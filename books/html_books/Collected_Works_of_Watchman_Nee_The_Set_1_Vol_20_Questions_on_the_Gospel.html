Our human heart is a heart of law, not a heart of grace. We always consider God's heart to be just like our heart and, therefore, misunderstand God's heart.</P><P>We must be clear about what grace means:</P><P>(1) Grace is not a matter of giving man what he deserves. Romans 4:4 says, "Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due." In other words, grace means receiving what one does not deserve. If grace involved receiving what one deserves, the very meaning of grace would be completely nullified. Grace is called grace simply because there is no element of merit in it. Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace you have been saved." The fact that you were saved even though you did not deserve it shows that it is grace. Romans 3:24 says, "Being justified freely by His grace." What does "freely" mean? Freely in the original text is the same word as "without a cause" in John 15:25, where the Lord said, "They hated Me without cause." Saying God's grace justifies a person freely simply means that God justifies a person without any cause. "The Scripture has shut up all under sin" (Gal. 3:22). "For God has shut up all in disobedience" (Rom. 11:32). God has put all men in the same position so that none can be saved by doing good. Each and every one must be saved by grace. If you asked Paul how he was saved, he would surely answer that he was saved by God's grace. If you asked all the saints how they were saved, they would surely answer that they were saved by God's grace. Grace is God saving people without a cause.</P><P>(2) Grace is not a matter of supplementing what man deserves. Ephesians 2:9 says, "Not of works that no one should boast." This does not mean that man should not have good works after he is saved. Rather, it means that man is not saved by works. If man were saved by good works, he would be able to boast. If thirty percent of man's salvation was by works, man could boast of that thirty percent, while God would lose thirty percent of the glory. If ten percent of man's salvation was by works, man could boast of that ten percent, while God would lose ten percent of the glory. It is not possible for God to share His glory with man. God hates man's self-boasting. God's intention is that He Himself would gain the glory. Therefore, God's grace does not supplement what man deserves.</P><P>Grace is neither giving man what he deserves, nor is it giving man more than what he deserves. Grace is neither a fair compensation nor an extra compensation. The questions of whether or not God should give and whether man is worthy cannot be placed side by side with grace. If man wants to receive grace, then the question of his worthiness cannot exist at all, neither can the question of being more or less worthy be established. In the matter of salvation, man cannot use any of his work to obtain God's grace.</P><P>Many have thought, "I will try my best to do good and keep the law; then I will rely on God's grace for the things that I cannot do." This means that they rely partially on work and partially on grace. A man once said, "We must keep the Ten Commandments; otherwise, we cannot be saved." Then someone asked him, "Have you violated any of the commandments?" He answered, "Yes, I have." He was then asked, "What do you do when you violate a commandment?" He responded, "I rely on God's grace for the things that I cannot do well." This kind of thought is a misconception of grace.</P><P>In Matthew 19 a young man asked the Lord Jesus, "What good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?" (v. 16). The Lord said, "But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments" (v. 17). The young man said he had kept them all. But when the Lord said, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor" (v. 21), the young man was not able. If man wants to be saved by keeping the law, he must keep it with "all." Not only does he have to love God with all his heart, all his will, and all his strength, but he also has to give all he has in his house, without holding back any item. But if man relies on God's grace, he has to rely on it completely. Man cannot work for one-half and leave it up to God to work for the other half. God's grace does not supplement man's inabilities. If it is by God's grace, it is all by God's grace; if it is by man's work, it is all by man's work. One cannot rely partially on his own work and partially on God's grace.</P><P>Why is this? It is because the Lord Jesus has already died. God puts all sinners in an equal position. When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, God "caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him" (Isa. 53:6). The problem of sin was solved once and for all. Therefore, man cannot rely on his own merit before God; it would overthrow the Lord's work, as though He had died in vain.</P><P>(3) Grace is not a withholding from him who does not deserve it. (This is similar to the first point except that the question is turned around.) Rather, grace is given because man does not deserve it. When man realizes that he is altogether helpless and has no way out, he will call out for grace. When God sees man as helpless and having no way out, He will dispense grace. If man is capable, he will not realize he needs grace, and God will not need to bestow grace. Man's "unworthiness" is not a hindrance to God bestowing grace. Rather, it is the one and only condition for God to bestow grace.</P><P>A brother once said, "Grace is boundless kindness expressed in boundless goodness." What is grace? Grace flows down from above. What is love? Love is treating one another equally. What is respect? Respect is honoring those who are above you. Grace flows down from above. Grace has only one direction; it flows downward. If you want to obtain God's grace, you must acknowledge that you are a helpless sinner. Being a helpless sinner qualifies you to obtain God's grace.</P><P>Many people dislike grace because grace is a truth that utterly humbles people. Grace requires you to acknowledge that you are an evil person. No cup turned upside-down can contain water. Likewise, no one who is proud is willing to receive salvation. You must admit that you are useless, before you can receive God's grace.</P><P>(4) Grace is not a matter of giving less because man does not deserve it. (This is in contrast to the second point.) God has not overlooked the problem of man's sin. In dealing with sin, God is very strict, definite, and thorough. Through His Son, He has thoroughly dealt with this problem. Therefore, how can any questions related to man's worthiness or the degree of his worthiness remain? God's grace is not concerned with man's unworthiness. Since all men are equal before God, all men can obtain God's grace.</P><P>God does not withhold His grace because of man's unworthiness; instead, He bestows grace because of his unworthiness. God does not differentiate among the unworthy, according to who is more unworthy and who is less unworthy. God does not enable the less unworthy to receive more grace and the more unworthy to receive less grace.</P><P>God cannot bestow less grace to those who have greater sins and more grace to those who have less sins. Grace is never used by God to patch up sinners' flaws. The condition of the sinner, his works, and his merits (both great and small) are completely put aside.</P><P>Since grace is grace, it is not related to the recipient's condition at all. The recipient does not need to have any qualification to receive grace, since grace is given to those who do not deserve it and is not related to the recipient's condition. Therefore, grace is not giving less to those who are less deserving. Otherwise, man's condition once again becomes the prerequisite of receiving grace. The bestowing of grace is neither according to a person's condition nor the result of comparing one person to another. God's grace is vast, expansive, and intended for all kinds of sinners. Those who think they are all right need God's grace as much as those who regard themselves as great sinners.</P><P>Some may think that a better person deserves more grace. But from God's viewpoint, everyone is the same. Suppose several plates fall to the ground. Some may break in half, some into five pieces, and others into fragments. Although they may break in different ways, they are all broken. Whether you are a "better" sinner or a "worse" sinner, you are still a sinner. The Bible says that all men are sinners. God sent the Lord Jesus to die for sinners, thereby affording every sinner an opportunity to be saved. If only one sinner in the world needed to be saved, God would have still sent His Son to die for him. In the parable of the shepherd seeking the lost sheep, the shepherd left the ninety-nine sheep to seek the one lost sheep (Luke 15:3-4). Whether you are a great sinner or a small sinner, as long as you are a lost sheep, you need the Lord Jesus to die for you.</P><P>(5) Grace does not make the recipient of grace a debtor. A debt means that you have been loaned a sum of money, which allows you to enjoy it for the present, but that you will later pay it back. Wages are given according to one's labor. Grace is neither the giving of wages according to one's labor, nor a temporary borrowing of something which one has to repay. God saves us by grace; therefore, our salvation is not loaned to us by God. If it were a loan, which we would have to pay back, it would not be grace. Grace does not mean that God sees a current lack of merit in our work for our salvation and then loans salvation to us so that we would eventually apply its merit to our works in order to maintain our salvation. Grace is free in the past, free in the present, and free in the future. If God gives us something and expects us to repay it in the future, it is a debt and not grace. God's grace is freely given to all who are unworthy. There is no price to it in the past and present, and there is no need to repay it in the future.</P><P>Men have a wrong concept: we think that salvation is by grace, but that maintaining our salvation depends upon our own selves. This is wrong. The Bible never says that God's grace makes us debtors. Romans 6:23 says, "But the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." What is the characteristic of eternal life? It is a gift. Gift can also be translated "present." In other words, a gift is given by God. Does a gift need to be returned? We must be clear that grace is not a loan. It does not need to be paid back now; it does not need to be paid back no matter how many days go by. This does not mean that Christians do not need to have good works or to serve God faithfully. After we are saved, we should have good works and serve God faithfully. But the motive behind these should be the Lord's love; the energy for these should be the Holy Spirit. Having good works and serving the Lord faithfully are neither for obtaining salvation nor for maintaining salvation. The works of Christians are not for the purpose of repaying a debt of the salvation. Just as God saved us out of His love for us, we should serve God out of our love for Him. Just as His salvation is not a loan to us, our faithful service to God is not a repayment of a debt.</P><P>Many do not understand God's grace. They think that grace means that God is willing to save a person, in spite of his unworthiness, but that God will withdraw his salvation, after he is saved, if he does not do good. This is like buying goods by installment. The goods can be delivered, but the loan has to be paid back by making regular payments. If you cannot make the payments on time, the lender will repossess the goods. This clearly twists the meaning of God's grace. The eternal life that God gave when you were saved does not require any installment payments. God will not take back the eternal life even if you do not have good works after experiencing salvation.</P><P>Moreover, since eternal life is a gift, there is no such thing as paying it back. The phrase paying back is wrong. We serve God out of love. If your father gives you a present and, day after day and month after month, you repay him until you reach the same amount as the gift he gave, is this not the same as buying the present yourself? Grace never has a price; otherwise, it is not grace.</P><P>(6) Grace does not directly forgive man's sins. This question has been misunderstood by many believers. They consider that God forgives sinners' sins because He is generous. This concept is wrong. The Bible does not say that God forgives sinners because He is tolerant, plays deaf, or is careless. Romans 5:21 says, "In order that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Sin reigns by itself, but grace reigns through righteousness. Grace does not reign by itself. We must know that God has not only grace but also righteousness. God delights not only in saving man but also in safeguarding man's salvation with righteousness. For God to give us grace does not mean that God is generous to forgive our sins in a loose way. Rather, God devised and worked out a solution to the problem of our sins, affording us the opportunity to be saved. If we misunderstand God's grace and consider it merely as God's generosity, the cross of Christ would be unnecessary and totally meaningless. Certainly without the love of God, there is no cross of Christ. But if there is only God's love without God's righteousness, there would still be no cross of Christ. God knows that we have sinned, and He cannot overlook our sin. Since we have no way to settle this sin, He caused His Son to bear our sins on the cross and solved the problem of sin once for all. This is God's grace. God's grace solves the problem of sin and then forgives our sin. This is why the Lord had to die before we could even possibly be saved.</P><P>A sinner is reckoned as a sinner because: (1) his conduct is bad; (2) his nature is corrupted; and (3) God's righteous law has judged him. In saving a sinner God must: (1) forgive his sins, that is, his bad conduct; (2) regenerate him by giving him a new life; and (3) justify him. The Lord Jesus has received the punishment of sins and died for us. God will forgive us. Some think that we have to beg God until He changes His mind. This is wrong. We can obtain forgiveness because God has poured out His wrath and laid our sins upon the Lord Jesus. Therefore, we can say, "Thank and praise God that the Lord Jesus has been judged." Righteousness requires a punishment only once; there will be no more punishment.</P><P>(7) Grace does not directly forgive a believer's sins. This principle is the same as the one above. Suppose a Christian, after being saved, is incidentally overcome by transgressions and repents. He does not need to beg God in order for God to forgive him. He does not have to ask God to do something today, but believe in what Christ has already done. God is righteous. Since the Lord Jesus has died, God will forgive those who have received salvation. If a Christian, unfortunately, commits sins, he must be clear about four things: (1) by confessing his sins, he will obtain forgiveness (1 John 1:9); (2) any kind of sin can be forgiven (vv. 7, 9; "cleanses us from every sin" and "cleanse us from all unrighteousness" means all); (3) before he confesses his sins, God is willing to forgive him because the Lord Jesus is his Advocate before God (2:1-2); and (4) God forgives and cleanses him because, on the one hand, God is faithful and righteous and, on the other hand, the Lord Jesus is the Righteous One.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING TRANSGRESSION<br>AND INIQUITY</H1><P>According to the Bible, what is the difference between "transgression" and "iniquity"?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>"Transgression" and "iniquity" are Old Testament terms. They present two aspects of sin in the Old Testament. Transgression is subjective; iniquity is objective. Transgression refers to our behavior; iniquity refers to our condition before God. If we transgress in this world, we have committed iniquity before God. Psalm 32:5 says, "I will confess my transgressions unto Jehovah; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin" (ASV, 1901). Jeremiah 33:8 says, "And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, by which they have sinned against Me, and forgive all their iniquities, by which they have sinned against Me and by which they have transgressed against Me." From these verses we can see that iniquity is the condition of man before God after committing transgression and sin. Whenever man commits a sin, offends God, and disobeys God, he has iniquity before God. Exodus and Leviticus frequently mention the things the priests had to do in the Holy Place in order to bear man's sin. The word used for sin in these cases is avon, which means "iniquity," not pesha, which means "transgression" (Exo. 28:38, 43; Lev. 5:1, 17). Iniquity is a matter before God, which must be borne and redeemed in the Holy Place. Consequently, when Daniel 9:24 speaks of transgression and sins, it says, "To close the transgression, and to make an end of sins." But when it speaks of iniquity, it says, "To make propitiation for iniquity" because this is something before God. We also see that the city of Sodom was destroyed because its iniquity was "full" before God (Gen. 19:15; 15:16).</P><P>Whenever the Old Testament talks about transgressions, it is always related to behavior and action. For example, Job 36:9 says, "Then he showeth them their work, and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly" (ASV, 1901). Proverbs 12:13 says, "The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips." Proverbs 28:24 says, "Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression, the same is the companion of a destroyer" (ASV, 1901). Micah 1:5 says, "All this is because of the transgression of Jacob/And because of the sins of the house of Israel./What is the transgression of Jacob?/Is it not Samaria?/And what are the high places of Judah?/Are they not Jerusalem?" Pride, stealing from parents, and worshipping idols are all transgressions.</P><P>Ezekiel 18:30-31 says, "Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord Jehovah. Return ye, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your transgressions, wherein ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?" (ASV, 1901). Amos 1:3 says, "Thus says Jehovah,/Because of three transgressions of Damascus,/Indeed, because of four, I will not turn away the punishment;/Because they have threshed Gilead/With sharp threshing tools of iron." From this we see that transgression is serious because it can produce iniquity. But thank God, the problem of our transgressions and iniquity has been solved through the redemptive work of Christ. "But He was pierced because of our transgressions;/He was crushed because of our iniquities" (Isa. 53:5).</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING ROMANS 4:7-8</H1><P>Is there any difference between "blessed" in Romans 4:7 and "blessed" in verse 8? If so, what is the difference?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>There is a difference, and this difference is related to the forgiveness of sins and justification. The word blessed in verse 7 refers to a negative aspect; whereas the word blessed in verse 8 is speaking of a positive aspect. Verse 7 says that God forgives man's iniquities and covers his sins, while verse 8 says that God works to such an extent that a man can be regarded as though he had never sinned: "by no means account sin." This is to be justified.</P><P>What then is the difference between forgiveness and justification? Forgiveness means that even though you have sinned, God has forgiven your sins. Justification means that you are regarded as a righteous person that has never committed a sin. Suppose a man is judged by the court and found guilty; therefore, he should receive a punishment. Later, he may be granted amnesty and released by the court. This is receiving forgiveness. But being justified is like going through the court and being declared not guilty. This is being justified.</P><P>The Lord saved us not only to forgive us but also to justify us. This is grace! The shedding of the blood of the Lord Jesus has completely solved our problem of sin. Since we were resurrected together with Him and in Him, God sees us as if we had never sinned. God, in Christ, has worked to such an extent that we are as complete as Christ. Colossians 2:10 says, "And you have been made full in Him." God sees us the same way He sees Christ, and He loves us the same way He loves Christ. God sees us as being complete in Christ.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING ROMANS 4:7<br>AND HEBREWS 9:26</H1><P>Are our sins "covered over" (Rom. 4:7) or "put away" (Heb. 9:26)? What is the distinction between these two?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Our sins are "put away," not "covered." Hebrews 9:26 says clearly that the Lord was manifested once at the consummation of the ages to offer Himself as a sacrifice to put away sin.</P><P>How then can the phrase "covered over" in Romans 4:7 be explained? We must realize that the words of this verse are quoted from Psalm 32:1. In the entire New Testament, except for this verse, we cannot find another verse that says our sins are covered over before God. "Covered over" signifies that the sins of the people of the Old Testament time were covered over. In the Old Testament, every sin was only covered over and not put away until the death of the Lord Jesus. For "He is the Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant.." (Heb. 9:15).</P><P>Let us first remember that "redemption" or "atonement" in the Old Testament means "to cover up" in the original language. In the New Testament there is no other place, except in Romans 4:7, where the phrase "covered over" is quoted. Second, in the Bible, the word propitiation, except in a few cases where it is translated in conjunction with cover, refers to a "sin offering," that is, a sacrifice offered for sins. Jesus Christ is the sin offering. He offered Himself for our sins; He did not cover our sins.</P><P>The Lord Jesus came to put away our sins, not to cover them. "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29).</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING THE PURIFICATION OF SINS</H1><P>Is the purification of our sins carried out only once or many times?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>The purification of sins is made only once.</P><P>Hebrews 1:3 says, "Having made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high." We can see that His work of purifying of sins has been accomplished. Hebrews 7:27 says, "For this He did once for all when He offered up Himself." Hebrews 9:12 says, "But through His own blood, entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, obtaining an eternal redemption." Hebrews 9:25 through 26 says, "Nor in order that He might offer Himself often...But now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself." Hebrews 10:10 through 12 says, "By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all...But this One, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down forever on the right hand of God." From this we can see that the purifying of sins is only once.</P><P>The blood of Christ is precious because of its efficacy; once is sufficient to purify sins. It was not so with the blood of bulls and of goats. Hebrews 10:1 through 4 says, "For the law...can never by the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, perfect those who draw near. Otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, because those worshipping, having once been purified, would have no longer had the consciousness of sins? But in those sacrifices there is a bringing to mind of sins year by year; for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins." This portion tells us clearly that the blood of bulls and goats was only an annual reminder of man's sins; therefore, it had to be offered frequently. The blood of bulls and goats can never take away the sins of man. The work of the cross has accomplished this once for all, and nothing more can be added.</P><P>How then should we explain 1 John 1:7, which says, "But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin"? The cleansing here is a lasting and continual action. There is a difference between continuance and repetition. Repetition is to do something over again. Continuance is to be nonstop in an action. The meaning of continual cleansing is that the blood has lasting effectiveness before God. The blood of the Lord is continuously effective; it is not a matter of having to wash over and over again. The precious blood causes us to have great liberty before God. If we do not realize the great effectiveness of the blood of the Lord Jesus before God, we will consider the blood of the Lord and the blood of bulls and goats to be the same. Even after a believer has committed sins, the blood does not cleanse him again; rather, when he confesses his sins, he believes that the blood has cleansed him, and then has peace.</P><P>Suppose a sinner wants to be saved. Is he saved by believing that Christ has died for him or is he saved by Christ coming to die for him again? A sinner is saved when he believes that Christ has died for him. When a believer commits sins, does he obtain peace through believing that the blood of Christ has cleansed his sins or by Christ coming again to shed His blood and cleanse his sins? Surely, peace is obtained through believing that the blood of Christ has cleansed him.</P><P>Let us look at the typology of the ashes of the red heifer in Numbers 19. The red heifer for the offering had to have three kinds of qualifications: (1) it had to be without spot and blemish-this typifies the sinlessness of the Lord; (2) it had to be one which had never borne a yoke-this typifies the Lord, who was never a slave of Satan; and (3) it had to be pure red-this typifies that the Lord bears our sins. Red typifies sins because it says in Isaiah 1:18, "Though your sins are like scarlet...though they are as red as crimson." The red refers to the skin and hair being pure red, not to the heifer being red within. The Lord Jesus is sinless within, while bearing the sins of man without. The red heifer was burned outside the camp (Num. 19:3); even so, our Lord Jesus also suffered death without the camp (Heb. 13:12). The red heifer was for the atonement of sins (Num. 19:4), because all the offerings for the atonement of sins had to have their blood sprinkled before the tabernacle of the congregation. If their blood was for purification, it had to be sprinkled upon the man. The manner of burning the red heifer was different from that of other sacrifices. "And the heifer shall be burned in his sight; her skin, her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall be burned; and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet, and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer" (Num. 19:5-6). The cedar wood and the hyssop signify the creation, which includes the entire world (1 Kings 4:33, "from the cedar tree...even unto the hyssop"). Also, the scarlet wool signifies sins. This helps us to realize that at the time of the Lord Jesus' death, all the sins of the whole world, beginning from Adam, were included. When the Lord bore our sins on the cross, the work was absolute and unlimited, and nothing else can be added to it.</P><P>Even though the red heifer died, the ashes still remained. The ashes proved that a red heifer had been slain. What was the use of these ashes? "For the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the sin offering that was burned, and running water shall be put upon it in a vessel...and the clean one shall sprinkle upon the unclean...thus, on the seventh day he shall purify him" (Num. 19:17-19). The ashes had the function of taking away sins continually. This indicates that when we trusted in the one-time substitutionary death of the Lord, our sins were forgiven; likewise, we can continually deal with all our sins and obtain forgiveness by the fact of the Lord's death. The cleansing in 1 John 1:7-2:1 corresponds with the function of the ashes of the red heifer.</P><P>We should know that if we, unfortunately, commit sin, it is not necessary for another red heifer to be slain; the ashes of the red heifer which has died are still effective before God. Thank God that when Christ bore all our sins on the cross, He not only paid our past debts, but He also left enough funds to pay our future debts. This is God's work. And this is the gospel!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING LEVITICUS 4:1-7</H1><P>In Leviticus 4:1-7, why was the blood of the sin offering brought to the tabernacle of the congregation and sprinkled seven times before the veil of the sanctuary before God; according to the law of the cleansing of the lepers in Leviticus 14:1-7, the blood was sprinkled upon the lepers seven times?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>First, let us pay attention to one thing. According to the entire Bible, who is the One that requires the blood? It is God. Why does God require the blood? When the people of Israel sinned, why did God not forgive them through His mercy? If God had done this, He would have been unrighteous. Could the publican simply ask God to grant mercy and pity him? No. What he actually said to God was, "God, be propitiated to me, the sinner" (Luke 18:13). Sin must be judged and punished. Only when you come before God with the blood can He forgive you, for without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins (Heb. 9:22). This is God's righteousness.</P><P>Some pray, "O God, if You want to forgive, please forgive; if it is Your will to forgive, please forgive." But forgiveness is not a question of whether or not God wants to forgive; neither is it a question of God's will. Although God is merciful and willing to be gracious, and although it is His will to willingly forgive us, He cannot forgive without the blood. God can only forgive when there is the blood because He is a righteous God.</P><P>Bringing the blood before God and sprinkling it seven times satisfies the righteous requirement of God. Then God can forgive the sins of man. When there is a sin, there must be the blood; this is the righteous requirement of God. Suppose someone committed a murder, went to the chief justice of the court, and pleaded for mercy. The chief justice could pity him and forgive him. Later, a second and third person could commit the same crime and also plead for mercy. If they were also forgiven, there would be chaos because murderers could be freed simply by pleading for mercy. Everyone would be able to kill. If there were no punishment for the sins, this would be unrighteous.</P><P>The requirement of the law of God is that whoever has sinned must die-blood must be shed. The Lord Jesus has shed His precious blood; this has satisfied the requirement of God's law. Therefore, we are saved not only because God has grace but even more because God has righteousness. The blood of the sin offering must be brought before God. Without the blood, God could not forgive even if He wanted to forgive. God cannot forgive a "bloodless" sinner because of His righteousness.</P><P>In order to understand the meaning of the sprinkling of the blood upon the leper seven times, we need to notice that Leviticus 14:1 through 7 does not say that the leper was healed after the blood was sprinkled. Rather, it says that after the leper was healed, the blood was sprinkled. What does this mean? Although the leper was healed, he was only cleansed before men; in order for him to be reckoned as cleansed before God, there had to be the blood. God's requirement is the blood. After a leper is healed, he is acceptable before men; but without the blood, he is still unclean before God.</P><P>In Matthew 8:1-4, when the Lord Jesus healed the leper, He also commanded him to offer the gift that Moses charged. (At that time, the Lord was not yet crucified on the cross, so He told him to do according to the Old Testament ordinance.) Although the Lord helped him to be cleansed before men, he was not yet cleansed before God. Therefore, he needed the blood. This shows that no matter how excellently one behaves or how moral one is, if he does not have the blood, he is still unclean before God.</P><P>The blood satisfies God's requirement. The blood is shed not only to cleanse our conscience but even more to fulfill the requirement of God's law. Since we are sinners, we cannot be saved without the blood. We are not saved because we are worthy but because the Lord has shed His blood. We are accepted by God because of the blood. We dare to draw near to God because of the effectiveness of the blood which the Lord Jesus shed, not because of ourselves. Only the blood satisfies God and causes Him to reckon us as cleansed.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING SIN AND SINS</H1><P>How are the words sin and sins used differently in the Bible?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>The difference between sin and sins is the distinction between sin in the singular and sin in the plural. In the Old Testament there is no distinction between sin in the singular and sin in the plural. However, in the New Testament there is a difference, and this difference is very significant.</P><P>Let us list all the occurrences of the word sin (noun), in both its singular and plural forms, that are found in the New Testament. In the original language, sin is armatia.</P><P>Sin in singular form: Matt. 12:31; John 1:29; 8:34 (twice), 46; 9:41 (twice); 15:22 (twice), 24; 16:8, 9; 19:11; Acts 7:60; Rom. 3:9, 20; 4:8; 5:12 (twice), 13 (twice), 20, 21; 6:1, 2, 6 (twice), 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23; 7:7 (twice), 8 (twice), 9, 11, 13 (three times), 14, 17, 20, 23, 25; 8:2, 3 (three times), 10; 14:23; 1 Cor. 15:56 (twice); 2 Cor. 5:21 (twice); 11:7; Gal. 2:17; 3:22; 2 Thes. 2:3 (KJV); Heb. 3:13; 4:15; 9:26, 28; 10:6, 8, 18; 11:25; 12:1, 4; 13:11; James 1:15 (twice); 2:9; 4:17; 1 Pet. 2:22; 4:1; 2 Pet. 2:14; 1 John 1:7, 8; 3:4 (twice), 5, 8, 9; 5:16 (twice), 17 (twice).</P><P>Sins in plural form: Matt. 1:21; 3:6; 9:2, 5, 6; 26:28; Mark 1:4, 5; 2:5, 7, 9, 10; Luke 1:77; 3:3; 5:20, 21, 23, 24; 7:47, 48, 49; 11:4; 24:47; John 8:21 (KJV), 24 (twice); 9:34; 20:23; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31; 10:43; 13:38; 22:16; 26:18; Rom. 4:7; 7:5; 11:27; 1 Cor. 15:3, 17; Gal. 1:4; Eph. 2:1; Col. 1:14; 2:11 (KJV); 1 Thes. 2:16; 1 Tim. 5:22, 24; 2 Tim. 3:6; Heb. 1:3; 2:17; 5:1, 3; 7:27; 8:12; 9:28; 10:2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 17, 26; James 5:15, 20; 1 Pet. 2:24 (twice); 3:18; 4:8; 2 Pet. 1:9; 1 John 1:9 (twice); 2:2, 12; 3:5; 4:10; Rev. 1:5; 18:4, 5.</P><P>After reading the many Scripture verses above, we will see how wise God was in the writing of the Bible, and we will truly say to Him, "O God! We worship You!"</P><P>The difference between the uses of sin and sins is this: Whenever the Bible refers to man's outward sinful behavior, such as pride, envy, lying, and so forth, it uses the plural form-sins. The singular form, sin, in the Bible never refers to the outward sin, but it does have two different kinds of usage.</P><P>First, it refers to sin as a master and power which controls or dominates. This is the sin which is ordinarily referred to as the source or the root of sin. The phrases the source of sin or the root of sin are not scriptural, but we will borrow them for the moment. The Bible does not mention either but rather, speaks of sin reigning and lording like a master. Singular sin refers to the sin that dominates, drives, and causes us to commit sin.</P><P>Second, it refers to the whole problem of sin. Whenever the Bible speaks of God forgiving sin, it always uses the plural form, sins, because we need to be forgiven of the sins in our outward behavior. The sinful nature within us cannot be resolved by forgiveness. Saying that God forgives the singular sin is incorrect, for God forgives only the plural sins. Since the singular sin is the master, the power, it is not something that we are directly responsible for; therefore, it cannot be solved by forgiveness. The plural sins need forgiveness because these refer to our conduct, for which we need to bear responsibility and for which we deserve a punishment. Therefore, forgiveness is needed. All "confession of sin" in the Bible should be "confession of sins," the plural number and not the singular number. Sin in its singular form does not refer to man's behavior and, therefore, does not require confession. The plural sins however signify man's conduct and require confession. The death of Christ is to save us from sins. "You shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins" (Matt. 1:21). This means that the Lord Jesus saves us from the sins of our behavior. He saves us from numerous sins.</P><P>When the Lord Jesus said to the Jews, "You will die in your sins" (John 8:24), He was saying that they would die in their sins (plural) and not in sin (singular). The Bible does not say that Christ died for our sin (singular), but it always says that Christ died for our sins (plural).</P><P>"And you, though dead in your offenses and sins" (Eph. 2:1). This refers to sins (plural) not sin (singular). This means that we lived in the sins (plural), such as pride, uncleanness, envy, etc. We were dead in sins (plural) not in sin (singular).</P><P>To "take away sins" in Hebrews 10:4 refers to the taking away of sins (plural). In Hebrews 10:2, "Would have no longer had the consciousness of sins" is also sins (plural).</P><P>Why do we no longer have consciousness of sins after the Lord's blood has cleansed our conscience? Our conscience accuses us of sins (plural), specific sins, such as temper, pride, etc., before God. Since the blood of the Lord Jesus has obtained for us the forgiveness of these sins, our conscience is no longer conscious of sins. The plural sins do exist, but the blood has dealt with them. If the Lord's blood cleansed sin (singular), then sin would no longer be in our experience. For if the blood washed sin (singular), it would mean that we would never again feel the power of sin, which is the power that drives us to commit sins. This is certainly not so. The blood of the Lord Jesus has cleansed us so that our conscience is no longer conscious of our past sins. This does not mean that we no longer have sin but that our conscience is no longer conscious of sins. We are not condemned by our conscience, because we are cleansed by the blood.</P><P>How then are we to be freed from the dominating sin (the singular sin)? "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves" (Rom. 6:6). Three things are mentioned here: (1) the body of sin; (2) the old man; and (3) sin. The body acts as the puppet. Sin causes the body to sin through the old man. When sin works in the body, the body is called the body of sin. The old man on the one hand accepts the motivation of sin and, on the other hand, instigates the body to sin. The old man stands between sin and the body. The old man is our personality. Sin tempts, and the old man agrees and directs the body to sin. Some say that the death of the Lord Jesus has eradicated the root of sin. This is wrong. The Lord Jesus accomplished the removal of the old man. Sin is still here and so is the body of sin, but the old man, which is in between, has been removed. Man as a person still remains; however, sin is now unable to manipulate the new man. Sin can never direct the new man. Sin (singular) still exists, but we are no longer its slaves. We are no longer slaves to sin, because the old man that directly instigated the body to commit sins has been crucified. What about the body? Originally it practiced sins; now it is unemployed.</P><P>Hebrews 1:3 says, "Who...having made purification of sins." The sins mentioned here is plural, referring to the removal of punishment for sins and not to the purging of the root of sin (singular).</P><P>How then do we explain "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29)? Since sin of the world is singular, does this indicate that the root of sin is eradicated? If so, then not only would the root of sin in the believers be eradicated, but even the root of sin in the whole world would be eradicated. This is not true. The meaning here is that the Lamb of God has solved the problem of sin for the whole world; it does not mean that He has eradicated the root of sin in the whole world. This agrees with the verse, "Therefore just as through one man sin entered into the world" (Rom. 5:12). Just as sin entered into the world by one man, it is taken away by another man. The Lord has dealt with the sin of the world and solved this problem.</P><P>How do we deal with sin (singular)? "So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin" (Rom. 6:11). Sins (plural) are dealt with by the death of Christ, while sin (singular) is solved by dying together with Christ. This death is a reckoning of oneself as dead. If we reckon ourselves to be dead to sin, even though sin still has dominating power, it cannot overcome us.</P><P>"But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin" (1 John 1:7). Again, sin here is in the singular form. This does not mean that the blood of the Lord Jesus cleanses the root of sin. The preceding part shows that if we walk in the light as God is in the light, we will have fellowship one with another. After this it says that the blood of His Son also cleanses us from every sin. If this cleansing referred to our sinful nature, and we walked in the light as God is in the light, we would have no sin. How then would there be sins for the blood of the Lord Jesus to cleanse? It is when we walk in the light of the gospel, as God is in the light of revelation, that we see the blood of the Lord Jesus solving all the problems related to our sin. In verse 9 it clearly says that we have sins (plural). Again, we have sins! Therefore, we can see that sin (singular) refers to the sin that dominates within us as master, while sins (plural) refer to our outward conduct. Sin (singular) refers to the whole problem of sin, while sins (plural) refer to specific sins.</P><P>"Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf" (2 Cor. 5:21). The word sin here is singular. The Lord Jesus was made sin not sins for us. Why is the singular word sin used here? It is because the Lord Jesus, who knew no sin (singular), that is, who never knew what sin was and never served sin or knew the power of sin, was made to become sin, the very problem of sin, so that God could deal with sin by judging Him. His becoming sin means that God dealt with Him as God would deal with our problem of sin. If the Lord Jesus had become sins, then He too would have had sins in His conduct and would have been a sinner. He too would have had pride, jealousy, uncleanness, and such sins. Thank God, He did not cause the Lord Jesus to become sins. He dealt with the Lord Jesus as the very problem of sin, so that when the Lord Jesus died, the problem of the sin of the whole world was completely solved.</P><P>Finally, let us conclude the discussion of this question from the book of Romans. The first eight chapters of Romans specifically address the problem of sins and sin. Romans 1-5:11 is the first section, and it deals with the problem of sins (plural), not sin (singular). Romans 5:12-8:12 forms the second section, which speaks of the problem of sin (singular). In the second section, except for the one instance in chapter seven where sins (plural) is mentioned, all the references are to sin (singular). The first section deals with specific sins in outward conduct. The sinful records and their penalties need to be taken away and eliminated. Therefore, the Lord Jesus came to bear our sins and take them away. The second section says that God not only forgives us of our sins (plural), but He also frees us from the sin that dominates us. God not only forgives our sins and does not punish us anymore; He also saves us from sin and from committing sins. The first section speaks of the precious blood, while the entire second section speaks of the cross. The resurrection in the first section is the Lord's resurrection for us, while the resurrection in the second section is our resurrection together with the Lord. The first section speaks of the Lord Jesus being crucified and shedding His blood for us; the second section speaks of our being crucified together with Him. The first section deals with forgiveness, while the second deals with deliverance. The first section deals with justification, while the second deals with sanctification. The first section solves the punishment of sin, while the second solves the power of sin. We all need to pass through these two sections.</P><P>When you first believed in the Lord, you were worried about the many sins you committed. All the individual sins were placed before you. You saw that there was nothing good without and within you. You wondered how the righteous God, the righteous Lord, could forgive your sins. But when you realized that the Lord Jesus had borne your sins, that His blood had cleansed you of your sins, and that they had all been forgiven, you rejoiced. Because your sins had been forgiven, you were able to stand in God's grace, rejoicing in the hope of the glory of God. Now you believe that you can do good. But day after day you discover that you can still lie as you lied in the past. What should you do? You should come before the Lord to ask for forgiveness. The Lord still forgives, and the Lord's blood is still efficacious. Then you may resolve and be determined to never sin again. The first few days you may do all right, but later as you become loose, you will sin again. Again you ask the Lord to forgive your sins, and again you resolve not to sin. But again and again you sin, and again you stumble. In the past you felt the evil of outward sins. After becoming a Christian, not only do you feel the evil of outward sins, but you also feel inward sin lording it over you. For example, consider a person who loves to gamble. In the past, he acknowledged that this was unacceptable conduct. But since he has believed in the Lord, he feels that there is a master in him with the power to force him to do the things which he does not want to do, leaving him no choice but to do them. Every one of us has our own particular sin that entangles us. You may recall how happy you were when you were saved. But now you suffer more than before you were saved. How can you overcome these sins? You inquire of God whether there is a deeper salvation. What Romans 5:12-8 describes is the deeper salvation. If the blood were all that God required, God could have used a different way to cause the Lord Jesus to shed His blood. Why was it necessary for Christ to die on the cross? It is because God wanted to show us not only that the punishment for our conduct was forgiven through the Savior Jesus, but also that our very person was crucified together with the Lord. The Lord Jesus Christ was crucified for our sins and, at the same time, He brought us along in His crucifixion so that we were crucified with Him. Not only were the sins of the sinner on the cross, but the sinner himself was on the cross. Not only were our sins on the cross, but all of us who are in Christ were on the cross as well. Not only did the shedding of the blood of the Lord Jesus cleanse us of our sins, but God also reckoned His death to be our death more than nineteen hundred years ago. At the beginning, we believed that the Lord Jesus died for us. Today we reckon the Lord's death as our death. Since the Lord has died, we too have died. As we believed in His death, we also should believe that His death is our death. In this way, although sin is still alive, it cannot seduce one who is already dead, for a dead person is freed from sin. Once a man has died, sin cannot interfere with him any longer, because even though sin is alive, the person is dead. God forgives our outward sins, but He will not forgive our inward sin. He has crucified our old man, so that the sin in us has no more power to drag us down. We believe that we are already dead. We do not have to go and die; rather, we believe that we have already died. We do not believe that we should die, but that we are already dead. When we feel weak and unclean, we must realize that God has already dealt with these things on the cross. If we look at Christ with the eyes of faith and believe that we have been crucified with Christ, we will see that the power of Christ will save us and free us from the power of sin within us. The first step of salvation gives us peace and satisfaction; it causes us to enjoy happiness. The second step of salvation gives us power to be freed from sin and walk in His way. Today, we may feel the power of sin oppressing us within. How good it would be if we could overcome the power of sin within. Overcoming the power of sin within is by deliverance and emancipation and not by forgiveness. Since the master within has been replaced, the old master can no longer control us. We must all go this way.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING GRACE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</H1><P>Are we saved by God's grace or by God's righteousness? What part of salvation is accomplished by God's grace, and what part is by God's righteousness?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace you have been saved." This indicates that we are saved by God's grace.</P><P>Romans 3:25 and 26 say, "Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness..with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus." This shows us that salvation is also by God's righteousness.</P><P>God's grace provides a Savior for us, so that we have the possibility of being saved (John 3:16), while God's righteousness causes salvation to be accomplished upon us, so that God must save us. The part from the Lord's birth through His death and resurrection to His ascension, has been accomplished for us by God's grace, while the part since the Lord's ascension until now is accomplished for us by His righteousness.</P><P>Grace can be given or withheld according to God's pleasure, but righteousness allows no choice. Since Christ has died and been raised, God must save you if you believe. If you believe and God does not save you, then He is not righteous. What does 1 John 1:9 say? Does it say, "If we confess our sins, He is merciful and loving to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness"? No. It says, "He is faithful and righteous." The blood of His Son has cleansed us from all sins. When we believe, God must save us. God cannot be unfaithful, because His word has already been spoken. He cannot be unrighteous because the blood of His Son has been shed. Therefore, we thank and praise God, for He must save us!</P><P>All unrighteousness is sin. God cannot be unrighteous, therefore He must save us. Saying that God may not forgive us is like saying that He is unfaithful and unrighteous. We must lay hold of God's righteousness. He delights in our laying hold of His righteousness. For us to lay hold of God's righteousness is to honor Him.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING THE RIGHTEOUSNESS<br>OF GOD AND CHRIST</H1><P>Are we saved by the righteousness of God (Rom. 3:21-26) or by the righteousness of Christ? What is the meaning of each, and what is the difference between them?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>It is the righteousness of God which saves us.</P><P>What is the righteousness of God? Romans 3:25 and 26 say, "Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus." The propitiation place is on the ark. It is here that God meets with men. God has set forth Jesus to be the propitiation place; therefore, He can contact man only through Christ. If there were no propitiation place on the ark, the law in the ark would condemn man's sin. But with the blood on the propitiation place, the law cannot condemn man's sin, because the requirements of the law have been fulfilled. In this, God's righteousness is demonstrated, which means that God is righteous.</P><P>According to the law, whoever sins must die. But since the Lord Jesus died for you, you do not need to die. Therefore, forgiveness is granted by God according to His righteousness. Suppose someone owes you one hundred dollars and gives you a promissory note. When he returns the one hundred dollars, you should return the promissory note to him in order to cancel the debt. If you did not return the note and continued to demand payment from him, you would be an unrighteous person. You have sinned, and you deserve to die. But you applied the blood of Christ to repay your debt of sin. So now God can ask nothing further from you. You are now forgiven because of God's righteousness. Regardless of the circumstances, God must forgive you because the Lord Jesus has died for you.</P><P>First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." "Faithful" refers to God's word. Whatever God says will stand. "Righteous" refers to the fact that the work done by Christ is accomplished. Since Christ has satisfied God's requirement for us, God can no longer require anything from us. God's Word says that he who believes will be forgiven. When we believe, God must forgive us. Since Christ has died, God's requirements have been met, and God must forgive us. Both God's forbearance of the sins committed by men in the past and His justification of those who believe at present manifest that He is righteous.</P><P>God not only justifies us, He also wants us to regard Him as righteous. In other words, He wants us to realize that He is very righteous in the way He treats us. Jesus is a man just as we also are men. As sin entered into the world by one man, it is also taken away by one man. The sin of Adam was not just one individual's problem; it became the problem of all mankind. Adam is the head, and we are all a part of him. The same is true with being in Christ; when Christ died, we also died, and when Christ resurrected, life flowed into us. We do not need to pitifully beg God to forgive us. Since Christ has died for us, God must forgive us. When we believe, we are saved.</P><P>In the entire New Testament, we cannot find one verse which says that Christ's righteousness saves us.</P><P>Christ's righteousness only gives Him the proper qualification to be the Savior. His righteousness refers to His own good conduct. He saves us by His death, not by His righteousness. His death fulfills the righteousness of God. His righteousness is like the veil in the tabernacle made of four different colors. He alone can come and appear before God; all others are kept outside the veil. Only when the veil was rent (when Christ died) was a new and living way opened, and only then could we draw near to God (Heb. 10:20).</P><P>How then do we explain 1 Corinthians 1:30: "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption"; and 1 Peter 3:18: "the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous"? We need to ask whether these two verses both refer to Christ's righteousness. No, they do not. First Corinthians 1 says that Christ Himself became our righteousness. First Peter 3 says that the Lord Jesus Himself is righteous; He is qualified to be a substitute for us who are unrighteous.</P><P>Regarding 2 Peter 1:1, "Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have been allotted faith equally precious as ours in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ." "Righteousness" here can also be translated as "fairness" or "justice." This means that He is not a respecter of persons. He has given the same precious faith to all, to those believers who have come first or come last, and to both the Jews and the Gentiles (cf. Acts 10:34, 44; 15:8-9).</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING CHRIST<br>AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</H1><P>What is the difference between the righteousness of Christ and Christ as righteousness?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Christ as righteousness is found in 1 Corinthians 1:30. "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption." This verse tells us that God has made Christ our righteousness.</P><P>The righteousness of Christ is the good conduct performed by Christ when He lived on the earth as a man. It is the personal virtue of Christ while He lived on earth. Christ becoming righteousness means that God gives Christ to us, making Him our righteousness. The righteousness of Christ refers to the goodness of Christ, whereas Christ becoming righteousness refers to Christ Himself.</P><P>Of the five offerings, the righteousness of Christ is equivalent to the meal offering. The meal offering contains no blood because it signifies the living, good conduct, and virtue of the life of the Lord Jesus. Of the five offerings, Christ as righteousness is equivalent to the burnt offering. Before God, this offering is a sweet savor; it typifies Christ being acceptable to God. With Christ as our righteousness, we offer Him up as we come before God. In this way, God accepts us as He accepts Christ, and God considers us perfect even as Christ is perfect. The sin offering is offered as the propitiation for the sin of our entire life, and the trespass offering is offered for our daily sins. These two offerings deal with sin. The burnt offering causes God to consider us as good as Christ. The Old Testament uses the phrase "Jehovah our righteousness" (Jer. 33:16). This means that God Himself is our righteousness. With Christ as our righteousness, we can answer all of God's demands.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING JESUS' PERSECUTION</H1><P>What aspect of God is revealed by the persecution of the Lord Jesus? What aspect of God is revealed by the putting to death of the Lord Jesus?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>The Lord Jesus' persecution expresses the love of God, and His being put to death expresses the righteousness of God.</P><P>If the earthly life of the Lord Jesus had expressed only righteousness, there would not have been so much opposition. But since He received the tax collectors and sinners, the Lord Jesus expressed love also, not just righteousness. This is why the Pharisees criticized Him (Matt. 9:11). When the Lord Jesus healed the sick on the Sabbath, the Pharisees took counsel to destroy Him (Matt. 12:10-14). The Lord Jesus answered the disciples of John the Baptist, saying, "Go, report to John the things that you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; and the dead are raised and the poor have the gospel announced to them; and blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me" (Matt. 11:4-6). Everything that the Lord Jesus has done here is grace. He said, "Blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me" because He was afraid that some would be stumbled because of His abundant grace. The Lord said, "There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land; and to none of them was Elijah sent, except to the city of Sarepta of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. And there were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them were cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian" (Luke 4:25-27). This also expressed love because a widow is a most pitiful person, while Gentiles were despised by the Jews. After the Lord said these words, the people in the synagogue were filled with rage. They rose up to cast Him out of the city, intending to throw Him over the cliff. During His entire life, the Lord was under persecution because whatever He did expressed God's love.</P><P>The Lord's death, however, shows forth God's righteousness because He bore man's sins on the cross. He was judged by God and He fulfilled the requirements of the law.</P><P>We thank the Lord that He first becomes the Friend of sinners, and then He becomes the Savior of sinners. He first loves us and then works so that we can believe and receive the redemption He has accomplished on the cross.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION TWELVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING THE TWO NATURES<br>OF CHRIST</H1><P>Why, in God's plan of redemption, must Christ be both God and man at the same time?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Suppose there are three persons: A, B, and C. Person C has sinned, and A asks B to die for C. This would show that A has love toward C, and that C has answered the requirements of the law; however, this is rather unjust to B. I sinned, and God caused Christ to die for me. Although this shows God's love and although I meet the requirements of the law, this is rather unjust to Christ. Only when Christ is both God and man is this just.</P><P>First, we need to know what forgiveness is. Forgiveness means that the one who forgives takes the loss upon himself. It means that the forgiver is suffering the loss of the forgiven one. The loss is on the side of the one who forgives. For instance, if someone owes you ten dollars, and you forgive him, we can say that you bore the loss since you suffered the loss of ten dollars.</P><P>In God's plan of redemption, Christ should not be a third party. If Christ is a third party, then God is unrighteous toward Him because He has no sin and does not deserve to die. The Bible tells us that man has sinned and that God is the One whom man has sinned against. The relationship here is a two-party relationship between God and man. Asking a third party to die in a substitutionary way may, perhaps, satisfy God's righteousness, and it may meet the law's demand on man, but this is rather unrighteous for the third party. It is righteous only because Christ is both God and man.</P><P>Micah 6:6 and 7 say, "With what shall I come before Jehovah/And bow myself before the high God?/Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings,/With one-year-old calves?/ Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams,/With tens  of thousands of rivers of oil?/Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression,/The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?" These verses say that when we have sinned against God, not only is an offering of rams of no avail, all the sacrifices are of no value. Even offering up our own offspring is of no avail. In order for Christ to not be a third party, He must be God since He Himself is the One being offended. The work of propitiation for sins is righteous only because Christ is God. Conversely, since the work of propitiation for sins is righteous, Christ must be God because only the one who is offended can forgive the one who offends. Who can say forgiveness is unrighteous? Christ is God; He is the offended One and, therefore, He can forgive men.</P><P>Romans 7:10 says, "And the commandment, which was unto life, this very commandment was found to me to be unto death." Romans 6:23 says, "For the wages of sin is death." These verses show us that a person has to fully keep the law in order to live; otherwise he must die. In order for the Lord to make us live, He had to suffer the penalty of sin; He had to die. However, 1 Timothy 6:16 says that God alone has immortality. Therefore, Christ must also be a man in order to die for us. He had to take a body upon Himself so that He could die for us. He is God; this makes His salvation of men righteous. He is a man; this makes His salvation of men possible.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING ROMANS 5:18-19</H1><P>Why does Romans 5:18 say, "One offense...one righteous act," yet verse 19 says, "The disobedience of one man...the obedience of the One"?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>First of all, we have to divide Romans 5:12-21 into definite sections. Verses 13 through 17 are a footnote to verse 12; verse 18 should follow immediately after verse 12. Verses 13 through 17 therefore are parenthetical, that is, an insertion, not the main text. Let us begin from verse 12.</P><P>Verse 12 says, "Therefore just as through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin, death; and thus death passed on to all men because all have sinned." Adam was a channel through which sin flowed into the world, and death followed behind sin. So death passed not only to one man but to all men because all have sinned. Yet after Paul finished this verse, he feared that some might raise the question: "Since there was no law during Adam's time, where did sin come from? And if there were no sin, how could there be death?" Paul, therefore, put in a parenthetical explanation, verses 13 to 17, which may be subdivided into three sections.</P><P>Verses 13 through 14 say, "For until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not charged to one's account when there is no law. But death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is a type of Him who was to come." Paul meant that before there was the law, sin was not counted as sin. This does not mean that because there was no law, sin did not exist. Paul was dealing with a fact. Even though there was no law, sin was in the world. Since death was in the world, sin must have been in the world also. Since death has come upon all, all have sinned. Although the sins committed by different men are different from Adam's sin, the death is the same. Paul was proving one thing: even though the act was done by Adam alone, it affected the whole human race. Not only did Adam receive the consequence, but the whole human race received the same consequence also. The same is true with Christ, because Adam prefigured Christ; Christ's actions affected the whole human race.</P><P>Verse 15 says, "But it is not that as the offense was, so also the gracious gift is; for if by the offense of the one the many died, much more the grace of God and the free gift in grace of the one man Jesus Christ have abounded to the many." This verse compares the offense itself (or its nature) with grace; the offense is inferior to grace. Paul's reasoning was that since Adam's sin caused the many to die, could not the grace of God be gained more by the many? He was comparing the nature of the offense with the nature of grace. He was saying, "What kind of grace is the grace of God? The grace of God was given freely to men through one man, Jesus Christ. Could it not abound more to the many? Certainly it could abound more to the many."</P><P>Verses 16 through 17 say, "And it is not that as through one who sinned, so also the free gift is; for the judgment was out of one offense unto condemnation, but the gracious gift is out of many offenses unto justification. For if by the offense of the one death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ." These two verses compare the end result (or the retribution) of the offense with the end result of grace. Concerning the end result, the offense is still inferior to grace. As a result of one man's sin, God condemned his sin according to righteousness, and many were also condemned. Because of one offense, many were condemned. Yet grace can forgive so many offenses, not just one offense. Therefore, the end result of grace far surpasses the end result of the offense. If one offense could affect so many, it is not known how many would be condemned by ten offenses or a hundred offenses. However, God's grace can forgive many offenses. The end result of grace is indescribably better. Verse 17 reinforces verse 16. Since we have both grace and righteousness, can we not reign in life? Surely we can.</P><P>Verse 18 says, "So then as it was through one offense unto condemnation to all men, so also it was through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men." The thought in this verse immediately follows the thought in verse 12. Verse 12 says that just because one man, Adam, sinned, death came upon all men because all have sinned. Verse 18 continues by saying that through Adam's one offense, all men were condemned, but through Christ's one righteous act, which accomplished righteousness once for all on the cross, there was justification of life to all men. If a person does not believe this doctrine, he will not admit that he is a sinner. The Bible does not say that you become a sinner when you commit sin; the Bible says all men are sinners. As long as you are a human being, you are a sinner. You, therefore, are a sinner because Adam sinned. Many do not understand the salvation of Christ because they do not understand the things concerning Adam. If you can say that all men were condemned in Adam, why can you not say that in Christ all men were justified to receive life? Praise and thank God! What we have gained in Christ is much more than what we have lost in Adam. We are sinners because of Adam's one offense, and we can be saved because of Christ's one righteous act. Adam's one offense brought forth such a result. Likewise, Christ's one righteous act brought forth a far better result.</P><P>Verse 19 says, "For just as through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the One the many will be constituted righteous." This verse explains that this result is much better than the other because this Man is far better than the other man. Putting it in another way, the other act was inferior to this act because the former man was inferior to the latter Man. For example, if both Brother Lee and Brother Chang are sweeping the floor, you can conclude that Brother Chang does not do as well as Brother Lee because Brother Chang himself is inferior to Brother Lee. Verse 18 says that what Adam once did is far inferior to what Christ has done. Verse 19 tells us that the reason the act of Adam was not as good as the act of Christ is that Adam was inferior to Christ. Adam disobeyed, but Christ obeyed. Because of Adam's disobedience, all men were made sinners. In the same manner, because of Christ's obedience, all men were made righteous.</P><P>Verse 20 says, "And the law entered in alongside that the offense might abound; but where sin abounded, grace has superabounded." The law does not cause the offense to abound; it only exposes the many offenses. The law does not cause man to sin; it only reveals man's sins. This is like a mirror; it only exposes the flaws on my face but cannot increase them. The law is from without, and it shows us what great sinners we are. After we come to know ourselves, God shows us that His grace abounds much more than sin.</P><P>Verse 21 says, "In order that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Adam has passed away. Now there is only the gospel. Praise and thank God that we are saved, but not through ourselves. This is the gospel!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FOURTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING CHRIST AND THE LAW</H1><P>Did Christ keep the law for us? Does our salvation have a direct relationship to His keeping of the law?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Christ did not keep the law for us. What saved us is God's righteousness, not Christ's righteousness.</P><P>Christ kept the law in order to be righteous in Himself and to be qualified as the Savior. There is only an indirect relationship between Christ's keeping of the law and our salvation.</P><P>Christ can save us because He received the punishment of the law, which is death, not because He kept the law. What has saved us is Christ's death and the righteousness accomplished through His death, not the righteous acts of Christ. The righteous acts of Christ are His own.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FIFTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING THE LAW AND FAITH</H1><P>How do we "establish the law" through faith (Rom. 3:31)? Why are the believers "not under the law" (Rom. 6:14)? What does it mean to be "not under the law"? Why is Christ the "end of the law" (Rom. 10:4)?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Romans 3:31 says, "Do we then make the law of no effect through faith? Absolutely not! Rather, we establish the law." This is Paul's conclusion. Prior to this he said, "For we account that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law" (v. 28). Since this is the case, someone may have raised the question: "Is not the law made void by faith?" Therefore, Paul answered, "Absolutely not!" The phrase "Absolutely not!" is a Greek idiom. It is the same as "Heaven forbid!" in Chinese. Paul meant that heaven would not agree with you saying that the law was abolished by faith.</P><P>In the first three chapters of Romans, Paul shows that the Gentiles, whom God had not chosen, were sinners, and the Jews, whom God had chosen, were also sinners. Those who served God and had the law of God were also sinners. No one can be justified by keeping the law. Therefore, Paul says, "Because out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him; for through the law is the clear knowledge of sin" (3:20).</P><P>"But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested, witness being borne to it by the Law and the Prophets" (3:21). Praise and thank God for "but now." Now there is a way of salvation.</P><P>"Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus" (3:25-26). God exercised forbearance toward those in the Old Testament, and He justifies those in this age. In the Old Testament age the Lord had not died, and sin had not been removed. Therefore, God forbore man. But today God justifies rather than forbears. To justify is not only to forgive a man or reckon him to be without sins but, even more, to pronounce him righteous. God gives us this righteousness in Christ Jesus. We can now receive this righteousness because Christ died and resurrected. Therefore, Paul said, "For we account that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law" (3:28). Paul was afraid someone might think that since man was justified through faith, the law would be abolished through faith. This is why he immediately said, "Absolutely not!" (3:31). Even heaven forbids man to say that.</P><P>How, then, do we establish the law through faith? The law has only two requirements: (1) the law commands man to do good, and (2) the law punishes those who do not do good. The law requires one of these two. If you do not keep the law, you will be punished by the law. If you do not follow the law and establish it, you will be punished by the law in order to establish it. Besides the Lord, no other person can keep the law; even Moses the lawgiver did not keep the law completely. The law requires death for those who do not keep the law. We can say, "I did not keep the law; I have sinned; I have died already. In Christ, I have received the judgment of the law and the curse of the law. Therefore, I did not break the law; rather, I established it through faith." Although we cannot establish the law by keeping it and deserve to die, praise and thank God that we have died in Christ! It is of God that we are in Christ Jesus (1 Cor. 1:30). It is God who put us into Christ. When Christ died, we also died in His death. Therefore, faith does not make the law void; rather, it establishes the law.</P><P>Why are the believers not under the law? The believers are not under the law because, on the one hand, they are already dead, and on the other hand, they are resurrected. We can prove this by Romans 7:1-6. Paul uses a parable of a woman and her husband. We need to note what "the husband" refers to in this section. Some say "the husband" refers to the law. Others say "the husband" refers to our flesh. Each group has its own opinions and reasons. However, if we read it carefully, we will see that both implications are actually here. In Romans 7:2, the husband is the law, yet the husband is different from the law. Therefore, "the husband" in this section has two meanings. One meaning refers to the law, and the other meaning refers to the flesh. If the husband referred only to the law, then the phrase "if the husband dies" would mean that law is dead. But how can the law die? Once we are clear about this point, we can conclude that "the husband" in this section refers to the flesh and also to the law.</P><P>Prior to believing in the Lord, everyone is bound by the law. How can one break away from it? It can only be done through death. Once we are dead, we break away. God condemned sin in Christ's flesh. We have died in Christ and broken away from the law. We are like the woman, and our flesh is like the husband. Once we are dead, we break away from the flesh. The requirement of the law, at most, is death. No matter how many sins a sinner has committed, the law can, at most, sentence him to die once. Once he is dead, everything is ended. Once we die, we break away from the law.</P><P>On the other hand, the verse says, "If the husband dies, she is discharged from the law regarding the husband" (7:2). This refers to severing our relationship with the law. Severing our relationship with the law is likened to death. The first part of the sentence emphasizes death; the second part emphasizes severing.</P><P>This section also shows us two pictures. One picture is that through the body of Christ, we are dead to the law and have completely broken away from it. On the day the Lord died, we died also. Therefore, we can say to the law, "I am not under the law." The other picture is that now we can remarry. At one time the flesh was our master, but now we can remarry. Now we belong to the Christ who has resurrected from the dead, and we can bear fruit to God. Therefore, today no Christian is under the law.</P><P>If someone says, "We should keep the law; we should keep the Sabbath," we should realize that if we attempt to keep one commandment of the law, we are saying that Christ did not die for us. We are overthrowing the work of Christ. Compare Romans 6:14 with 3:19. Romans 6:14 says, "For sin will not lord it over you, for you are not under the law but under grace." This says that the believers are not under the law. Romans 3:19 says, "Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may fall under the judgment of God." This says that the law speaks to those who are under the law. Since we are not under the law, the words in the law are not directed toward us.</P><P>Why did Paul write Galatians after he had already written Romans? The book of Romans tells us that sinners cannot be justified by keeping the law. Galatians tells us that saints cannot be sanctified by keeping the law. Sinners are not saved by doing good. But this is not all; saints cannot be sanctified by doing good. Just as we began through grace, we must be perfected through grace. We cannot be justified through faith and then try to become holy by keeping the law. Justification is by the Holy Spirit, and sanctification is also by the Holy Spirit. The way of entry is the way of completion. God only works according to one principle. Why can wool not be woven together with linen? (Deut. 22:11). Wool comes from the shedding of blood, while linen comes from man's planting. What is done by God is God's work; what is done by man is man's work. God will not mix His work with man's work.</P><P>What does "not under the law" mean? "Not under the law" does not mean lawlessness or ungodliness. The Bible says, "For sin will not lord it over you, for you are not under the law but under grace" (Rom. 6:14). We are not under the law because we are under grace. Since we are under grace, sin cannot lord it over us. We should pay attention to this verse. Sin cannot have dominion over whoever is not under the law. However, we cannot be uninhibited to do anything we want to.</P><P>What does it mean to be "under grace"? Let us read Romans 11:6: "But if by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace." "Under grace" means we do not have to depend on our own doing. What does it mean to be "under the law"? It means we do it by ourselves. Yet the more we try to do good, the more we cannot do it. Being under grace is having the Lord Jesus do it, while being under the law is doing it ourselves. To be under grace is for God to operate within us until sin can no longer be our master. To be under the law is for sin to lord it over us because we cannot overcome sin. If we are under grace, we have the grace of God working within us. Can sin compete with the grace of God? Of course not.</P><P>The Lord who died on the cross for us is living in us. The same One who bore our sins on the cross is now in us causing us to overcome sin. The law was but a command of God, but grace is God's power. The law commands us to do something, but grace empowers us to do it. Not being under the law, but being under grace, means that the resurrected Christ is living in us and enabling us to overcome.</P><P>Christ is the end of the law because He has satisfied all the requirements that the law has on man.</P><P>First, Christ ended the law in His living. For the moment, we will not mention the Lord Jesus as God but consider Him only as a man. In the whole world, the Lord Jesus is the only man who has ever completely followed the law. There were none before Him nor any after Him who did this. He has such a qualification. He is the end of the law.</P><P>Second, Christ's death ended the law. The ultimate, consummate requirement of the law is nothing other than death. Suppose a person breaks the law of the nation. He deserves death and is executed. Once this person is executed, the law of the land can no longer require anything more. The requirement of the law extends only up to death. Once a man is dead, everything is settled. The law says that those who do not keep the law have to die. The Lord Jesus died and ended the law.</P><P>The end means the final point. Once it is the end, what more can you add? What more needs to be done? Therefore, every Christian can thank and praise God that Christ has ended the law.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION SIXTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING MATTHEW 5:17</H1><P>How did Christ fulfill the law and the prophets (Matt. 5:17)?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>In order to answer this question, we must carefully read Matthew 5:17-21. Verse 17 begins, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets." Why did the Lord say, "Do not think"? He said this because there was the possibility of thinking this way. Perhaps some thought this. After the Lord had spoken the nine blessings on the mount, He mentioned two other matters: (1) we are the salt of the earth, and (2) we are the light of the world. When the people heard this, they might have thought that the blessings spoken by the Lord were absolutely different from the Old Testament. In the Old Testament, God wanted the Israelites to be great, prosperous, and victorious over their enemies. But now the Lord was saying that man should be humble, meek, suffer persecution, and so forth. This is completely different from the Old Testament. Had the Lord come to abolish the law? In the past God selected the Israelites to be His testimony on earth. Now He was saying that His followers were the salt and the light. God had already removed His testimony from among the Israelites and given it to a few others. Had not the Lord come to abolish the law? Therefore, immediately after the Lord said that we were the salt and the light, He said, "Do not think." The Lord said that He did not come to abolish but to fulfill. The literal meaning of the word abolish is to tear down piece by piece, as in tearing down a wall, and the literal meaning of the word fulfill is to fill to the brim.</P><P>In history there were two schools of teaching regarding the Lord Jesus' attitude toward the law. One teaching was poor. They said that the Lord Jesus fulfilled the law by annulling the law. They argued that there were clearly many discrepancies between what the Lord said and what Moses said. Moses said that if a man wanted to put away his wife, he only needed to write a certificate of divorce. Yet the Lord said that putting away one's wife, except for the cause of fornication, was not permitted. According to the first school, the Lord was opposing Moses. The Protestant school, however, said that much had been added to Moses' law by the Jews in the fifteen hundred years after Moses, so the Lord came to preserve the true nature of the law by abolishing what had been added by man. But contrary to what these two schools say, the meaning of "fulfill," was for the Lord to fill to the brim; it was to make up the lack. Now let us see the Lord's attitude toward the law.</P><P>First, the Lord acknowledged that the law and the prophets came from God. In Matthew 5:12, the Lord said: "For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you." This indicates that the Lord acknowledged the prophets. In Matthew 5:23 the Lord spoke concerning the matter of offering sacrifices on the altar, indicating that the Lord was not against the altar. After the Lord had finished His teaching on the mount, He came down and met a leper. After healing him the Lord commanded him to show his body to the priest and offer the gift which Moses had commanded (Matt. 8:1-4). This proves that the Lord acknowledged that what Moses had commanded should be done.</P><P>Second, although the Lord acknowledged that the law and the prophets came from God, He also said that the law was not complete. In Matthew 5, we read again and again: "You have heard that it was said to the ancients...but I say to you." The Lord agreed with Moses when he said that it was right for one not to kill or commit adultery, but even this was not complete. Rather, one should not even be angry or have a lustful thought. However, we have to note that being incomplete does not mean that it is wrong. For example, a child has just learned that two plus two equals four. Concerning knowledge, his learning is not complete, but this does not mean that what he has learned is wrong.</P><P>Third, the Lord came to fill up the inadequacy of the law. The word "fulfill" refers to the Lord's work of fulfilling as a teacher, not to His work of fulfilling as a Savior. This means that where the law was lacking, the Lord supplemented and made it full. The law teaches us to return an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. This is the principle of fairness. However, the Lord teaches us to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us. This is the principle of grace. The law expresses God's way of doing things, which is to do everything in fairness. Grace and mercy express the nature of God Himself. According to the Lord's grace, He causes the sun to rise on the good people as well as the evil, and the rain to fall on the just as well as the unjust. John 1:17 says, "For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ." Moses talked about God's procedures, while the Lord talked about the nature of God Himself.</P><P>On the cross the Lord has borne the curse of the law for us. Since we have received life by accepting the Lord's work on the cross, we should also walk according to the Lord's commands on the mount in our living on earth. Some people say that what the Lord spoke on the mount was all law and no grace. Therefore, they conclude that the teaching on the mount was for the Jews only. There is evidence which proves the error of this school of thought. (1) We cannot reasonably push all the hard requirements onto the Jews and leave the easy ones for ourselves. Can God, who gave less power and grace to the Jews, require more from them? Can the same God, who has given more power and grace to us, require less from us? (2) Matthew 5:1-2 clearly say that the Lord was speaking to the disciples. If anyone says that the disciples refer to the Jews, there is at least one verse in the Bible that says that they are Christians (Acts 11:26). However, there is no verse in the Bible that says, "the disciples are the Jews"; nor is there the term "Jewish disciples." Once we become disciples, there is no longer a distinction between Jews and Gentiles. (3) Matthew 28:19 and 20 say, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you." When we preach the gospel, we also need to teach people to keep the Lord's teachings, which include the Lord's teaching on the mount. It is true that the teaching on the mount is difficult, but we cannot push all the difficult matters onto the Jews. John 14:26 says, "But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and remind you of all the things which I have said to you." We need to pay attention to the last phrase. The things that the Lord said include not only believing in the Lord Jesus and receiving eternal life, but also the Lord's commandments. The work of the Holy Spirit is to cause man to obey what the Lord has commanded. The disciples were not only commissioned to preach the gospel; they were also commissioned to teach people to obey the Lord's teachings.</P><P>Matthew 5:18 says, "For truly I say to you, Until heaven and earth pass away, one iota or one serif shall by no means pass away from the law until all come to pass." "One iota" refers to the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and "one serif" refers to the diacritical marks in the Hebrew alphabet. One iota and one serif refer to the smallest parts of the language. To fulfill all the iotas and serifs is to fulfill all things. Heaven and earth will pass away only when each iota and each serif of the law is fulfilled.</P><P>Verse 17 speaks about the law and the prophets, while verse 18 speaks only about the law. Why is this so? It is because the law only goes as far as the end of the millennial kingdom, while the prophets cover eternity (Isaiah once spoke about the new heaven and new earth). If we say that heaven and earth will pass away only when all that the prophets have spoken is fulfilled, are we not reversing the order of the record in Revelation? Our Lord's word is very precise; He did not say too much or too little. The Lord said that heaven and earth could pass away only when each iota and each serif of the law was fulfilled. Therefore, we can see how honorable the law is.</P><P>The word "therefore" in verse 19 is a continuation of what has been said in the preceding text. What do the "commandments" in verse 19 refer to? They refer to the law in the preceding text, not the teaching on the mount, since the word "these" in "these commandments" clearly refers to the law in the preceding text.</P><P>There are two kinds of laws: one is the ceremonial law, and the other is the moral law. For example, the way to offer the sacrifices is a ceremonial law, while the way to treat people and things is a moral law. The moral laws are much more important than the ceremonial laws. When the Lord was on the earth, He had His ways of dealing with both kinds of law.</P><P>Matthew 22:37 through 40 says, "And He said to him, `You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the great and first commandment. And the second is like it: `You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets." Matthew 9:13 says, "I desire mercy and not sacrifice." The Lord shows us that the moral laws are more important than any other laws. Matthew 23:23 says, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you give a tenth of the mint and the anise and the cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law-justice and mercy and faithfulness. But these you should have done and not neglected the others." Here the Lord shows us that the laws differ in importance. Some people were very thorough in observing the rituals, yet the Lord still reproached them. Paying tithes of mint, anise, and cummin, not weaving wool and linen together, not using goat's milk to boil the kid, and so forth are all lesser commandments.</P><P>Matthew 5:19 says, "Therefore whoever annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whoever practices and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens." This shows us the great responsibilities that are upon those who minister God's Word. Whosoever breaks the least item among these commandments in his conduct and teaches others to break them (rather than to keep them), shall be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens. Many wrong teachings are often produced by wrong conduct. For example, some people may regard baptism as being unimportant. Then they may say, "Why be bothered with baptism"? They are determined not to be baptized. Later, when others ask them about the matter of baptism, they make up a set of doctrines about not being baptized. Because they have such a wrong conduct, they come up with such a wrong teaching. The Lord said that these people will be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Do Christians have to keep the law also? No, they do not because Christians are not under the law but under grace (Rom. 6:14). During the apostles' time, a few people taught the brothers saying that if they were not circumcised according to Moses' law, they could not be saved. Peter answered them saying, "Therefore why are you now testing God by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?" (Acts 15:10). Afterwards, they wrote to the brothers asking them only to abstain from the contaminations of idols, fornication, what is strangled, and blood; they did not ask the disciples to be circumcised (Acts 15:1-29).</P><P>On the other hand, while the Lord was on the earth, and before He died and resurrected, He was the expression of the law and all the ceremonies. Therefore, the disciples had to continue keeping the law at that time. For example, both the Lord and Peter paid a temple tax at that time (Matt. 17:27). It was not until the Lord died that the law ceased. Once the Lord died, the law and all the rituals were fulfilled. This is related to the matter of dispensation.</P><P>After the Holy Spirit descended and the church was established, Peter still kept the ceremonial laws by refraining from eating unclean things as mentioned in Leviticus 11. How did God teach him? "The things that God has cleansed, do not make common" (Acts 10:9-16). There is a change under the New Testament. Galatians tells us that circumcision is a very important law to the Jews. But Paul told them seriously, "Behold, I Paul say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing. And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law" (Gal. 5:2-3). Paul said that once a person is circumcised, he has to keep the whole law. Regarding the law, we have to either keep all or none of it; we cannot take what we want and reject what we do not want. From this verse, we see clearly that we are not under the law.</P><P>The "kingdom of the heavens" in Matthew 5:19 does not refer to the church but rather to the Lord's reigning in the millennial kingdom after His second coming.</P><P>Some think that even though Christians do not have to keep the ceremonial laws, they still have to keep the moral laws. They also think that since they are saved through faith, they have the power to attain sanctification through their own conduct and by keeping the law. However, we must realize that just as keeping the law is not the condition of salvation, keeping the law is not the principle of our living throughout our life.</P><P>Matthew 5:20 says, "For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens." To say that the Pharisees have righteousness is to say that they have kept the moral laws. Can a Christian enter the kingdom of the heavens just by having the righteousness of the Pharisees? The Lord said definitely not. In this passage of the Bible (vv. 17-20), the Lord said twice, "I say to you." In verse 18 He told the disciples that the law cannot be abolished but rather that it should be fulfilled. In verse 20 He told the disciples that He came to supplement the lack of the law. Verse 17 says, on the negative side, that the law is not to be abolished, and on the positive side that it has to be fulfilled. Verses 18 through 19 show us the Lord's attitude toward the law on the negative side: the law is not to be abolished. Then verse 20 shows us the Lord's attitude toward the law on the positive side: the law is to be fulfilled, that is, filled to the brim. Because of the difference in these two aspects, the Lord said twice, "I say to you."</P><P>There is a difference between "your righteousness" in verse 20 and the justification of the law. God's justification is given to us by God, and it is received through faith. "Your righteousness" has to do with our own behavior and is obtained through the working of the Holy Spirit. When we mention justification, it is with reference to sinners. These words were spoken to the disciples. Therefore, the righteousness here is not the righteousness given by God but the righteousness attained by the disciples.</P><P>Even if the scribes and the Pharisees did their best, they could only fulfill the righteousness of the law. But the disciples who are not under the law should have a righteousness that exceeds the righteousness of the law. Their standard should be higher than that of the scribes and the Pharisees. No Christian can enter into the kingdom of the heavens by keeping the law. Christians have received the teachings of Matthew 5-7. If they do not keep them, they cannot enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Let us be clear about one more point. Every believer has the eternal life, but not every believer can enter into the kingdom of the heavens. We obtain eternal life through the righteousness God has given us, but we enter the kingdom of the heavens through the righteousness we work out ourselves. Once we believe, we obtain eternal life and will never lose it. However, only the overcomers can enter into the kingdom of the heavens. We can obtain eternal life in this age, but the kingdom of the heavens will only be established when the Lord comes again. The Gospel of John mentions the matter of obtaining eternal life through believing nine times. However, Matthew 11:12 says, "The kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence, and violent men seize it." Once we believe, we obtain eternal life, but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we have to pursue it daily. God selects some from among this world to receive eternal life, and He selects some from among those who have received eternal life to enter into the kingdom of the heavens. There is no difference between being great and being the least in obtaining eternal life, but there is a difference between being great and being the least in entering into the kingdom of the heavens. Therefore, if we, the saved ones, want to reign at the Lord's second coming, we have to work out our own righteousness through the Holy Spirit. How can we not believe in the Lord's words!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION SEVENTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING GALATIANS 3:21</H1><P>Can Galatians 3:21 be read as follows: "Is then the law against the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given which was able to give righteousness, life would have indeed been of law"? Is it wrong to render it this way? If so, where is the error?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Galatians 3:21 correctly says, "Is then the law against the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given which was able to give life, righteousness would have indeed been of law." The error in the question is the reversal of "life" and "righteousness." We have to understand what Paul meant. Paul said that the law and the promises of God are not opposed to each other. The Galatians thought that the promises came after the law; Paul proved that the promises were made before the law. God made the promises to Abraham and then gave the law later. In fact, God made the promises to Abraham four hundred and thirty years before He gave the law. Therefore, we must realize that God gave the law four hundred and thirty years after He gave the promises to Abraham.</P><P>Among Christians there is the mistaken concept that God had to save man by grace because He failed to achieve His purpose through the law. However, this was not the case. God's promise to Abraham did not depend on Abraham's doing. Abraham received the promise only by believing. The reason God gave the law to the children of Israel was because they failed to realize the preciousness of grace. The purpose for giving them the law was to make them realize that they were sinful in violating the law, so that they would then treasure God's promises. But, even after God gave man the law, He continued to save man by grace. The law causes man to know himself. Only after a man knows himself does he treasure grace. If a person is hungry, he naturally wants to eat. However, if he does not want to eat, he may need to have his appetite stimulated. In the same way, the law leads man to the point where he realizes the need for grace.</P><P>What Galatians 3:21 means is that if the law could have given life to man, it could also have given righteousness to man. Does the law give life or righteousness first? Do Christians gain life first or righteousness first? This is the main point that Paul argued in Galatians. Paul said that if the law could give us life, it also could give us righteousness. In our salvation, we obtain righteousness first and then life. Does a man perish because he has committed sins? Does committing sins or perishing come first? Obviously, committing sins comes first and perishing follows. How then can a man be saved? He is saved by righteousness. Does righteousness or life come first? Obviously, righteousness comes first and life follows. We can verify this by the Scripture. Romans 5:17 says, "Much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ." This verse says righteousness comes first and reigning in life later. Verse 21 says, "So also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." This is another verse that says righteousness comes first and eternal life later. Romans 8:10 says, "The spirit is life because of righteousness." This is yet another verse that says righteousness comes first and life later.</P><P>We need to be clear that the reason we do not have life is because we do not have righteousness. According to the righteousness of God, whoever is without righteousness should be punished and should die. When the Lord Jesus came, He did not first resurrect and then die for us. He died first, and then He was resurrected for us. When we believe in Him, we receive the righteousness attained by Him; then this righteousness becomes our life. The spirit is life because of righteousness. The Lord Jesus died and resurrected for us so that we might have life. The Lord Jesus died, and according to God's righteousness, God must forgive man because the price has been paid and the righteous requirement of God has been satisfied. Our salvation is based on the righteousness attained by Christ, which renders it impossible for God not to forgive us. What Paul meant was, "If the law could have given life, I would also have to say that the law could give righteousness. But I did not say this. Righteousness is manifested apart from the law, it is not of the law." In spite of this, God still saves man according to the principle of the law, for the law states that only those who are righteous can gain life. Grace gives man righteousness and then life. Therefore, the promise of God is not opposed to the law.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION EIGHTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING REDEMPTION</H1><P>What does redemption mean? From what are we redeemed?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>The word redemption means to buy back, that is, a certain object that was once held as a pledge has now been bought back.</P><P>We have been redeemed, but from what were we redeemed? Many traditional teachings say that we were redeemed from the devil's hand. They say that because we were slaves under the devil's hand, the Lord Jesus shed His blood and redeemed us out of his hand. If this is the case, does this not mean that God acknowledged that it was lawful for us to be in the devil's hand? Suppose someone that you know has stolen something from you. If you pay him a price to ransom what has been stolen, you are acknowledging his theft to be lawful. If we say that the Lord Jesus shed His blood as a price to pay the devil to redeem us, we are, similarly, saying that God acknowledges the legality of man falling into the devil's hand. This is certainly not correct. Therefore, we cannot say that we are redeemed from the devil's hand.</P><P>Should we say that we are redeemed from God's hand? No, this too is wrong. (1) Saying that we are redeemed from God's hand effaces His love. The Lord Jesus came because God sent Him. The Bible repeatedly tells us that God loves us. (The entire New Testament mentions "the love of Christ" only three times-in Romans 8:35, in 2 Corinthians 5:14, and in Ephesians 3:19. The Lord Jesus was willing to redeem us according to God's will because He also loved us.) God loved us and prepared a way of salvation by sending His Son to save us. We must not misjudge God's nature. (2) If we are redeemed from God's hand, to whom do we belong? If we say that we are redeemed from God's hand, why do we still belong to God?</P><P>Should we then say we are redeemed from sin? No, we cannot say this either. If we are redeemed from sin, to whom is the ransom paid? The Lord truly paid the price, but sin cannot be the recipient of this price.</P><P>There is only one place in the Bible that can answer this question. Galatians 3:13 says, "Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf." Our conclusion must be that we are redeemed from the curse of the law. We were sinners before God under the curse of the law, but the Lord Jesus died for us and redeemed us from the curse of the law. We were redeemed not from the law but from the curse of the law. Being redeemed from the law would be unrighteous. Being redeemed from the curse of the law means being redeemed from the consequence of the law. Whoever violates the law has to be punished; by the shedding of His blood, the Lord Jesus answered the demands of the law. He delivered us not just from a few laws; He delivered us from the curse of the law. Since the Bible says this, we can only say the same; saying more or less than this would be incorrect.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION NINETEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING ROMANS 2:12</H1><P>Does Romans 2:12 say that a man will not perish if he does not have the law (which means God has not given him the law) and commits sin? Will a sinner still end up in perdition if he has never heard the gospel?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Perdition and sin are closely related. Whether or not one perishes does not depend on the existence of the law. Romans 2:12 says, "For as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law." If a person does not have the law or has not heard the gospel, God has a way to deal with him. (1) The righteous God does not do anything unrighteous. (2) God is not obligated to save man. Man has committed sin and deserves to perish. Therefore, God would not be unrighteous if He did not save man. We are saved not because God is obligated to save us, but because God extends special grace to us.</P><P>When we consider this question, we must pay special attention to God's grace and God's righteousness. God's grace caused a Savior to die and resurrect for us. We were saved by the righteousness of God because the Lord Jesus died, and God must save us if we have believed. However, if the Lord Jesus had not died for us, God would not have been unrighteous if He did not save us. Grace comes first and then righteousness follows. Grace is the means of salvation, but salvation itself is accomplished by righteousness. By His grace God sent the Lord Jesus to become the Savior of sinners. This is how God saves a sinner. In the future there will only be voices of pain in hell but no voices of complaint, because hell is God's most righteous punishment. The judgment in Revelation 20 shows us that nobody will rise up and say that God is unrighteous at that time.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION TWENTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING BELIEVING IN RESURRECTION</H1><P>Since the basis of salvation is the death of Christ, why does the Bible tell us to believe not only in His death but also in His resurrection?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>The apostles were witnesses of the resurrection of Jesus (Acts 1:22). The book of Acts is full of testimonies of the Lord Jesus' resurrection. Death is merely a process; whereas, resurrection is the fulfillment. Therefore, whenever the Bible mentions the Lord's death, His resurrection is also mentioned. The Lord frequently told the disciples that He was going to be killed. But He did not stop there; He always went on to say that He was going to be raised on the third day. Resurrection is the conclusion of death. Only in resurrection can the work of death be accomplished. The Lord Jesus died for our sins on the cross. How do we know that He accomplished what He intended to accomplish? How do we know that God accepted what He accomplished? We know because He was resurrected from the dead. This can be likened to a criminal who is sentenced to a certain term of imprisonment. How do we know that his term is fulfilled? We know because he is released from jail. Resurrection concludes death. Without death, there is no resurrection. With resurrection, death passes away. God has "furnished proof to all by raising Him from the dead" (17:31). The Lord wants us to believe in His resurrection.</P><P>We cannot be saved by only believing in the Lord Jesus' death. We must also believe that the Lord Jesus has risen from the dead before we can be saved. Romans 10:9 says, "If you...believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."</P><P>Resurrection is an act of God. "And the Author of life you killed, whom God has raised from the dead" (Acts 3:15). Man had only seen death. If the Lord had not been raised, everyone would have thought that only an ordinary man had been killed. But God raised the Lord Jesus from the dead in order to show them that "it was not possible for Him to be held by it" (2:24). He was the One whom "God has exalted to His right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins" (5:31). "This is the One who was designated by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead...that through His name everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins" (10:42-43).</P><P>Believing in the resurrection is beyond man's ability. Without the touch of the Holy Spirit, man is not able to believe that the Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead. Just by saying, in a light way, that one believes is of no consequence. Without the work of the Holy Spirit, it is impossible for man to believe from the depth of his being. "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God" (Eph. 2:8). Surely salvation is the work of God. In the power of the Holy Spirit, the apostles bore witness to the Lord Jesus' resurrection. "And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit...And with great power the apostles gave testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus" (Acts 4:31, 33).</P><P>The work of redemption was accomplished by the death of Christ. His death is the basis of our salvation. However, we cannot believe only in the death of Christ; we must also believe in His resurrection.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION TWENTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING RESURRECTION<br>AND SALVATION</H1><P>On the cross Christ said, "It is finished," indicating that the work of the cross was complete. Why then could we still not be saved if He had not resurrected?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>When Christ said, "It is finished," on the cross, it meant that redemption was finished; it did not mean that salvation was finished. Redemption, the objective aspect, was accomplished by Christ. Salvation, the subjective aspect, is accomplished only when we are personally saved. Our joining to Christ in the subjective aspect involves a union with Christ's resurrection. Therefore, if He had not resurrected, we could not be saved.</P><P>Romans 8:2 says, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." Notice that this verse speaks of being freed from two laws, the law of sin and the law of death. The death of Christ dealt with sin; whereas, the resurrection of Christ dealt with death. Christ did away with sin through His death and nullified death through His resurrection. Christ's death only solved the problem of sin. Christ's resurrection solved the problem of death. We are not only sinful people but also dead people. The Lord died on the cross to save us from being in the position of sinners, and He resurrected to save us from being in the position of dead men.</P><P>If the Lord had not died on the cross, we would be both sinful and dead. If the Lord had only died without being resurrected, we would no longer be sinners, but we would still remain dead men. Resurrection destroys the power of death. Death satisfies God; it takes care of the objective need and deals with the law. Resurrection satisfies us; it takes care of the subjective need and gives life to us. If we only preach Christ's death, without preaching His resurrection, we are preaching only one half of the gospel. In reading the book of Acts, we see that the apostles paid a great deal of attention to the Lord's resurrection.</P><P>The blood is spoken of more than four hundred times in the Bible. The blood was brought before God to satisfy God. However, this happened after resurrection (Heb. 9:12). While the Lord's death must be heeded, it cannot be separated from resurrection. Death was followed by resurrection. Without resurrection there can be no salvation, because we are regenerated by God through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead (1 Pet. 1:3).</P><P>The Bible is full of the truth of resurrection. The New Testament and the Old Testament are filled with resurrection. Abraham offered up Isaac because he believed in resurrection. The Israelites' crossing of the Jordan River and the budding of Aaron's rod typify resurrection. First Corinthians 15:3 and 4 say, "Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures;...He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures." The Scriptures in this verse refer to the Old Testament. This shows that both the death and resurrection of Christ are according to the Old Testament.</P><P>We praise and thank God that His Son not only died for us but was also resurrected for us. He dealt not only with the law of sin but also with the law of death. He saves us not only from being in the position of sinners but also from being in the position of dead men.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION TWENTY-TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING 1 CORINTHIANS 15:3 AND 17</H1><P>First Corinthians 15:3 says that Christ died for our sins. Why does verse 17 say that if Christ has not been raised, we are yet in our sins?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Verse 3 speaks of Christ's death, which is related to the problem of sins. Verse 17 speaks of Christ's resurrection, which is also related to the problem of sins. Why is the problem of sins mentioned in verse 3 solved by the death of Christ, whereas the problem of sins mentioned in verse 17 is solved by the resurrection of Christ? Today gospel preachers have an inclination to put an adequate emphasis on Christ's death but not on Christ's resurrection. In many places we hear people say that Christ's death delivers us from sins, but we seldom hear people say that Christ's resurrection delivers us from sins.</P><P>The death of Christ delivered us from the punishment of sins and canceled the record of sins. But to be delivered from the power of sins, there must be the resurrection of Christ. The word "sins" in verse 3 is plural in the original language. It implies the individual acts of sin, the sins committed day to day. Christ died for our sins. He suffered the punishment for our sins and bore them on the cross. However, that was not enough. According to the book of Acts, did the apostles speak more about death or more about resurrection? Consider 1 Corinthians 15. Was Paul trying to prove the death of Christ or the resurrection of Christ? We know that the apostle put the emphasis on Christ's resurrection. The world believes that the Lord Jesus has died; but it is not easy for them to believe that He died to bear our sins. How do we know that the purpose of the Lord Jesus' death was to bear our sins? The Lord Jesus' resurrection solves this problem and proves that His death was for this purpose. The problem of sins was solved; therefore, He resurrected. When we tell someone that the Lord Jesus has died for his sins, and if the Holy Spirit reveals the resurrected Christ to him, he will believe. Only the resurrection of Christ can prove that Christ's death is for our sins.</P><P>Not only does the Lord Jesus' resurrection prove that His death is for our sins, His resurrection also gives us a new life. The Lord Jesus had to die for us; He also resurrected for us. We are sinners; the Lord Jesus has died for and propitiated our sins. But can we live before God by our flesh? Can we sin again? The Lord Jesus' death paid for our old debts, but His death cannot guarantee that we will not incur new debts. The Lord had to resurrect and put a new life into us so that we can live differently from before. Death clears our record of sins, whereas resurrection enables us to not sin again. The Lord Jesus not only died and propitiated our sins before God; He also resurrected and now lives in us, bearing our hardships and enabling us to overcome sins and temptations. Even though His death paid our old debts, we would still not have the strength to avoid new debts if the Lord Jesus had not resurrected. Therefore, He had to be raised in order to solve future problems. We not only have to believe that the Lord Jesus has borne our sins, but we also have to realize that He has resurrected and now lives in us. We are regenerated by the resurrection of the Lord Jesus (1 Pet. 1:3). God has put a new life into us; this life is a resurrection life with no bounds, which will raise us in the same way Christ was raised.</P><P>Many people make a basic mistake of receiving only the work of the Lord Jesus' death but not the work of His resurrection. Some Christians often feel that their circumstances are too difficult and their families have too many problems. Because they think the temptations are too real, they cannot overcome them. We have to be clear that even though the temptations are real, the Christ who dwells in us is also real. God puts us in difficult circumstances for two reasons: (1) He wants to prove to us the reality of the Christ who lives in us, and (2) He wants us to be satisfied with the reality of the Christ who lives in us. We can overcome sins not just once or twice but many times by the Christ who dwells in us. Many people only pay attention to an outward Savior and forget the Savior who lives in them. They only pay attention to the Savior at Golgotha but forget about the Savior who dwells in them. Yet the life within us is real and can overcome any temptation.</P><P>We have clearly seen that death has solved the problem of sins, and resurrection has given us a new life that enables us not to sin.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION TWENTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING BELIEVING<br>IN THE SON OF GOD</H1><P>Why does the Bible tell us to believe in the Son of God? What does it mean to believe in the Son of God? Which one of Christ's accomplished works for us corresponds to believing in the Son of God? If a person only believes that He is the Son of Man, can he be saved?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Christ was lifted up as a man; therefore, He included all of mankind. Because Christ died as a man, all men died (2 Cor. 5:14). Just as the action of the one man, Adam, included all of mankind, the work of the one man, Christ, included all of mankind. In order to understand redemption, we must see that Christ included all of mankind.</P><P>In order to show us that the priestly ministry of Melchisedec is greater than that of the sons of Levi, Hebrews 7:4 through 10 shows that Abraham offered Melchisedec a tenth of the spoils and also received Melchisedec's blessings. Therefore, Melchisedec was greater than the sons of Levi. Why was this so? "For he [Levi] was still in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him" (v. 10). We know that Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Levi. Levi was Abraham's great-grandchild. When Abraham offered his tithe and received the blessings, not only was Levi not yet born, but his father and grandfather were not yet born either. However, the Bible reckons Abraham's offering of tithes and receiving of the blessings as Levi's offering of tithes and receiving of the blessings. Since Abraham was less than Melchisedec, Levi must also have been less than Melchisedec. This matter helps us to understand that when Adam sinned, all men were in the loins of Adam and all sinned. Similarly, when Christ died, all men were in Him and all men also died.</P><P>Christ as the Son of Man has terminated everything of Adam, and Christ as the Son of God has begun the new creation. Christ is the last Adam. Through death He has terminated the old creation, and through resurrection He has begun the new creation. Through death Christ has dealt with sins; through resurrection Christ has given us life. For this reason, the Bible tells us to believe in the Son of God.</P><P>Believing in the Son of God means believing in the Lord's resurrection, because the Lord was "designated the Son of God in power...out of the resurrection of the dead" (Rom. 1:4). Psalm 2:7 says, "You are My Son;/Today I have begotten You." Acts 13:33 tells us that the Lord's resurrection fulfilled the word in Psalm 2:7.</P><P>Believing in the Son of God corresponds to the resurrection that Christ accomplished for us.</P><P>If a person only believes that Christ is the Son of Man, he cannot be saved. He has to believe that He is both the Son of Man and the Son of God in order to be saved. Christ not only died; He also resurrected. He not only bore our sins; He also abolished death. He not only causes us to not perish; He also gives us eternal life.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION TWENTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING AN<br>OLD TESTAMENT MIRACLE</H1><P>What is the most crucial miracle in the Old Testament? To what does this miracle refer?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>In the Old Testament, the most crucial miracle is the miracle of Jonah, which refers to the Lord Jesus' resurrection from the dead.</P><P>Some have misinterpreted this miracle. They say that the miracle of Jonah being in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights typifies the Lord being in the earth for three days and three nights. However, being dead and buried in the earth for three days and three nights is not a miracle because it is very common to be buried in the earth after death. It is also quite possible for a person to jump into the sea and be devoured by a big fish. It is not a miracle to be in the belly of a big fish for three days and three nights. It is not even a miracle to be in the belly of a big fish for fifty days and fifty nights. But being in the belly of a fish for three days and three nights and then coming out of it is a miracle. For Christ to be in the grave for three days and three nights is not a miracle. His resurrection from the grave after three days and three nights is the miracle. Death is not a miracle, but resurrection is a miracle.</P><P>Jonah had made up his mind and would not have returned if he had not suffered a calamity. He was very racially prejudiced. God commanded him to go to Nineveh, but he went his own way to Tarshish. Although he did not obey God, God did not let him go. He sent a great wind into the sea, and Jonah's ship was on the verge of being destroyed. Eventually, Jonah realized that he was the cause of the calamity. Finally, he asked the people on the ship to cast him into the sea, and the storm subsided. God prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah, and he remained in the belly of this fish three days and three nights. When God commanded the fish to vomit Jonah out upon the dry land, Jonah obeyed God's command to go to Nineveh and preach the gospel. Therefore, if you want to have peace within, you have to cast this man, Jonah, into the sea.</P><P>Jonah was a man who rebelled and escaped the will of God. He was cast into the sea because of his own sins. Our Lord, however, was crucified on the cross on behalf of our sins. When Jonah was cast into the sea, everything became peaceful. When the Lord died, everything was also at peace-man was reconciled with God. Whenever we are willing to accept the position the Lord gives to us, everything will be at peace. Jonah had to be cast into the sea, the Lord Jesus had to die, and we too must die and partake of the Lord's death.</P><P>Burial is typified by Jonah being cast into the sea and swallowed in the belly of the big fish. The unique meaning of burial is keeping the dead out of our sight. After Abraham's wife Sarah died, he spoke to the sons of Heth, saying, "Give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight" (Gen. 23:4). Our baptism is to confess that the Lord Jesus' death is real and that our death with Him is also real. We have both died and been buried together with Him. Resurrection is typified by the fish vomiting out Jonah upon the dry land. The Lord Jesus has been raised from the grave, and we have been raised together with Him. The Lord Jesus' resurrection is the central point of this miracle. Resurrection is not only an objective fact but also a subjective experience. Before Jonah was cast into the sea, he would rather have died than go to Nineveh. Jonah was not ready to go to Nineveh until the big fish vomited him out upon the dry land. This fundamental change in him was the work of resurrection. After we believe in the Lord and have the experience of resurrection, we are willing to do what we previously were very unwilling to do. We previously failed constantly in many things and were unable to overcome. But once we received the resurrection life, we underwent a fundamental change.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION TWENTY-FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING THE CHRISTIAN'S NATURE</H1><P>Adam was created by God not born of God; Christ was born of God not created by God. Are we Christians born of God or created by God?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Some people claim that they believe in the entire Bible but not in the Christians' regeneration. They say that regeneration is for the Jews and that Christians are created anew but not born again. However, the Bible says that Christians are born of God and also created anew by God. John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." First Peter 1:3 says that God "regenerated us...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." This reminds us that there is a begetting of the flesh and a begetting of the Holy Spirit. Second Corinthians 5:17 says, "So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new." Whenever regeneration is mentioned, we are reminded that we once had Adam's life; whenever the new creation is mentioned, it reminds us not to think of the old things but only of Christ.</P><P>We are a new creation in Christ. While this refers to our position, it also includes our experience. Position and experience are different, but they cannot be separated. Positionally speaking, the believers in Corinth were sanctified and justified. But experientially speaking, they still had jealousy and strife. Even though it is right to say this, if we separate position from experience, we may forget what Christ has accomplished and pay too much attention to our own experience. The more we pay attention to our own experience, the less experience we have. If our eyes behold Christ, we will be transformed into the image of the Lord. We must not look at ourselves but at Christ; only then will we have real experience. What does it mean to live in ourselves? Living in ourselves is turning to ourselves and thinking about ourselves. When we turn inward and think about ourselves, we immediately live in ourselves. Being humble is to not think about ourselves. It is not to think less about ourselves because when we think less about ourselves, we are still thinking about ourselves. Our union with Christ is not only a union in position but also a union in life. (The same is true with our union in Adam.) Whosoever looked upon the brass serpent experienced its effectiveness (Num. 21:9). Whosoever looks upon Christ only will experience victory.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION TWENTY-SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING ROMANS 5:9 AND 4:25</H1><P>What does it mean to be justified by the blood? (Rom. 5:9). What does it mean to be justified by resurrection? (4:25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Romans 5:9 says that we have "now been justified in His blood." Romans 4:25 says that Jesus "was raised for our justification." How can we tie these two verses together? We need to examine the meaning of "justified in His blood" and the meaning of "raised for our justification." How wide is the scope of justification in the blood and the scope of justification by resurrection?</P><P>Justification, according to the Bible, has two meanings: (1) A believer has been forgiven of his sins, and (2) God sees him as righteous or perfect. Before Adam and Eve sinned, they were not justified by God. Christ is righteous and perfect in God's sight. God tells every Christian who comes before Him that he not only is a forgiven sinner but he is also righteous. When he comes before God, he is not only free from any defilement of sin, but he is also clothed with the robe of righteousness. Everyone who comes before God in Christ is accepted by God just as Christ is accepted by God.</P><P>What are the differences between justification by the blood and justification by resurrection? The problem of our record of sins is resolved by the blood of the Lord Jesus. He shed His blood to nullify our record of sins. At the same time, we are accepted by God through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Many Christians commit a big error in thinking that forgiveness includes everything. We should, no doubt, rejoice in the forgiveness of sins, but God gives us more than just the forgiveness of sins in Christ. Forgiveness alone is not full salvation. Some have said that if they could only reach heaven, they would be satisfied. Others have said if they could only stand at the gate of heaven, they would be satisfied. If this is their concept, they surely do not know what the grace of God is. The Bible tells us that the grace of God includes not only forgiveness of sins but also a most glorious truth: when we come before God, we are accepted in His eyes. Ephesians 1:6 says, "He graced us in the Beloved." We are not only forgiven; we are also accepted. The thief who was saved at the time of his death was accepted by God as much as the apostles John, Peter, and Paul. In the eyes of God, whoever is in Christ is not only blameless but also without blemish. What is a blemish? Suppose that I cut my hand with a knife. When the wound has healed, a scar still remains. The damage no longer exists, but the scar proves that at one time there was an accident. The Bible tells us that God is able to save us to the point that we do not have any scars. God can save us to the extent that we will not be reminded of our sinfulness or be condemned about it anymore. God's work is always perfect. He does not merely forgive our sins; He also saves us and makes us righteous.</P><P>The blood is for redemption before God. This is the objective side. The blood purifies man's conscience (Heb. 9:14). Whenever we think of our sins, we can recall that the blood has washed us, and our heart will be at peace. This is the subjective effect of the blood. The Lord Jesus shed His blood to propitiate for our sins before God; this solved the problem of sins. The blood of the Lord Jesus also cleanses our conscience. What is the conscience? When we sin, there is a voice within us that points out our sin and makes us feel uneasy. The blood of the Lord is able to purify our conscience to the point that we no longer have a conscience burdened by sin. If there is a Christian who is constantly living under the accusation of his conscience, this is not humility. Rather, this indicates an unbelief in God's Word as well as a scorn of Christ's work. None of us should have a conscience under the accusation of our past sins. We should believe that the blood has washed all our sins away.</P><P>Once there was a woman who was over fifty years old. More than twenty years before, she had committed a most disgraceful sin, which lasted for a period of several months. Although she later repented, there was always condemnation within her that the sin she had committed could never be forgiven. Therefore, she had no peace at all. Then she met a preacher and told him how often she felt distressed for that sin and could not have peace. The preacher asked her if she had ever read 1 John 1:7, and she said that she had. Then the preacher said, "Let us read together the last clause of that verse: `The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.' Besides that particular sin, have you committed any other sins?" She said, "I have indeed committed other sins, but all of them have been cleansed by the blood. However, this sin remains uncleansed." He said, "My Bible says, `Cleanses us from every sin,' not `cleanses us from other sins.'" Then he read verse 9 with her: "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." After reading it, he asked, "How does such a faithful and righteous God forgive and cleanse your sins?" She said, "By confessing my sins." "Have you confessed?" he asked. She responded, "I have confessed tens and hundreds of times." Then he said, "Well, God says that if you confess your sins, He will forgive and cleanse. You have already confessed, and God has already forgiven and cleansed you." She said, "I do not feel so." He asked, "Does it really matter how you feel if God in heaven has forgiven and cleansed you?" She said, "No, it really does not matter." Later they prayed together, and he said to her, "Prayer is effective only if you believe what is in the Bible; if you do not believe it, it is futile even if you pray." He then entrusted her to God with a few simple words, asking God to make her believe that her sins had already been forgiven and cleansed. Her prayer declared, "O God, my problem before was that I could not believe in the work of Christ. Now I do believe in Christ's work. I believe in Your Word. Therefore, my sin has been forgiven and cleansed." When someone later met this sister and asked her how she was, she said, "Very fine indeed. Very fine!" Since many people have not seen this point clearly, they look daily at their sins instead of the sinner's Savior. They look daily at their sins instead of God's grace. They look daily at their sins instead of Christ's work. Those who are more concerned with their own sins are the ones who sin more readily. If we look away unto the Lord Jesus and believe in the work He has done, we will surely forget our sins. Our salvation hinges upon looking away unto the Lord and not upon our consideration of ourselves. The more we pay attention to a sin, the harder it will be to remove that sin. But if we look away to the Lord, we will be transformed from glory to glory, even into the Lord's image.</P><P>Our justification by resurrection is the positive side of the matter. He resurrected to impart a new life to us. This life is as righteous as the Lord. This life does not sin. When God sees this life, He reckons us as righteous. Christ's resurrection not only imparts a new life to us; it also hides our life with Christ in God (Col. 3:3). On the subjective side, Christ as our life is dwelling within us. We received this at the time of our regeneration. This life is the resurrection life. On the objective side, we appear before God in Christ and have a new position so that God sees us just as He sees Christ. The way God sees Christ is the same way He sees us. Therefore, when we come before God's presence, we do not have to tremble. We can say, "Hallelujah!" We may draw near to God with boldness and fullness of faith. We may say to God, "You are our Father, and we are Your children." It is God who justifies us; who is he who condemns? When we appear before God in Christ, nothing is more beautiful than we are. Hymn #299, stanzas 3 and 4 say,</P><P CLASS=HBODY>So nigh, so very nigh to God,<br>I cannot nearer be;<br>For in the person of His Son<br>I am as near as He.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>So dear, so very dear to God,<br>More dear I cannot be;<br>The love wherewith He loves the Son,<br>Such is His love to me.</P><P>The life within us is given to us by Christ. Our position before God is also given to us by Christ. So many Christians do not grow because they are under the accusation of their conscience, and they have no freedom before God. Once there is a hole in the conscience, faith leaks out. When we pray and our conscience is under accusation, our faith is weakened.</P><P>Our justification by the blood resolves our problem with sins. God looks upon us as though we have no sins. Our justification by resurrection means that Christ has become our life within. We occupy a new position in Christ before God, the position which Christ occupies before God.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION TWENTY-SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING CHRIST'S CRUCIFIXION</H1><P>There are two aspects to the crucifixion of Christ: being crucified by man and being crucified by God. Acts 2:23 and 36 and 3:15 speak of being crucified by men, while Isaiah 53:6 and 10 speak of being crucified by God. Which part of Christ's crucifixion was done by man and which part was done by God?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>When we read the Bible, we can clearly see that the crucifixion of Christ involves the matters of man crucifying Him and God crucifying Him. From the seven sentences spoken by the Lord on the cross, we can understand which part of the crucifixion was done by man and which part was done by God. According to human time, the crucifixion lasted for six hours. During the first three hours, the Lord spoke three sentences, and during the last three hours, He spoke four sentences. Why did He not speak more or less during the first three hours? If we read carefully, we realize that the first three hours of the crucifixion were the work of man, while the last three hours were the work of God.</P><P>During the first three hours, lasting from nine in the morning until noon (Mark 15:25), man was mocking, scourging, reproaching, crucifying, and railing at the Lord on the cross. All this was heaped upon Him by man.</P><P>In the last three hours, lasting from noon until three in the afternoon, the crucifixion was the work of God. We know this because from noon until three there was darkness over all the land. This was definitely beyond man's capacity. The veil of the temple was also suddenly split in two from top to bottom. This was also beyond man's capability. Furthermore, the earth was shaken, rocks were split, and even tombs were opened (Matt. 27:45, 51-52). All of these could not be the work of man. They were altogether the work of God.</P><P>During the first part of the Lord Jesus' crucifixion on the cross, man did everything that he could do. During the last part, God also did all that He could do. The first part of the crucifixion expressed all the hatred of man toward God. The last part revealed all the love of God toward man. Therefore, one might say that the cross is the meeting point of love and hatred.</P><P>Now let us look at the three sentences spoken by the Lord during the first three hours.</P><P>First, He said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (Luke 23:34). How could God forgive those who murdered an innocent person? How could the Lord even pray in such a way? If God answered this prayer, would He not become unrighteous? In order to answer this, we must be clear that the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross in order to bear the sin of the world. The righteous God could forgive our sins only by the cross because "without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness" (Heb. 9:22). Furthermore, only from His position on the cross could the Lord Jesus pray such a prayer. Otherwise, the Lord Jesus' prayer as well as God's forgiveness would have been unrighteous.</P><P>Second, He said, "Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" (Luke 23:43). How could such a thief enter into Paradise? If all the thieves were permitted to enter into Paradise, would it still be a Paradise? These, however are only man's considerations. In the eyes of God, not only are thieves barred from Paradise, but even the so-called good people are unqualified to enter because, in Adam, all have sinned (Rom. 5:12). The Lord Jesus was able to speak to the repentant thief in this way because He is the only Mediator between God and man (1 Tim. 2:5) and because He is the Lamb of God (John 1:29). Through the eternal Spirit, He offered Himself to God without spot or blemish. Therefore, His blood can purge man's conscience from dead works (Heb. 9:14). The thief in Paradise is no longer a thief, but one whose conscience has been purged from dead works. Today all who receive Him, that is, all who believe in His name, will have the same experience.</P><P>Third, He said, "Woman, behold, your son....Behold, your mother" (John 19:26-27). This verse shows us that because of the Lord's accomplishment on the cross, we have a new relationship with God and with man. We are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God. We have fellowship not only with God but also with one another. John was not the only one who could receive Mary as his mother according to the word of the Lord. Later, even Paul (Rom. 16:13) and all the saints throughout the ages also shared this kind of feeling. How marvelous it is that by having the same life, a new relationship is produced among all the saints.</P><P>After the Lord Jesus had spoken these three sentences, there was darkness over all the land. God heard the prayer of the Lord, and He laid all the sins of the world upon the Lord Jesus. God made Him who knew no sin become sin on our behalf. God not only saves us according to His grace; He also saves us according to His righteousness. God not only has mercy on us; He also paid the price for us and repaid everything we ever owed.</P><P>At about three in the afternoon, the Lord spoke four more sentences. Fourth, He said, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Matt. 27:46). Many martyrs, who experience man's persecution and severe punishment, do not show any sign of sorrow or self-pity. Rather, they feel that God is very near to them. Our Lord was obedient to God all His life. Therefore, if He was only crucified on the cross through the persecution of man, God should have been much nearer to Him! How could God ever forsake Him when man forsook Him? Thank and praise God! On the cross our Lord did not die a martyr's death; rather, He died bearing the sins of all mankind. God put our sins upon Him, and God crucified Him. After the Lord spoke the first three sentences, God heard the Lord Jesus' prayer and put all the sins of mankind upon Him. Then the Lord knew that God had forsaken Him.</P><P>Fifth, He said, "I thirst" (John 19:28). Thirstiness is a condition of hell, a characteristic of the suffering of hell. The rich man in Luke 16 was in the fire of Hades without a drop of water. There is no other place that causes more thirst than hell. At that moment the Lord suffered the punishment of hell on man's behalf and tasted death for every man because He bore our sins (Heb. 2:9).</P><P>Sixth, He said, "It is finished!" (John 19:30). This indicates that the work of redemption was finished. The Lord had borne the sins of man and received the penalty of sin for man.</P><P>Seventh, He said, "Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit" (Luke 23:46). Earlier the Lord had said, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" He said this because He was standing on the ground of bearing man's sins. But here He was able to say, "Father," because after the redemptive work was accomplished, His fellowship with the Father was instantly restored. The Lord laid down His life voluntarily, and He committed His life to God. He said, "No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again" (John 10:18). If He had not done so, not even a hundred crosses could have taken the Lord's life away.</P><P>Our sins have been taken away by the most righteous Lord. According to His righteousness, God can no longer choose to forgive or not forgive us; He must forgive us because Christ has already died and become the sin offering.</P><P>Since the Lord did not accomplish the work of redemption until His death on the cross, perhaps some will ask how He could have forgiven man's sins before His death. This is possible because God reckoned the cross as an accomplished fact even before Christ's death. John 3:15 says, "That every one who believes into Him may have eternal life." John 6:54 says, "He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life." These passages show us that even when the Lord was on the earth, everyone who believed in Him could have eternal life. Revelation 13:8 says, "The Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world." The Lord is the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world. Therefore, the church is not limited by space (for the Body of Christ is one), while the cross is not limited by time (for even in the Old Testament, God could forgive people). In the Old Testament, anyone who killed another person accidentally could flee to a city of refuge where no one could seize his life, and he would be free when the high priest died (Num. 35:25-28). This signifies that even before Christ's death, if anyone hid in Christ, he would be safe and free upon the death of Christ.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION TWENTY-EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING JOHN 19:30<br>AND COLOSSIANS 1:24</H1><P>John 19:30 says, "It is finished!" Colossians 1:24 says, "Fill up...that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ." What does it mean to be "finished," and what does it mean to be "lacking"?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>At first glance these two verses seem to contradict each other. But if you read them carefully, you will see the distinction between them.</P><P>In John 19:30, "It is finished" refers to the redemption of the Lord Jesus; it refers to the punishment which the Lord received on the cross, the suffering for sins which the Lord received from God's hand on the cross.</P><P>The term afflictions is sometimes translated as "tribulations" or "distresses." The "afflictions" in Colossians 1:24 refer to the afflictions received from human hands. No one can share the afflictions which Christ received from God's hand. The afflictions that Christ received from God have already been accomplished. But, at the same time, our experience of the afflictions which Christ suffered from man's hands is still lacking. This is the portion that every Christian should fill up.</P><P>Although the work of redemption has already been accomplished, many Christians have not clearly comprehended it. Some think that if they are good in their behavior, they are qualified to go to heaven and able to go boldly and confidently. But if they misbehave, they are not as bold, and they think that they can only crawl into heaven. Actually, there is no such thing! Suppose that the thief who was nailed on the cross did not die after he believed in the Lord. Suppose, instead, that he came down from the cross and lived for many more years. If, during that time, he accomplished ten times more work than Paul, loved ten times deeper than John, and saved ten times more people than Peter, would all of these works make any difference in whether he could go to heaven on the day of his crucifixion? Would they make him any more worthy? All those who know the grace of God would say that he would not be any worthier than before, because all of the qualifications for going to heaven were completely accomplished by the Lord. Among those who believe in the Lord, no one is unworthy, and no one is more worthy to go to heaven. Christ has accomplished the work of redemption. No one can add anything more to it. Even if a person becomes a so-called holy man, his qualifications for going to heaven are still based on what Christ gave to him when He said, "It is finished."</P><P>We should not be misled to think that believers cannot sin. No, definitely not. If a saved believer misbehaves, he is not disqualified from heaven, but he will not be able to enter the kingdom. Our behavior does not affect our entrance into heaven in any way. Even God cannot change this fact. We have been judged, and we have died because the Lord Jesus was nailed on the cross. God cannot be unrighteous. God in Christ has already accepted the death of Christ as our death, and He cannot judge or condemn us again. It is finished; this fact is unchangeable. But if we sin, we will be cast out of the kingdom and left outside of the glory of the kingdom.</P><P>There are two passages in Romans which specifically speak of God's glory. One says, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (3:23), and the other says, "Through whom also we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand and boast because of the hope of the glory of God" (5:2). We fall short of the glory of God because of sins; whereas we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God because of the blood. Whatever loss sin has incurred, the blood has replenished and replenished with added abundance. Because of the death of Christ, we can "boast because of the hope of the glory of God."</P><P>The redemptive work of Christ is finished, but there is still a lack of the afflictions of Christ. He has accomplished redemption, but does everyone know what He has accomplished? Many still do not know. Therefore, we should tell people what Christ has accomplished. Christ preached the gospel only to the people who contacted Him directly, and His preaching was limited only to those in that generation. His afflictions among mankind are still lacking. This is why we have to take the responsibility to preach today. When we do this, we will inevitably meet afflictions. Preaching the gospel will cost us our face. Even distributing a gospel tract is very embarrassing. Yet this is something we must bear. Christ has accomplished the work of redemption, but the preaching of this work of redemption is still lacking. Therefore, we must go and preach. </P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION TWENTY-NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING CHRIST'S DEATH</H1><P>What is the difference between Christ dying for us (Rom. 5:8) and Christ dying for our sins (1 Cor. 15:3)?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>The meaning of Christ dying for us is that Christ died for us as sinners. The purpose of His death was to save us, the sinners. We were gained and delivered from ourselves as a result of Christ's accomplishment for us.</P><P>The meaning of Christ dying for our sins is that Christ died for the sins which we, the sinners, have committed. The purpose of this was to remove the record of our sins and deliver us from the punishment and power of sin so that our sins could be forgiven and we could be freed from sin's dominion.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION THIRTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING 2 CORINTHIANS 5:21</H1><P>In God's redemption, do Christians exchange their position with Christ? In other words, did the righteous Christ become unrighteous and are unrighteous sinners made righteous (2 Cor. 5:21)?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>In God's redemption, Christians do not exchange their positions with Christ; rather, they are united to Christ. "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him" (2 Cor. 5:21).</P><P>There is no place in the Bible that says that Christians and Christ have changed positions. Although we often say that we were sinful and that we were saved only because Christ died instead of us, we need to know that this expression refers exclusively to what we personally attained. The question mentioned above concerns our position in "God's redemption." As far as our personal gain is concerned, it is true that Christ died for us. But in God's redemption, if we said that Christ only stood in the position of the sinners in order to die for us, it would make God unrighteous. Christ is clearly righteous; how can God condemn Him as unrighteous? We are clearly sinners; how can God reckon us as righteous? In God's redemption, Christ and we do not exchange positions; rather, we are united.</P><P>Let us read 2 Corinthians 5:21 again: "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf." This verse shows us that God caused the One who never sinned and who knew no sin to be made sin for us. Note that the verse says, "Made sin," and not "bear" or "carry" sin. If it said "bearing," there would be a possibility of not bearing. If redemption were only a matter of "carrying," then it could be accomplished by merely carrying something on the body. Christ, however, not only bore our sins or carried our sins on the cross; He was made sin. The Lord Jesus is united to us to such a degree that He not only bore or carried our sins, but He also was made sin. Therefore, when God judged Him, He judged sin. When God punished Him, He punished sin.</P><P>In God's way of redemption, we should understand three aspects: (1) God and man, (2) God for man, and (3) God in man. First, the union of God and man enabled God to accomplish redemption. Second, God accomplished redemption for man. Third, God worked what He accomplished into man. The Lord Jesus' incarnation is the union of God and man. This is the meaning of God and man. Because there was a union of God and man, the Lord Jesus was able to die for us, resurrect for us, and become the mighty Savior. In order for God to dwell in man, God sent His Holy Spirit from heaven. While He was on earth, the Lord was clothed with flesh. But now He is dwelling in us and is clothed with the Spirit. Therefore, some say that the Holy Spirit is the Lord Jesus Christ in another form. The Holy Spirit comes to work in us and accomplish all that God has accomplished in us. If there were not God and man, there could not have been God for man or God in man. If the Lord Jesus had not been born as a man, He could never have died. When He died on the cross, the Lord Jesus did not bear the sin of the world as a third party; He was made sin and died for us with the qualification of being a man. On one hand, God has laid our sins on the Lord, and therefore, the Lord bore our sins; but on the other hand, in God's way of redemption, God judged both us and sin when He judged the Lord Jesus. Today we thank God for the fact that Jesus Christ was made sin for us on the cross.</P><P>What is the result of Christ being made sin on our behalf? Do we become righteousness? No. Do we become righteousness in Him? No. Instead of these, we "become the righteousness of God in Him." We should not only pay attention to the words "in Him" but also to the words "the righteousness of God." Christ was not made sin on our behalf in order to make us righteous and no longer sinners. Rather, He was made sin in order to make us the righteousness of God in Himself. It was for the purpose of becoming the righteousness of God. Every saved Christian has become the righteousness of God. The righteousness of God saved us. God made Him (the Lord Jesus) sin. Since God judged the Lord Jesus, we have been judged, and sin has been judged. Therefore, God reckons us as righteous, but not because we are righteous. God's reckoning of us as the righteousness of God is purely an objective matter. If someone should say, "According to my observations, you are not so good," this would be true. But we are not made righteous in Him; rather, we have become the righteousness of God in Him. This proves that it is the righteousness of God that saves us. If we are clear on this point, then the number of problems that we encounter in our daily life will be greatly reduced. The Lord on the cross was equivalent to sin on the cross. There on the cross God condemned sin and solved the problem of sin. Therefore, we are set free.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION THIRTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE UNION</H1><P>When were we united with Christ on the objective side, and when were we united with Him on the subjective side?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>We were united with Christ objectively at the time Christ died on the cross: "One died for all, therefore all died" (2 Cor. 5:14). When Christ died He brought the whole world to the cross with Him. Therefore, all men died in Him.</P><P>We were united with Christ subjectively when we were regenerated in the Lord's resurrection. By reading Romans 6:3-5 and 8, we can see one thing: our subjective union with Christ is altogether in His resurrection. What does baptism signify? It signifies burial. When we are baptized, we are objectively declaring that we have died, because only dead people are buried. We acknowledge that our death is real. Therefore, we agree to our burial. Resurrection comes after a burial. When we rise up again after our burial, we are resurrected. In our daily life, we are not seeking death. Rather, we acknowledge that we have died in Christ, and we daily allow the resurrection life to be lived out through us. Romans 6 requires us to do one thing, which is to consecrate ourselves. Many people focus their attention on death. This is why they can never die. After we believe in the Lord, the first thing we should do is be buried, not die. We have to acknowledge our death instead of begging for death.</P><P>We should pay attention to another point. Suppose someone talks about the cross and says, "First, the Lord died on the cross for me; second, the Lord died on the cross in my place; and third, the Lord died on the cross with me." Is such a statement scriptural? Let us lay aside the first and second points and focus on the third point: the Lord died on the cross with me. Is it wrong to say this? If we search the entire New Testament, it does not mention that Christ died with me; instead, it says, "I am crucified with Christ" (Gal. 2:20), and "Through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world" (6:14). Just by reading these two verses, we should know that we died with Christ and not that Christ died with us. This is because our union with Christ's death is objective. Christ's death is accomplished once and for all. We died in His death. Saying that Christ died with us would be turning from the objective to the subjective side and would imply that Christ has to be offered up several times. For example, Christ dies with Mr. Chang today, and tomorrow He dies with Mr. Yu. If a thousand people believed in Him, He would need to die a thousand times. We must remember that the Bible only tells us the truth: "We have died with Christ," not "Christ died with us." Do not think that reversing the order is a trivial matter. By reversing the order, the truth is no longer the truth. The Lord's word must not be twisted or reversed.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION THIRTY-TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING OUR POSITION IN CHRIST</H1><P>Why does the Bible say that we are "in the Lord," "in Christ," and "in Christ Jesus," but never "in Jesus" or "in Jesus Christ"?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Although 1 Thessalonians 4:14 says in Chinese, "So also those who have fallen asleep in Jesus," it should be translated according to the Greek as follows: "So also those who have fallen asleep through Jesus." There is no place in the Bible where we can find a phrase such as in Jesus or in Jesus Christ. The Bible always says "in the Lord," "in Christ," or "in Christ Jesus." This matter is greatly related to redemption and us.</P><P>Jesus is the name the Lord received at His birth. It is His lowly name as a man. Christ is the name He received when He was anointed by God after His resurrection (Acts 2:36). It is His name in glory.</P><P>Jesus Christ means that the lowly Jesus is the One who is the Christ, while Christ Jesus means that the One who is now Christ is the One who was Jesus.</P><P>The Bible does not use the phrase in Jesus or in Jesus Christ because we are not united with the Lord in His living on the earth. We have no union with Him as the Son of Man. Jesus is His name as the Son of Man. He is the Man above all men. His virtues and beauty pertain to His being the Son of Man. We are not united with Him in such a life. The Bible never says that we share His sufferings on the earth. The meaning of Jesus is Savior. We are not united with Jesus, because we do not share in His work of saving men.</P><P>Saying "in the Lord," "in Christ," and "in Christ Jesus" indicates that Christ has resurrected from the dead and that God has made Him both Lord and Christ. Since we share in His resurrection, we also share in Christ Himself. God has put us in His resurrection. Our subjective experience is in His resurrection.</P><P>Jesus is an individual name, while Christ is both an individual and a corporate name. "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ" (1 Cor. 12:12). This verse is not speaking of Christ and the church, but simply of "Christ." The Head is Christ, and the Body is also Christ. This is the corporate Christ. The Bible only has the title "Christian," not "Jesusian." Christian means "Christ-man." In other words, a Christian is a part of Christ. There is only a "Christ-man," not a "Jesus-man." Jesus refers to His experience on the earth as the Son of Man; His life was miraculous and beyond man's reach. We are Christ-men. The Head is Christ; the Body is also Christ. If we realize what the word Christ means, we will know how deeply we are united with Him. The Head is Christ; so is the Body. If a person's little finger is broken off, he has a defect. If a Christian could perish, then Christ would be defective. But we can thank and praise God that Christ could never be defective. Once we are in Christ, we are in Christ forever. "That He [Christ] might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish" (Eph. 5:26-27).</P><P>The name Jesus refers to His own personal experience of God sending Him to be the Savior. For this reason, when the Bible refers to Him as a man, the title Jesus is used, but never Christ. However, after His resurrection, He is called either Christ or the Lord. This is to emphasize His resurrection and authority. Although He is addressed with the title Jesus in Acts and in the Epistles several times, these are special references to His humanity. Therefore, when we address Him, we should not simply call Him "Jesus" but "Lord Jesus."</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION THIRTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING THE TIME<br>OF OUR CRUCIFIXION</H1><P>At what moment were we crucified with Christ? Was it between the time He was put on the cross and the time He expired, or was it at the very moment He expired?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>If we understand question thirty-two, we can conclude that we were crucified with Christ at the moment He expired. Prior to His expiration, He was engaged in the work of redemption, bearing our sins, and dying for us. If we were crucified with Him during that time, we would have been participating in His redemption and, thereby, we would have become saviors. Saying this would be a great mistake.</P><P>Some say that since the Lord Jesus was on the cross for six hours and did not die instantly, we must also have been crucified with Him for six hours. If this were the case, we would have also participated in the Lord's redemption. This is absolutely not so. We died with Christ at the moment He expired. The only One who suffered was the Lord Himself, but the effect is ours. We thank and praise God!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION THIRTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING THE BLOOD AND THE CROSS</H1><P>What is the difference between the significance and function of the blood and the significance and function of the cross? Why does the Bible never say that we shed blood with the Lord but only that we were crucified with the Lord?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Because some may ask, "Since sins have been taken away before God, why is sin still with us?", we ought to pay attention to this question in order to eliminate any doubt.</P><P>Many places throughout the Bible tell us that the Lord shed His blood. Many other places tell us that the Lord was crucified. Are the significance and function of the blood the same as the significance and function of the cross? Are they interchangeable? For example, could we change "Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness" (Heb. 9:22) to "Without crucifixion is no remission"? Or could we change "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him" (Rom. 6:6) to "Knowing this, that our old man shed blood with Him"? If the significance and function of the blood are the same as that of the cross, then they are interchangeable. But if they are not interchangeable, then their significance and function must be different.</P><P>Then what is the significance and function of the blood, and what is the significance and function of the cross?</P><P>Let us look first at the matter of the blood. There are over four hundred references in the Bible to the blood. Why does God require the blood? Why does God need to slay whoever dares to come into His presence without the blood? Leviticus 17:11 says, "For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make propitiation for your souls; for it is the blood which, by the life, makes propitiation." This verse clearly tells us that the blood is for propitiation. Where is propitiation made? It is made upon the altar. The work of the blood is before God; it is not in us. The blood propitiates for us before God so that God considers our sins as having been taken away. However, it does not cleanse us from sin inwardly.</P><P>Perhaps some may ask, "Does not 1 John 1:7 tell us that `the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin'?" Yes it does, but we must remember that whenever the Bible mentions cleansing from sins by the blood, it always refers to a cleansing before God. The first part of this verse says, "But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another." Then it says, "And the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin." This cleansing is before God. The function of the blood is altogether a matter before God. God requires the blood. He requires that we come before Him with the blood.</P><P>Some may ask, "Does not Hebrews 9:14 say that His blood can purify man's conscience?" Yes it does, but we must realize that "purify" refers to the purifying of the conscience, not to the purifying of the sinful nature. Our sinful nature has never been purified by the blood. In the entire Bible, there is no mention of the blood purifying our old nature, nor does it mention the blood purifying the flesh. The blood only cleanses us from the sins that we have before God. The blood only purifies our conscience so that we may freely and boldly come before God. "And without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness" (v. 22). With the blood there is forgiveness of sins, and therefore, we have peace. "Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh" (10:19-20). The blood, not the cross, is brought to the heavens. The Bible tells us that the Lord Jesus shed His blood. We did not share in the Lord's shedding of the blood. The blood remits and takes away our sins before God. Let us hold fast to this fact.</P><P>Many people do not have freedom before God because they misunderstand the function of the blood; they assume that the blood is for cleansing away the sin within man. Therefore, they can never see the function and effect of the blood. The cleansing spoken of in 1 John 1:7 does not refer to the cleansing away of inward sin or to cleansing away the root of sin. Rather, it refers to the cleansing before God. God alone demands the blood, and only the blood of the Lord Jesus can satisfy God's heart. Therefore, we can freely draw near to God by the blood at any time. Whether we feel that our sins are great or small, rough or refined, forgivable or unforgivable, all these sins are cleansed away before God. "Though your sins are like scarlet,/They will be as white as snow" (Isa. 1:18). What does this mean? It means that every scar and trace of your sins can be erased just as if you never sinned. This refers to your condition before God. Although there is still nothing good within you, before God and in His eyes, your sins have been taken away.</P><P>When we read Numbers 20:2-9 and 21:4-9, we realize how bad the children of Israel were when they were in the wilderness. They sinned and murmured against God. Yet Numbers 23:21 says, "He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob; /Nor has He seen trouble in Israel./Jehovah their God is with them,/And the shout of a king is among them." This is true. We must note that there are two aspects to dealing with sin: one is before God, and the other is in us. The blood cleanses us of our sins before God so that God sees no unrighteousness in us.</P><P>Does the Bible ever say that our justification is because of the cross? No. Justification is through the blood. The blood is before Him; it enables God to justify us. What is this righteousness? It is the righteousness that makes us fit to dwell in heaven with God. The blood of the Lord Jesus enables us to have a standing in heaven so that we may dwell with God. We may boldly enter into heaven by the blood. God knows how valuable the blood is!</P><P>Leviticus 16:30 says, "For on this day propitiation shall be made for you to cleanse you; you shall be clean from all your sins before Jehovah." This plainly tells us that sins are removed before God, not within us. The blood only cleanses us of our sins before God. Within, the blood is limited to the cleansing of our conscience, so that we no longer sense the presence of sins and there is no more barrier between God and us. The blood removes the accusation that comes as a result of the individual sins we have committed. But the blood does not remove our consciousness of the root of sin. The Lord's death bore our sins before God; whereas His blood cleanses us before God. The blood is to propitiate for our sins; it does not remove our inward sinful nature.</P><P>The "sin" in "sin of the world" (John 1:29) is singular in number, and the "sin" in "cleanses us from every sin" (1 John 1:7) is also singular in number. Both refer to the taking away and cleansing of the problem of our sin before God. Neither the "takes away" in John 1:29 nor the "cleanses" in 1 John 1:7 can be interpreted as the taking away or cleansing of the root of sin. Both verses refer to the Lord's blood solving the problem of our sins. Before God, our sins have been taken away.</P><P>The significance and function of the cross is different from the significance and function of the blood. The blood is before God; whereas the cross is within us. The blood solves the problem of our sins; whereas the cross solves the problem of our old man. God not only gives us the blood, which gives us freedom before Him, but He also gives us the cross, through which we deal with our corrupted self and flesh.</P><P>The flesh is dealt with by the cross. Galatians 5:24 says, "But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts." Does this say that the blood cleanses the flesh? No. It says that the flesh has been crucified on the cross. Cleansing the flesh would not be adequate. Suppose that both a living child and a clay doll become dirty. After the child is washed, he is clean. But no matter how much the doll is washed, it will never be clean, because it is clay within and without. The corrupted flesh is just like a clay doll. It is so corrupted that even the Lord's blood cannot wash it. The only way to deal with the flesh is to crucify it.</P><P>As far as our sins are concerned, they are cleansed away by God with the blood. As far as our flesh is concerned, it is crucified by Him on the cross. We cannot rely on the cross to cleanse us of our sin, nor can we rely on the blood to cleanse our flesh. Romans 6:6 says, "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves." Being crucified with Him causes the body of sin to be annulled. In the original Greek the word annulled is the same as "make useless" in Luke 13:7. Therefore, annulling does not annihilate the body of sin but makes it useless. The word annulled can also be translated "unemployed." Once God crucified the old man, the body which was subject to sin became useless; it is no longer a slave to sin and is unemployed. Christians ought not to sin; but the way to be victorious is based upon the Word of God and not upon our own concept. Today we do not need to beg for God to do the work of sanctification for us. Instead, we need to thank Him for having crucified us on the cross. The way is not believing that God will do something, but believing that God has already done something. Promises are obtained through prayer, but facts are obtained only through believing. The old man was crucified with the Lord; this is an accomplished fact which we only have to believe. Once we believe this fact, no temptation can touch us. The only way to be victorious is to abide in the Lord by faith and abide in the Lord's accomplished fact. If we depart from this, we will stop our progress.</P><P>Galatians 2:20 says, "I am crucified with Christ." It does not say that I have shed my blood with Christ. Instead, it says that the wicked "I" has been crucified with Christ. We need to see clearly that the blood deals with sin; whereas the cross deals with the flesh. The blood secures forgiveness for us and rids us of the record of sins; however, the cross sets us free and delivers us so that we are no longer under the power of sin. The blood is related to salvation; whereas the cross is related to victory. The blood settles the problem of our sins; whereas before God the cross settles the problem of our person. Just as we believe in the blood, we should also believe in the cross. It would be good if we practiced this every day.</P><P>Romans 6:11 says, "So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus." Verse 13 says, "Neither present your members as weapons of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as alive from the dead, and your members as weapons of righteousness to God." All we need to do now is: (1) daily stand upon verse 11, believing that we have already died and that the body of sin is unemployed, and (2) present our members as weapons of righteousness to God. If our presenting is inadequate, we will still fall. If we do not do what God requires of us, we will still fall. On the one hand, we should believe, and on the other hand, we should obey. If we believe in what God has accomplished and obey what He demands, we will spontaneously be victorious.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION THIRTY-FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING BELIEVING AND PERISHING</H1><P>The Bible says that the Lord Jesus died for everyone. Will a person perish if he does not believe in the Lord Jesus?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>"For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died" (2 Cor. 5:14). The "One" in this verse refers to Christ. The "all" in "One died for all" refers to all men. Since the Lord Jesus' death is a death for all, it might seem that a person will not have to die even if he does not believe in the Lord Jesus. But the Bible also says, "He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God" (John 3:18). How do we explain this in view of God's righteousness and God's administration? Let us consider this matter.</P><P>Matthew 20:28 says, "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many." First Timothy 2:6 says, "Who gave Himself as a ransom for all." What is the difference between "many" and "all" in these two verses? Matthew says that He died "for many." "Many" refers to many people; it includes all those who believe. The Lord Jesus died for and on behalf of the many who believe in Him. First Timothy says that He gave His life as a ransom for all. This refers to the Lord Jesus as a ransom prepared for all men. The Lord Jesus' death is for believers as well as on the behalf of believers. But His death is only for sinners and not on the behalf of sinners. The extent of His death on behalf of men is limited before God. The Lord Jesus, on the one hand, died for and on the behalf of the many; on the other hand, He died for all men but not on behalf of all men.</P><P>"One died for all" (2 Cor. 5:14) means that the death of the Lord Jesus Christ is prepared for all men to apply; it does not mean that the Lord died on behalf of all men. When the Bible refers to all or all men, it only uses on behalf of. This means that the provision of the Lord's death is available to all men so that all men will have a chance to be saved. But when the Bible refers to the believers, it uses both for as well as on behalf of. Therefore, the death of the Lord Jesus is most righteous. If He had not died this way, there would be no righteousness. Whoever is in the Lord Jesus Christ considers His death as a death on their behalf. But whoever is outside of the Lord Jesus Christ does not consider His death as a death on their behalf; they can only consider that the Lord Jesus has died for them. This can be likened to a meal that was prepared for them that they did not eat.</P><P>First John 2:2 says, "And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world." Christ became the propitiation not only for us who believe, but also for those who do not believe. We, however, have to be clear that the word "for" in this verse does not mean "on behalf of." God's salvation is already prepared. But not until we receive this salvation does God reckon us as one of the "many." Christ died for all men. His death was a provision for all men. Yet His death is not on behalf of all men. If a person does not believe in Christ, he will surely perish. This is man's responsibility before God. </P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION THIRTY-SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING JOHN 1:12-13<br>AND REVELATION 22:17</H1><P>How can we reconcile John 1:12-13, which says that receiving life is not of the "will of man," and Revelation 22:17, which says that whosoever will can take life?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Since ancient times, this question has been debated by many theologians. One school claims that salvation is wholly a matter of man's will, whereas another school claims that salvation is wholly a matter of God's will. We must realize that there are often two sides to God's truth. If we are not careful, we can become unbalanced. There is a tendency for man to hold on to one extreme or the other.</P><P>Is the matter of salvation entirely a matter of man's will or God's will? Actually, it involves both aspects. Without God's will to save, no one could be saved. At the same time, if man is not willing to be saved, God has no way even though He has the will. Therefore, not only does God have to be willing, but man must also be willing. The Lord Jesus said, "How often I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you would not!" (Luke 13:34). These are the two sides of God's truth. It takes a willingness on both sides. With only one side, salvation cannot be accomplished. If we want to know the truth, we should not lay hold of only one side of the truth. When Satan tempted the Lord, he said, "It is written," but the Lord replied, "Again, it is written." No doubt it is written, but we must also pay attention to what is written again. Just laying hold of one or even a few verses to prove a side of the truth is inadequate. We must realize that there are many verses which confirm the other side of the truth. For example, once Christians are saved, they remain saved forever. This is one side of the truth. At the same time, Christians who sin after their salvation and do not repent will still be punished. Even though they will not pass through the second death, the Bible says that they will suffer the hurt of the second death. This is also the truth.</P><P>Some have asked why the Bible says, on the one hand, that whosoever will may take the water of life freely and whosoever believes in the Lord Jesus should not perish but have eternal life and, on the other hand, that God predestinated man to be saved? Someone has given a very good answer that the word "Whosoever" is written on the outside of the gate of heaven meaning "whosoever will may enter." But once the gate has been entered, we can turn around and see that "You are predestinated" is written on the inside of the gate. This statement expresses the two sides of God's truth. Our experience can confirm this. When I first believed in the Lord, all I did was believe. After believing in Him, I looked back and wondered why I was saved when there were so many others who were better than I who were not saved. I was ignorant and did not know why it happened. I could only say that my salvation was predestinated by God.</P><P>No matter who we are, as long as we believe, we will be saved. This is the word for unbelievers. For the believers the word is God's selection and God's predestination. It is a big mistake to speak a word to unbelievers which is meant for believers. The Lord told His disciples, "You did not choose Me, but I chose you" (John 15:16). We cannot say this to the unbelievers.</P><P>Once a student of theology went to a servant of God and asked, "The Bible says God predestinated man to salvation. But when I preach, sometimes I look into someone's face and wonder, `What if God has not predestinated this one to be saved and yet I convince him to be saved?'" The servant of God replied, "Just keep on preaching. If you are able to persuade him to be saved, he must have been predestinated by God."</P><P>We should realize that God tells believers that their salvation is predestinated in order to create a thankful heart in them. When I realize that, even though there are still many unbelievers, I am saved, I can only say that God has chosen me from among the millions. Hallelujah! I am saved not because of my own merit but because God has saved me. All I can do is thank Him!</P><P>Revelation 22:17 is spoken to unbelievers, and John 1:12-13 is spoken to believers. Our salvation is altogether God's doing and not our own working. In this way the truth is balanced.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION THIRTY-SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING LUKE 10:25-37</H1><P>Does Luke 10:25-37 indicate that a person inherits eternal life because he loves the Lord his God with all his heart, with all his soul, with all his strength, with all his mind, and by loving his neighbor as himself? If so, is not inheriting eternal life dependent upon works?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>The Bible tells us that eternal life depends upon our believing and not upon our works. The entire New Testament uses the word believe more than five hundred times. When we believe, we have eternal life; when we believe, we are saved; and when we believe, we are justified, etc. In Luke 10 a certain lawyer asked, "What should I do to inherit eternal life?" The Lord said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read it?" The lawyer replied, "You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind, and your neighbor as yourself." Then the Lord said to him, "You have answered correctly; do this, and you shall have life." The law teaches two things: to love God and to love man. Since these are altogether works, is not inheriting eternal life dependent upon works? If this story ended at verse 28, it would be very difficult for us to explain how to inherit eternal life. But thank and praise the Lord that this story continues through verse 37.</P><P>The lawyer said, "And who is my neighbor?" By saying this, he meant that he knew God but did not know who his neighbor was. Then the Lord spoke about a certain man who went down to Jericho and fell among robbers. A certain priest came down that way and did not save him. A Levite passed by that way and did not save him either. But a certain good Samaritan saved him to the uttermost. In verse 36, the Lord asked the lawyer, "Which of these three, does it seem to you, has become a neighbor to him who fell into the hands of the robbers?" We must note the lawyer's question in verse 29: "And who is my neighbor?" and the Lord's question in verse 36: "Which of these three, does it seem to you, has become a neighbor to him who fell into the hands of the robbers?" By His question, the Lord meant, "You are the one who fell among the robbers, so now which one of these is your neighbor?" He said, "The one who showed mercy to him." Then the Lord said, "Go, and you do likewise." This shows us that the Lord did not ask the lawyer to be a good Samaritan; rather, He wanted the lawyer to know that his neighbor was a good Samaritan. In other words, it was the Samaritan who saved him. More explicitly, the good Samaritan was the Savior of the lawyer.</P><P>The one who fell among the robbers was a sinner. Neither the priest nor the Levite could be his savior. Only the good Samaritan was his savior. The sinner's neighbor is the sinner's Savior. Loving the neighbor is loving the Savior. Having eternal life depends upon a Savior; it does not depend upon ourselves trying to be a savior. Many mistakenly consider this parable to be a lesson in treating people well. The Lord never said that we have to be a savior to the one who fell among the robbers. Rather, He said that we are the ones who have fallen among the robbers. The good Samaritan who saved us is our neighbor, and we should love Him. We are those who fell among the robbers. The One whom we did not know came to save us. The lawyer asked who his neighbor was. The Lord answered him by saying that the lawyer had fallen among the robbers and that his neighbor was the One who saved him.</P><P>We love the Lord because we have eternal life; we do not love the Lord in order to obtain eternal life. First there is the relationship of a neighbor, then the loving affection. This portion of the Word shows us the following items: (1) man is fallen; (2) man cannot save himself; (3) the Savior has come; and (4) if we receive His salvation, we will surely be saved and love Him. The mistake of many is that they themselves want to be the savior and are ignorant of the gospel of grace. We need to know that the Lord wants us to love the good Samaritan who is the Lord Himself.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION THIRTY-EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING LUKE 16</H1><P>In the story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16, was the rich man's perdition a result of enjoying good things in his lifetime? Was Lazarus' salvation a result of suffering evil things in his lifetime, or were there other reasons?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Some say that the rich man's perdition was a result of enjoying good things in his lifetime and that Lazarus' salvation was a result of suffering in his lifetime. They say this because of the words which were spoken by Abraham to the rich man (Luke 16:25). But is this really the case? In verse 25 Abraham was comparing the differences between these two before and after their death. Abraham did not come to the basic reason for their perdition and salvation until verse 29, which says, "But Abraham said, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them." From this we can see that the rich man's perdition was due to not obeying the words of Moses and the prophets, whereas Lazarus' salvation was a result of heeding the words of Moses and the prophets.</P><P>What are the words of Moses and the prophets? After the Lord Jesus resurrected, He was walking with the two disciples who were on their way to Emmaus. "And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He explained to them clearly in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself" (Luke 24:27). Verses 44-46 also say, "And He said to them, These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled. Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures; and He said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day." The words of Moses and the prophets were the words spoken by the Lord Jesus. In other words, the rich man perished because he had rejected the Savior who died and rose for him. Lazarus was saved because he received the Savior who died and rose for him.</P><P>God has given us the Bible. Since we can believe the words of the Scripture, He will not send a man from the dead to preach the gospel. God has been hiding Himself. He does it most marvelously. God has been hiding Himself to the extent that man thinks that there is no God. Even though man commits sin and evil, God does not punish him by instantly striking him to death with thunder and lightning. Even if man blasphemes God, He still does not instantly punish him. God does not arrange all the stars in the heavens into words that explicitly tell man that he has sinned, thereby proving that there is a God in this universe. Today God does not use spectacular ways to express Himself. He simply wants man to believe His Word.</P><P>"But he [Abraham] said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead" (Luke 16:31). This is a revelation from God. This revelation tells us that if people do not believe the words of Moses and the prophets, it would be futile even if someone were raised from the dead. Therefore, if people do not accept the testimony of the Bible, they will not believe even if someone rises from the dead.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION THIRTY-NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING ROMANS 4 AND JAMES 2</H1><P>Romans 4 says that Abraham was justified by faith, and James 2 says that Abraham was justified by works. How do we explain these two kinds of justification? How are they related to one another?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>The Scripture speaks of two kinds of justification: one is justification by faith, and the other is justification by works. We can prove this by the following verses:</P><P>Acts 13:39 says, "And from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified." Romans 3:28 says, "For we account that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law." These verses by Paul clearly show us that justification is by faith.</P><P>First Corinthians 4:4 says, "For I am conscious of nothing against myself; but I am not justified in this, but He who examines me is the Lord." The primary difference between this verse and the two previous verses is that it refers to being rewarded before the judgment seat of Christ. The meaning of justification in this verse is a reward for good works. This verse is also by Paul. He speaks of justification by faith, on one hand, and justification by works, on the other hand.</P><P>The Bible speaks of the matter of reward when referring to justification by works and also mentions justification by works in the midst of justification by faith. Let us read about this.</P><P>We know that the books of Romans and Galatians speak of justification by faith, whereas the book of James speaks of justification by works. Some may think that Paul's words about justification by faith alone were not fully adequate; therefore, James had to fill up the lack by speaking about justification by works. But this concept is not accurate, because the books of Romans and Galatians had not been written when James wrote his Epistle.</P><P>In Romans Paul tells us that justification is by faith. He feared that some might not know what God had done, what Christ had accomplished, and how effective the precious blood was. They might have thought that just believing was insufficient and that there was an additional need for man's works in order to be saved. Therefore, Paul used the case of Abraham to show that justification is by faith. James, however, also used the case of Abraham in speaking about justification by works. Consequently, we can see that there is a close relationship between justification by faith and justification by works. Paul and James actually spoke about the same thing; their words are not contradictory. Let us see their relationship to each other and how these two portions of Scripture are connected.</P><P>Let us first come to Romans 4.</P><P>Verses 2 and 3 say, "For if Abraham was justified out of works, he has something to boast in, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? `And Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness.'" Verses 9 and 10 say, "Is this blessing then upon the circumcision only, or also upon the uncircumcision? For we say, Faith was accounted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was it accounted? While he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision." This portion of the Word tells us that even before Abraham was circumcised, he was justified by faith. The Jews regarded circumcision as the most important act. In the eyes of the Jews, uncircumcised Gentiles were as swine and dogs. Yet before Abraham was circumcised, he was justified by faith.</P><P>Verse 11 says, "And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those in uncircumcision who believe, that righteousness might be accounted to them also." Circumcision is like a seal stamped by God, which declares that one is justified by faith and that nothing will change this fact. The reason God required Abraham to be circumcised was not so that He could justify Abraham by this act; a seal was stamped on him in order to declare that nothing would change the matter of his justification by faith. Even if Abraham had not offered up Isaac later, he still would have been justified by faith. Therefore, we can be assured that once we are justified by faith, we are securely justified.</P><P>Verse 12 says, "And the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision." This shows that being circumcised required faith, because Abraham was justified by faith before he was circumcised.</P><P>Romans proves that a sinner cannot be justified by the works of law. Galatians proves that a believer cannot be sanctified by the works of law. We are both justified by faith and sanctified by faith. If we have begun by the Spirit, how can we be perfected by the flesh? In any case, the seal has been stamped, and those who are of faith are blessed together with believing Abraham.</P><P>Now let us come to James 2:</P><P>Verse 14 says, "What is the profit, my brothers, if anyone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?" What was James's intention in writing these words? Who was he speaking to? He wrote these words because some were saying that they had faith but not works. If he did not stop these people, the church would have been greatly affected. Faith must be kept before God and not vainly boasted of before man. Faith must be accompanied by works. If anyone says he has faith and does not have works, that kind of faith cannot save him. The word save in the Scripture has several meanings. For example, Paul said, "For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ" (Phil. 1:19). Was not Paul saved? "Salvation" in this verse does not refer to receiving eternal life by those who believe, but rather to Paul's release from prison. In 2 Corinthians 1:10 Paul said, "Who has delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us; in whom we have hoped that He will also yet deliver us." Some think that this refers (1) to the Lord's death on the cross which delivered us from the punishment of our sins in the past, (2) to Christ in heaven as our Mediator delivering us from the authority of sin in the present, and (3) to His coming back again in the future to save our body. This is not what Paul meant. The salvation spoken of here refers to the Lord's delivering the body from affliction. By reading the context, it is clear that affliction came to Paul's company while they were in Asia. They were excessively burdened that they despaired even of living. Yet the Lord delivered them out of this situation. Paul believed that the Lord would deliver them out of their present and future affliction. James's reference to the word save means to profit others in their environment. This is made clear by the following verses.</P><P>James 2:15 and 16 say, "If a brother or sister is without clothing and lacks daily food, and any one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, yet you do not give them the necessities of the body, what is the profit?" The "one" in these verses is one who vainly said that he had faith, yet he was not supplying food and clothing to the needy brothers and sisters. He vainly said to them, "Go in peace." Being saved in these verses is not a matter of going to heaven in the future, but a matter of being physically warmed and fed in this age. James implied that it is not adequate just to talk and believe without also meeting the needs of the saints.</P><P>Verse 17 says, "So also faith, if it does not have works, is dead in itself." This is James's conclusion. He meant that if you believe that the brothers and sisters will be warmed and fed but do not give them the things they need, this kind of faith without works is not a living faith but dead. A living faith is believing in the heart that the loving God will not allow the brothers and sisters to be lacking in food or clothing and, at the same time, being enabled by this faith to supply the things they need.</P><P>Verse 18 says, "But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works." There is always someone to refute those who vainly say that they have faith. They will ask, "If you say that you have faith, how is your faith manifested? You only say this with your mouth. But when you encounter difficulties, you are not even willing to sacrifice a single hair for the sake of others. Where is your faith? You pretend to others that you believe, but you have no faith. If you have faith, why do you not give all that you have to the needy saints? They are naked with no clothes to wear, and they lack in daily food and drink. They do not even have anything to eat today. At least you still have clothing to wear and food to eat. Why do you not give all that you have to them? You say that you have faith, but what will you do to show us that you have faith? Your faith is only vain talking. Your faith is dead and not profitable to the needy ones at all. But I have works. My faith is proved by giving the brothers and sisters the things that are needful to them. I believe that God will not let us be short in food and clothing. And since the brothers and sisters are in need, I give all that I have to them. My works are according to my faith. My works are the evidence of my faith. I will show you my faith by my works. Even though you said that you have faith, where is the evidence of your faith? What are you going to do to show us your faith?"</P><P>Verse 19 says, "You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe and shudder." The people of Israel believe there is one God and rightly so, but the devil also believes that there is one God, and yet he still remains a devil. James indicates that faith without works is like the devil who, even though he believes in God, is still the devil.</P><P>Verse 20 says, "But are you willing to know, O vain man, that faith without its works is useless?" Vain man is another name for those who vainly say they have faith. We can say that this kind of man actually has no faith. Those that supply others in a practical way can show their faith to others by their works. Thus, there is first faith, then works. Genuine faith must be accompanied by genuine works. The one who vainly says that he has faith, yet has no works, shows that his faith is dead. His heart before God is not proper, so his faith is dead.</P><P>Verse 21 says, "Was not Abraham our father justified by works in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?" If James had not referred to this instance of Abraham, some might have considered that he was wrong, after reading the books of Romans and Galatians. Since Paul spoke of justification by faith, they might have assumed that just believing is enough and there is no need for any works. James meant that even though Abraham was no doubt justified by faith, he also was justified by works. James does not overthrow Abraham's justification by faith; rather, he proves that Abraham's faith was not without works because he offered up Isaac. Abraham's works were the evidence of his faith. Abraham was not only justified by faith; he was also justified by works. Instead of overturning justification by faith, James actually strengthens it by using justification by works to prove what true faith is. Abraham's offering up of Isaac on the altar was a work, and this work was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness. But what kind of work was it? It was a work of faith. "By faith Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac; indeed he who gladly received the promises was offering up his only begotten, of whom it was said, `In Isaac shall your seed be called'; counting that God was able to raise men even from the dead, from which he also received him back in figure" (Heb. 11:17-19). In using the offering up of Isaac, James shows us that true faith must also have works. Abraham gladly received the promises of God; he believed in what God had told him: "In Isaac shall your seed be called" (v. 18). Eliezer was not the one, nor was Ishmael. Even if Sarah bore him another son, he would not have been the one either. Isaac alone was the heir of the inheritance and promises. God was testing Abraham to see how his heart was toward God and how real his faith was. God required him to offer up Isaac, the one appointed to be his heir, on the altar, even to be slain and burned. If Abraham truly loved God and was willing to offer up everything to Him and burn Isaac, how could God's promise be fulfilled and accomplished? If he wanted to fulfill God's promise, he could not comply with God's request. According to man, these two are contradictory and cannot be reconciled. However, with a true and living faith these two are not contradictory; they are reconcilable. God made the promise, and God also required the offering. God can never contradict Himself. Between fulfilling the promise and offering Isaac, there is another way, the way of resurrection. "Counting that God was able to raise men even from the dead." Abraham's faith said, "Even though I slay Isaac and offer him as a burnt offering, I still believe Your promise, `In Isaac shall your seed be called,' will be fulfilled because You will resurrect Isaac from the dead." Thus, when he offered up Isaac, he went with a determined heart. He actually bound Isaac up, raised his knife, and was about to slay him. His heart toward God was absolute, without any reservation. His heart was firm and void of doubt in believing God. Then the angel of the Lord called to him and said, "Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him," and he "received him back in figure." Abraham's willingness to offer up his only begotten son was a work of faith. This is justification by works.</P><P>James 2:22 says, "You see that faith worked together with his works, and by these works faith was perfected." "You see" means that this verse is a continuation of the preceding verse. Because Abraham offered up Isaac on the altar and because this constituted his being justified by works, we can see that faith runs parallel to works. In other words, faith and works operate together. Abraham's work was produced from his faith, "and by these works faith was perfected." A faith that has not yet passed the test is undependable. By Abraham's offering up of Isaac, his faith was proven and perfected.</P><P>Verse 23 says, "And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, `And Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness'; and he was called the friend of God." Abraham believed God, and his believing was reckoned unto him as righteousness. This is recorded in Genesis 15. What is the relationship between the events in Genesis 15 and the offering up of Isaac in Genesis 22? James says that the offering up of Isaac was justification by works. Why then does he refer to justification by faith in Genesis 15? James says, "And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, `And Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness.'" Justification by works fulfills justification by faith. It seems that justification by faith is a prophecy, and justification by works is the fulfillment of that prophecy. One who has faith must also have works, because works demonstrate the reality of faith. Because of Abraham's belief in God, God reckoned him as righteous and called him His friend. Consequently, Abraham had the work of offering up Isaac. By offering up Isaac, Abraham's work became the fulfillment of his faith in God. In other words, Abraham's offering up of Isaac demonstrated his faith in God.</P><P>James 2:24 says, "You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith only." A man is not only justified by faith but also by works because Genesis 22 is the fulfillment of Genesis 15, because works are the evidence of faith, because faith without works is dead, and because faith is made perfect by works. We need to notice that James does not say that a man is justified by works and not by faith; rather, a man is justified by works and not just by faith. James meant that after being justified by faith, we need to prove and perfect what we have by our justification by works just as Abraham was justified by faith and then by works through God's testing.</P><P>Verse 25 says, "And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works in that she received the messengers and sent them out by a different way?" James first cited an excellent person such as Abraham, who was not only justified by faith but also by works. Then he cited a bad woman such as Rahab the harlot, who was also justified by works because she received the messengers and sent them out by a different way. What kind of work is this work? Hebrews 11:31 tells us, "By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who were disobedient, since she had received the spies with peace." This work is the work of faith. Faith and works are inseparable; they are two sides of one thing. What is called faith in Hebrews is called works in James. Works are the evidence of faith, whereas faith is the source of works. If one says he has faith yet does not have the works of faith, his faith is dead. Therefore, where there is justification by faith, there must also be justification by works.</P><P>James 2:26 says, "For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead." From James 2:14 onward, the relationship between faith and works is discussed. There is a kind of faith that is without works, vain, superficial, and dead. However, there is another kind of faith that has works and is living. Works prove and perfect faith. James used the cases of Abraham and Rahab as evidence to prove this point. Finally, he used one illustration: "For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead." A living faith must have works, because faith without works is dead just as the body without the spirit is dead.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FORTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING THE THREE PARABLES<br>IN LUKE 15</H1><P>Why does Luke 15 use three parables? Is not one adequate?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>There are three parables in Luke 15 that speak of something being "lost." The first parable concerns a lost sheep; the second, a lost coin; and the third, a lost son. After reading this chapter, many wonder why three parables are used to typify a sinner when only one should be sufficient. We must realize, however, that the Lord's intention in speaking these parables was not to talk about the lost ones; rather, His emphasis was on God's treatment of a lost one. If the Lord was only concerned about man's lost condition, one parable would have been sufficient. However, His focus was on how God treats a lost one; therefore, all three parables were necessary. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit-the Triune God-each have a specific work on the lost one. These three parables clearly portray to us the three aspects of God's work.</P><P>Can the sequence of these three parables be rearranged? No. If they were randomly rearranged, the gospel would not be in the proper order, because these three parables speak about the sequence of God's plan of redemption. The first parable concerns the Lord Jesus coming to do the good Shepherd's work. John 10 tells us that a good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep (v. 11). Following this, the Lord told the parable of a woman seeking for the lost coin. There is a difference between the good shepherd looking for the sheep and the woman seeking for the coin. The good shepherd looked for the sheep outside the house, and the Lord Jesus left the Father's house to come to the world to look for us. The woman sought for the lost coin within her house. She lit her lamp, swept the house, and sought diligently. The woman typifies the Holy Spirit. First, the Lord Jesus came to accomplish redemption; then the Holy Spirit came into us to enlighten us so that we might receive the Lord Jesus' accomplished redemption. The Bible reveals that God has two gifts for us, not just one. God gave us His Son, and He also gave us the Holy Spirit. Some preachers make the mistake of preaching only half of the truth. They only tell people, "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life" (John 3:16) and neglect the words spoken by the Lord Jesus: "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever" (14:16). God not only sent the Lord Jesus as a good Shepherd to seek for us, but He also sent the Holy Spirit to enlighten us. The first parable does not mention the lamp. The second parable mentions the lamp. The first parable speaks of searching outside the house. The second parable speaks of searching within the house. The Lord Jesus went outside the house; that is, He went to the world to find the lost sheep. The Holy Spirit is in the house-within us-enlightening us with the lamp to seek diligently for the lost coin. The last parable is of a father waiting at home for the return of his son. The Savior has come, and the Holy Spirit has come to seek so that the Lord's accomplished redemption will not be in vain. God is waiting at home for the son to return so that the Holy Spirit's accomplishment will not be in vain.</P><P>Taking away the first or second parable would make the other parables inadequate. If the good Shepherd did not come to lay down His life for the sheep, redemption would not have been accomplished. If the Holy Spirit did not enlighten men, none would be convicted concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8). Although some may be partially convicted concerning their sins, without the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit, they would not be thoroughly convicted concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.</P><P>Without the good Shepherd laying down His life for the sheep, it would not have been possible for the Father to take in the prodigal son when he returned home. The enlightening work of the Holy Spirit is based on the Lord's death. If the Lord had not died, the heavenly Father could not have forgiven man's sins. Otherwise, God would be unrighteous. We must lay hold of this fact: God's forgiveness of sins is His righteousness. God loves us. Nevertheless, God's love comes through His righteousness. If this were not so, God would be unrighteous, act contrary to His righteous nature, and be only tolerant of us. Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins. If forgiveness could be obtained without the Lord's blood, there would be no need of a Savior. Then how are we saved? Even though we have sins, the Savior has truly borne our sins. Therefore, we can boldly come before the presence of God and please Him. If we did not have a Savior, we would never have peace in our conscience. Since the Lord Jesus has died and accomplished redemption, the heavenly Father is waiting to receive us. When the prodigal son returned home, his father did not have a rebuking word or a word exhorting him to repent, because the Savior had accomplished redemption for him, and the Holy Spirit had enlightened him. As a result, his sins were forgiven and washed by the blood.</P><P>Even though the Lord Jesus has died and the heavenly Father is waiting at home, no prodigal son would be able to return home without the enlightening of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit convicts man of sin, causing him to regret his unbelief. The Holy Spirit convicts man of righteousness, causing him to question why he has not received the Lord who is resurrected, ascended, and well-accepted by God. The Holy Spirit convicts man of judgment, causing him to question why he follows Satan who has been judged and is no longer his master. This is all done by the Holy Spirit. Therefore, we should believe in what the Lord has accomplished and also pay attention to what the Holy Spirit will accomplish.</P><P>One group of people only stresses what the Holy Spirit will accomplish, neglecting what Christ has already accomplished. Another group emphasizes what Christ has already accomplished, neglecting what the Holy Spirit will accomplish. Those who emphasize what Christ has accomplished say that Christ has died, resurrected, and accomplished everything and that the work of the Holy Spirit is merely to guide us to the truth, meaning that He only informs men that Christ has died, resurrected, and entered into glory. Those who emphasize what the Holy Spirit will accomplish say that the Holy Spirit must specifically work within us so that we will have a special experience. Each of these two views is biased. A bird has two wings. If we clip off one wing, it cannot fly. Each of these two views clip off one of the bird's wings. If a person only focuses on what Christ has accomplished, he will not have any experience. On the other hand, if a person only focuses on the work of the Holy Spirit, he will lack a proper foundation because the work of the Holy Spirit is based on what Christ has accomplished.</P><P>In 2 Corinthians 13:14 Paul says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." God's heart is love. God purposed to save man. Love is something within. When it is expressed, it is grace. The outward expression of love is grace, and the inward reality of grace is love. Therefore, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is spoken of first because redemption was accomplished by Christ. God loves, and the love of God in the person of Christ results in grace. The Holy Spirit conveys Christ's accomplishments into us. This is the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit does not impart anything of Himself; rather, He flows what Christ has accomplished into us. It is impossible to receive the Lord's grace without the Holy Spirit. And if we only want the Holy Spirit without receiving what Christ has accomplished, it is also impossible to receive the Holy Spirit. A water pipe allows water to flow. Neither a pipe without water nor water without a pipe is effective. Therefore, the three parables in Luke 15 are not repetitious; they are a portrait of the sequence in God's way of redemption. Christ accomplished redemption, the Holy Spirit enlightens man, and God the Father receives us by His love. A proper understanding of these three parables will give us a balanced life, and we will not be biased in any way.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FORTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING CHRIST<br>AND THE HOLY SPIRIT</H1><P>What is the relationship between the death of the Lord Jesus and the descending of the Holy Spirit?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>This question is very much related to salvation and the gospel. Therefore, we must examine it carefully.</P><P>A great number of people have an erroneous concept concerning the Holy Spirit. They think that they have to pay a great price to be filled with the Holy Spirit and that it requires a great deal of self-affliction and desperate begging before they will feel happy. Once they are filled with the Holy Spirit, they think that they will be good Christians and have the power to preach the gospel. If we study the Bible carefully, however, we will see that it never tells us this. The Bible tells us that there is only one price for having the Holy Spirit and that it has already been paid by the Lord Jesus Christ. As a result of the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, God sent the Holy Spirit. The descending of the Holy Spirit is the result of the death, blood, and merit of the Lord Jesus. It is not the result of any price we can pay, nor is it due to our own merit.</P><P>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He told the disciples that the Father would give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him (Luke 11:13) because, at that time, the Holy Spirit had not yet come. After the resurrection of the Lord, He breathed into the disciples and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (John 20:22). Since that day, there is no longer a need to ask for the Holy Spirit; the need now is to receive the Holy Spirit.</P><P>A servant of God once said, "The Holy Spirit has already come. If the water pipe which conveys the Holy Spirit is blocked, just remove the obstacle, and the water will flow. We must consecrate ourselves not just once, but continuously." Based upon the Lord's blood, death, resurrection, and ascension, the Holy Spirit has come. We need to remove the obstacles by consecrating ourselves to the Lord. When we remove the obstacles, we can be filled with the Holy Spirit. Consecration is the way to be filled with the Holy Spirit, but the flow of the Holy Spirit is based upon the Lord's blood. Only the Lord's blood can bring the outflow of the Holy Spirit. If the water pipe is empty, removing an obstacle will not produce water. In order to be filled with the Holy Spirit, we must consecrate ourselves. The more thorough our consecration, the more we will be filled. However, the water pipe has water only because of the blood of the Lord Jesus.</P><P>The Old Testament records that when the Israelites were in the wilderness, Moses smote the rock and water flowed out of the rock (Exo. 17:6). First Corinthians 10:4 says, "And the rock was Christ." The outflow of the Holy Spirit is not based on our consecration, but on the death of Jesus Christ. Leviticus 14 is the record of the cleansing of leprosy. The priest first took the blood from the sacrifice of the trespass offering and put it upon the tip of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the big toe of the right foot of whoever was being cleansed. Then the priest put the oil in his left hand upon the tip of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the big toe of the right foot. The rest of the oil in the priest's hand was put upon the head of whoever was being cleansed (vv. 14-18). The blood refers to redemption, while the oil refers to the Holy Spirit. The coming down of the Holy Spirit on the leper was not because he declared that he was cleansed, but because of the blood. He was anointed with oil only after he was pronounced as being cleansed.</P><P>In order for our ears to listen to God's voice, our hands to do His work, and our feet to walk His path, we must first be cleansed by the blood. Based on the Lord's redemptive work and His blood which washes away all our sins, the Holy Spirit comes to fill us and enable us to work and have the power of the Holy Spirit. The power of the Holy Spirit is not the result of our own doing; it is based on the blood of the Lord.</P><P>This matter is not explicitly revealed in the Old Testament. But in the New Testament it is clearly revealed. John 7:37 through 39 says, "Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified." At that time, the Holy Spirit was not yet because Jesus had not yet died, resurrected, and ascended. The Holy Spirit had not yet come because Jesus was not yet glorified, not because there was a lack of prayer and desperate begging from men. Acts 2:33 says, "Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this which you both see and hear." From this we see that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit was the result of the death, resurrection, and exaltation of the Lord Jesus. The coming of the Holy Spirit is due to the Lord Jesus Himself; it is not due to our desperate begging.</P><P>We have seen many people begging and afflicting themselves in order to have the power of the Holy Spirit. Others think that only special Christians can receive the power of the Holy Spirit and that a common Christian cannot receive this power. They think that receiving the power of the Holy Spirit is something extraordinary. Of all that God has given us, nothing can compare with the Holy Spirit. Its price is very high, but it has already been paid by the Lord Jesus Christ through His death and resurrection. This is why we can receive the Holy Spirit. The Lord's blood is the price, and the Lord Jesus Christ is the source of the Holy Spirit. We must also remove all the obstacles on our side. The water may be plenteous, but if the water pipe is clogged, it is still unavailable. If we understand the source of the Holy Spirit, and if we realize that the price has been paid, we will not need to beg desperately.</P><P>Galatians 3:13 and 14 say, "Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, `Cursed is every one hanging on a tree'; in order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith." This tells us that the Lord Jesus was hung on a tree in order to allow the blessing of Abraham to come to the Gentiles. What does it mean for the blessing of Abraham to come to the Gentiles? It means that we can receive the Holy Spirit promised to us by God simply through believing.</P><P>If you feel weak, if your spiritual life fluctuates, if you frequently stumble, if your strength fades day after day, and if you do not have the power of the Holy Spirit, you need to know that the Lord Jesus Christ has died and His blood has been shed. All that you need to do is come forward to the presence of God to receive the promised Holy Spirit. You can thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ which has already paid the price, and you can receive the power of the Holy Spirit. You do not need to live a fluctuating life. However, you must pay attention to one thing: if there is any obstacle on your part that has not been removed, or if your consecration is not thorough, you still cannot receive the power of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>We do not have to force ourselves to pray for the Holy Spirit. We should receive what the Lord Jesus Christ has already accomplished, believe, and appropriate it by faith. The Bible says that the Lord Jesus Christ was sent to accomplish God's will and that the Holy Spirit has already been poured upon us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FORTY-TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING RECONCILIATION</H1><P>What does the Bible teach concerning reconciliation? Should man be reconciled to God or God be reconciled to man?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Let us consider 2 Corinthians 5:18-20: "But all things are out from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation; namely, that God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself, not accounting their offenses to them, and has put in us the word of reconciliation. On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God." These verses show us one thing. There is a common misconception that if a person wants salvation, he must desperately plead until God changes His mind. But the Bible does not say this. God is not a God of hatred. There is no problem on His side. Man tends to think that God's heart is very hard. Therefore, he feels compelled to constantly plead for pity and forgiveness, fearing that God will change His mind toward him. This concept comes from a lack of understanding the Bible.</P><P>"But all things are out from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ." God has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ. Consequently, if a man thinks that God initially hated him and that he must plead, confess, repeatedly cry, and offer much penance before God can forgive him, he is wrong. In fact, God is reconciling man to Himself through Christ. When Christ was on earth He represented God. He did everything for man with the purpose of expressing God. Christ's love toward man on earth expressed God's love in heaven. Ultimately, God prepared a Savior for us. He died on the cross and was punished for us. Therefore, God has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ. God is at peace with us. He has no problem with us. How He deals with us is altogether contrary to our thought.</P><P>"And has given to us the ministry of reconciliation." The ministry of the apostles is to persuade man to be reconciled to God. Man thinks that he must entreat God for pity and love. He is totally ignorant that God loves man to the uttermost. God longs for man to be reconciled to Himself. Therefore, the apostles preached in order to beseech men to be reconciled to God; they never pleaded for God to be reconciled to man.</P><P>How did God reconcile us to Himself? By "not accounting their offenses to them." God reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ by not accounting our offenses to us.</P><P>"On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God." This verse says that the apostles beseeched on behalf of Christ that we would be reconciled to God. They did not ask God to be reconciled to us. Man thinks that God is not willing to be reconciled to him. Actually, God commissioned us to beseech men to be reconciled to Himself. The command we receive from God is to beseech men on His behalf that they be reconciled to God. We do not need to plead with God; we need to beseech men to receive what God has bestowed on them. Man does not need to pitifully pray to God; he only needs to believe and accept what Christ has accomplished.</P><P>Does not God hate sin? God no doubt hates sin. But if any man receives the Lord Jesus Christ, God will forgive him. Therefore, we have to be careful to not be misled to think that there is hate in God's heart toward man.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FORTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING THE REQUIREMENTS<br>FOR SALVATION</H1><P>What are the requirements for salvation, that is, for receiving eternal life?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>According to the Bible, there is only one requirement for being saved: to believe. There is no need to add anything else to believing. Yet many people think that believing is not enough and that we must add something to it in order to be saved. This is because they do not understand what we believe, what faith is, what the result of a living faith is, and what the expression of a living faith is. As long as a person truly believes, he is saved, and no other requirements need to be added. Let us consider seven conditions which are not required for salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. Believing and Hoping</H2><P>Some people think that in order to be saved we must believe and then implore God earnestly, hoping that God will pity us and have mercy on us so that we might go to heaven. But the Bible does not say that we should hope for God's graciousness towards us; rather, it says that we must believe that God has already granted us grace. Romans 3:21 and 22 say, "But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested, witness being borne to it by the Law and the Prophets; even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe, for there is no distinction." Whoever thinks that he must believe and hope does not have a reliable faith and will eventually be one who does not have genuine faith. Faith is to believe what is already accomplished. These people do not know what faith is, nor do they know God's heart. They consider that God's forgiveness is given to people reluctantly and that they must plead with God to such an extent that He has pity on them. Actually, God has already forgiven us. Since the Lord Jesus has shed His precious blood, all of our sins are forgiven. Therefore, the work is accomplished. If we believe it, we are forgiven. By faith, the redemption which the Lord has accomplished is ours. Once we believe that Jesus Christ died for us, the grace of God is manifested in us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. Believing and Confessing</H2><P>Some say that if a man believes but does not confess Christ, he cannot be saved. Indeed, the one who believes must confess Christ. However, salvation is not the result of confession. Confession is not a condition for being saved, and one is not saved by confessing.</P><P>Matthew 10:32 and 33 say, "Every one therefore who will confess in Me before men, I also will confess in him before My Father who is in the heavens; but whoever will deny Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father who is in the heavens." This passage of Scripture does not refer to receiving eternal life; rather, it refers to a man's future position in the kingdom of the heavens and to the salvation of the believer's soul. If a person is willing to deny himself and confess the Lord on earth, the Lord will confess him before the Father in the future. It does not refer to a person's eternal salvation.</P><P>Mark 8:38 says, "For whoever is ashamed of Me and of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels." This also refers to the time of the kingdom. Mark 8:35 says, "For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever will lose his soul-life for My sake and the gospel's shall save it." What does losing one's soul on the earth mean? It means to be willing while on earth to forfeit all enjoyment of the soul for the Lord's sake. Whoever is afraid of losing face and being put to shame today will certainly lose face and be ashamed in the future. Whoever is not afraid of losing face and being put to shame for the Lord today will certainly be glorified in the future. Those who are not willing to suffer with the Lord today will surely miss the glory in the kingdom. When the Lord Jesus Christ establishes the kingdom on the earth, many will miss the glory.</P><P>Matthew 10:32 and 33 and Mark 8:35 and 38 all speak about the kingdom and not about obtaining eternal life. Entrance into the kingdom is related to a believer's conduct on earth today. If a believer does not confess the Lord when he should before man, even though he already has eternal life, he will have no portion in the kingdom.</P><P>Romans 10:10 says, "For with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation." This verse seems to say that one can be saved by making confession with the mouth. However, in order to understand this verse we must consider the entire context. The subject of Romans 10 is the righteousness which is by faith. Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to everyone who believes (v. 4). Faith is the requirement for obtaining righteousness, but what is this faith? The previous verses say that the word is near you, even in your mouth and in your heart, and that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. This faith includes two aspects: one is with the mouth, and the other is with the heart. These two matters are the actions of faith; they are two aspects of one thing. They are just like justification and salvation which are two aspects of one thing. Confessing with the mouth is an expression of faith, and faith includes confession. This is why in the subsequent concluding word only faith is mentioned and not confession. Verse 11 says, "Everyone who believes on Him shall not be put to shame." This verse does not say that whosoever believes and confesses shall not be put to shame. Confession is included in believing, so there is no need to mention it. Verse 14 says, "How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed?" Verses 16 and 17 say, "`Who has believed what he has heard from us?' So faith comes out of hearing." These verses do not mention confession again. Confession is not an independent matter; rather, it is a spontaneous expression of believing. Then how is the confession spoken of here expressed? Confession does not mean standing up to give a testimony. Instead, it is like a child acknowledging his mother by calling her "Mom." When a person is saved by believing with his heart, he confesses with the mouth and spontaneously calls, "Abba, Father." Therefore, confession is not a requirement in addition to believing. A person needs only to believe in order to be saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Believing and Good Works</H2><P>Some people think, "I am a sinner and need to have good behavior. Being saved just by believing in Jesus is too cheap. I should believe in Jesus and do good works so that I will be assured of being saved." But this is not the teaching of the Bible. Although God saves us unto good works, that is, we have been "created in Christ Jesus for good works" (Eph. 2:10) and "prepared unto every good work" (2 Tim. 2:21), nevertheless, we must remember that the Bible tells us that good works come after being saved. Salvation is not a result of good works, nor is it the result of good works in addition to believing. A child cannot walk before he is born; in like manner, we have to be reborn first, and then good works come. It is impossible to expect a person to do good works before he is reborn.</P><P>Romans 4:4 through 6 says, "Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due. But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted as righteousness. Even as David also speaks blessing on the man to whom God accounts righteousness apart from works." The wages of the one who works are not accounted according to grace but according to what is due. He deserves his wages because he has done a good work. But the faith of the one who does not work but believes (let us note the word "believes") on Him who justifies the ungodly is accounted as righteousness. We can be saved not by works but by faith. Something else in addition to believing is not needed. We must remember that faith alone is sufficient. David said that "the man to whom God accounts righteousness apart from works" was blessed. "Apart from works" shows that salvation has nothing to do with works.</P><P>Ephesians 2:8 through 10 says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast. For we are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them." Verses 8 and 9 tell us that we are saved by grace through the faith which God has given to us and not by our own works. Verse 10 tells us that God has saved us to do the good works which He prepared for us. We are saved by grace through faith; after being saved we should do the good works which God prepared for us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. Believing and Praying</H2><P>Some people think that praying should also be a condition for salvation. They do not realize that salvation is by faith not by prayer. Since the Lord Jesus Christ has already borne our sins and been judged by God, we do not even need to pray; all we have to do is believe. To pray is to ask God to do something, but to believe is to accept what God has already accomplished. We believe that God has judged Jesus Christ and that Christ has died for us. The cross has fully accomplished the work of redemption so that whoever believes in what God has done shall be saved.</P><P>However, someone may ask, "Does not Romans 10:13 say that `whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved'? Does this not show us that we must pray to be saved and that if we do not pray we will not be saved?" But let us read the following verse which says, "How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed?" Believing comes first, and calling comes after. First there is the believing, and then there is the calling. To call is an expression of faith-it is not an independent or additional requirement. Believing includes calling, and believing spontaneously produces calling. Furthermore, the calling in this verse is not an ordinary plea; it is an invoking of the name of the Lord. This is similar to what was spoken in the previous text about confessing the Lord Jesus with the mouth. It is also referred to in 1 Corinthians 12:3: "No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit." The name of the Lord is salvation. Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord or says that Jesus is Lord will be saved. Can one say Jesus is Lord if he does not believe that Jesus is Lord? On the other hand, can one who believes that Jesus is Lord not say that Jesus is Lord or call on His name? Therefore, prayer is not a requirement of being saved. Faith and faith alone is the requirement.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>5. Believing and Baptism</H2><P>Some may rightly think that salvation is not dependent on hope, confession, works, or prayer, but still think that one must both believe and be baptized in order to be saved. This concept is also incorrect. Even though Mark 16:16 says, "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved," we have to pay attention to what the word "saved" refers to. In the Bible there are several kinds of salvation: the eternal salvation by which one obtains eternal life, the believer's daily salvation, the salvation through affliction, the salvation of the body, and the salvation of the soul in which one reigns with the Lord in the kingdom of the heavens. The salvation related to baptism is our salvation from the realm of the sinful world. This is different from having eternal life. Having eternal life is a personal matter of receiving eternal life, but being baptized is to be saved out of a sinful realm. If a person only believes but is not baptized, although he has eternal life, in the eyes of the world he is still not a saved one. He must rise up to be baptized and declare that he has nothing to do with the sinful realm. Others will then acknowledge that he has been saved. In order to receive eternal life, deliverance from condemnation, and eternal salvation, all that one has to do is believe; there are no additional requirements. The first part of Mark 16:16 says, "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved," and the second part says, "But he who does not believe shall be condemned." The second part does not say that "he who does not believe and who is not baptized shall be condemned." In order to be saved from the sinful realm of the world, one must believe and be baptized. In order to be condemned, however, all that he has to do is not believe. In other words, the requirement for not being condemned is just believing; it is not baptism in addition to believing. The criminal on the cross was not baptized, yet the Lord said, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" (Luke 23:40-43). He believed and was not condemned; rather, he was saved and had eternal life. Therefore, baptism is not a condition for receiving eternal life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>6. Believing and Confessing Sin</H2><P>Some have said that our sins are like strips of paper hanging one by one on the cross. When we confess one sin, one strip is taken off the cross, while the sins which we have not confessed are still hanging there. But the Bible does not say this. Nevertheless, this does not mean that we do not need to confess our sins. We should confess our sins, but the confession of sins is not a condition for salvation.</P><P>However, some may reply, "Since 1 John 1:9 says, `If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness,' does this not indicate that we must confess our sins?" Indeed, this verse is in the Bible. But 1 John is not written for unbelievers. The word "we" indicates Christians, which means it is written for believers. This book mentions three kinds of Christians: (1) little children, those who have the life; (2) young men, those who are strong; and (3) fathers, those who are experienced. First John is different from Romans because the entire book speaks to Christians. The subject of 1 John is fellowship. If a Christian commits a sin, he must confess his sin; otherwise, his fellowship with God will be hindered. If he wants to restore the fellowship with God, he must confess his sin. However, it is wrong to tell an unbeliever to confess his sins in order to be saved. The Holy Spirit convicts a sinner of sins, righteousness, and judgment and causes a person to believe the works which the Son of God has accomplished. When a person believes, his sins are forgiven before God. The condition for a sinner to be forgiven by God is faith. We cannot find a passage in the Bible that says a sinner must believe and confess his sins before he can be saved. Jesus Christ has accomplished redemption, and whoever believes the testimony God gave of His Son will be saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>7. Believing and Repenting</H2><P>Many say that salvation depends on repentance. The book of Romans presents the matter of salvation very clearly, yet this book does not mention that salvation is by any kind of work. The Gospel of John is the clearest book concerning the gospel, yet it contains no indication that salvation is by repentance. Salvation is by faith, not by repentance.</P><P>Then is repentance unnecessary? According to the Bible, those who believe must first repent, and a saved person must also have repentance. There is a repentance before believing, and there is a repentance after believing. If a person never has a change in his view concerning sin, himself, the world, and the Lord, he cannot be saved. The word repentance means to have a change of mind. For instance, what one person treasured before his salvation is no longer treasured after his salvation. Therefore, repentance is not a condition of salvation but a part of believing and a part of salvation.</P><P>What is believing? To believe does not mean to believe in some theological doctrines. To hear is to hear the doctrines, but to believe is to believe in Christ. Ephesians 1:13 says, "Having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing." We hear the word of truth, the gospel, but we believe in Christ. Some people say that they believe, but actually, they only agree with the doctrines-they do not really believe in Christ. Some with other motives may say that they have believed, but they have never known Christ. These persons are not saved. Therefore, preaching doctrines is not our aim; our aim is for people to believe in Christ.</P><P>What does it mean to believe in Christ? First John 5:9 through 12 says, "If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that He has testified concerning His Son. He who believes into the Son of God has the testimony in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son. And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life." Therefore, believing is receiving the witness that God gave of His Son. Whoever believes in His Son has eternal life.</P><P>We rejoice because we are saved by believing and not by anything else. We should have good works, confess Christ before people, confess our sins, repent, be baptized, and pray frequently to be pleasing to God. We should not neglect these things and bring about God's displeasure. However, we are not saved by doing these things. Our salvation is only by believing.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FORTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING THE UNPARDONABLE SIN</H1><P>What sins are unpardonable? Can someone who commits such a sin be saved? What is the real meaning of this sin?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>The unpardonable sin is the sin of blaspheming against the Holy Spirit. The devil is never idle; wherever the Holy Spirit is working, the devil is also working. Sometimes he stretches the truth of the Bible just a little in order to torment people. When the Holy Spirit is convicting a person of his sins, the devil will tell him, "You are a sinner, a great sinner, and even a unique sinner; you have committed the sin of blaspheming against the Holy Spirit. Therefore, you can never be forgiven." Many people are afraid that they have committed the sin of blaspheming against the Holy Spirit. Let us first explain the meaning of this sin and then come to the conclusion that it is not possible for anyone to commit this sin today. We will first read Mark 3:28-30.</P><P>Verse 28 says, "Truly I say to you that all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they blaspheme." This sounds like music! This is a most pleasant word! All the sins of the world and all the words of blasphemy may be forgiven. This is a great proclamation of the gospel! All the sins-including great sins, small sins, refined sins, gross sins, the sins which are humanly considered as pardonable, as well as those sins which are considered unpardonable, yesterday's sins, today's sins, even tomorrow's sins-are included. Hallelujah! All sins are forgiven! Blasphemous words against God can be forgiven; even slander against the Lord can be forgiven. All the sins, that is, all our actions of conduct and all the blasphemous words spoken against God when we were unbelievers can all be forgiven. There is not one sin, not even a word of blasphemy, which cannot be forgiven. This is what the Lord says in this verse.</P><P>You should not think that you have committed the unpardonable sin. Saying something that offends God is not a blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Speaking something against Christ is not a blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. The only unpardonable sin is to blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, not against Christ. Quenching the Holy Spirit is not the same as blaspheming against the Holy Spirit; neither can rejecting the Holy Spirit nor resisting the Holy Spirit be considered a blasphemy against Him.</P><P>Verse 29 says, "But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness forever, but is guilty of an everlasting sin." It is clear that this is a unique and special sin.</P><P>What is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit? It is to speak with one's mouth things which blaspheme against the Holy Spirit. How can we know that this sin is a sin that involves words of the mouth? Please read verse 30: "He said this because they said, He has an unclean spirit." This sin is not as easy to commit as many think today. In order to commit such a sin, a person must have clearly seen the Lord casting out demons and performing miracles and works of wonders by the Spirit of God when He was on earth. In spite of this knowledge, he would still have to insist on saying that the Lord Jesus was demon-possessed.</P><P>For a person to commit this sin, he must (1) see the Lord Jesus with his own eyes; (2) personally witness the Lord performing wonders and miracles among the people; (3) know clearly that this was the work of the Holy Spirit; and yet (4) still insist on saying that this is the work of demons. How can we commit the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit if we have not seen the Lord with our own eyes, have not personally seen Him performing wonders and miracles among us, and have not clearly known that those works were done by the Holy Spirit? We have neither the opportunity nor the possibility of committing this sin. If someone or even the devil says to us that we have committed the sin of blaspheming against the Holy Spirit and can never be forgiven, we can immediately answer that there is no such thing because we have not personally seen the Lord, His wonders, or His miracles. Moreover, we have not said that wonders and miracles were done by the devil while assuredly knowing that they were done by the Holy Spirit.</P><P>There was a newly saved brother who once asked an elderly brother, "Have I ever committed the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit?" The elderly brother answered it very well. He said, "If you can grieve for your sins, you have not committed the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit." This is really true. But we should add one more word: even if a person does not feel that he has sinned, he still cannot be described as having committed the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.</P><P>Let us see how the Gospel of Matthew records this matter. "And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the one to come" (12:32). These are words spoken by the Lord to the Jews who had committed the sin recorded in this chapter. They clearly saw that the Lord cast out demons by the Holy Spirit. However, they insisted on saying that He had cast out demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons. How does the Bible describe these people? "And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, `In hearing you shall hear and by no means understand, and seeing you shall see and by no means perceive. For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed, lest they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and they turn around, and I will heal them'" (13:14-15). This shows us that any person who committed the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit by no means sensed or wanted to be saved, because his heart had become fat, his ears heard heavily, and his eyes were closed.</P><P>There are two other related passages in the Bible which are quite meaningful. One is found in Luke 8:12: "And those beside the way are those who heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they would not believe and be saved." The devil knows that man will be saved when he believes; therefore, he is fearful lest any man believes and is saved. The other passage is found in Matthew 13:11-15: "And He answered and said to them, Because to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been given....For this reason I speak to them in parables...lest they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and they turn around, and I will heal them." Concerning the people who blasphemed against the Holy Spirit, God was also fearful that they might be saved. Therefore, the Lord spoke in parables lest they should repent and be healed. Hallelujah! To believe and be saved is so marvelous!</P><P>Whoever blasphemed against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven, because he "is guilty of an everlasting sin." According to the opinion of some Bible scholars, this can also be translated as "He will sin forever." He will not receive forgiveness in this age nor in the age to come because he will sin forever. But how can he sin in hell? What torments him most in hell will be worms and fire. In hell, there is suffering because of a lack of water to the point that there is not enough water to even wet the tip of the finger. There is also the burning of the fire of lusts. Hell is a place where sin and lusts are never satisfied. It is a most tormenting place. But we can thank and praise God. As long as we are willing to believe, there is not one sin which can prevent us from being saved, because the Lord said, "All sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they blaspheme" (Mark 3:28). Therefore, we can be at peace.</P><P>Although we are not able to commit the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, we should be careful when we touch the work of the Holy Spirit. Do not say in a light way that the work of this person is of the Holy Spirit or the work of that person is of the evil spirits.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FORTY-FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING FALLING FROM GRACE</H1><P>What does it mean to fall from grace (Gal. 5:4)? Can the ones who have fallen from grace be saved?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>There are several books in the New Testament which closely resemble one another, such as Ephesians and Colossians, and Galatians and Romans. The reason for this resemblance is that one book presents a matter from one point of view, while the other book proves the matter from another point of view. Ephesians says that the church is the Body of Christ; Colossians then turns around and says that Christ is the Head of the church. Romans says that justification is by God's grace, based on God's righteousness, and through man's faith. Galatians, from the negative side, says that man cannot be saved by the law or justified by works. Romans tells us what is the truth, and Galatians tells us what is not the truth. By knowing what is not the truth, the knowledge of the truth becomes even clearer.</P><P>The believers in Galatia had a good beginning because they were saved by faith. However, a danger developed among them; some said that even though the beginning of man's salvation is by faith in Christ, by the moving of the Holy Spirit, and by the grace of God, once he is saved, he can only please God by keeping His law and trying his best to do good. If you ask someone how he was saved, he will say through faith. But if you ask someone how he can please God, he will say it is by doing good. This was the condition of the believers in Galatia. They thought that salvation was by faith but that maintaining salvation depended on keeping the law. They thought that the first thing they had to do was be circumcised and the second thing they had to do was keep the ordinances of the Old Testament. Therefore, Paul told them, "You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace" (Gal. 5:4).</P><P>What does "fallen from grace" mean? From Galatians 5:1 we know that they had entered into grace: "Stand fast therefore, and do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again." This indicates that Christ had set them free. They were already free. Now they should stand fast in this freedom and not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. As we read further, we understand what it means to fall from grace. Suppose one is standing in a position of freedom. If he moves away from his position of freedom and takes a yoke to bear, this is to fall from grace. This, basically, has nothing to do with whether or not one can be saved. On the contrary, only those who have already been saved have the possibility of falling from grace.</P><P>Every saved Christian obtains a new position on the day he is saved. He also obtains a freedom which is his as a child of God. Freedom does not mean indulgence; it is having a free spirit before God. We are not required to do hard labor or keep the days [in the Law], much less to be circumcised.</P><P>Before God, what is the difference between a Christian who is free and a Christian who is not free? When a Christian who is free comes to the presence of God, he only remembers that he is acceptable to God because of the Lord Jesus. He forgets himself and does not look at himself, but only remembers that his coming to God's presence is by the blood of the Lord Jesus. Therefore, he has boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies. However, a Christian who is not free thinks he must be very careful from morning until evening. If he treats people well, reads his Bible with joy, and prays long prayers during the day, he is bolder when he comes to a meeting. Even his "amen" is uttered in a louder voice. If he does not do quite as well on a particular day, he thinks that God is displeased with him. This kind of Christian always turns his eyes inward to look at himself. He forgets to look at what Christ has already accomplished. He thinks that God is pleased with him if he does well and that God is displeased with him if he does not do well. Consequently, from morning until evening he makes an iron yoke for himself, a yoke composed of the strictest laws to keep.</P><P>We should realize that the freedom which Paul speaks of does not refer to one's position or salvation but to a Christian's daily enjoyment of the freedom in grace which God has given him. Freedom is not licentiousness, nor is it to do anything one wishes. Freedom refers to the kind of freedom we have before God, which was given to us through Jesus Christ. If we come before God forgetting the blood and looking only at ourselves, we are committing the greatest sin, because we have lightly esteemed the blood which God values highly. Hebrews 10:29 tells us that it is a great sin to count the blood of the covenant by which man was sanctified a common thing. The blood is so valuable to God that the Bible calls it "the precious blood." Anyone who does not look at the precious blood before God will lose the enjoyment of grace in this life.</P><P>"You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ" (Gal. 5:4). This means that such a one has lost the blessings of this life. If a person is saved, he will certainly have the blessings of the coming life. But if he does not know how to live daily by what Christ has accomplished, he is not able to enjoy the blessings which Christ can give to him day by day. A Christian who is not free makes a yoke for himself to bear; he lives as a slave, not as a son.</P><P>The Bible places great emphasis on the work of Christ. It tells us that God accepts us because of the work of Christ, not because of our own works. Each time we come before God it is based on what Christ is before God, not on what we are before Him. God esteems Christ highly, not us. Even if we could do better than Peter, John, and Paul, we still could come before God only because of Christ. It is Christ who brings us before God, not our own good works.</P><P>We come before God by what Christ has accomplished. By what then should we come before men? Should we say that because our coming to the presence of God depends on what Christ has accomplished, it does not matter if we have bad conduct before men? Our light should shine before men. If our light shines before men, people will give glory to our heavenly Father because of our good works. If our conduct is bad, people will not acknowledge us as Christians.</P><P>The position which Christ has given us before God is very secure. Each day, each time, we come to the presence of God, we should come with a conscience void of offense. Some Christians always feel guilty when they come to the presence of God. But Hebrews 10:2 says, "Having once been purified, would have no longer had the consciousness of sins." With our conscience once purified by the blood, we are forever free before God.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FORTY-SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING HEBREWS 6:4-8</H1><P>Will the people mentioned in Hebrews 6:4-8 perish?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Hebrews 6:1 through 8 says, "Therefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us be brought on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in God, of the teaching of baptisms and of the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment. And this we will do if God permits. For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, and yet have fallen away, to renew themselves again unto repentance, crucifying again for themselves the Son of God and putting Him to open shame. For the earth, which drinks the rain which often comes upon it and brings forth vegetation suitable to those for whose sake also it is cultivated, partakes of blessing from God. But if it brings forth thorns and thistles, it is disapproved and near a curse, whose end is to be burned." Some, after reading verses 6 and 8, assume that the kind of people mentioned in these verses cannot be saved. As mentioned in verses 4 and 5, they are "those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come." These verses mention four facts: (1) they were once enlightened; (2) they tasted of the heavenly gift; (3) they became partakers of the Holy Spirit; and (4) they tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come. If a person has already experienced the four items mentioned above and falls away, he will be "disapproved and near a curse, whose end is to be burned" (v. 8). Based upon this verse, some speculate that their end is perdition. If this is the case, then this means that although one has been saved and has gained eternal life, there is a possibility for him to lose it. How do we explain this?</P><P>We must be clear what the book of Hebrews is speaking of. Hebrews speaks about "pressing on," and this progress has two areas. First, Christians should progress; second, the one who teaches should also progress. In their living, Christians should increase in their knowledge of the Lord and should advance. The one who teaches should likewise teach the truth in a progressive way; he should not dwell on the topic of salvation all year round but go on to teach the deeper truths.</P><P>The climax of this progress in the book of Hebrews is in chapters five and six. In chapter five the writer speaks of Melchisedec: "Concerning whom we have much to say that is also difficult to interpret since you have become dull of hearing" (v. 11). They should have been fully grown; yet, unfortunately, they were old children. They should have been able to take in solid food and learn the word of righteousness; yet, unfortunately, they were still those who needed milk. Chapter six speaks to those who teach others. They should also make some progress. They should not just speak about six doctrines: repentance from dead works, faith in God, the teaching of baptisms, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and the eternal judgment. Rather, they should press on to teach other matters. Thus we can see that Hebrews 6:1-8 is not speaking of the matter of salvation but of spiritual progress. The goal of the book of Hebrews is progression, not salvation. We cannot proceed to speak clearly about this book if we are misled about its subject.</P><P>Some Christians do not pay any attention to the truth of the church and of the kingdom. Their eyes are fixed only on salvation. It seems that salvation alone is adequate for them. But the Bible does not speak only of salvation; it also has many other things to tell us.</P><P>We must grasp the theme of the book of Hebrews before we can go on to Hebrews 6:1-8. These few verses can be divided into three sections: (1) verses 1 through 3 form a section with the title "Need Not"; (2) verses 4 through 6 form the next section with the title "Cannot"; and (3) verses 7 through 8 form the third section with the title "Should Not."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. Need Not</H2><P>Six "need not" items are mentioned: (1) repentance from dead works, (2) faith in God, (3) the teaching of various baptisms, (4) laying on of hands, (5) resurrection of the dead, and (6) eternal judgment. We are told that we do not need to lay another foundation again. All these six items are foundational teachings. Once the foundation is laid, there is no need to lay it again. There is no need to repeat the work. When building a house, one does not lay a foundation and then not build upon it but instead lay another foundation. The foundation has already been laid. There is no need to lay another foundation. We should move on.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. Cannot</H2><P>The word "once" in verse 4 denotes a historical fact. The word "again" in "renew themselves again unto repentance" (v. 6) is the same Greek word used in "not laying again a foundation" (v. 1). In Greek, the word "leaving" in verse 1 has the meaning of "slipping" or "falling away." The coordinate conjunction "and" in verses 4 and 5 joins four items together, namely, "once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come." If one has experienced these four items, it is impossible for him to renew his repentance again just because he has fallen once. It is impossible for him to crucify the Son of God again and put Him to open shame, even if he wishes to do so. If a person falls, it does not mean that he has forsaken the course which he was on; his direction is still correct. Therefore, he cannot renew his repentance again. He cannot crucify the Son of God again. He cannot put Him to open shame again.</P><P>In verses 1 through 3 the writer of this Epistle told the Hebrews not to lay another foundation. However, some among the Hebrews may respond, "If one who is in the condition mentioned in verses 4 through 6 slipped and fell away, should he not lay another foundation? Should this fallen one not renew again his repentance?" Paul replied that even if one were indeed in the condition mentioned in verses 4 through 6, even if he really sinned, he could not renew his repentance again.</P><P>This portion of the Word uses "again" twice. It is used once in verse 1: "Not laying again a foundation," and also in verse 6: "To renew themselves again unto repentance." There are six items of fundamental truths, repentance being the first item. In the first section, the writer of this Epistle tells them not to lay a foundation again. In the second section, he tells them that even if someone falls, he cannot renew his repentance again and cannot lay a foundation again.</P><P>Is it possible for us to be born again and yet lose that life? Is it possible to be reborn once more by repenting again? The repentance in verse 6 is the same repentance as in verse 1, which is a foundational repentance. That is not to say that one cannot repent again, but one cannot go back to the state of laying again the foundation that has been laid by repentance. This is the vital key here. Please take note of the word "again" in "again unto repentance" and "laying again a foundation of repentance." Not only does one not need to lay another foundation or repent again, but even more, it is impossible to do so.</P><P>This portion of the Word says that one who has received so much goodness from the Lord and then slips, does not need to repent again and lay another foundation. One can only be reborn once. One does not need to start all over again if he slips while on the way. However, many think that if one has fallen, he should start all over again. This concept is wrong.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Should Not</H2><P>Although verses 1 through 3 tell us that we "need not" and verses 4 through 6 tell us that we "cannot," verses 7 and 8 tell us that we "should not." This means that we should not fall away again and again, nor should we sin, as if to put the Son of God to open shame by crucifying Him again. If we do this, we will be punished. Therefore, we should not do this.</P><P>Some think that if a person sins after he is saved, he is no longer saved. Others think that once a person is saved, he will never be punished even if he continues to sin. Both of these concepts are incorrect. God longs for a saved one to grow. Going back and laying again another foundation after one falls is as impossible as asking one's parents to give birth to him again simply because he did not behave well. But if a person continues to do evil and engages in all the items mentioned in verse 6, what will happen? He will have three results. He will be disapproved, near a curse, and his end is to be burned.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>A. Disapproved</H2><P>This word is the same as the word "disapproved" in 1 Corinthians 9:27. Paul said he buffeted his body and brought it into subjection, lest by any means, when he preached to others, he himself would be disapproved. Every Christian knows that Paul was saved. But Paul was afraid that he would not gain the crown. He was afraid that he would not enter into the kingdom.</P><P>What does it mean to be disapproved by God? For example, a bicycle that was originally in good shape and suitable for use, and that is now broken and rusted, is no longer useful. This does not mean that the bicycle no longer exists but that it has been disapproved and put aside as useless. When we are disapproved by God, it does not mean that we do not have eternal life and are unsaved; it simply means that we have been put aside by God and are useless to Him. God's punishment for the believer who sins is to put him outside of glory and into darkness, so that he has no share in the kingdom. This is the meaning of Matthew 25:30.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>B. Near a Curse</H2><P>"Near a curse" does not mean "being cursed." Being near a curse means feeling like a curse; it is not the same as being cursed. This verse is neither speaking about the degree of punishment nor the categories of punishment; rather, it says that Christians and the unsaved ones will be punished. This is why the expression "near a curse" is used.</P><P>Therefore, we must take heed. Do not think that regardless of how bad a Christian is, he will not be punished. We must remember that "near a curse" means there will be a punishment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>C. Whose End Is to Be Burned</H2><P>This is the burning spoken of in 1 Corinthians 3:15. The fire of God will burn all the manner of life and all the works of this person. This man is like a living trash can. Hidden within him are many filthy things which can only be purified through the burning fire.</P><P>Therefore, we rejoice, on the one hand; yet on the other hand, we should be warned. On the one hand, our salvation is sure, yet on the other hand, if we do not do well, we will receive punishment. Although this punishment is not eternal, we will not have a share in the millennial kingdom.</P><P>Let us now summarize the above. Hebrews 6:1-3 tells us that we do not need to lay a foundation again; verses 4 through 6 tell us that we cannot lay a foundation again. A believer must rise up from where he has fallen. He cannot renew his repentance again. Verses 7 and 8 show that it is not right for us to do evil. If a person insists on doing evil, he will receive a definite punishment.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FORTY-SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING HEBREWS 10:26</H1><P>Hebrews 10:26 says, "For when we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins." What does this mean?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P> What does the phrase "There no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins" mean? Some may say, "If I sin willfully after I have received the knowledge of the truth, I will not be saved. It is true that God sent His Son to die for me, to bear my sins so that I would be saved through believing in His Son. But if I sin willfully, according to Hebrews 10:26, there is no longer a sacrifice for sin, and I cannot be saved. This is mentioned not only in verse 26 but also in verse 27, which says, `But a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fervor of fire, which is to consume the adversaries.' If I sin willfully, I can wait for only two things: one is the judgment, and the other is the fervor of fire which consumes the adversaries. This is hell and perdition. Since according to the Bible if I sin willfully, there remains no longer a sacrifice for sins, the ending for me is judgment and the fervor of fire which consumes the adversaries. Therefore, I cannot be saved." Those who think in this way think that this passage is for Christians and that if a Christian sins willfully, he cannot be saved. We have to look into this portion of the Word carefully to find out if the ones who sin willfully are Christians or other people. We must also consider the meaning of sinning willfully and see if this refers to sin in general or to some particular sin.</P><P>"When we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth," the result, according to the Bible, is "a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fervor of fire, which is to consume the adversaries." The people mentioned here are different from those in Hebrews 6:4, "who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift." The "truth" spoken of in Hebrews 10:26 is the redemption accomplished once for all by the Lord Jesus Christ. There are certain people who know about the death of the Lord Jesus, the shedding of His blood, and the purpose of His body being broken. They know that man can enter into the Holy of Holies through the blood of the Lord Jesus and be accepted by God; they also know that the work of redemption has been completed forever, and the sacrifice has been offered once for all. There no longer remains a sacrifice for sins for this kind of people, who sin willfully after they have known these truths.</P><P>For a moment, let us assume that this portion refers to a Christian who, after receiving the knowledge of the truth and understanding all the doctrines mentioned above, falls into temptation and lies, steals, or goes to places where he should not go. Since he knows that these things are wrong and continues to do them, he sins willfully and cannot be saved. If this is true, I wonder if anyone is saved at all. In Romans 7 Paul said, "For what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do....For I do not do the good which I will; but the evil which I do not will, this I practice...Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?" (vv. 15, 19, 24). Does this not show that Paul clearly knew that he should do good but did not do good and instead did the things he hated? In the presence of the maid, Peter denied the Lord three times; he lied (Matt. 26:69-75). Did Peter not know that lying was sin? With this in mind, to "sin willfully" must not mean to sin while knowing that such an act is a sin. This can also be proved in an indirect way. Let us read Hebrews 10:26-29: "For when we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins, but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fervor of fire, which is to consume the adversaries. Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without compassion on the testimony of two or three witnesses. By how much do you think he will be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled underfoot the Son of God and has considered the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing and has insulted the Spirit of grace?"</P><P>What is the meaning of "sin willfully" in verse 26? To sin willfully is to commit the three acts spoken of in verse 29: (1) to trample underfoot the Son of God, (2) to consider the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and (3) to insult the Spirit of grace. In summary, this is to reject salvation. Even though a person has heard God's Word which says that Jesus is the Son of God, he says that Jesus is a bastard. Even though he has heard God's Word which says that the blood of Jesus was shed for the remission of sins, and that this blood is precious as the blood of the Lamb without blemish, he says that Jesus died as a martyr and that His blood is as common as anyone else's. Even though he has heard God's Word which says that the Holy Spirit brings man to repentance and gives eternal life, he says, "I do not believe God will impart the accomplished work of Jesus Christ to me; I do not believe that man can be born again." For this kind of people, the Bible declares, "There no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins."</P><P>What is the meaning of "There no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins"? "No longer remains" means it was once available. We have to pay attention to the "no longer." Let us read the following verses:</P><P>Hebrews 7:27 says, "Who does not have daily need, as the high priests do, to offer up sacrifices first for his own sins and then for those of the people; for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself."</P><P>Hebrews 9:12 says, "And not through the blood of goats and calves but through His own blood, entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, obtaining an eternal redemption."</P><P>Hebrews 9:25 through 28 says, "Nor in order that He might offer Himself often, just as the high priest enters into the Holy of Holies year by year by the blood of other creatures; since then He would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself....So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many."</P><P>Hebrews 10:2 says, "Otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, because those worshipping, having once been purified, would have no longer had the consciousness of sins?"</P><P>Hebrews 10:10 through 12 says, "By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest stands daily, ministering and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never remove sins; but this One, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down forever on the right hand of God."</P><P>After reading these Scriptures we must ask: why did the Lord Jesus offer Himself once and not many times? The book of Hebrews, from chapter seven onward, repeatedly makes a comparison between the sacrifice which the Lord Jesus Christ offered and the sacrifices offered in the Old Testament. The Lord Jesus Christ offered Himself only once and became the eternal sacrifice for sins, while the sacrifices offered in the Old Testament were sacrifices of bulls and goats and offered up year after year. In the Old Testament, when a man first committed a trespass, he had to offer up a sin offering of a bullock, a lamb, two turtle doves, or two young pigeons. If he committed a trespass a second time, he would have to offer up a sin offering as an atoning sacrifice again. If he committed a trespass the third time, he would have to offer up his sin offering again. This was required of every person as an individual. The whole congregation of Israel also had to offer the sin offering year after year on the day of atonement.</P><P>Why were the offerings of the bulls and goats made year after year? It was because the blood of the bulls and goats could never take away man's sins. One offering had to be made for the trespasses of last year; another offering had to be made for the trespasses of this year. But through the eternal Spirit, Jesus Christ offered Himself to God and became the one sacrifice for sins forever, so that we who are being sanctified are perfected forever.</P><P>Therefore, Hebrews 10 tells us that if there are some who have heard the truth and sin willfully, rejecting the blood of the Son of God, rejecting the Holy Spirit, and despising the Son of God, for them "there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins." In the Old Testament, if a person missed the opportunity for atonement one year, he might still have an opportunity the following year. But today if a person rejects Jesus Christ, "there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins." The sin offering of the Old Testament is gone and no longer effective. If he knows the truth and still rejects Him, then "there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins." "And there is salvation in no other" (Acts 4:12). God has done everything He could do to save us in sending the Lord Jesus Christ to accomplish the work of redemption and to be our Savior; He has done the utmost. He cannot add anything more to His work. Moreover, God has provided the opportunity for man to hear the gospel and know the truth; if a person still rejects these and willfully sins, the Bible tells us that there is no hope for him. His end is nothing but "a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fervor of fire, which is to consume the adversaries."</P><P>The end of those mentioned in Hebrews 6:1-8 is "near a curse." But the end of those mentioned in Hebrews 10:26-29 is the fervor of fire, which is to consume the adversaries. It is hard to apply Hebrews 10:26-29 to Christians. This portion of the Word must refer to those who know the gospel but purposely reject it; there is no other salvation for them. Otherwise, why is "no longer" used? Why does it say, "There no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins"? Why is "once" used repeatedly in the previous verses? If we put "no longer" together with "once" in these verses, we will understand the real meaning.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FORTY-EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING DIFFERENT KINDS<br>OF FORGIVENESS</H1><P>How many kinds of forgiveness from God are there according to the Bible? How do we explain these different kinds of forgiveness?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>We have to remember one thing: the consequences of sin determine the kind of forgiveness involved. There are at least five consequences of sin:</P><P>(1) Eternal perdition.</P><P>(2) Separation from the people of God. In the Old Testament, if an Israelite committed sin, he was cut off from the people of Israel. In the New Testament we also have these words: "Remove the evil man from among yourselves" (1 Cor. 5:13).</P><P>(3) Fellowship with God is hindered.</P><P>(4) If sin is not put away, God will chasten and discipline.</P><P>(5) If sin is not forsaken, the Lord may deal with it when He comes to reign in the millennium, and the position of this person in the kingdom may be affected by such sin.</P><P>The fourth consequence is chastisement in this age; whereas the fifth consequence is chastisement in the coming age. The Bible makes statements like, "Will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the one to come" (Matt. 12:32). "Age" in this verse refers not to the world but to the ages. This gives us an indication that while certain sins are forgiven in this age, other sins will be forgiven in the coming age.</P><P>Since sins have five possible consequences, there must also be five kinds of forgiveness. If there were only three kinds of forgiveness, what would happen to the other two consequences of sin? If there were only four kinds of forgiveness, what would happen to the other remaining consequence of sin? Many wrongly teach that there is only one kind of judgment. The result of such a teaching is much confusion. If we are not clear regarding these five kinds of forgiveness, we will not know what to do many times.</P><P>What are the five kinds of forgiveness? First, we will mention them briefly; afterwards, we will talk about them one by one.</P><P>(1) God's eternal forgiveness. (Relating to the problem of eternal salvation.)</P><P>(2) The forgiveness through God's people. (Relating to the problem of the fellowship between God's children.

(Relating to the forgiveness of the millennium.)</P><P>Now we will explain these five kinds of forgiveness separately.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. God's Eternal Forgiveness</H2><P>Eternal forgiveness is related to man's eternal salvation. Even though this forgiveness is eternal, it is nevertheless given to the sinners in this age. What is the basis for this forgiveness? Hebrews 9:22 says, "And without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness." Matthew 26:28 says, "For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." This verse tells us that eternal forgiveness is based on the blood of the Lord Jesus. No matter how big and gross a sin is, it can be forgiven by the blood of the Lord Jesus. But this forgiveness is not without a price, and God cannot forgive freely because "without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness." God's forgiveness of our sins does not mean that God is lenient toward them or will let them go. God still condemns sin as sin. God is only able to forgive us because our sins were judged in Christ. The Lord Jesus has died, shedding His precious blood and paying the price. God's way of forgiveness is most righteous. We have a Savior who has already died for us. Therefore, God has no choice but to forgive us.</P><P>The reason that our sins can be forgiven is because the Lamb of God has taken away our sins, and the blood of His Son Jesus has cleansed us of all our sins. Our forgiveness is based on the blood of the Lord Jesus, and we obtain this forgiveness through faith (Acts 10:43; 13:39). Do not think that we were forgiven because we repented for our past sins and resolved not to commit any sins in the future. The Word of God says that our sins are forgiven because of the blood of the Lord Jesus. If we believe in the blood of the Lord Jesus, we will see that our sins have been laid upon Him and that we are forgiven.</P><P>Is the forgiveness of our sins something for the present or the future? Let us read 1 John 2:12: "I write to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you because of His name." Pay attention to the three words "have been forgiven." They are not "will be forgiven," but "have been forgiven"; not "expected to be forgiven" or "waiting to be forgiven," but "have been forgiven." Hallelujah! As soon as we believe in the Lord Jesus, our sins are already forgiven. The Word of God says, "Little children...your sins have been forgiven you because of His name." When God says we are forgiven, we are forgiven. God does not lie.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. The Forgiveness through God's People</H2><P>John 20:23 says, "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained." Is not the mention of forgiveness in this verse strange? Does this mean that the apostles have the authority to forgive sins on earth? If we do not understand the meaning of this verse, we will not be able to refute the pope's authority. The authority of our forgiveness as related to salvation is in God's hand. If you go to Peter and he does not forgive you, does this mean that you are not saved? No, salvation and the forgiveness of sins depend absolutely on receiving the precious blood of the Lord Jesus. Then what does forgiveness in this verse mean? It refers to a declaration which the church makes under the direction of the Holy Spirit and is based on the church's understanding of a person's forgiveness before God. We must notice that it says, "Whosever sins you forgive," not "Whom you forgive." "Whosever" is plural not singular; it is corporate not private; it is not by an individual but by the church. "Whosever sins you forgive" means that the church declares that the sins of a certain man have been forgiven and he is saved. Someone may come to the church declaring, "I have heard the gospel and believed. Please receive me that I may be baptized and break bread the same way as the other disciples." In order to receive him, the brothers have to know whether his sins have been forgiven. If the brothers know that his sins have been forgiven before God and that he is a child of God, they can declare that he has been forgiven and saved, and receive him. If the brothers are not clear from within, they cannot make such a testimony for such a one; therefore, they cannot receive him. The forgiveness of the church is based on the forgiveness of God. The church merely declares what God has already done. Through the church, God announces the condition of a man before Him.</P><P>We must pay attention to verse 22 since verse 23 follows it. Only after verse 22 can we have verse 23. Verse 22 says, "And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit." Based upon the power and instruction of the Holy Spirit, the church determines whether one's sins have been forgiven. It is not based on individual feeling. If a person is saved, and the church is not sure and asks him to wait for a little, this will not affect his forgiveness before God. For example, after Paul was saved and came to Jerusalem, he desired to join himself to the disciples. But they were all afraid of him and did not believe that he had believed in the Lord and become a disciple. Only after Barnabas testified for him was Paul able to be with the disciples coming in and going out in Jerusalem (Acts 9:26-28). Therefore, the church cannot forgive or retain one's sins directly; it only declares that one's sins are forgiven or not forgiven before God, deciding if he may have fellowship and communion among the disciples.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. The Forgiveness to Restore Fellowship</H2><P>First John 2:1 and 2 say, "My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world." First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." We must be clear about the special emphasis of the Gospel of John and 1 John. The Gospel of John shows the gospel among men; whereas 1 John shows the gospel in the heart of God. The Gospel of John has two lines: grace and truth. When grace is mentioned, truth is also mentioned. First John also has two lines: God is love, and God is light. On the one hand, it speaks of love, and on the other hand, it speaks of light. What is the relationship between grace and truth, and love and light? Love is in God's heart. When it is expressed among men, it is grace. Light is in God's heart. When it is expressed among men, it is truth. The Gospel of John brings God to man, while 1 John brings man to God. The Gospel of John speaks of the matters of life, salvation, eternal life, and so forth; whereas 1 John speaks of fellowship, drawing near to God, and going to Him. The Gospel of John deals with the matter of salvation; whereas 1 John deals with the matter of fellowship with God. The beginning of 1 John speaks of the matter of fellowship, and chapters one and two speak on the forgiveness in this fellowship.</P><P>There are two kinds of relationships between God and us. One is a kindred relationship in that we are saved and are children of God. This relationship can never be broken. Let me ask: is a son no longer a son of his father because of his misbehavior? No. If a son does not want to be his father's son, can he stop being his father's son? No. If a father denies his son, is the son no longer a child of his? No. If you are a certain man's son, can someone else or even Satan annul this fact? No. We can respectfully say that even God cannot deny this fact. Therefore, after a person is regenerated and becomes a child of God, no one is able to overthrow this relationship. This relationship can never be severed. Nevertheless, there is another type of relationship which is subject to interruption. This is the relationship of fellowship. For example, although you are your father's son, if you do something wrong one day, you will be afraid to see your father for fear of his rebuke. The more serious the mistake, the more you will be afraid to see him. Though your family relationship can never be cut off, your communication with your father may be broken. Our relationship with God is the same. After we are saved, there is still the possibility that we will commit sins. Whenever we sin, our fellowship with God is immediately cut off. In order for the fellowship with God to be restored, our sins must be forgiven. If we commit sins we must, according to 1 John 1:9, "confess our sins." We must say, "O God, I was wrong in this matter; please forgive me." After confessing this way, our fellowship with God can be restored.</P><P>By what means are we cleansed from our sins? We are cleansed by the blood. Many Christians try to use time to wash their sins away, instead of applying the blood. How do they do this? Some may commit a sin and stay in their bad feelings for several days, thinking that God could not forgive them so quickly. After five or ten days, when their heart is at peace, they think that the sin is no more. They try to wash their sins away by using five or ten days instead of applying the blood. We must remember that forgiveness of sins comes by the blood, not by forgetting. We are not forgiven because we have forgotten our sins. Rather, the blood of His Son Jesus washes away all our sins. God can only forgive our sins under the blood.</P><P>Someone once asked a child what a person should do if he has sinned. The child answered, "He should do two things. First, he should feel sorrowful for several days, and second, he should be forgiven." The theology of this child is the theology of many people. It is also the thought of many older people. It seems that only if we suffer enough will we be forgiven; otherwise, we cannot be forgiven. Brothers and sisters, even if one suffers many days, he still cannot earn one percent of forgiveness. While we should have a sorrowful and penitent heart for our sins, our forgiveness does not depend upon our sorrow. Rather, it depends upon the blood of Jesus who saved us. If we confess our sins, God will forgive us through the blood of the Lord, and the fellowship between God and us will be restored.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. The Forgiveness in God's Discipline</H2><P>This concerns God's way of dealing with His children. What is God's administration? God's administration is God's method or way by which He deals with man. Let us read several portions of the Scripture.</P><P>Second Samuel 22:26 and 27 say, "With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful,/and with the upright man thou wilt show thyself upright./With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure;/and with the froward thou wilt show thyself unsavory." This shows the way of God's administration. God deals with us according to the way we are. Galatians 6:7 and 8 say, "Do not be deceived: God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap. For he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life." This also shows us God's principle in dealing with man. He who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh; but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life. Committing sin not only causes man to have a sinful record before God but also brings suffering as a consequence. The record of sins can be remitted by God, but suffering its consequence cannot be avoided. For example, a child may disobey his mother and steal candy all the time. If he is willing to repent, the sin of stealing can be forgiven, but his teeth may be ruined. Many times, even though the sins of God's children are forgiven, the consequences of those sins still remain. We gain eternal forgiveness as soon as we believe; we gain forgiveness for the restoration of fellowship as soon as we repent. But the consequence of God's discipline may be very hard.</P><P>For example, Samson was a judge, but he later fell and was ill-treated by the Philistines. Even though he cried to Jehovah in the end, saying, "O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes" (Judg. 16:28), and even though he killed more at his death than when he was alive, his eyes were never restored. His hair grew back again, and the fellowship between him and God was restored, but his ministry as a judge was not recovered.</P><P>Second Samuel 11 and 12 record the two most evil sins of David: adultery and murder. After David committed these sins, God sent the prophet Nathan to David to rebuke him. God judged these sins most severely. He said, "Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife...Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun" (12:10-12). This was the consequence of God's discipline for David. Even though he confessed his sin and Nathan told him, "The Lord also hath put away thy sin," David still had to bear the sufferings of God's discipline. David confessed his sins before God and was forgiven; his fellowship with God was restored. Discipline, however, still followed the forgiveness. He killed only one person, Uriah, but four of his sons died (the first being the one born to Bathsheba, and also Amnon, Absalom, and Adonijah). This is what God did with respect to righteousness. If we realize this, we will not dare to sin. God had to vindicate Himself by making it clear that He was displeased with David's conduct. If God had not disciplined David, the whole world would have said that Jehovah was pleased with David in committing these sins. God could forgive David, but He had to manifest His hatred for David's sin. We need to pay attention to the fact that if we sin against a brother, a sister, or someone, we must take care of the matter.</P><P>James 5:14 and 15 say, "Is anyone among you ill? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him." The forgiveness spoken of in these verses is the forgiveness in God's discipline. If it were eternal forgiveness, it could not be received through another's prayer of faith. Nor is it forgiveness to restore fellowship, because the forgiveness of fellowship can be obtained as soon as one confesses his sins. The forgiveness of discipline requires that one call for the elders of the church to pray for him. If the Lord gives the elders faith to pray for such a one, he will be healed.</P><P>Isaiah 53:5 says, "But He was pierced because of our transgressions; / He was crushed because of our iniquities; / The chastening for our peace was upon Him, / And by His stripes we have been healed." This verse touches four aspects. The first aspect concerns conduct; the second, one's condition before God; the third, the body; and the fourth is expressed in the sentence: "The chastening for our peace was upon Him." Concerning God's discipline, His chastening will continue even after one has repented. The Lord, however, has already been chastened for us; chastening is a part of the work of the Lord's crucifixion. Therefore, we may ask God to acquit us of our chastening since the Lord was already chastened on our behalf.</P><P>James 4:7 says, "Be subject therefore to God; but withstand the devil, and he will flee from you." First Peter 5:6 through 10 says, "Therefore be humbled under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in due time, casting all your anxiety on Him because it matters to Him concerning you. Be sober; watch. Your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking someone to devour. Him withstand, being firm in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are being accomplished among your brotherhood in the world. But the God of all grace, He who has called you into His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground you." Whenever we are being disciplined, we need to submit under the mighty hand of God and tell Him, "I will not resist what You are giving to me. Your treatment is what I deserve." We must, however, resist the devil. The minute we become careless, the devil will come and give us additional sufferings. While God scourges us, the devil will try to scourge us also. Therefore, we must resist the devil. Only when we submit ourselves under God's chastening can we resist the devil. On the one hand, we need to submit to God. On the other hand, we need to exercise our will daily to resist the devil, proclaiming that we refuse to be sick or weak.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>5. The Forgiveness of the Kingdom</H2><P>Concerning the forgiveness of the kingdom, Matthew 18:21 through 35 says, "Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times? Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven. For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who desired to settle accounts with his slaves. And when he began to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him. But since he did not have the means to repay, the master commanded him to be sold, as well as his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made. Then the slave fell down and worshipped him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you all. And the master of that slave was moved with compassion and released him and forgave him the loan. But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and he took hold of him and began to choke him, saying, Repay me what you owe. Then his fellow slave fell down and begged him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you. But he would not; instead, he went away and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed. Then his fellow slaves, seeing what had taken place, were greatly grieved and came and explained fully to their master all that had taken place. Then his master called him to him and said to him, Evil slave, all that debt I forgave you, because you begged me. Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave even as I had mercy on you? And his master became angry and delivered him to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed. So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts."</P><P>If we cannot differentiate between the various kinds of forgiveness in reading the Scripture, we will encounter difficulties. In this portion of the Scripture, if we do not distinguish what kind of forgiveness is spoken of here, we may think that our heavenly Father can nullify eternal forgiveness and that we can no longer be saved. We have to realize that this passage is not speaking of the previous four kinds of forgiveness; rather, it is speaking of the forgiveness of the kingdom. We shall receive this kind of forgiveness when the King settles His accounts with His slaves (v. 23). Concerning the church, God speaks of grace; but concerning the kingdom, it is a matter of responsibility. As regards the church, it is a matter of what the Lord has done and how He deals with man; but, as regards the kingdom, it is a matter of how we are trained before God. Concerning the kingdom, the judgment in the future depends upon the kind of living we have today. These verses speak of our responsibility. This is related to the kingdom of the heavens and reigning in the millennium, not to eternal salvation.</P><P>There are several parables concerning the kingdom in the four Gospels. Matthew 18:21 through 35 is one of them. The kingdom of the heavens is likened to a king who settles accounts with his slaves. One owed his master ten thousand talents and had no means to repay. He begged his master to have patience with him so that he could repay later. The master was moved with compassion and forgave him the loan. The same slave then went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii. Rather than forgive him, he cast him into prison until he would pay the debt. Afterward, other slaves told their master what had been done, and his master said to him, "Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave even as I had mercy on you?" After the Lord Jesus finished telling this parable, He explained its meaning. He said, "So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts." This refers to the forgiveness of the kingdom. This forgiveness is not obtained by every Christian, but only by those who forgive others. The first kind of forgiveness is received through believing in the Lord Jesus. The second kind of forgiveness is received through the declaration of the church. The third kind of forgiveness is received by confessing our sins to God. The fourth kind of forgiveness is received when God sees that the time of chastening is fulfilled, and He takes away the rod of discipline. The fifth kind of forgiveness can only be obtained as we pardon and forgive others from our hearts.</P><P>We know that the daily life and work of Christians on earth will be judged in the future. First the Lord will receive those who have overcome and are prepared into the air. After all the Christians are raptured, each one will be judged before the judgment seat of Christ. This judgment is not concerning the matter of salvation; it is a judgment to determine whether or not a Christian is worthy to participate in the kingdom. For those who are worthy, this will be the time to establish their position in the kingdom. There are two dangers one can face at the judgment seat: (1) being found unworthy to even enter the kingdom, and (2) even though being found worthy to enter the kingdom, being given a very low position.</P><P>How will God judge? The kingdom is God's reward to us. Reward is given according to our behavior. Although we cannot be saved through good behavior, we do need good behavior in order to be rewarded. Our salvation is due to faith, but our reward is due to good works.</P><P>A certain saint once said, "I pray that God will cleanse with the Lord's blood even the tears that I shed in sorrow for my sin! I still need to ask God to cleanse my repentance for my sin with the Lord's blood!" In the future, when we stand before the judgment seat, the flaming eyes of the Lord will examine our living and work from the day we were saved until that day. At that time, probably not many things will be deemed flawless in the eyes of the Lord. The works which many consider as superior may be judged as impure, improperly motivated, and quite mixed in the eyes of the Lord. Many "good" works may not appear so good in the eyes of the Lord.</P><P>If judgment is to begin from the house of God (1 Pet. 4:17), this judgment must be most severe. If so, who can pass this judgment? How we hope that God will have mercy upon us before the judgment seat, for even there, there is grace. This is what Matthew 18 speaks about. While it is true that God is absolutely righteous in His judgment, He is also forgiving. However, His forgiveness is based upon our forgiving others today. Suppose five people offend you, and you forgive them. Suppose another ten people offend you, and you forgive them again. Suppose you forgive everyone who has offended you. On that day, God will treat you justly. Since you have forgiven others, it is very just for God to forgive you at the judgment seat.</P><P>James 2:13 says, "For the judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment." If you show mercy toward others, God will have mercy on you. If you show no mercy toward others, God will have no mercy on you. If you are daily forbearing, do not try to find fault, and are generous with others, God will also forgive you on that day.</P><P>Daily we need to pay attention to these things: (1) examine our own behavior so that we will not fall under God's judging hand, and (2) have mercy toward and forgive others who may owe us much, so that we may obtain God's forgiveness in that day.</P><P>Matthew 7:1 and 2 say, "Do not judge, that you be not judged. For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you." The word "judgment" in this verse indicates that God will judge us in the same way that we judge others; this means that we will be judged by God on that day in the same manner that we judge our brothers today. For example, if we observe wrongdoing in a certain person and, rather than beseeching him in love, criticize him presumptuously and judge him severely, God will similarly judge us on that day. The way God will judge us on the day of judgment depends on how we treat others today. This is the meaning of the opening verses of Romans 2: "Therefore you are without excuse, O every man who judges, for in what you judge another you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things. But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who practice such things. And do you consider this, O man, who judge those who practice such things and do the same yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God?" (vv. 1-3).</P><P>Luke 6:38 puts it even more clearly: "Give, and it will be given to you; a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, they will give into your bosom. For with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you in return." If we give to others, God will give to us abundantly and richly repay us with a measure not only full to the brim but also running over. The amount of grace you give to others is the same amount of grace God will give to you in the future. If you treat others severely today, you should not expect God to treat you generously in the future. Therefore, every Christian should learn not to be a "judge" and should avoid judging others with self-righteousness. If we do not forgive others, we will receive the most severe punishment in the millennium. We are destined to have eternal life because salvation is eternal. But if we do not forgive others who offend us in this life, God will not forgive us in the future.</P><P>How can a nation be destroyed? How can a house fall? Is it not because it is divided against itself? Therefore, God will not allow two people in His kingdom to be divided against each other, nor will He permit hatred in the hearts of His people. God will not allow a ruler of five cities to be in conflict with the ruler of another five cities. He cannot use anyone who is not a peacemaker to rule a city. He can only hand them over to the tormentor until they have paid all their debts. How do they make payment? They must be willing to pardon and forgive others from their hearts. Sooner or later we must forgive others; so why wait until that day?</P><P>Matthew 6:14 and 15 say, "For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also; but if you do not forgive men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses." Matthew 5 through 7 speaks of the kingdom. Whoever does not forgive others shall not be forgiven by God. This forgiveness will affect his position in the kingdom. Whether or not he forgives will affect his being forgiven in the coming kingdom.</P><P>Today our God is testing us to see whether or not we are worthy to be kings in His kingdom and whether or not we are fit to govern in His kingdom. Do not think that serving in the church is a great thing; in the future, the things of the kingdom will be much greater. In the coming kingdom, God will give us higher and more glorious things to rule over. If we cannot manage small things today, we will not be able to handle great things in the future. If we cannot deal with things pertaining to this present life, how can we be qualified to judge angels in the future (1 Cor. 6:1-8). For the sake of that day, let us learn how to forgive others today.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FORTY-NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING DIFFERENT KINDS<br>OF SALVATION</H1><P>How many kinds of salvation are mentioned in the Bible? How are they explained?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>There are at least six kinds of salvation mentioned in the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. Eternal Salvation before God</H2><P>The first kind of salvation is eternal salvation before God, which we obtained the moment we believed in the Lord. This salvation involves our being delivered out of the judgment of sins, the curse of the law, the threat of death, the punishment of hell, and the power of Satan. Our trespasses have been forgiven, and we have been cleansed of our sins. We are justified, sanctified, and reconciled to God. This salvation also includes regeneration, receiving the eternal life of the Lord, the quickening of our spirit, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit within us. We receive this salvation entirely by the grace of God; it has nothing to do with our works. Ephesians 2:8 and 9 say, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast." Second Timothy 1:9 says, "Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages." Titus 3:5 says, "Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit." Acts 15:11 says, "But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus we are saved in the same way also as they are."</P><P>This eternal salvation was accomplished by our Lord Jesus. He is our Savior who came to die for us on the cross and bore our sins (1 Pet. 2:24), redeemed us out of the curse of the law (Gal. 3:13), and delivers us from the wrath which is coming (1 Thes. 1:10). By His death He destroyed the devil, who held the might of death (Heb. 2:14), and delivered us out of the authority of darkness (Col. 1:13) that we should not come into judgment, but pass out of death into life (John 5:24). By the resurrection of the Lord Jesus from the dead, we are born again, given eternal life, and become the children of God (1 Pet. 1:3; John 12:24). By the ascension of the Lord Jesus, we are brought near to God the Father so that we and the Father can have fellowship in the Holy of Holies (Heb. 9:12; 10:19-22), far above all the powers of darkness (Eph. 1:21). The Lord has accomplished all these matters. Our part is simply to believe and receive. "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name" (John 1:12). "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes, both to Jew first and to Greek" (Rom. 1:16). "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household" (Acts 16:31).</P><P>This kind of salvation is eternal. Once a person is saved, he is saved forever. "And having been perfected, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation" (Heb. 5:9). Since the salvation that the Lord has accomplished for us is eternal, our salvation is also eternal.</P><P>We can find at least twelve aspects in the Bible which confirm the security of our salvation and the fact that we shall not perish once we are saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>A. According to God's Will</H2><P>We have been made children of God and have received sonship not according to our condition but according to the predetermined will of God (Eph. 1:5). God has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His own purpose (2 Tim. 1:9). Our condition may change, but God's will never changes (Heb. 6:17). In eternity past, God determined that He would save us and not lose any of us (John 6:39). How then could we be saved and later unsaved? Our salvation is eternally secure in God's unchangeable purpose.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>B. According to God's Election</H2><P>Our election by God is neither accidental nor temporary. God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4). God chose us according to His purpose, not according to our works (Rom. 9:11). Furthermore, we did not chose the Lord, but He chose us (John 15:16). The Lord will never change. God's calling is irrevocable (Rom. 11:29). Therefore, our salvation is eternally secure and will never be changed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>C. According to God's Love</H2><P>We are saved because God loved us, not because we loved God (1 John 4:10). Our love may easily change, but God's love is deeper than the love of a mother (Isa. 49:15); it is eternal (Jer. 31:3), to the uttermost (John 13:1), and unchanging. This everlasting love of God assures us that His salvation can never be a matter of concern and never be lost.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>D. According to God's Grace</H2><P>We are not saved by ourselves nor by our works but by the grace of God (Eph. 2:8-9). Our self and works may change, but the grace of God is constant and unchanging. Therefore, our salvation is forever secure. Furthermore, God has saved us according to His grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages (2 Tim. 1:9). Our salvation is according to the riches of His grace (Eph. 1:7). The grace of God is sufficient and superabundant; it is able to bear all our burdens, meet all our needs, and save us to the uttermost.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>E. According to God's Righteousness</H2><P>God saved us not only because of His love and by His grace but also according to His righteousness. The Lord Jesus received the judgment of God's righteousness on the cross for us, thereby satisfying the requirement of God's righteousness. Consequently, God must save us if we believe. If God did not save us, He would fall into unrighteousness. The righteousness of God is revealed in His saving us (Rom. 1:16-17). We are justified by God, and God must save us because who can bring a charge against God's chosen ones? (8:33). Righteousness is the foundation of God's throne (Psa. 89:14) and is solid and unmovable. Our justification is based on the righteousness of God and, therefore, is eternally secure and unshakable.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>F. According to God's Covenant</H2><P>God has made a covenant to save us (Matt. 26:28; Heb. 8:8-13). Since this covenant cannot be altered (Psa. 89:34), neither can our salvation be changed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>G. According to God's Power</H2><P>"My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father's hand" (John 10:29). Since God is almighty, so is His power. Therefore, no one can snatch us out of His almighty hand. Our salvation is secure according to God's power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>H. According to God's Life</H2><P>The life of God is eternal. God has given us His eternal life so that we can become children of God. Thus, we have a life relationship with Him, an eternal relationship (John 3:16; 1 John 3:1). A life relationship can never be broken, and since we have the eternal life of God within us, we shall never perish (John 10:28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>I. According to God Himself</H2><P>God never changes, and with Him there is no shadow cast by turning (James 1:17; Mal. 3:6). How can the salvation we received from such a God ever change?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>J. According to Christ's Redemption</H2><P>The Lord has become the source of eternal salvation unto us (Heb. 5:9). "For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified" (10:14). What the Lord accomplished is eternal; therefore, our salvation is also eternal. Because of this accomplished fact, "Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us" (Rom. 8:34). No one can negate the Lord's redemption which He accomplished for us by His death and resurrection, and no one can condemn us. Therefore, our salvation is eternally secure.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>K. According to Christ's Power</H2><P>"And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand" (John 10:28). The Lord and God are one. He is equal with God; therefore, His hand is as powerful as God's hand. No one can snatch us out of the Lord's hand. His mighty hand makes our salvation eternally secure.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>L. According to Christ's Promise</H2><P>"All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out" (John 6:37). The Lord has promised that He will never cast out those who come to Him. Based on this promise, we have the assurance that our salvation is eternally secure.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. Salvation before Men</H2><P>"He who believes and is baptized shall be saved" (Mark 16:16). The salvation spoken of in this verse does not refer to eternal salvation, because the verse continues to say, "But he who does not believe shall be condemned." Since the first part says, "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved," we may wonder why the second part does not say, "He who does not believe and is not baptized shall be condemned." When the second part speaks of condemnation, it puts aside the matter of being baptized. This explains why "shall be saved" in the first part is not equal to "shall [not] be condemned" in the second part. Not being condemned is totally a matter of believing. Being saved requires us to believe and be baptized. Therefore, the salvation in Mark 16:16 does not refer to eternal salvation, which saves one from condemnation. What then does it refer to? It refers to the salvation before men. If a person only believes but is not baptized, he is not known in the eyes of men as a saved person, even though he may have the eternal life within him. He must rise up and be baptized, proclaiming to men that his sins have been forgiven and that he belongs to the Lord. Then men will know that he is saved. Baptism separates him from the worldly people. Therefore, the salvation of being baptized refers to the salvation before men.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Daily Salvation</H2><P>"So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling" (Phil. 2:12). We cannot work out our salvation by ourselves. By God's grace we freely received our salvation. But this verse says, "Work out your own salvation." Although we have been saved, in our daily living we must still live out the salvation that we have received. As soon as we believed in the Lord, we received the life of God. God is dwelling within us through the Holy Spirit. "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure" (v. 13). In our daily living we must live out the life of God. Day by day, moment by moment, we must live by obeying God who is operating within us. This cannot be accomplished quickly, but day after day we must live out our salvation with fear and trembling.</P><P>"Hence also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them" (Heb. 7:25). This also speaks of the Lord's saving us in our daily living. The Lord is now interceding before God for us, keeping us, and saving us until the day He comes.</P><P>In the matter of daily salvation, we should also be aware that the Lord wants us to pray daily, petitioning God to deliver us from the evil one (Matt. 6:13). Day by day and moment by moment, Satan is tempting us, luring us, attacking us, and trapping us. Therefore, we need to pray that the Lord would deliver us from Satan day by day and moment by moment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. Salvation from Tribulation</H2><P>There is another kind of salvation, in which God saves us out of tribulation. Paul said, "Who has delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us; in whom we have hoped that He will also yet deliver us" (2 Cor. 1:10). Deliverance does not refer to eternal salvation before God. The deliverance spoken of in this verse is a continuation of the preceding verses. In verses 8 and 9, Paul said that trouble came to him and his co-workers in Asia, so that they were excessively burdened, beyond their power, so that they despaired even of living. They even had the response of death in themselves. Yet God delivered them out from so great a trouble and so great a death. God had delivered them in the past, He was delivering them then, and they expected that He would deliver them in the future. God would deliver them from all the troubles in their circumstances.</P><P>"The angel of the Lord encamps/Around those who fear Him, and delivers them" (Psa. 34:7). God will send His angel to encamp round about those who fear Him to deliver them out of the troubles in their environment.</P><P>"For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ" (Phil. 1:19). "And I was delivered out of the lion's mouth. The Lord will deliver me from every evil work" (2 Tim. 4:17-18). This salvation also refers to salvation in troubled times. The Lord will deliver us from troubles and evil works.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>5. Salvation of the Body</H2><P>At the second coming of the Lord, our body will be redeemed, transformed, and conformed to His glorious body (Phil. 3:21). This too is called salvation in the Bible. It is the salvation of the body. "But we ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly awaiting sonship, the redemption of our body" (Rom. 8:23). Verse 24 says, "For we were saved in hope." "Saved" refers to "the redemption of our body" in verse 23. The redemption of our body will be achieved only at the time the Lord comes again. We must hope for this. At the time we believed in the Lord, we received eternal salvation; our spirit was made alive, but our body is still in the old creation groaning, laboring, restrained by corruption, and suffering illness and oldness. When the Lord comes, He will redeem and transform our body, the body that is restrained by the old creation, and He will bring it into the glorious freedom of the new creation.</P><P>"For now is our salvation nearer than when we believed" (Rom. 13:11). This also refers to the salvation of the body. We received the salvation of our spirit at the moment we believed. Our body will be saved in the future. Therefore, after we believe, the salvation of our body draws nearer and nearer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>6. The Salvation of the Soul</H2><P>Since our whole being is composed of three parts-spirit, soul, and body (1 Thes. 5:23), our salvation involves the salvation of these three parts. The salvation of our spirit occurred at the time we believed in the Lord, when we were regenerated by the Holy Spirit. When God forgave all our sins, the Holy Spirit entered into us and enlivened our deadened spirit. The salvation of our body will occur at the coming of the Lord. By His power the Lord will change our vile body into a glorious body. In addition to these two parts, our soul also needs to be saved. The salvation of our soul relates to entering into the millennial kingdom and reigning with the Lord. The Lord will reward us, and our soul will enjoy with Him the joy of the kingdom.</P><P>"For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it" (Matt. 16:25). "Save" in this verse does not refer to eternal salvation, which is received freely by believing. The salvation referred to here requires a price; one has to lose the soul and sacrifice the soul in order to gain the soul. This speaks of a person who, having been saved by the Lord, is willing to deny himself, take up his cross, and follow the Lord. He sacrifices his own soul for the Lord's sake, and by doing so, will enter into the millennial kingdom and participate in the joy of the Lord (25:21, 23). The soul is the part of our being where we perceive joy and sorrow. If we can endure the suffering and sacrifice temporary joy for the Lord's sake, when He comes we shall enter into the joy of the Lord. Man's soul is also his self. If we deny the self today for the Lord's sake, the Lord will give us something that is truly our own in the future (Luke 16:11-12).</P><P>"But whoever will lose his soul-life for My sake and the gospel's shall save it" (Mark 8:35). The Lord's sake and the gospel's sake always go together and are inseparable. Whether it is for the Lord or for the gospel, if we sacrifice the soul and its pleasure in this age, our soul will gain special joy in the coming kingdom age; that is, we will reign with the Lord and enjoy the joy of the Lord in glory.</P><P>"Whoever seeks to preserve his soul-life will lose it, and whoever loses it will preserve it alive" (Luke 17:33). Believers who preserve their soul and the pleasure of their soul in this age will lose the joy during the kingdom age. Whosoever will lose his soul and its pleasure in this age, will save his soul and have the enjoyment in the coming kingdom.</P><P>"But he who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved" (Matt. 10:22). "In your endurance you will possess your souls" (Luke 21:19). If believers can endure to the end in persecution, they will gain the reward from the Lord. By then, their souls will not suffer but will participate in joy.</P><P>"But we are not of those who shrink back to ruin but of them who have faith to the gaining of the soul" (Heb. 10:39). The faith spoken of in this verse is the faith we receive after we are saved. It is not the initial faith but the faith by which we walk. It is not faith for life, but faith for our living. If we can walk the Lord's way by faith and live a victorious life after being saved, our soul will be saved in the future, and we will have a portion in the glory and joy of the kingdom.</P><P>"Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls" (1 Pet. 1:9). This "faith" is also the faith which we receive and live by after we are saved. This faith enables us to be kept by God and overcomes difficulties and trials. It will bring about the salvation that God has prepared and will be manifested when the Lord comes back. This is to be delivered from all sufferings and enjoy the joy of glory.</P><P>"Therefore putting away all filthiness and the abundance of malice, receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls" (James 1:21). The salvation of the soul is not the same as the salvation of the spirit. For the salvation of the spirit, we do not need to do anything; just by believing and receiving, we obtain it. However, the salvation of the soul requires that we put away all filthiness and malice in our conduct and receive the implanted word in meekness.</P><P>"The Lord...will save me into His heavenly kingdom" (2 Tim. 4:18). "For doing these things you shall by no means ever stumble. For in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly and bountifully supplied to you" (2 Pet. 1:10-11). The salvation of the soul is the salvation into the kingdom of the heavens- the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION FIFTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING SANCTIFICATION</H1><P>What is the meaning of sanctification? How are we sanctified?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Regarding sanctification, we have to look at the following three points:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. The Meaning of Sanctification</H2><P>From the Old Testament to the New Testament, from Genesis to Revelation, sanctification means to be separated unto something. It means to be separated out and to belong to someone else. This is the biblical meaning of sanctification.</P><P>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast; it is mine" (Exo. 13:1-2). All the firstborn of Israel were God's. They all needed to be separated, and a declaration needed to be made that they were sanctified and belonged to Jehovah. Therefore, sanctification means to be separated unto God. When man offers anything to God, whatever is offered is separated and sanctified unto Him (Lev. 27:14; 2 Sam. 8:11). The Lord Jesus was sanctified by the Father (John 10:36) and is the Holy One (Luke 1:35). The Lord is different from any other man because He is the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father (John 1:18), and He is holy. Those who believe in the Lord are called saints (Acts 9:13), which means that they are separated unto God.</P><P>While the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He asked the Pharisees a question. In the Old Testament times when a man offered a gift, did the gift sanctify the altar, or did the altar sanctify the gift? (Matt. 23:19-20). It is wrong to say that the gift sanctifies the altar. Rather, the altar sanctifies the gift. When a gift is put on the altar it belongs to God. Before offering the gift on the altar it belongs to man, but once it is offered on the altar it belongs to God. This does not mean that the thing itself has changed in any way but that it has been absolutely separated unto God; therefore, it becomes holy. In the Old Testament, after all the things belonging to the tabernacle were anointed, they became holy. The things themselves did not change, but after they were wholly separated unto God's use, they became holy. The New Testament also shows that the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife, the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband, and the unbelieving children are sanctified by the believing parents (1 Cor. 7:14). The people do not change in themselves, yet they become separated and are sanctified because of their believing husband, wife, or parents.</P><P>God purchased us through the blood of the Lord Jesus. Therefore, we do not belong to anyone else; we cannot be anyone else's. We belong to God Himself; we are only His.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. The Position of Sanctification before God</H2><P>When a Christian receives the Lord, not only is he forgiven of his sins and justified; he is also sanctified before God. God is holy. Without holiness man cannot see God, fellowship with God, or pray to God. Righteousness is the way in which God works; holiness is God's nature. The forgiveness of sins is according to righteousness. Without the forgiveness of sins man cannot be saved, and without holiness no one can see God (Heb. 12:14). Sanctification does not relate to sins; it relates to being separated unto God. Every Christian is sanctified in Christ, and he can therefore come to God.</P><P>The book of Romans speaks about justification, but the book of Hebrews speaks about sanctification. Romans deals with righteousness, and Hebrews deals with holiness. Romans speaks of the throne, and Hebrews speaks of the Holy of Holies. Romans speaks of the guilt of sin before God, and Hebrews speaks of the defilement of man before God. Being forgiven and justified is taking away man's sins so that he can stand before God; yet, without holiness man cannot enjoy God's presence and fellowship with God in the Holy of Holies.</P><P>Romans tells us that although we are sinners, God has forgiven our sins and justified us through the death of His Son. Hebrews tells us that although our bodies are unclean, the blood of the Son of God has cleansed us and that by His blood we are able to enter into the Holy of Holies and have fellowship with God. We can enter boldly into the Holy of Holies through the blood of the Lord Jesus (Heb. 10:19).</P><P>How much does sanctification include? The gospel of God always draws forth hallelujahs. God is holy. Holiness is the highest expression of God's glory. If we are anything less than holy, we cannot be in God's presence. But we are as holy as Christ is when we are in Him. We can come before God because God sees us in the same way that He sees Christ. Thank God, the salvation of Jesus Christ is complete and eternal. If it were not complete, God's righteousness would not be upon us. If it were not eternal, we would not be separated and sanctified unto God eternally. But the salvation of Jesus Christ is complete and eternal (Heb. 10:14). Therefore, we can obtain eternal forgiveness, be sanctified unto God, and remain forever in God's presence.</P><P>"To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours" (1 Cor. 1:2). Paul wrote this letter to those in Corinth who were sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints. We are not going to be saints, because when we were called, we were already saints sanctified unto God. Once we are called and saved, we are sanctified in Christ and are called saints.</P><P>What kind of believers were the Corinthians? They ate and drank their own food before they partook of the Lord's supper, so that while they were overly filled or even drunk, others came in hungry (1 Cor. 11:20-22). Yet Paul acknowledged that they were sanctified in Christ Jesus and were "called saints." Moreover, gross sin had been committed among them, even the taking of one's stepmother (5:1). Yet Paul still said that they were sanctified in Christ Jesus. They were boastful; nonetheless, Paul still said that they were sanctified in Christ Jesus. Therefore, sanctification in the Bible does not refer to outward behavior. Sanctification is different from what is spoken of Romans 5-8. What is mentioned there is the fruit of sanctification and not sanctification itself. Romans says that no one should be a slave to sin but that everyone should offer his members as slaves to righteousness and bear the fruit of sanctification (6:13, 17-22). Our sanctification is based upon the fact that when Jesus Christ died, He joined us to Himself. This is sanctification. The tree and the fruit of the tree are different. The tree is the tree, and the fruit is the fruit. Similarly, sanctification and the fruit of sanctification are different. Sanctification is one thing, and the fruit of it is another. The believers at Corinth had the position of sanctification, but they did not yet bear the fruit of sanctification. Therefore, Paul rebuked them in his letter and showed them that since they had the position of sanctification, they should also bear the fruit of sanctification (2 Cor. 7:1).</P><P>"But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption" (1 Cor. 1:30). This verse says that Christ Jesus became our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Just as Christ Jesus is righteous and sanctified before God, we are righteous and sanctified in Christ. Our sanctification before God cannot be any less than that of Christ Jesus. Praise God that our sanctification before God is not because of our righteous behavior or experience of Christ; it is because Christ has become our sanctification before God, and His sanctification has become our sanctification.</P><P>"And these things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God" (1 Cor. 6:11). According to this passage, sanctification comes before justification. We were sanctified and justified. Paul said that we have already been sanctified and justified. Do you have sanctification and justification yet? If you ask a Christian if he has been justified, he will boldly say yes. If you ask him if he is a righteous person, he may dare to answer yes. But if you ask him if he is a saint, he will most likely not dare to say yes. But the Bible tells us that we are already sanctified. God has not only forgiven our sins and justified us, but He also reckons us as worthy, as being saints because of the Lord Jesus Christ. In God's eyes, we are qualified and worthy. However, when our eyes are turned to ourselves, we lose the enjoyment of this relationship.</P><P>"By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all" (Heb. 10:10). Our sanctification is based on Jesus Christ offering His own body. He did it once, and it was accomplished forever. "For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified" (v. 14). Thank God that our sanctification is because of Christ and is perfected forever. Some are afraid to come to God because they sense their filthiness. Indeed, we are filthy, easily contaminated, unchaste, and unfaithful to God. But we are holy because of Christ and not because of our own work. Since Christ offered His own body once, we are sanctified forever, and our position before God is holy. Whenever we stand on this position and come to God through Christ, God sees us as holy in Christ and accepts us as He has accepted Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Bearing the Fruit of Sanctification</H2><P>"But according to the Holy One who called you, you yourselves also be holy in all your manner of life" (1 Pet. 1:15). The Lord is holy, and since we have already been called, we are holy in position as well. Nevertheless, in our daily living, in our behavior, we should be holy also. How can we possibly be holy before God and yet unholy before men? Our daily living must express that we are a holy people separated and sanctified unto God.</P><P>"But now, having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, eternal life" (Rom. 6:22). Thank God that having been freed from sin and separated unto God, we are enslaved to God and should have our fruit unto sanctification. We should not offer the members of our body to lawlessness and unrighteousness. Instead, we should offer our members to righteousness and should belong wholly to God so that we can be slaves of God and bear the fruit of sanctification.</P><P>"Therefore since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and of spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God" (2 Cor. 7:1). We should remove anything that defiles our body and spirit and anything that is not of God, and we should bear the fruit of sanctification in the fear of God.</P><P>"Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth" (John 17:17). To be sanctified in the truth is to bear the fruit of sanctification daily. This truth is the word of God. Daily as we compare our conduct with God's truth, any conduct that is not sanctified unto God should be done away with by the word of God so that we may be cleansed. This is a matter of daily progress and cannot be accomplished all at once. This is the work of the Holy Spirit, which He performs day by day in our living, according to the truth.</P><P>Some say that sanctification is a sudden matter and that we can be sanctified instantly. This is impossible. There are indeed sudden experiences of victory over sins. We do have sudden experiences of victory over sins, but we cannot call this sanctification. Sanctification means to be separated unto God. Instant victory over sins is deliverance. An erroneous interpretation will produce an erroneous result.</P><P>"For they disciplined for a few days as it seemed good to them; but He, for what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness" (Heb. 12:10). Discipline is another way for us to bear the fruit of sanctification. When we go astray, God will guide us back to the path of holiness by His discipline so that we may be partakers of His holiness and may belong wholly to Him.</P><P>Finally, let us see that the fruit of sanctification is not only a matter of our conduct but also a matter of our experience of drawing near to God and fellowshipping with Him. "Pursue...sanctification, without which no one will see the Lord" (Heb. 12:14). Although positionally we are holy and can boldly enter into the Holy of Holies to have intimate fellowship with God, if we do not sincerely and faithfully stand on the position of sanctification at all times, we may feel that we cannot touch God. Therefore, we must follow and pursue after holiness, without which no one will see the Lord.</P><P>"And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is He who calls you, who also will do it" (1 Thes. 5:23-24).</P></body></html>
