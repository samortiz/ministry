   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>First Corinthians 15:42-44 shows us that when a Christian dies, he is not buried, but is "sown."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We know that to sow something and to bury something are two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, when you bury a piece of copper in the ground, that is all there is to it; it will not grow up again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But if you sow a grain of wheat into the ground, it will grow after a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a Christian dies, he is not like a piece of copper buried in the ground, but like a grain of wheat sown into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One day he will spring up again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He can spring up again because he has the life of Christ within him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This life is a life that cannot be imprisoned by death, because the life of Christ is the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This life is in the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why he will resurrect one day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because Christ is our redemption, He will make us grow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ will not be imprisoned by death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A regenerated Christian has Christ within him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is his redemption, and he will inherit a resurrected body which is incorruptible, glorious, strong, and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because Christ is our redemption, some Christians will not see death, but will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There was a young girl who once asked a preacher, "Does it not take a great effort for a Christian to be raptured away?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For a child, the rapture takes great effort.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But we know that the rapture is not something according to our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A Christian is raptured because Christ is in him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is his redemption, and Christ will take him away.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ as our life is the foundation of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first step in our salvation is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The last step in our salvation is the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But from beginning to end, the basis is Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The relationship between Christ and us is a life relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, it is an indissoluble relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ does not become something outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He has come into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A relationship in life is an indissoluble relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we have not received Christ as our life, we have nothing to do with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But since we have received Christ as our life, we have an indissoluble relationship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After Adam sinned, God immediately guarded the way of the tree of life with the cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way Gen 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He did this because if Adam had eaten the fruit of the tree of life, he would have bonded an indissoluble relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thank God that our relationship with Christ is a relationship which Adam did not have; it is an indissoluble relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even God Himself cannot dissolve this relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This life lives in us all the time, and it is bringing us into glory, into eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What a great power this is!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What a glorious hope this is!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May the Lord open our eyes to see that God has put us into Christ and made Christ our wisdom: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May the Lord show us that of all the gifts He has given us, none is greater than His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May the Lord show us that Christ is the gift and also all the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is the singular gift and also the plural gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to learn to know Christ as our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to learn to know Christ as our righteousness, we have to learn to know Christ as our sanctification, and we have to learn to know Christ as our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May the Lord deliver us from foolishness and darkness so that we realize that there is no matter or thing in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All we have is just Christ.</S>
