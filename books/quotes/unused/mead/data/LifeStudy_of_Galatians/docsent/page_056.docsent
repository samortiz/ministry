   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Baptized into Christ and Putting On Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are both sons of Abraham and sons of God because we have been baptized into Christ and have put on Christ 3:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To believe is to believe into Christ John 3:16 , and to be baptized is to be baptized also into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Faith in Christ brings us into Christ and makes us one with Christ, in whom is the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must be identified with Christ through faith so that in Him we may be sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By both faith and baptism, we have been immersed into Christ, we have thus put on Christ, and we have become identified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although we all have a natural life with a natural ancestry, we need not live any longer according to that life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, we may live by the divine life with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By living according to this life, we are in reality the sons of God and the sons of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have been baptized into Christ, the unique seed who has fulfilled God s promise to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We and Christ have been joined in a marvelous organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because of this union, we are sons of God and sons of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here in this organic union we inherit the promise which has been fulfilled by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, Christ Himself is this inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The promise we inherit is the promise we now enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>E. All One in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Galatians 3:28 says, There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here we see that the sons of Abraham are all one in Christ, without any natural status.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Christ there are no differences among races and nationalities, in social rank, or between the sexes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>F. Included in Abraham s Only Seed</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Galatians 3:29 says, And if you are Christ s, then you are Abraham s seed, heirs according to promise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abraham s seed is only one, Christ v. 16 . Hence, to be Abraham s seed we must be Christ s, a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because we are one with Christ, we are also Abraham s seed, heirs according to promise, inheriting God s promised blessing, which is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed God to be our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Under the New Testament, the believers as God s chosen people, being sons of full age, are such heirs, not under law but in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Judaizers who remained under law and kept themselves apart from Christ were, like Ishmael 4:23 , Abraham s descendants according to flesh, not, like Isaac 4:28 , his heirs according to promise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the believers in Christ are such heirs, inheriting the promised blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, we should remain in Christ and not turn to law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the law is unable to give us life 3:21 , it cannot produce the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the Spirit that is received by faith 3:2 and that gives us life 2 Cor 3:6 can produce the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Law kept God s chosen people under its custody until faith came 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Faith in Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit makes God s chosen people Abraham s seed as the stars of the heavens Gen 22:17 according to God s promise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we are in a position to see a brief sketch of Galatians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This chapter reveals that God intended to give the promise to Abraham according to His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before this promise was accomplished, the law was given to serve as the custodian of God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then, at the appointed time, Christ, the promised seed, came to fulfill God s promise to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Christ came, the fulfillment of God s promised blessing also came.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, grace came with Christ and with the fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All this is on God s side.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On our side, we need a way to apprehend, realize, and grasp all that Christ, the seed, has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, we need a spiritual camera to photograph the scenery of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This camera is our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, with the coming of grace on God s side, there is also the coming of faith on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now that we have grace, faith, and the seed which has fulfilled the promise, we no longer need the law to serve as our custodian.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, the law should be set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It should no longer have any place in the scenery.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must turn from the law, the custodian, and stay with Christ, the One who has fulfilled the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Of course, this means we should also stay with grace and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we shall be included in Christ, the unique seed, to inherit the fulfilled promise and to enjoy the blessing of the promise to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This blessing is the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
