   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Today's reformed theology teaches people that God has predestinated us, and if we believe, His salvation will be accomplished in us.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hence, once we are saved, whatever we do afterward is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We were chosen by God and have believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From now on we can be at peace without worry; we can go dancing, gambling, or do whatever we like.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To some extent, the reformed theologians know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They see that we were chosen by God in eternity past and that God's selection and calling are forever irrevocable Rom 11:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, they neglect the matter of the kingdom, thinking that as long as a person believes, everything is settled; he is eternally saved and will go to heaven after his death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because of this, after they have been saved, many people live a life of indulging in their lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because this kind of pitiful situation has been going on for almost two thousand years, the Lord's calling in Revelation for overcomers is still going on today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christians read the Bible, but they altogether overlook the fact that, in its last book, the Bible uses two long chapters to call for the overcomers seven times, saying that he who overcomes will be rewarded Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 26-28; 3:5, 12, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Revelation even warns us that if we do not overcome, we will be hurt by the second death 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be cast into the lake of fire to suffer eternal torment is the second death 20:11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Anyone who is genuinely saved will not suffer the second death; they will not be cast into the lake of fire to suffer eternal torment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, if the believers are defeated in this age, they will be hurt by the lake of fire in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is to be hurt by the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In his book The Gospel of God, Brother Nee pointed out clearly that to be hurt by the second death is to be hurt by the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Certainly, our salvation is eternally secured.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, if we do not overcome in this age, one day we will still suffer being hurt by the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the clear revelation of the Word, yet it is neglected by many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do we also ignore and are we also indifferent concerning the warning of the Bible and the Lord's call to the overcomers?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Recently, I have often repented and prayed, "Lord, I am in fear and trembling about one thing, that is, that from the past until the present, I am still not an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lord, I pray that You would give me a few more years and measure to me another length of time in which I can exercise to become one of Your overcomers."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today we dare not say who are overcomers and who are not.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can only wait for His return when we will stand before His judgment seat, and He will judge whether we have overcome or have been defeated 2Cor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>5:10; Rom 14:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The overcoming ones will enter into the kingdom with Him to reign as kings; the defeated ones will go to the outer darkness to be chastened for one thousand years Matt 25:21, 23, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sooner or later we all have to mature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do not mature in this age, we will be put into the darkness in the coming age to be chastised so that we may become mature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After the one thousand years, all the believers will have become mature to be the overcomers Rev 21:7 , who will be qualified to participate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The New Jerusalem in the kingdom age is of a small scale, being constituted only with the overcomers in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After the kingdom is over, after the majority of the believers as the defeated ones have suffered chastisement in the darkness, they will have become mature and will be qualified to participate in the New Jerusalem in its consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the pure revelation of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In His seven epistles to the degraded churches, Christ is calling the defeated believers to be His overcomers by Himself as the sevenfold intensified Spirit for their experience of His organic salvation in His sevenfold intensification.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I can testify that this is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It has not been until recent years, especially the last three years, that I know in a deep way what God's organic salvation is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, this organic salvation is strengthening me from within.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In such a sevenfold-intensified organic salvation, we can become overcomers by Christ as the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
