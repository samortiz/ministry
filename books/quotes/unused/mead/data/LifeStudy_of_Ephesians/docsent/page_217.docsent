   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SEVENTY-FIVE GOD S ECONOMY CHRIST WITH THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:5, 9-11, 22-23; 3:2-4, 9-11; John 15:1, 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s economy is Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we consider God s economy as revealed in the book of Ephesians, we need to pray that the Lord will give us an open heaven with a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we would know God s economy, not only must we have the knowledge of the book of Ephesians; we must also touch the reality contained in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are not for mere knowledge we are for reality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reality in the book of Ephesians is God s economy concerning Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>SOME IMPORTANT TERMS Economy</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In relation to God s purpose, the word economy is unfamiliar to many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Greek word for economy, oikonomia , is used three times in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1:10 Paul speaks of a dispensation, or economy, of the fullness of the times, in which all things will be headed up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 3:2 he speaks of the stewardship of the grace of God, and in 3:9, of the dispensation of the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The English word economy is an anglicized form of oikonomia, which means administration, stewardship, arrangement, or dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In particular, in this sense economy denotes dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God s economy is to dispense Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Apart from Himself, God has nothing to dispense into His chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, His economy is to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is altogether related to Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Will</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Besides the term economy, a number of other important terms are used by Paul in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Three times in chapter one Paul mentions God s will: the good pleasure of His will v. 5 , the mystery of His will v. 9 , and the counsel of His will v. 11 . God has an economy because He has a will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In eternity God planned a will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This will was hidden in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, it was a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In His wisdom and prudence He has made this hidden mystery known to us through His revelation in Christ, that is, through Christ s incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Good Pleasure</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Another important term is good pleasure 1:5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has a will in which is His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This good pleasure refers to the delight of God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The book of Ephesians speaks from the standpoint of the good pleasure of God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to 1:9 and 10, God s good pleasure is what He has purposed in Himself for an administration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In human terms, God s good pleasure is that which makes Him happy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is something within God s heart that pleases Him and makes Him happy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is God s good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not think that the term good pleasure is insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the contrary, it is a very important term in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Ephesians the word purpose is used three times, twice as a noun and once as a verb.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1:11 Paul says that we have been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who operates all things according to the counsel of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 3:11 Paul speaks of the purpose of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The purpose of the ages is the purpose of eternity, the eternal purpose, the eternal plan of God made in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 1:9 the word purpose is used as a verb: Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God has a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here the word purpose is the equivalent of the English word plan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God has a plan which He made in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God has a plan because He has a will, a good pleasure, and an economy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to His economy, He made a plan, a purpose.</S>
