   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOOD AND DRINK Before the Fall</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every herb that produces seed...and every tree which has fruit that produces seed Gen 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before the fall God ordained that man eat herbs and the fruit of trees.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man ate vegetables and could not eat meat.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After the Fall</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; just as I gave you the green herb Gen 9:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the fall of man God ordained that animals as well as vegetables could be food for man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In other words, after the fall both meat and vegetables could be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The purpose of eating is to maintain life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The meat that we eat as food comes from the killing of animals, and in the Bible this symbolizes Christ being killed that we might obtain life and live.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, in brief, meat symbolizes redemption through the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>While meat symbolizes redemption through the shedding of blood, vegetables symbolize works without the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before man fell, man could eat only vegetables to maintain his life, symbolizing that man was without sin and could live before God without the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But after the fall and the entrance of sin Rom 5:12 , man needs the shedding of blood for redemption in order to live before God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This need is symbolized by God telling man to eat meat after the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In contrast, Satan tells people to eat only vegetables.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Satan s hidden and crafty intention in telling people to eat only vegetables is to cause them to reject the requirement of the shedding of blood for redemption and to instead rely on their works in order to live.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Alas, vegetarians do not have this realization!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Satan influences what people eat by promoting self-denial.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who are tricked by Satan into being vegetarians not only practice self-denial but also rely on self-denial.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, Buddhism emphasizes self-denial and relies on self-denial.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Consequently, Buddhism also emphasizes and promotes vegetarianism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once we see Satan s intention in this matter, we should not be influenced by the thought or practice of vegetarianism; instead, as those who eat meat, we should declare that we are sinners in need of the blood that Christ shed for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Its blood, you shall not eat Gen 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although God ordained that man could eat meat after the fall, He did not allow man to eat blood.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Blood is needed for the redemption of human life because life is in the blood Lev 17:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Lord Jesus came, He told us to drink His blood because only His blood redeems us and enables us to obtain His life John 6:53-56; Matt 26:27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to typology, blood redeems man, but in reality only the blood of Jesus can take away the sin of man Heb 9:12; 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we can eat only the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God commands man not to eat blood in order to show that the shedding of blood is for the redemption of sin and to show that only the blood of the Lord Jesus can take away man s sin.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man could eat both vegetables and meat Lev 10:12-14; Deut 12:17-18, 20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the dispensation of the law, man s failure to keep God s requirements exposed his weakness, sin, and inability to be justified by works of law, showing that, in reality, man could be redeemed and live before God only through the shedding of blood.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to Acts 11:5-12, this signifies that God wants His people to discern between clean and unclean people in their relationships and dealings with others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Clean animals represent people with whom His people can deal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These include animals that have divided hooves and that chew the cud Lev 11:2-8, 26-28 , fish that have fins and scales vv.</S>
