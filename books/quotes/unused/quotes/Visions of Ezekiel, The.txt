Through the redemption of Christ, man gained access to the tree of life again, to take the tree of life as his food
If we go then from John's Gospel to John's Revelation, we can see that all the redeemed ones are built up together into one city
Eventually, chapter forty-eight tells us that we who have His life will all be built up together into the holy city, Jerusalem
By the divine nature with the divine image, we all will be built up together as one eternal dwelling place the New Jerusalem
These two books not only have the term life, but also have visions portraying what life is and how life is working within us and among us
Both of these books tell us how God's intention is to come into us to be our life, that we may have His divine nature and His glorious image
The first section of Ezekiel, which is all of chapter one, presents a vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord
It reveals how God is manifested, how God moves, and how God administrates His government through the four living creatures
In the second section from chapter two through chapter thirtytwo God comes as the consuming fire to judge His people and the heathen nations
The fourth section, concerning the holy building of God, comes out of the recovery by life and consummates the whole book
The Gospel of John begins in this way: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
If we study the whole of Scripture, though, we can be clear that the thirtieth year means the thirtieth year of Ezekiel's life
According to Numbers 4:2-3 and 1 Chronicles 23:3, a priest, a Levite, started to serve the Lord when he was thirty
We discover a principle: to realize spiritual things and to see heavenly visions, we need the maturity of life
Others may be twelve years of age and others even fifteen years of age, but not many have reached the age of thirty in spiritual maturity
These four corner courts are the places for the priests to prepare the offerings for the people to eat and enjoy
These three layers, or three stories, signify the three persons of the Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
The number thirty means that the creatures have the Triune God added to them so that they can bear responsibility
The thirtieth year was counted from the year of his birth, but the fifth year was counted from the year of captivity
Why did the visions come in the fifth year of the captivity and not in the first year or the second or the third?
Ezekiel, being under the age of thirty, was not ready; likewise, the people also were not ready until they had been in captivity five years
One chapter says they started to serve when they were twenty-five, and another chapter says they started to serve when they were thirty
He did not see the visions at the beginning of his apprenticeship, but at the end of his apprenticeship, when he had fully matured
That was the very place where Ezekiel saw the visions the place where Satan started a great rebellion against God among the fallen people
The river Chebar carried the people of God away from God, but the river flowing out of the temple brought people into God's life
If you are still in the trend of today's world, you are not by the river of the living water, but by the river Chebar
One is the river that carries people away from God, and the other is the river which brings people back to God
One is the river which destroys the building of God, and the other is the river which is for the building up of God's dwelling place
The Lord told Ezekiel that He would make his face stronger than their faces and his forehead stronger than theirs
On one hand, he was the son of Buzi, despised by others, but on the other hand, he was Ezekiel, strengthened by God
The first time that the Bible mentions the heavens being opened was when Jacob was wandering in his attempt to escape from his brother, Esau
When the Lord Jesus was baptized, the heavens were opened to declare that there was a man on the earth who was one with God in the heavens
In the land of captivity, there was also a man, Ezekiel, who was mature and one with God so that the heavens were opened to him
If you minister a lot, and nothing happens, this means you have a babbling mouth, but God's hand is not working
Oh, today we need the heavens opened; we need the vision coming to us; we need the word to come expressly; and we need God's hand to follow!
There it says that the lifting up, the promotion, comes not from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south, but that God judges
In the King James Version, this same Hebrew word, ruach, is translated into all three of these words in Ezekiel 37
It is very difficult for the translators to decide whether in a certain verse it means the wind, the breath, or the spirit
By His staying as a cloud, He is covering, overshadowing, and brooding to give us the enjoyment of His presence
Whenever we experience God as the blowing wind, we also have the sensation that He is overshadowing, covering, and brooding over us
All day long you had the sensation that something was following you, covering you, brooding over you, and overshadowing you
Lord burn out my disposition burn out my intention burn out my selfaim burn out my motives burn out my goal burn out this and burn out that
No one can experience the Lord as the blowing wind, covering cloud, and as the burning fire without having a real change and transformation
Burn out my self my disposition my attitudes my goals my aims my motives my intentions my relationships with other people my worldliness
Darby says in his note on Ezekiel 1:4 that some would suggest that electrum is a kind of shining metal, a mixture of gold and silver
In Genesis 1 He was solely God having nothing of the element of redemption within Him but in Revelation He is the redeeming God the LambGod
We experience the blowing wind; next we enjoy the covering cloud; then we experience the burning and consuming fire
We must experience God as the spiritual wind, as the overshadowing cloud, as the burning fire, as the Lamb, and as the glowing electrum
When people look upon us they can see the wind; they can see the cloud; they can see the fire; and they can see the electrum
Always there has been the blowing, the covering, the burning, and then the receiving of something as the electrum
The wind brings in the cloud; the cloud enfolds the fire; and the fire produces the electrum plus something more
The word 'living' in Hebrew has the same root as the word 'life' in Genesis 2, where it refers to the tree of life
It says that the Lord has redeemed us from four sources: from every kindred, every tongue, every people, and every nation
We as the four living creatures are not only the unique expression of Christ, but also the complete expression of Christ
We were the first man by birth; we became the new man by regeneration; and now there is the prospect that we may become the manchild
Remember that the subtle one tempted the first man by telling him that if he would take of the tree of knowledge, he would be like God
Because He was tired and thirsty, He asked His disciples to go into the city to buy something to eat, while He rested
All the people working in your office should know that if they talk to you about going to a movie, you will behave like a lion
You must learn to behave yourself not only like a proper man or like a bold lion, but also like a serving, suffering ox
These four faces the face of a man, the face of a lion, the face of an ox, and the face of an eagle simply portray the life of Christ
As Christians, we must be the living creatures who are a corporate entity, expressing Christ exactly as He was on earth
Surely the wings are the wings of an eagle because, of the creatures represented by the four faces, only the eagle has wings
Corinthians 4:7 says that we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may not be of us, but of God
Paul also said that he had the confidence in his conscience that all his conduct on the earth was not by his wisdom, but by the grace of God
Paul was happy to boast in his weaknesses in order that the power of Christ might rest upon him and overshadow him
We all must bear the four wings on the four sides, showing people that whatever we do and whatever we are is not by ourselves, but by God
Two of his wings are stretched forth to join to the other living creatures, and two of his wings are wrapped around his body for a cover
We have the four wings of an eagle, giving people the impression that we have God with us as our power and our protection
Some say they have faith in the almighty God to supply all their needs, hence there is no need for them to use their hands to do anything
Sometimes young people imagine that because they are seeking the Lord, there is no need for them to study hard
No matter how much you seek the Lord, no matter how much you love Him and care for Him, you still must study hard to prepare your lessons
Many so-called religious people seem to have only the eagle's wings; they do not seem to have the hands of a man
We must have the wings of the Lord's empowering grace and the hands of a man, cooperating with God in a human way
While we can apply the boldness of a lion to our Christian character, we should not apply the lion's paws to the Christian walk
If one is walking with the claws of an eagle, we always must be careful because sooner or later he may hurt us
During the last six days before the Lord Jesus was crucified He went to Jerusalem and was surrounded by the leaders of religion and politics
They knew that if they said the baptism of John came from the heavens, He would ask them why they did not believe him
If on the other hand, they said that it was not from the heavens, the people would stone them because they considered John to be a prophet
Not only was the Lord Jesus so straight, but also the Apostle Paul was very straight, frank, faithful, and honest
The clean cattle such as the cow and the sheep have two characteristics: the chewing of the cud and the dividing of the hoof
When we talk of feet as shining brass, we must remember Revelation 1:15, where it tells us that the Lord Jesus' feet are like shining brass
By having this kind of life and this kind of walk, we as the living creatures can be coordinated into one entity
We need a life that has the wings of an eagle and the hands of a man, and we must have a walk that has the straight hoofs of a calf
No other verses in the entire Bible reveal coordination in such a definite and practical way as these four verses
We have also seen that the eagle's wings in the Old Testament symbolize the divine strength, the divine power, and the divine supply
By themselves the living creatures are individuals, but with the eagle's wings they are coordinated into one body
The coordination is also for God's divine administration and government, because the throne is in the clear sky above such a coordination
The coordination of the living creatures is for manifesting Christ, for the Lord's move, and for God's divine government
As they face these four directions, two of their wings spread out and touch the adjacent creatures' wings, forming a square
While one of the living creatures is walking toward the north, the living creature facing the south must return, walking backward
The brother who is burdened for the gospel will be fighting for the gospel, for the outreach, for the increase
When the brother with the mending ministry is functioning, the brother with the gospel ministry must learn to walk backward
He did a good job, but he was always hunting for the strong brothers and the capable sisters to join his cleaning service group
By this you can see that it is easy for us to cause a division, but it is hard for us to have the proper and real coordination
The more they grow and learn, the more they will be able to function and to minister, and the more problems they will cause
There is only the straightforward walk, the backward walk, the sideways walk to the right, and the sideways walk to the left
If you are the one who is walking straightforward, you must be very careful to walk according to the leading of the Spirit
To follow the Spirit is not the business of the other three, but the business of the one who is walking straightforward
From the proper coordination in the local church there will be not only the burning, but also the enlightening and shining
Whenever you touch the church you should be able to realize that there is nothing of darkness among these people
Among the coordinated living creatures while they are the burning coals and the burning torches there is a fire among them going up and down
We will be the burning coals and the shining, burning torches, and we will have God as the divine fire among us going up and coming down
We must apply the matter of coordination not only within a local church, but also among all the local churches
Because the Lord on the throne looks like a man, the four living creatures expressing Him also look like a man
In these verses the four living creatures are not only for the expression of the Lord, but also for the move of the Lord
Not only does every proper local church need to have a wheel beside it, every proper individual believer must also have a wheel
They also can see that in your character and your behavior, you are honest, straight, frank, and sincere, having no crookedness
In addition to this kind of move with you, there should be also another kind of move, an extraordinary kind of move, the move of a wheel
It may be that on your job you are not such a proper human being; you are somewhat worldly, and the move of the Lord is not with you
If you do not have the eagle's wings and the calf's hoofs, you are not qualified to have a wheel standing beside you
By reading his writings and by reading the book of Acts, we can realize that the Apostle Paul considered himself less than the least
Paul was a little man, yet with him were the eagle's wings, the calf's hoofs, and also a high and dreadful wheel
Do you think that the wheel moving in New Zealand will be altogether different in appearance from the wheel that is moving in Los Angeles?
If you mean business with the Lord for His move today on this earth, you will have foresight and insight and all kinds of sight
Do not be like a frog at the bottom of a well able only to see what is directly above you in a very narrow way
When we speak of a wheel, we say that the circumference is the rim, that the center is the hub, and between these two are the spokes
In James 5:17 we are told that when Elijah prayed, he prayed with prayer ; there was a prayer within his prayer
If the churches are not moving with the Lord, they have no way to go on because there is no wheel within the wheel
It is meaningful to see that the living creatures do not follow the wheel, but that the wheel follows the living creatures
They tell us that upon the heads of the four living creatures there is the firmament or the expanse which we call the sky
The voice that comes out of their wings is like the voice of great waters and also like the voice of the Almighty, that is, the Almighty God
Please remember that first we experience a storm with the wind blowing, which brings in the cloud of God's presence to overshadow us
We must experience and enjoy the eagle's wings, that is, we must move by the divine power, the divine strength, and by the grace of Christ
We must also be able to cover ourselves, to hide ourselves, under His overshadowing wings, that is, under His grace
Within the coordination, the fire will be going up and down as coals to burn us and as torches to enlighten us
In addition, there will be a high and dreadful wheel beside us, meaning that we have God's move on this earth by us and with us
After we have experienced the items of the first twenty-one verses, the sky over our heads will be crystal-clear
They have a thorough fellowship with the Lord vertically, and they also have a clear fellowship between themselves, horizontally
We all must look to the Lord that the testimonies of all the local churches would be like the sound of great waters
Sometimes, the atmosphere in the local churches may not be like this because they do not have such a clear, expanding, and stable heaven
When they do not have a proper fellowship and coordination, they may try to vindicate themselves and claim to have something
If we would have a clear sky, a crystal heaven before the Lord, we must have a pure conscience, a conscience without any offense
Whenever we have a particular condemnation or offense on our conscience, immediately our sky becomes cloudy, darkened, and foggy
Sometimes a very small matter, such as a poor attitude toward our wife or husband, can cause us to have a cloud in our sky
It may remain for several days until we are forced to go to the Lord and to ask His forgiveness for our bad attitude toward our wife
By the Lord's anointing, we have the sensation that we also need to go to our dear wife and confess and apologize
Because we consider ourselves to be a man and we hate to lose our face to a female, we would insist on not going and confessing to her
We may talk about having the Lord's presence, but we should never forget that with the Lord's presence, there is always His throne
When we do not see the throne, we will be able to be loose and to do many things according to our own taste and convenience
In one sense, because we are saved we are really liberated, but in another sense we are under the throne and have no liberty
The living creatures are still on this earth, but through them the throne in the heavens is transmitted to the earth
Electricity is in the generator at the plant far from the city, but it is transmitted to us by the electrical lines
Whether you call it the Lord's presence or the throne, it is the transmission of the heavenly throne to this earth through that dear saint
When you are living under a clear sky with a throne above it, you do not need to claim to have authority, but the authority is simply there
If the heaven above us is clear and the throne is with us, we will have the authority and we will have the weight
The words out of one brother's mouth may have power and the same words out of another brother's mouth may have nothing
If you are under a clear sky, you do not need to argue; you do not need to claim anything; you do not need to say anything
Whenever we have a clear sky with God and we are in front of His throne, the situation will be like the sapphire stone
Whenever we have a clear sky with God's throne in it we are in a kind of heavenly situation having the appearance of a sapphire stone
It means that our conscience is void of offense we have nothing between us and God and nothing between us and others
They realize that from the time He was in the manger in Bethlehem to the time He was on the cross at Golgotha, He was a man
In the book of Ezekiel, the term 'son of man' is used over ninety times, indicating how much God desires to have a man
God's kingdom can never come in full until we are on the throne, and God's enemy will never be subdued until we are on the throne
Satan intended to exalt his throne up to the heavens, but God said He would cast him to the ground and bring his captives to the throne
We are called to be the sons of God, and our destiny is to be kings, but God must work on us today to qualify us for the kingship
It is hard for us to see that a man who was so small that people could crucify Him, kill Him, and bury Him could be the Lord of the universe
After the burning, something will remain, and that will be electrum, a mixture of gold and silver signifying the Lamb-God, the redeeming God
God wants us to gain Him as the electrum, but He first has to come to us as fire to enlighten, to search, and to burn
Although God is a holy God and a consuming God and none can exist in His presence, by His faithfulness we are spared
In a rainbow, there are six or seven different colors, but the basic colors are only three: red, yellow, and blue
It is very significant that the three main colors are red, yellow, and blue because they correspond to what we have already seen in Ezekiel
The Lord Jesus came, died on the cross, was resurrected, and is now our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption
In ourselves we are short of God's glory; we are under God's righteous judgment; and we are kept away by God's holiness
We must experience the Lord in such a way that when others contact us, they can sense the righteousness, holiness, and glory
In the first stage, they enjoyed Christ in Egypt as the Passover lamb with the unleavened bread and bitter herbs
The ultimate enjoyment is to enjoy Christ as the good land with all His unsearchable riches in the church life
Today in the church life we have Gods presence and Gods authority because we are Gods elect living in Christ and enjoying all that He is
The vine in God's economy should produce grapes and wine which can satisfy God and can cause people to rejoice
God's treasure of gold and silver became dross, the waste material which remains from the refining of gold and silver
A scholarship can be an idol; education can be an idol; money can be an idol; a wife, a husband, or children can be an idol
A particular style of dressing, whether it is a loose style of dressing, or a formal style of dressing, can be an idol
They love their mission work their membership their young peoples work their Bible studies or their gospel work more than the Lord Himself
The people of Israel accepted the idols and through them were brought into contact with all the heathen nations
Once the people of Israel were associated with the heathen nations, they began to walk after their manners and customs
Some teachers today in Christianity minister the Lord's Word in a violent way, cheating and fooling the people by the wrong use of the Word
The Lord condemned the prophets because they would not fill up the gap and make up the hedge during the time of the battle
If the mortar is not thoroughly saturated with water before it is applied to the wall, a rain will wash it away and the wall will crumble
The meaning of this parable is that many prophets ministered the Word of God, but not in a properly tempered way
The women in Ezekiel were not only prophesying falsely, but they were also practicing superstition and witchcraft
Today some pastors and preachers speak in a superstitious way, to comfort people in a false way, not according to the truth
In the first section of Ezekiel, in the vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord, we saw three main things
The righteousness, the holiness, and the glory of God are the basic elements with which God exercised His judgment over His people
In Ezekiel 2 24 there are some negative things which are versus the righteousness, the holiness, and the glory of God
Because of the idols in the temple, the glory of God was withdrawing step by step, leaving the temple, the city, and the people
In the last step the glory of the Lord left the temple and the city, stopping on the Mount of Olives on the east side of the city
The glory of the Lord stopped on the mountain and waited, but eventually it left the mountain and went back to the heavens
God judged His people by four terrible things: by the sword, by famine, by pestilence or disease, and by wild, noisome beasts
If we desire to have the healthy word, the supply of Christ, the rich and special spiritual food, we need the oneness
Paul warned the elders from Ephesus that one day wolves would come into the church who would have no pity on the flock
During the time of Eli, the people of Israel fought against the Philistines with the ark in a superstitious way and were defeated
After Nebuchadnezzar captured Jehoiachin, he established Jehoiachin's uncle, Zedekiah, as the king over Israel
He said that He would make Ezekiel's forehead harder than theirs and his heart harder than theirs, as a diamond is harder than flint
He became, not a permanent sanctuary like the one in Jerusalem, but a temporary sanctuary to all the captured, scattered people
We should not say that they do not have the real presence of the Lord at all, but we must say that it is only a temporary sanctuary
Rather, that temporary sanctuary should be a calling to come back to Jerusalem back to the permanent sanctuary
Ezekiel predicted that out of the house of David there would be a tender twig set upon the mountaintop which would become a great cedar tree
At that time God was overturning the kingdom and nation of Israel until the One who has the right to inherit would come
Although they were under the judgment of God, they should not be disappointed, but encouraged by Christ and with Christ
Deuteronomy 32:8 tells us that God set up the boundaries of all the nations according to the number of the people of Israel
By looking at a map, we can see that Palestine, the good land where God put Israel, is in fact a real center on this earth
According to history, the preaching of the gospel began in Jerusalem, spread to Europe and to Egypt, and then to Asia
Through Babylon under King Nebuchadnezzar, God executed His judgment not only over His people Israel, but also over all the nations
The first four nations, Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Philistia form one group, and Tyrus and Zidon form a second group
Previously, we pointed out that the spiritual application of the noisome beast is that some evil people could be in the church as wolves
They were happy about three things the sanctuary being profaned the good land being made desolate and the house of Judah being carried away
The sanctuary was a type of the incarnated Christ tabernacling on this earth as God's dwelling place, God's sanctuary
The sanctuary signifies Christ, the good land signifies God's rich grace in Christ, and the house of Judah signifies the church
Some people on the earth, represented by the Ammonites, hate Christ, they hate the grace God gives in Christ, and they hate the church
During the first two centuries of the church, the Roman Empire was an Ammonite, hating Christ, God's grace, and the church
According to the record of Ezekiel, Edom was full of hatred toward Israel, continually seeking revenge and vengeance
On the one hand you are a real Israelite loving the church, and on the other hand you are a real Edomite hating the church
Some of the churches can hardly go on because they are frustrated by the old man and the natural man of the leadership
If you talk to them concerning the church, the Lord's testimony, or Christ, they cannot understand what you are talking about
They only want to know if this will help them make a better living and help them become richer or get a higher degree or a higher position
They think you spend too much time going to the meetings, too much time fellowshipping, and too much time reading the Bible
In Matthew 13:22 Jesus said that the deceitfulness of riches and the cares of this world are like thorns which choke the growth of life
Egypt represents a person who is exercising natural wisdom to develop his natural resources to be rich and to have a supply
There is Edom representing the old man, and there is Philistia representing the natural man interfering with the things related to God
Following these are the people of Zidon who become the briers and thorns to the church due to the seeking of riches
When we are desolate, we have nothing fresh, nothing new, nothing living, nothing growing, nothing built up we are like a desert
If we will judge our natural man, we will see that our spirit will be fresh, living, green, flourishing, and growing
It may be that some persecutors are still living, but sooner or later God will put them into the nether parts of the earth
No matter how much we say that we love the church, if we are attracted to the wealth and riches of the world, we will damage the church life
If you put your trust in riches and the development of the natural resources, you will be a damage to the church life
Ezekiel and John the Baptist both sounded the trumpet of repentance, warning the people to turn from their evil ways
At that time we realize that the Lord Jesus is not only our Savior but also our Shepherd, seeking and searching us out
Though we were living like unbelievers among the millions of people on earth, the Lord Jesus sought us out and brought us back
They were in captivity in heathen countries, but the Lord promised to bring them back to their own country, to the good land of Canaan
From the mountains, the rivers flow; from the resurrected and ascended Christ, the living water of the Spirit flows
Once we came into the meetings of the local churches, we had the sensation that we had been brought back to the river
In every meeting of the local churches, we have the sensation that we are by the rivers and in the pasture, that we are drinking and eating
In Song of Songs 1:7, the seeker asked the Lord where He fed His sheep, where He gave His flock rest at noontime
We have the sensation that some of our wounds and breaks are under the Lord's binding, healing, and strengthening
Frequently in the local church meetings we have the sensation that something is not only flowing but also coming down like a shower as well
Sometimes even at home after the meeting, we have the sensation that the showers are still coming down upon us
Sometimes before a meeting there are only five small loaves, but after the meeting twelve baskets are left over
The recovery of the church life is not a matter of teachings, gifts, or other things, but a matter of the Lord's presence
In the previous section, Edom was judged, but because the old man is very difficult to deal with, the judgment had to be repeated
You thought your old man was fully condemned and judged yesterday, but you did not realize that he came back without giving you any notice
While you are in the enjoyment of Christ, he is still with you hating everything of God, God's Word, and God's people
To the Lord, of course, they were speaking nonsense, because He was going to exercise His judgment over them again
Ezekiel 36:8-12, 15 promises the recovery of the good land, the restoration of the full enjoyment of the riches of Christ
The Lord Jesus washes us with His cleansing blood, not only when we are saved, but also every time we are revived and brought back to Him
We need to be washed from gossip, from spreading rumors, from jealousy, from criticism, and from all unkindness
Many Christians have never dropped a single tear for the Lord Jesus, but they have wept many tears for their clothing
You heard many messages, but none of these told you that at your conversion the Lord gave you a new heart and a new spirit
If we would contact the Lord, receive the Lord, take the Lord, enjoy the Lord, drink the Lord, and eat the Lord, we need a spirit
When people talked to us about the Lord Jesus, we did not care to listen; we had no interest because we had no appetite
Once we have acquired a loving appetite toward the Lord, we also need to use our spirit, to contact Him, touch Him, and receive Him into us
You may feel it is difficult to discern the difference between your spirit and your heart, but do not analyze this with your mind
Immediately, you will forget all your darkness, and you will have the sense of something moving deep within your being
In addition to this, he said that we all have been baptized into one body in one Spirit and that we all were made to drink of one Spirit
The Pentecostal people appreciate 1 Corinthians 12 and 14 concerning speaking in tongues and prophecy, but they neglect 15:45b
If one can speak in the tongues of angels or the tongues of men and yet have no life in spirit, that is sounding brass
In 1 Corinthians 7:25, Paul said that he had no commandment from the Lord, but based on his age and experience he gave his opinion
When some Pentecostal people came to our meetings and did not see the manifestation of tongues, they were disappointed
We have a new heart, a new spirit, and we have the Holy Spirit within our spirit strengthening us all the time
In the last part of Ezekiel 36 the Lord promised that He would flock people in, but that we need to inquire of Him
It is not merely a matter of outward position and outward circumstances, but it is also a matter of the inward nature and inward disposition
If we had only Ezekiel 36, we would realize that we were evil, bad, sinful, dirty, and filthy, but we would never think that we were dead
Whether you were an unsaved sinner or whether you were a backslidden believer, this was exactly your situation
The Lord did not, however, come in directly to be the Shepherd, but He came in through Ezekiel and through the prophesying of His Word
We can see clearly that the main meaning of prophesying is not that of predicting, but of speaking forth something for the Lord
It is difficult for the translators to decide whether to translate ruach into the wind or into the breath or into the Spirit
We do know that according to our experience, when we come to the meetings and make a lot of noise, we are really one
When we come in and we make some noise, shouting joyfully to the Lord Jesus, calling on His name, praising His name, we are one!
In the second part of the chapter, the Lord told Ezekiel to pick up two sticks representing the northern and the southern kingdoms of Israel
The Lord did not tell Ezekiel to exercise his gifts or to teach, but to prophesy, to utter some words, to speak forth some words for God
By the inner life and by the growth of life, the two dead branches will receive life and grow into one another
In the Lord's recovery, we have many ex-pastors, ex-missionaries, ex-ministers, and ex-Bible teachers, but all of these are now one in life
We have seen in previous chapters the appearance of the glory of the Lord, the judgment of God by fire, and the recovery of the Lord by life
We may even say that the issue of the glory of the Lord, the judgment of God, and the recovery of the Lord is the building of God
The vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord which Ezekiel saw in chapter one was seen in the fifth year of the captivity
The vision of the building of God's house which he saw in chapter forty was in the twenty-fifth year of their captivity
Five is four plus one, meaning that man as the creature plus God as the Creator can together bear responsibility
The number twenty-five means not only the maturity, but also the full qualification for bearing responsibility
According to Exodus 12:3, the tenth of the first month was the day that the people of Israel prepared the lamb for the Passover
Any new beginning we can have in our spiritual life is always based upon Christ, the Passover Lamb, and His redemption
When they came back to the holy land, to the church life, they could see the vision of the building of the church
In order to see something properly, we need the right position, we need the right standing, and we need the right angle
In Revelation, John told us that he was carried away in spirit to a high mountain to see the holy city, New Jerusalem
We not only need to grow up, but we also need to go up to the highest position with the highest angle to see the building of God
On each pavement are five chambers built as places for the people to eat and enjoy the sacrifices and offerings
There are five chambers on each of six pavements, making a total of 30 chambers for the people to eat and enjoy the offerings
In this section on Gods building from Ezekiel 40 through 48 three main things are covered the holy temple the holy city and the holy land
It does not start from the outside and say, 'body and soul and spirit'; rather, it says, 'spirit and soul and body'
In the church life we must always have something from within first the temple, then the city, and then the land
After you pass through the outer threshold, the passage, the inner threshold, and the lobby, you enter into the outer court of the temple
By referring to the drawing of the gate, you can see that within the gate is the entry of the gate, which is exactly ten cubits wide
By putting these numbers together we can realize that Christ is the Triune God who became a man having the number six
If there were no wall, all the sinful people would be able to enter into the temple and become an insult to God's glory and God's holiness
In order for the Lord Jesus to be the gate to bring people in, He had to fulfill all the requirements of the Ten Commandments
By passing through the gate, our Lord Jesus, we are qualified to enter into God's building which is full of God's glory and God's holiness
On one side there are two spaces of five cubits each, and on the other side there are also two spaces of five cubits
The Lord Jesus as the Triune God became a man and died on the cross, fulfilling all the responsibilities of the Ten Commandments
Remember that the passage is ten cubits wide, meaning that the Ten Commandments are wholly fulfilled by the Lord Jesus
If, however, we deduct one cubit for the border around the guardroom on each side, this leaves the passage only eight cubits wide
Fifteen is composed of three times five, signifying the Triune God in resurrection bearing all the responsibility
In the foregoing portion, mainly the numbers five, six, and ten are used, but with the porch the number eight is used
We saw that the gates were divided into four sections: the first threshold, a passage, a further threshold, and the porch
Six is the number of the Lord's perfect humanity by which He fulfilled the requirements of the Ten Commandments
We also saw that the dimensions of the guardrooms match the dimensions of the cross section of the wall, six cubits by six cubits
These numbers indicate that the Lord as a man is fully in resurrection and is qualified to be a proper witness
The number thirty in Ezekiel indicates maturity which is able to bear something and also indicates the enjoyment and expression of Christ
Because the columns must bear the weight of the roof and support the whole building, they must be in victory and they must be everlasting
If we would enter the temple Ezekiel saw in his vision, we must first climb up the seven steps and then pass through the spacious gate
The main thing in the outer court was the pavement which ran around all the walls on the east, the south, and the north sides
In addition to the thirty chambers on the pavement, there were also four small courts, one at each corner of the outer court
The chambers connected to the kitchens were the dining places, the places for the people to enjoy the sacrifices
We must see that the main thing in the outer court was to enjoy Christ by eating the sacrifices and the offerings
If we walked into the outer court and there were no stone pavement, our feet would be on the dirt of the earth
One kind of Christian works at his office during the day, comes home, watches television, or listens to his radio before dinner
Surely all those people who enjoy the worldly pleasures and amusements on their Sunday are standing on the dirt
It also is composed of three times ten, meaning the Triune God in resurrection fulfilling all the requirements
If we experience Christ to the measure of fifty cubits, then the measure of our enjoyment of Christ will also be fifty cubits
The people of Israel were tested in the wilderness for forty years and the Lord Jesus was tested in the wilderness for forty days
While He was on the earth and while He was dying on the cross, He was under the cooking and suffering for the sake of our eating
In the outer court there was some enjoyment of the Lord through the boiling and eating, but there was no service, no ministering to the Lord
The burnt offerings needed four steps of preparation: they were killed, skinned, cut into pieces, and finally, they were washed
In the outer court there was only the enjoyment of Christ, but in the inner court there was much improvement and progress
According to our experience, though, when we were in the outer court, we were still only the people; we were not yet the priests
By adding the one and one-half cubits of the length to the one and one-half cubits of the breadth, we have three cubits
As a creature signified by the number four, He was split, yet He was resurrected, and now in resurrection He is a testimony
On the east side there are two gates, on the south side there are two gates, and on the north side there are two gates
The fact that the gates are divided into three groups of two indicates that the God-man was cut by crucifixion, but is now in resurrection
The altar is not only the center of the inner court, but is also the center of the whole premises of the temple
As the center of the universe, the cross indicates the all-inclusive death of God, of man, and of all the creatures
By looking at the plot plan of the temple compound, we can see that no matter through which gate we enter, we will arrive at the altar
The altar is not only the center of the whole universe, but also the meeting place of God with man and the meeting place of man with God
He stayed on this earth for thirty-three and one-half years, and eventually He went to the altar, to the cross
By His incarnation, He had put man upon Him, so that while He was dying on the cross, man was also dying there
By the all-inclusive death of the Lord Jesus on the cross, we were terminated and all the riches of God were released
The all-inclusive death of Christ on the cross is a wonderful release to God and a wonderful termination to us
All that we are and all that we have was terminated on the altar, and all that God is was released to us by His resurrection
If we bury both a grain of wheat and a small stone a plant will grow out of the grain of wheat and the small stone will simply be terminated
Through the death of the cross the Lord as a grain of wheat was released, but we, as a small dead stone, were terminated
How can we prove from the account in Ezekiel that God and man and all the creatures died on the altar, on the cross?
In earlier books the Bible did not speak specifically about the measurements of the altar but Ezekiel gives us details concerning the altar
Since we know that the number one signifies the unique God, we therefore see that God is the base of the altar
The number four signifying the creature, the number six signifying man, and the number three signifying the Triune God are all here
We have seen the numbers two, three, four, five, six, eight, and ten, but we have not seen the number twelve until this point
The greater ledge, which is the section directly under the upper altar, has an edge on either side which measures one cubit
Under the greater ledge is the lesser ledge, which also has two edges of one cubit each, making it a total of sixteen cubits wide
On every story, on every section, of the altar are the edges which are spreading out like two arms to hold something
The horns on the altar, which are toward the four corners of the earth and are also upward, signify the power of the cross of Christ
Without the proper realization and experience of the cross of Christ, it will be difficult for us to have the reality of the church life
If we desire to have a proper church life, we need an adequate realization and experience of the cross of Christ
To be in the outer court having the enjoyment of Christ is wonderful, but it is still far from the experience of the temple
To be even in the inner court where the ministry has begun is also wonderful, but it also is far from the experience of the temple
We must go on and on until we pass through the altar and come to the temple; there we will have the reality of the church life
After we have passed the altar, which signifies the all-inclusive death of Christ, we come to the temple itself
It has the first level in the outer court, the second level in the inner court, and the third level in the temple
Although we must climb twenty-five steps from the street level to the level of the temple, we actually ascend only fifteen cubits in height
We can calculate this because the ten steps to the temple are equal to the height of the platform of the temple
The platform, which was six cubits high, was the base of the whole building of the temple and the side chambers
We have no way to ascend higher and to progress further inward apart from the Triune God bearing responsibility in resurrection
The pillars signify Christ as God's witness bearing the house of God in the universe with a strength which is unlimited and immeasurable
The first entrance, that of the porch, measures fourteen cubits, but the second entrance to the outer court measures ten cubits
The length of the outer temple was forty cubits, and the breadth was twenty cubits, making a total of eight hundred square cubits
If we are outside the porch, we have no restriction, but when we come inside the porch, we have some restriction
Because these were set one upon the other, a ledge of one cubit was created, and the beam of the side chambers was placed upon that ledge
Because the side chambers at the first level were four cubits broad, they signify us as the creatures in a general way
There were thirty chambers on the pavement, thirty windows in the gates, and thirty sides of the posts in the gates
If we are enjoying the life-giving Spirit, surely we are enjoying the victory, the everlasting power, and the strength of the Lord Jesus
After you have twelve baskets left over, and you feed others again, you may have forty-eight baskets left over
He is able to fulfill all the requirements and meet all the needs of both God and man and still have a large building left
The proper humanity is not our natural humanity, but the crucified, resurrected, and ascended humanity of Jesus
The cherubim are the four living creatures mentioned in chapter one, signifying the glory of the Lord manifested upon the creatures
Among the cherubim were the palm trees, signifying the victory of Christ, the everlasting and ever-existing power of Christ
In chapter one the cherubim had four faces, but in the carvings on the walls, they have only two faces: the man's face and the lion's face
When you meet certain brothers and sisters, you have the impression that upon them there is some carving of the Lord
The main point is that both the walls and the incense altar were covered with wood, signifying the proper humanity of the Lord Jesus
The many doors in the south building open toward the north, and the many doors in the north building open toward the south
The holy chambers are fifty cubits wide and one hundred cubits long with a walkway ten cubits wide between them
In the holy chambers, the priests not only eat and enjoy Christ, but they also have Christ as their clothing and Christ as their storage
After the measuring of the temple was completed Ezekiel was brought outside of the compound where the man measured the land outside the wall
In the center, a square of only 5000 cubits was used, leaving a wide, spacious land surrounding the temple compound
When the Lord in His leaving stopped on the threshold of the house, it indicated that He was not happy to leave
Through all the centuries the enemy in his subtlety has kept Christians from knowing anything about the building
Many of us knew him very well, and we knew that he was burdened for the church and for the building up of the church
These messages were not released so that people could be spiritual in an individual way, but so that the church could be built up
Those people who put out the inner-life books by Brother Nee do not have much regard for his books on the church life
The Song of Songs, and so forth all books on the individual spiritual life but very few of them sell Brother Nee's books on the church
It is so wonderful that in the church in Los Angeles in the past years, we have had the sensation that the glory of the Lord has come back
When you come into the church meetings in Los Angeles, you have the sense that you come, not into the darkness, but into the light
Ezekiel 43:3 says that the appearance of the Lord was the same when He returned as when He came with the prophet to destroy the city
The Lord's people at that time were in a low place, in the bottom, but the Lord Jesus was riding among them to bring them out
The Lord Jesus was with those captives in the bottom, and He was also with those in the captivity by the river Chebar
Even a decision concerning what time or what day to have the meetings should not be concerned wholly with peoples' convenience
The man stood by him and said, 'Son of man, the place of my throne' , proving that the man who stood by Ezekiel was the Lord Himself
Unless the church is built up, the Lord has no standing to administrate His government and to move upon this earth
According to Ezekiel 43:7 the people, the house of Israel, had offended the Lord in two things: in their whoredom and in their carcasses
The Lord did not rebuke the house of Israel for their behavior and conduct, but for their whoredom and carcasses
To the church at Ephesus in Revelation 2, the Lord said that they had done many good works, but they had lost the first love
Verse 7 says, 'neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places '
She comes to the front with a dress which exposes her bare shoulders and she is painted with blue white and red as she stands there singing
That is not a carcass of a lower standard, but of a higher standard, having a high education and a high standard of music
You have to keep the form, the fashion, the ordinances, the statutes, the laws, the comings in and the goings out related to the house
The Lord charged Ezekiel to show them the form, the fashion, even the comings in and the goings out, the statutes, and the laws
Before he was saved, he treated his parents and his sister poorly, but after he got saved, he learned how to treat them well
From now on, the house of Israel should behave themselves, not according to the law, but according to God's house
We should not be God's people according to the law of Moses; we must be God's people according to the form of the temple in Ezekiel
We have to see that the requirement of the indwelling Christ is not according to the law, but according to His house
If what we are and what we do does not fit into the church, it amounts to nothing in the eyes of the Lord and is even an abomination to Him
After the purification, the cleansing on the altar for seven days, on the eighth day in resurrection, the Lord's people were accepted by Him
On the eighth day, in resurrection, we must offer ourselves to the Lord as a burnt offering absolutely for His satisfaction
The law of the house could be summed up in two points: it must be upon the top of the mountain, and it must be most holy
We must check ourselves by these two points is our church life on top of the mountain, and is our church life most holy?
Our work, our behavior, and our person must also be according to the fashion, the form, the pattern, the statutes, and the laws of the house
If your flesh, natural man, and old man have not been dealt with by the cross, you are not qualified to serve in the church life
The Lord said that such persons could serve in the house, but could not come near to the Lord or to the holy things
Because they have gone astray from the Lord, they have lost their qualification and position to serve the Lord in a direct way
The fat we present to God is the precious Person of Christ, and the blood we present to God is the redemptive work of Christ
In all our service to God, we must present the precious Person and the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus to Him
When we use our own strength to endeavor and struggle it proves that we are not under the Lords blessing but rather under the Lords curse
In the Lords recovery as we serve the Lord we need to avoid and even escape from any kind of selfenergy selfstruggle and selfendeavor
If something is from the Lord, surely the Lord will grant His abundant blessing upon it and He will work it out
There is no need for us to push and to endeavor and to struggle and to energize to such an extent that eventually we are fighting
In addition to this, a priest who would serve the Lord directly in His presence cannot be defiled by any dead person
You will say that the elders are wrong, the co-workers are wrong, the young people are wrong, the old people are wrong, everyone is wrong
Whenever you realize that you are with such people, you have to run away; otherwise, you will be defiled by their death
After talking only a short while with a certain person, you could not pray or function in the meetings for a week
They are very alive to movies, to sin, to worldly things, and to negative talk but they are absolutely dead to the church
According to 1 Corinthians 11:5, to cut off or to shave off all the hair signifies rebellion against the Lord's headship
If a man keeps his hair long it means that he is keeping his selfglory and selfdignity he is fulfilling his selfpleasure and selfenjoyment
Suppose a brother says that he is not under anyone, that he is independent, and that he is equal to every other member in the Body
On the other hand to have long hair, signifying self-glory, is to desire and seek for leadership in the church life
If we want to be qualified to serve the Lord, we should not shave our head, meaning that we should have a proper submission
We should not let our hair grow long, meaning that we should not seek after self-glory, self-dignity, position, and leadership
All the heave offerings, all the firstfruits, all the top produce of the people of the Lord belonged to the priests
Moses told the people of the Lord to offer one lamb out of ten to God, but Ezekiel told them to offer one out of two hundred
Even if you have four ephahs of wheat, you are not qualified to offer anything: you must have at least a homer of wheat
Of the wheat and barley you must offer onesixtieth of the oil you must offer onehundredth and of the lambs you must offer one twohundredth
In the book, The All-Inclusive Christ, we pointed out that wheat signifies the incarnated Christ who died for us
According to Ezekiel's record there was the yearly offering, the monthly offering, the weekly offering, and the daily offering
The yearly offering was offered on the first day of the year signifying that, in principle, every year we should have a new beginning
The yearly offering was offered not only on the first day of the year, but also on the seventh day of the year
Keep in mind that, in principle, at the beginning of every year, we need to have a renewal in our service to the Lord
On December 31, we spent the whole night together and prayed until the early hours of the first day of the year
We must be able to declare to the whole universe, 'Our work has stopped and we are now enjoying the Lord's work'!
Now we know what kind of priests we must be in order to serve the Lord, and now we know what we have to offer to the Lord
Please notice that the flow is not in chapter one; in that chapter there was no flow, but there was the burning fire
The people began to have their living according to the house, according to its pattern, its laws, and its statutes
Their daily walk, their daily life, and all their conduct was according to the form, fashion, pattern, statutes, and laws of the house
There were the yearly offerings, the monthly offerings, the weekly offerings, the daily offerings, and all the solemn feasts
Wherever and whenever a group of believers are built up in oneness as Ezekiel described, the river will flow out of their building up
Today in Christianity many zealous ones pay attention to outreach and to the gospel, yet their condition and their situation are very poor
If there is a strong building up in the local churches, there will be a flowing river going out to other places
When a sister goes to the store to buy a piece of cloth, first she examines the piece of cloth and then she measures it
Remember, to be measured by the Lord means to be tested, to be examined, to be judged, and eventually to be taken over by the Lord
Four is the number of the creature, and this means as a creature we must be thoroughly judged and tested by the Lord
If the river is only up to our ankles or up to our knees, it proves we have not been measured fully by the Lord
We look to the Lord for His mercy that in all the local churches there will be a river that no man can pass over
You have sufficient grace so that it is not easy to lose your temper, and yet you do not have sufficient grace to overcome your temper
Once the water of life becomes so deep that it is a river you cannot pass over, then you will shout, 'Hallelujah'!
If you give up the denominations, yet you are not absolute for the proper ground of the church, you are in a marsh
However, the Lord brought the land out of the death waters, and the family of Noah was given the right to enjoy the land
From Babel God scattered the people and called out Abraham from that fallen place and brought him into Canaan, the good land
Four hundred years later, by God's deliverance, they experienced the Passover and, passing through the Red Sea, they left Egypt
At the time we were saved we received Christ, but not long afterward we fell away and lost Christ in our experience
On the one hand Christ is the wheat, the vegetable life; and on the other hand Christ is the Lamb, the animal life
The animal life is for being slain and shedding the blood for redemption, and the vegetable life is for producing and generating life
Out of these two lives mingled together we have the riches of Christ, the milk and the honey, for our enjoyment
At the top of the Dead Sea is the River Jordan which goes northward to another sea, the Sea of Galilee or the Sea of Tiberias
Some of the verses in the Bible imply that the good land of Canaan is an elevated land; it is a raised-up land
When the tribes became divided, only Judah and Benjamin remained with the Lord and never participated in division
No matter how much consideration you give to migration, eventually you will be in a certain place under the Lord's sovereignty
In Revelation 7 the name of Dan is not mentioned in the list of the tribes of Israel because of their idolatry and degradation
According to the map, besides this holy heave offering land, there was still some remainder of land on the west and on the east
The allotment of the land and the placement of the tribes upon their particular portion of land is very meaningful
From Dan in the north to Gad in the south all the Israelites enjoyed Christ, but their nearness to Christ was not the same
The temple is God's house, God's dwelling place, for His rest, and the city is God's kingdom for His authority
All the fellowship, service, work, government, royalty, lordship, and kingship come out of our enjoyment of the riches of Christ
Only one city in the whole Bible has twelve gates with twelve names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and that is the city of Jerusalem
It is not just a mingling of divinity with humanity, but also a perfect government which comes out of this mingling
Out of such a mingling there will be the church government for God's administration on the earth and for the whole universe
Regardless of which direction you come from, and regardless of which gate you enter through, you will be on the same street
