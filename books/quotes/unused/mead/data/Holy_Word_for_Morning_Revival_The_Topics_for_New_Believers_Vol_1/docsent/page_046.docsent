   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Luke 2:10 For behold, I announce to you good news of great joy, which will be for all the people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Acts 5:42 Every day they did not cease teaching and announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rom 15:16 That I might be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, a laboring priest of the gospel of God, in order that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Preaching the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every saved person, having believed in the Lord, must preach the gospel and delights to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The life of God in us, which we have received, is such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more we preach the gospel, the more this life is released, and we will grow in this life accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Definition of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The gospel is the glad tidings and the good news of great joy, which God asked His servants to announce to men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>196 Moreover , the gospel is Christ, who is the very embodiment of the processed Triune God, reaching us as the consummated Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the truth, the gospel is the entire divine revelation of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's New Testament economy is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christians are used to saying that there are four Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John , but Paul told us that the entire book of Romans is the gospel of God 1:1, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It includes the preaching of God, the condemnation of God upon fallen man, and the Body life, including the local churches in chapter sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Have you ever received such a broad view of the definition of the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Personally, the gospel is a wonderful person, 197 the most wonderful person in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is an unlimited, all-inclusive, and all-extensive person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Ephesians 1 we are told that this all-inclusive and extensive person fills all in all in the universe v. 23 . The measurement of the universe has no end. No one can tell how big the universe is or how many things are in it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But Ephesians 1:23 tells us that Christ is the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a person is the center of the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The gospel is concerning Jesus Christ the God-man; hence, Jesus Christ the God-man is the center of the good news and the glad tidings of God to men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>198 Of course, forgiveness, salvation, etc. are included in the gospel, but they are not the central point.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The gospel of God concerns the person of the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This wonderful person has two natures the divine nature and the human nature, divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>199</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's New Testament Priesthood of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to carry out the God-ordained way , God's New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we have to take care of four steps: begetting, nourishing, perfecting, and prophesying .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Each step is a must.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first step is to get sinners saved to make them members of the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, we have to preach the gospel as New Testament priests.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>200 In the Old Testament, the priests offered cattle sacrifices as types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>201 The main sacrifices that a New Testament priest offers to God are not his praises or good works.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The main sacrifices he offers to God are living persons, sinners who have been regenerated begotten of God to become members of the living Christ 1 Pet 2:5; Rom 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>202 The second step is to nourish and cherish the newborn babes in Christ in home meetings as nursing mothers 1 Thes 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>203 The third step is to bring these new ones into the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The group meetings will have the fellowship, the interceding, the mutual care, the shepherding, and the mutual teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This will spontaneously perfect equip, supply the functions of these new ones, carrying out the perfecting of the saints revealed in Ephesians 4:11-12.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fourth step, as a result of such perfecting, is to usher these ones into prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, we have to perfect them to such an extent and to such a level that they can speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord to minister and dispense Christ into others for building up the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>204</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
