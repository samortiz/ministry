   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we are not a spiritual house, we cannot be the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Likewise, if we are not the priesthood, we cannot be a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But if we are the dwelling place of God, the tabernacle, then surely we are a body of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In like manner, if we are not a body of priests, then we are not God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to have a house, materials of different kinds must be built together.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the materials are simply piled up on the building site, it would be impossible to have a house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We would only have a heap of materials.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These materials may be arranged in a very nice way to show forth their excellence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, there would not be a house.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A house comes into existence only when the materials are built together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose when we were building the meeting hall in Anaheim, we did nothing more than pile up all the materials.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may have appreciated the beauty of certain materials, but we would not have a meeting hall, a building in which to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the case of both a house and a meeting hall, there is the need for the materials to be built together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The principle is the same with the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since the priesthood equals the house, and the house depends on the building up of the materials, the priesthood also requires the building up of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I was with the Brethren, I heard a number of messages on the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Brethren strongly oppose the clergy-laity system and declare that all believers are priests, that they are neither the clergy nor the laity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Brethren put a strong emphasis on what is called the universal priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to this concept, the priesthood is universal because every believer is a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But although Brethren teachers emphasize this matter, I never heard a message saying that all the priests need to be built up together in order to have the priesthood, the body of serving priests.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some of their teachers emphasize 1 Peter 2:5 and 9.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I heard several messages on these verses, and I was helped by these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, there was no emphasis on the fact that the priesthood is a building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We know that the priesthood requires the building up of the believers because the priesthood is a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to remember that in 1 Peter 2:5 the spiritual house and the priesthood are in apposition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the matter of the spiritual house we can clearly understand the need for building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But with the priesthood the need for the building up is not apparent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all are the materials for God s spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But have we been built up together to be God s house?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you have the assurance and the peace to say that you are part of God s house?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Are the believers in your locality built up together as a spiritual house?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Deep within, you may not have the assurance that you have truly been built into the local expression of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may not have the peace to say that you have actually been built into God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1 Peter 2:5 Peter writes in a way to charge us and encourage us to be built into a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we have emphasized, this spiritual house is a holy priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may wonder why in this verse the house is mentioned first and then the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This sequence is based upon that in the book of Exodus, where we first have the tabernacle and then the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The priesthood must come after the tabernacle, the house.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why must the spiritual house also come first?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why must the church first be God s dwelling place and then the priesthood?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The answer is found in our need to be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because of the need of the building up, the church must be the house of God before it can be the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As the materials for God s building, we have been chosen, predestinated, called, saved, forgiven, justified, reconciled, and regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although we are such materials, we must still ask ourselves if we have been built up with others into God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today there is much teaching among Christians about being spiritual, powerful, or victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>More than forty years ago, I read books about how to be victorious, how to be powerful, and how to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today there may not be as many how-to books as there were years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many Christians have learned that the methods taught in these how-to books do not work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The emphasis in the Bible is not on how to be holy or how to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Instead, the emphasis is on God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The materials that have been built into the meeting hall in Anaheim are stable and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But suppose instead of being built in, these materials had been left to lie on the ground for years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By now would they not be unclean and unattractive?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To be sure, those materials would be in a pitiful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Had they been left scattered on the ground, they would certainly have become damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But because they have been built up together, these materials have been preserved, protected, and made stable.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do you want to be protected in your Christian life?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do you want to be stable, preserved, and sanctified?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If this is your desire, then you need to be built into God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have pointed out that without the building up of the saints, there cannot be the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There would be the priests, but there would not be the -hood.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the church in Anaheim we may have many priests.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But if these priests have not been built up together, we do not have the -hood.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The -hood depends upon the priests being built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>First we must have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then this building will be the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>SERVING IN COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The priests in the Old Testament did not serve in an isolated, individualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>On the contrary, they served together in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Their service was not individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even when a priest did something by himself, what he did was in the priesthood, in the priestly body.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>His personal service was in the coordination of that group of serving priests.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This coordination can be illustrated by what happens in my body when I use my hand to pick up a book.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Yes, it is the hand which grasps the book.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But the hand does not act separately or individualistically; it functions as part of my body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The principle is the same with speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although my mouth speaks, it does not speak apart from the body.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The mouth speaks in the coordination of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I use the function of the hand and the mouth to illustrate the fact that the priests serve together; they do not serve in an individualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They are a coordinated unit, a body, a -hood.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>For this reason, they live together, serve together, and work together.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we read the book of Leviticus carefully, we shall see that the priests also ate together.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They were corporate even in their eating.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This indicates that they lived in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This corporate living of the priests, however, is not the same as that practiced in so-called communes today.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should not confuse a commune with the corporate living of the priests in the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>TWO ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When we are built up together, we become the church in the aspect of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Then we automatically are the church in the second aspect, the aspect of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We are a corporate people serving God as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Such priests do not serve individualistically; they serve corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is the reason in the New Testament the church is described by terms such as house, priesthood, and Body.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We, the church, are the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In this Body there are many members, but none of the members acts individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In the typology in the book of Exodus, God uses two matters to portray the function of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>First, the church functions as God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Without the church, God would be homeless.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He would be like a person wandering in the wilderness, a person without a home.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But with the church God has a home, and He is now in His home.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Therefore, the church functions as God s home, His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Another function of the church is to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>As we afford God a dwelling place, we also serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>God s dwelling place is a group of serving priests.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This twofold function of the church, that of the dwelling place and the priesthood, is typified by the tabernacle and the priesthood in the book of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We all need to see that the church has a twofold function, the function to house God and the function to serve Him.</S>
