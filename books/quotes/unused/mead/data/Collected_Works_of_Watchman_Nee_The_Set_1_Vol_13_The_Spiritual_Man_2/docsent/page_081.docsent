   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If we live by our emotion, we do God's will only when we feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we live by faith, we see that we obey the Lord in all matters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many times, we are clear that a particular matter is according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, we do not have the slightest interest in it and even as we do it, we feel dry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not feel the Lord's pleasure, blessing, or strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the contrary, we feel as though we are walking through the valley of the shadow of death because of our fight with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Under this circumstance, unless we press on by faith, we will surely flee to Tarshish.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Alas, not even mentioning the believers who do not do the will of God today, many who do His will do only that which interests them!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How many believers do only that part of God's will which suits the desire of their emotion!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us ask again, "What is a life of faith?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A life of faith is a life that lives by faith in God under all circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Job said, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him!"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Job 13:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since we once believed in God, loved God, and trusted God, no matter where He puts us or how He ill-treats us, and even if He causes us to go through the refining fire so that we would suffer both physically and emotionally, yet we will believe in Him, love Him, and trust Him!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Most of the believers today only expect to suffer pain in their bodies, while having peace in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But who would refuse even the comfort to their hearts because they believe in God?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Who can still delight in God's will without being discouraged and still commit himself to God when he feels that God has rejected him and even feels that God hates him and wants to slay him?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should know that God does not treat us this way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, many believers who have advanced in their spiritual journey have the experience of seemingly being rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we feel this way, does our faith in God remain unchanged?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the people were going to hang John Bunyan, the author of Pilgrim's Progress, he said, "If God does not intervene, I shall leap into eternity in blindness, come heaven, come hell."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was a hero of faith!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we feel discouraged, are we able to say, "O God, even if You should forsake me, I will still trust in You"?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Emotion begins to doubt when it senses darkness, but faith clings to God even in death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How few of the believers have arrived at this stage!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How our flesh is opposed to a life that gives no room to self but only to God!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since by nature we dislike taking the cross, many believers remain at a standstill in their spiritual journey.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They always want to reserve some happiness for their own enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To lose their all in the Lord, including that which causes the self to be happy, is truly a death too deep and a cross too heavy!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They can be wholly consecrated to the Lord, suffer for Him, or even pay a price to do His will, but they find it difficult to abandon that little feeling which gives pleasure to the self.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They treasure a small amount of comfort and allow the spiritual life to rest in such a petty feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they have the courage to willingly deliver themselves into God's fiery furnace, without the slightest feeling of self-pity or self-love, they will advance in their spiritual journey by leaps and bounds!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, believers are still regulated by their natural life because they think that what they see and feel is reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They do not have the courage, faith, and aggressiveness to explore those areas which they neither feel nor see in order to discover the paths that have not been trodden by those who were before them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They have reached the place where the boundary has been drawn.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A little loss or a little gain becomes the cause of their sorrow or joy, and they no longer aim to go any higher or deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are limited by their petty self.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a believer realizes that God wants him to live by faith, he would not often utter sounds of murmurings and sighings, nor breed thoughts of discontent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If he is willing to accept the feeling of dryness which God has given him and regard everything from God as good, how quickly his natural life will be dealt with by the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Ignorance and unwillingness, however, hinder the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Otherwise, these experiences of dryness would become the very cross to practically deal with his soul-life, enabling him to truly live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What a pity that many believers accomplish nothing in their lifetimes except the pursuit of a little feeling of happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But faithful believers those who have been brought by God into a real life of spirituality lead a life that is so much of God!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When they recall their experiences, they realize that God's arrangement has, indeed, been right, because without their experiences, it would have been difficult to lose their soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The need today is for believers to fully commit themselves into the hand of God without caring about how they feel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, this does not mean that henceforth we will become persons without joy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"Joy in the Holy Spirit" is the greatest blessing in God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, the fruit of the Spirit is joy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It means that although we have lost the feeling of happiness, the joy which we receive out of a pure faith will not be quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is deeper than feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By becoming spiritual, we lose our former desire to focus on pleasing the self, and we no longer pursue happiness with zeal as we once did; but peace and joy in the spirit, which come out of faith, are always present.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a believer wants to walk according to the spirit, he must renounce a life of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One who walks according to the spirit must walk by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To walk according to the spirit is to renounce the pleasant feeling which the flesh holds on to, demands, and desires, which the believer regards as crutches and security in all his activity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When a believer walks according to the spirit, he does not fear the absence of any supportive feeling or the presence of any opposing feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once his faith weakens, however, and he does not walk according to the spirit, he will seek things which he can see, feel, and touch to support him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whenever the spiritual life is weak, feeling will replace intuition in taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A believer who lives by his feeling will come to realize that he was after a pleasant feeling in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Eventually, he will seek the help of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you cannot reject the pleasant effect of feeling, it will lead you to rely on the world.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Feeling must have the world as its resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, emotional believers often resort to their own ways, seeking help from men.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be led by the spirit more than anything else requires faith because the intuition's leading is often contrary to one's feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Those without faith cannot go on.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Soulish believers simply cease to serve God the moment they feel discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, believers who live according to faith do not wait until they are excited to work; rather, they ask God to increase the strength of their spirit so that they can overcome the sense of discouragement.</S>
