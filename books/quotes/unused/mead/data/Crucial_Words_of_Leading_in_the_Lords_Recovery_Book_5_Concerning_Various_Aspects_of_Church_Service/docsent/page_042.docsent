   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DEACONS SERVICE Visitation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In addition to the elders leading, teaching, shepherding, and promoting, in a local church there is still a need for the deacons visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The needs in a local church are of various aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to our experience, the greatest need is visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are many names on our list, but less than half the saints come to the meetings regularly, because there is a lack in visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Visitation is an upholding and support that can keep people in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because we have a lack in our practice of visitation, many people slip through the cracks in our localities.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must raise up a sufficient number of saints in the local churches to take up the responsibility of visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These saints should know the truth, have some growth in life, love the brothers and sisters, and have a heart to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such saints, whether they are brothers or sisters, should serve as deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the past we had the mistaken concept that we should not have too many deacons; thus, our need was not met.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For this reason, we have added many saints to serve as deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should charge these saints to take up the work of visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Visitation is a miniature of shepherding and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In fact, visitation is shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to our experience we need to carry this out in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, some older saints are retired and no longer work, and they do not have much responsibility at home because their children are all grown.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If these saints have a heart, they can do two things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, they can pray for the church regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church needs such a group of older saints to pray whenever they have the time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although they do not have the strength to go out, they can pray regularly at home.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes three or five of them can come together and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We believe that the Lord hears their prayer, and the church indeed depends upon their prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is something precious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In addition, we can encourage the older saints to do some visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They may not be able to travel far, but they can take care of nearby brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In particular they can care for the saints before and after every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should help the older saints to participate in the work of visitation, but we do not need to give them the title of a deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their physical strength may not be adequate, but they can still be in the coordination for visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The second aspect, with regard to the older saints, is to appoint saints under sixty years of age, who have much growth in the truth and in life and who love the church, the Lord, and the saints, as deacons and entrust them with the responsibility of visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sixty deacons is not too many for a church with one thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The deacons are the saints in a locality or in a meeting hall who have the growth and experience in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is better if more saints of this kind do the work of visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Taking Care of Miscellaneous Matters</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Besides visitation, there are still many other miscellaneous matters, such as business office responsibilities, clerical needs, accounting, record keeping, ushering, cleaning, set-up, electrical maintenance, purchasing, hospitality, transportation, repairs, and estate management, which includes property, housing, and appliances and furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Almost every meeting hall has these miscellaneous items, and every item needs an experienced saint, who has the energy and the physical capacity, to be a deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ushering needs a brother or a sister who is a deacon to bear this responsibility and to ask other saints to serve as ushers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When he asks other saints to serve, he should not approach the saints who take care of visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We hope that every saint will take up only one task, and no one will bear two tasks.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not ask the saints who already have a task to serve in another task.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Similarly, we can entrust the task of cleaning to one or two deacons, who in turn can ask other saints to come to the meeting hall at an appointed time to clean.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We hope also that the saints who take care of cleaning will not do other things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The same principle can be applied to each item.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Besides the deacons who are responsible for visitation, there is still a need for a dozen more deacons to bear responsibility for these miscellaneous items.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this way almost all the saints can be utilized.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are aggressive, every saint will have a function in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not have only one group of saints who are always ushering in every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead, we should use several groups of saints: one group for Lord s Day, another group for Tuesday, and still another group for Thursday.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, many saints will be involved in serving as ushers, no one will be tired, and all the services will be evenly borne by the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The elders in each meeting hall should take care of making arrangements, because they take the lead and are familiar with the condition of each saint.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is the elders who should select appropriate saints to be deacons for visitation and also select the saints to be in charge of the miscellaneous items.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then the church will be on the right track.</S>
