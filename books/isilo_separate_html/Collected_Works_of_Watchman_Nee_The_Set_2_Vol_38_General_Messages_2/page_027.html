We must realize that the central meaning of testimony is God's declaration of Himself; it declares that God is a God of life. In order to testify of Himself, He came among men and declared what He is. This testimony is a spiritual fact; it is the ultimate reality. If anyone has not touched this ultimate reality, he has not touched the testimony. Strictly speaking, no one can testify of God, because from eternity to eternity, only God can testify of Himself; God Himself declares who He is. (The testifying that we are speaking of here is different from the testifying that we understand in ordinary terms.)</p><p>There is much that we can say about God; we can testify for God and speak of the kind of God that He is, but our words are useless. We can recite one, ten, or a hundred speeches concerning God, but we must realize that the testimony is not given by man; the testimony is what God tells us about Himself. Therefore, if God does not speak, there will be no testimony. Do you see the significance of this? If God does not speak, there will be no testimony. If God does not tell men about Himself, no one can testify for Him. We can talk and speak, but talking and speaking are useless because only we are talking and speaking. If God does not speak, everything is vain. For example, I may try to defend someone in court by witnessing for him, and I may be very eloquent. If the defendant, however, will not testify or say anything, what are my words worth? God's testimony is His declaration about Himself. If God does not speak, there is no testimony.</p><p>Therefore, anyone who testifies for God must touch God and speak what God wants to speak. A man will not have anything to speak for God until he has known God, seen God, and received revelation from God. When he touches the ultimate reality, he will have something to say, and he will be able to testify for God. If we have not touched this reality, we will have nothing to say, and we will have no testimony. We can convey God's commandments, statutes, and ordinances to others, and we can preach the word of the Bible. But these are not the testimony. The testimony is something else. Even though man can receive ordinances, statutes, and commandments, the testimony remains with God. These are outward things, but the testimony, the ultimate reality, remains with God. Consequently, Christ needed to come from God to testify for God. Similarly, only the Spirit which proceeds from Christ can testify for Christ, and only those who know this Christ and this Spirit can testify for God and Christ. This has nothing to do with what man can say; it is not a matter of his doctrines or his teachings. It is a matter of Christ being released. The testimony can become a doctrine, but a doctrine can never be the testimony. The testimony can make demands on man, but a demand can never be the testimony. The testimony is something entirely different; it is something absolutely different from what we ordinarily think of as a testimony. We often say that we cannot testify because we do not have the experience. But even if we have experiences and personal encounters, these things are small in the context of the testimony; they do not fit into the testimony. The testimony is not a matter of experiences and personal encounters, but a matter of touching the Lord. From man's point of view, a testimony is an experience, but terms such as experience and personal encounters are too small; they are not great enough and cannot be compared with the testimony. The testimony is man touching the Lord. Only God can testify for Himself, because no one is greater than God. Only God can testify for God.</p><p>The greatest problem in the church is that there are too many doctrines from man. Man comes up with many doctrines and biblical teachings; he tells others what they should do, what is scriptural, and what is unscriptural. Man pays attention to all these matters, but a genuine testimony touches the ultimate reality. Only that which touches God constitutes a testimony. I do not wish to say too much concerning this point, yet I would like all of us to ponder this matter before the Lord. Brothers and sisters, if we read the Pentateuch and Psalm 119 again, we will realize that God uses the term testimony differently than we do. A testimony is too great a thing; it is something that our mind cannot fathom. The testimony is the speaking of God concerning Himself and His demands. Those who have touched God's testimony surely have touched God Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">OFFENDING GOD BEING TO OFFEND THE TESTIMONY</h2><p>What does it mean to offend the testimony? To offend the testimony is to offend God Himself. Anything that touches God's attributes and ways touches God's testimony. God intends to express His absolute attributes. Anything that improperly expresses them or improperly represents them is an offense to God's testimony. God is very unforgiving about some things, because they touch His testimony. Whenever something touches His testimony, He will not bear with it lightly. He is very uncompromising with anything that improperly expresses Him or that affects His attributes, position, or person.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
