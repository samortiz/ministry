   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE WE ARE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 5:21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have previously covered two points.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, God saves us according to His own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are not saved by our own righteousness; we are saved by God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God did not save us according to our righteousness, but according to His own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thank the Lord that God cannot be unrighteous toward us, because He cannot betray Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we believe in Him, He has to save us, and we have to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, Christ is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We come to God by putting on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our righteousness before God is not our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our righteousness before God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is a difference between our conduct and our righteousness before God; we cannot mix up the two things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot make our conduct our righteousness before God, or our righteousness before God our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's Word shows us that it is possible for our conduct to fluctuate, but it is impossible for our righteousness before God to fluctuate, because our righteousness is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God opens our eyes to see that our righteousness before God is Christ and not our conduct, we are liberated, we can pray and fellowship with God, and we can be bold before God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now we come to the third point, which is covered in 2 Corinthians 5:21: "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We were sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But through Christ being made sin on our behalf, we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who have received salvation through the work of Christ are the righteousness of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This matches the word in 1 Corinthians 1:30.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Corinthians 1:30 shows us that "Christ Jesus...became...to us...righteousness," while 2 Corinthians 5:21 shows us that "we...become the righteousness of God."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The One who knew no sin was made sin on our behalf, and those who confess this One become the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>GOD'S REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>EXPRESSING GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I do not know how to put this, but it is a most wonderful thing that we are the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible tells us that our righteousness is Christ, that God's righteousness is us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has made Christ our righteousness, and He has made us the righteousness of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is the meaning of the expression "we become the righteousness of God"?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that if anyone wants to know what God's righteousness is, and if anyone wants to see God's righteousness, all he has to do is find a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's righteousness is displayed in Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, Christians are the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before we believed in the Lord, we were not clear what righteousness is and what unrighteousness is according to God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even after we become a Christian, we are still not necessarily clear about righteousness and unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God not only has to save us; He has to teach us the lesson of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's redemption saves unrighteous ones, and His redemption teaches us the meaning of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the first chapter, we saw that God cannot forgive our sins easily.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we sin, we break the law, and God is a God who honors the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God loves us, yet He cannot disregard the law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He wants to forgive us, yet He cannot break the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, He paid the price that we should have paid ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the meaning of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to forgive our sins, God sent His Son to bear our punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since Christ has borne our sins, we can now come to God through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God cannot reject anyone who comes to Him through Christ, because Christ's cross has satisfied God's righteous requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some may think that if God wants to save us, He can simply do it, and there is no need to send the Son or to crucify Him on the cross to shed His blood for us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They think there is no need for God to go to such lengths, but they have never thought of the matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to realize that God wants very much to save us, yet He cannot be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In His heart, He wants to save us, but He must be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What would happen if He allowed us to be saved easily, and what if He took away Hades, death, and the lake of fire?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The consequence is very serious!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If God took away Hades, He would take away His righteousness; if He took away death, He would take away His righteousness; and if He took away the lake of fire, He would also take away His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God is responsible to Himself for His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although He does not have to be responsible to anyone, He cannot be careless with Himself; He has to be responsible to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God must be righteous towards Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When a Christian comes to God through Christ, others see him as the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This means that God has not forgiven men carelessly or without any ground.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He forgives men righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He has given us His Son for the satisfaction of the demand of His law.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we stand before God and present Christ to Him, we become the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To say that we are the righteousness of God has nothing to do with our Christian conduct; it has to do with being the manifestation of God's righteousness through the redemption of Christ.</S>
