   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-FIVE FELLOW WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The sphere of our work determines the sphere in which we find our fellow workers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we settle the question of fellow workers we must settle this question: What is our work?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no possibility of solving the problem of our co-workers until the problem of our own work is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Does our work answer the demands of God's eternal purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is our ministry fully meeting God's need?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If so, we cannot require less than this from any fellow worker that he have a clear seeing objectively, and that he have a fundamental breaking of the natural life subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Gospels our Lord showed us that it is He who appoints fellow workers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He chose twelve disciples, and He sent them forth in six pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We read of Simon "and" Andrew, James "and" John, Philip "and" Bartholomew, Thomas "and" Matthew, James "and" Thaddaeus, and Simon "and" Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All twelve disciples were fellow laborers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Each one labored together with the other eleven, but in a more specific sense each one had a special co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our Lord appointed them to a special task, and for the performance of that task He sent them forth two by two.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Gospels we read of two times six, but in Acts 2 we read of "Peter...with the eleven."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Six companies of two have now become a company of twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the disciples labored throughout the country, they were divided into pairs of fellow workers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When they were assembled in Jerusalem, they were not there as a testimony for the unsaved but as a testimony to the resurrection of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They could not meet in the assembly as fellow workers, so the six pairs were dissolved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But when there was a special piece of ministry that had to be done, we read of special cooperation among them again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Acts 3 we find Peter and John going out together, and in Acts 8 we find the same two going forth as special fellow workers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The principle governing a special commission to special ministry is six times two, but the principle governing the Christian life is the oneness of all the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Recorded by P.D.</S>
