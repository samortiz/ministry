<p>Prayer: O Lord, we worship You. For Your economy and Your speaking, we worship You. We bow down to You from the depths of our being. You are the Lord who speaks. You speak words to us with enlightening revelation and life supply. O Lord, as we come to the final message, we pray that You would speak thoroughly and completely. We also pray that You would reach every one of us with Your words that we may all hear Your speaking. O Lord Jesus, as the speaking God, You are the Word of God; we worship You. May You touch every one of us in our depths and sow every word of Yours into us. O Lord, cleanse us with Your precious blood; we need Your cleansing every day. We have the filthiness of our natural being, the filthiness of our flesh, the filthiness of our lusts, and the filthiness of the earth. Lord, all these need the cleansing of Your precious blood in every way. We thank and praise You that Your precious blood is always accompanied by the anointing. After the cleansing of the blood, we enjoy the anointing of the ointment. We believe that Your ointment is here anointing us. Once more we ask You to give us utterance and grant us fresh and up-to-date words. Amen.</p><p>In this message we come to the conclusion, which is the consummation of the believers&rsquo; experience of the grace of God in His economy. In the course of carrying out His economy, God first handed down the law. The law is His portrait, His image, His &ldquo;photo&rdquo;; it is not His organic person. Galatians 3:21 tells us that the law cannot give life because there is no life in the law. Although a photo cannot give life, it has its function. The law in God&rsquo;s economy is used by God to expose sinners in their sinful nature and evil deeds. Before His law all mouths are shut. We have violated, broken, every commandment of the Ten Commandments, from the first one to the last one. We have had numerous idols apart from God. We have not taken God as our satisfaction, neither have we taken what He has accomplished for us as our rest. Rather, we have forsaken God as the fountain of living waters to hew out for ourselves cisterns, broken cisterns, which hold no water (Jer. 2:13). We have not traced back to our beginning, our origin, to honor our source&mdash;the very God who created us. Furthermore, our hearts have been filled with murder, adultery, stealing, lying, and coveting. We have not lived out God&rsquo;s outward virtues according to His inward attributes.</p><p>David was a very devout person. In Psalm 1 he related how he appreciated the law and meditated in it by day and by night like a tree planted beside streams of water. However, after David&rsquo;s word of appreciation in Psalm 1, God repudiated David&rsquo;s concept and announced concerning His Anointed, &ldquo;You are My Son; / Today I have begotten You&rdquo; (2:7b). In resurrection God has begotten His Anointed as His firstborn Son. God&rsquo;s desire is that we listen to His anointed Firstborn instead of appreciating the law. Psalm 3 was written by David in his flight from his son Absalom&rsquo;s rebellion, which was the outcome of David&rsquo;s sin of murder and robbing a man of his wife. In Psalm 1, David was one who appreciated the law, yet in Psalm 3 he was fleeing from his rebellious son as a consequence of his murder and robbing a man of his wife. The result of David&rsquo;s appreciation of the law was murder and robbing a man of his wife. The law of God fully uncovered David&rsquo;s sinful nature and evil deeds. The entire book of one hundred fifty psalms shows us that the law is used by God to expose man in his sinful nature and evil deeds.</p><p>Now the New Testament believers in God&rsquo;s economy are not under law but under grace. The grace in God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s embodiment. God became flesh to dwell among us, full of grace, and of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace. When God comes, grace comes. God&rsquo;s embodiment is grace to us. When we receive grace, we obtain God.</p><p>God&rsquo;s economy is to work out an organism for the Divine Trinity. How does He work this out? It is by His becoming flesh to be a man that His divinity and humanity might be united and mingled to produce a God-man. This God-man is grace. Whomever He meets, He is grace to them; wherever He goes, He is grace. He is simply grace. If we have Him, we have grace. Hence, in the Bible grace is called the grace of Christ. The embodied grace came for us to receive as our enjoyment and supply. However, there are few who see this today, even fewer who preach this, and very few who live this out.</p><p>If we experience the grace in God&rsquo;s economy, there will be a consummation&mdash;the organic Body of Christ. Christ to us is grace; as such, He comes into us to be our life and person. He not only lives in us but also lives with us. Moreover, He wants us to live along with Him. This is to enjoy grace as our inner supply. Such an enjoyment of grace spontaneously produces a result. This result is not merely that we do good. Rather, it is that Christ lives with us and we with Him. When we live Christ and magnify Christ, we become the living members, organic members, of Christ, and we all are organically joined as an organism, which is the church. This organism grows continually, and ultimately there will be a consummation&mdash;the New Jerusalem.</p><p>The last stanza of <em>Hymns,</em> #840 says,</p><p class="hbody">In God&rsquo;s house and in Thy Body<br />Builded up I long to be,<br />That within this corporate vessel<br />All shall then Thy glory see;<br />That Thy Bride, the glorious city,<br />May appear upon the earth,<br />As a lampstand brightly beaming<br />To express to all Thy worth.</p><p>Christianity has not seen this, and accordingly, they do not have such a result. I expect that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there will be such a possibility and such an expression. This is my burden, and this is why I grieve. Today there are many arguments and discussions, but there are not many who have seen this vision. If you see this vision, you will weep. Where is &ldquo;the glorious city&rdquo; today? &ldquo;That Thy Bride, the glorious city, may appear upon the earth&rdquo;&mdash;is this possible? Are we enjoying grace and the supply of grace? May the Lord have mercy upon us. We are a group of people who really need His mercy. We should be a group of people who experience and enjoy grace in our living and in our words and actions. This grace is God&rsquo;s embodiment that we supply to others that they also may receive grace with us. As a result, our experience has a consummation&mdash;the Body of Christ.</p>
