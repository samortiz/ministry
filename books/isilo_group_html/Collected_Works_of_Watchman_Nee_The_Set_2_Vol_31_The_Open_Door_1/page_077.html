Brother Ju Yao-ju was introduced to work in a "Wounded Soldier Assistance Organization" on a trial basis as a secretarial clerk. His testing period is over at the end of February, and if he does well, he will begin as a regular in March. Thank God for finding us some jobs. We ask the Lord to give us an opportunity to learn how to serve others and to ease the burden which the brothers and sisters bear for us.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Hu Lan-sheng, Ju Yao-ju<br />February 15</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>A few letters from Brother Lan Tsi-yi: Missionary Hai of the Charismatic Crusade, who is traveling with three companions from the China Inland Mission and four from the Lutheran Church, is going to Hong Kong with us tomorrow. Through her kindness, she purchased three tickets for us. By God's good arrangement, Sister Ma, Miss Yao, and I will leave with them for Canton tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. (This was quoted from a letter from Hankow written on January 26&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>Thank and praise the Lord! His gracious hand held us and His loving arms covered us. All the words in Psalm 121 were fulfilled in us. We, who are so unworthy of grace, have received the greatest grace, and we cannot refrain from praising the Lord with a marveling heart! We began our journey by train on January 26 and arrived safely in Canton on the morning of the thirtieth. That evening we changed to the Canton-Kowloon train and arrived in Kowloon. The train went very fast. The train from Wu-ch'ang that traveled on the twenty-third to the twenty-fifth was only ahead of us by one day. We can only praise and thank the Lord! We also thank you sisters for your petitions.</p><p>Missionary Hai and the others will return to England on a ship which leaves on the eighth or the tenth. Mrs. Wu sent a letter yesterday saying that she was taking the train to Canton on February 1. The brothers and sisters in Hong Kong are all well. I will need a few more days here. If nothing new happens, I will return to Hankow after the Lord's Day after I meet with Mr. Lee. On the return trip to Hankow, I must pass though Ch'ang-sha and then transfer to Ch'ang-Teh and Yuan-Jiang. I will be delayed one week by this transfer. I will then return to Hankow from Hunan. God will have to give grace for my safety in traveling and the arrangements of all things. I hope you will pray for me. (From a letter sent on February 2 from Hong Kong&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>God's presence is so sweet! I have seen God's manifested grace in all aspects on this trip. At the same time, I have also seen the hunger and thirst among so many brothers and sisters in each locality, the need of the gospel among the sinners, as well as my own poverty and depravity. Through these I have gained some understanding of the Lord's desire in this age.</p><p>I took a sailboat to Yi-Yang with Brother Zhang on the seventeenth. I returned to Ch'ang-sha on the sixth. I had originally decided to return to Hankow the same night, but Brother Wu-ru insisted that I stay in Ch'ang-sha for two days of meetings with two special messages and one table meeting. This is a chance for me to receive grace before the Lord with the brothers and sisters in Ch'ang-sha. Praise the Lord! By the Lord's arrangement, I left Hunan on the evening of the twenty-first and arrived safely in Hankow on the twenty-second. (From a letter sent from Hankow on February 24&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>Through God's sovereign arrangement, Brother Liu Guo-jieh has found a job working for the Health Department.</p><p>Brother Liu Chu-fei and his uncle, Brother Liu Jing-hsi, are both in Ch'ang-sha with their families. Brother Chu-fei is working as a physician at the Ren-Shu Hospital. Their mailing address is Ren-Shu Hospital, Ch'ang-sha, Hunan. Witness Lee's second sister came to Hankow a few days ago and has already returned to Hsu-Chang. His third brother came to Hankow also. His sister came especially to bring her brother to the meeting hall to hear the gospel. Please pray for her brother.</p><p>Brother Gu Teh-chang has already found the meeting hall. He came to Hankow in December of last year but did not know where we met and could not find us. Brother Ju made a special trip to speak with him today. He is living in the Heng-Chung Cloth Factory at 1 Yung-Teh Lane. Sister Wang Shuai-hsin and her two younger sisters are both living in the upstairs of the Gospel Court.
