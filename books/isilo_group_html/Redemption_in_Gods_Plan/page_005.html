SPIRIT, SOUL, AND BODY</h2>
<p>God created man with three parts&mdash;a spirit, a soul, and a body. God formed man&rsquo;s body from the dust of the ground, and then He breathed into man&rsquo;s body the breath of life, and man became a living soul. The breath of life became the human spirit. When the human spirit was combined with the human body, the soul was produced (Gen. 2:7). Man has a visible body, and within man there is an invisible spirit. Between the visible body and the invisible spirit is the soul. Man is composed of three parts&mdash;a spirit, a soul, and a body.</p>
<p>With our body we contact things in the physical realm, and with our spirit we contact things in the spiritual realm. With our soul, which is between our body and our spirit, we contact things in the psychological realm. Our body uses various senses and faculties to contact physical things. Our spirit uses the functions of the conscience, intuition, and fellowship to contact divine and spiritual things. Our soul uses our mind, emotion, and will to contact things in the psychological realm. Our mind is our thinking organ with which we think and consider. Our will is our decision-making organ with which we plan, judge, decide, and choose. With our emotions we feel delight, anger, sorrow, joy, love, hate, excitement, or depression. Our soul is composed of these three parts: mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to know our body or our soul, but it is difficult for us to understand our human spirit. Our spirit is the innermost part of our being, and it is the organ with which we contact God, know Him, and fellowship with Him. Only our spirit is able to know God and fellowship with Him. Neither our body nor our soul can contact God. Only our spirit can contact and know God. The inward feeling of needing God, the sense and realization of God in the depth of our being, and the condemnation and approval of our conscience are functions of our spirit.</p>
<p>Man is the highest creature, not only because the human life is the highest created life or because man was created in God&rsquo;s image and according to God&rsquo;s likeness, but also because man has a spirit in addition to a soul and a body. Other creatures have only a soul; they do not have a spirit, so they cannot understand or fellowship with God. Among all the creatures on earth, only man was created with a spirit, because God in His plan determined that only man would have His life. Hence, we can become the many brothers of Christ. God created us with a spirit so that we can contact Him and receive His life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD CREATING MAN GOOD AND UPRIGHT</h2>
<p>Ecclesiastes 7:29 says that God made man upright. When man was formed by God, man was upright, good, and clean, not crooked, evil, or filthy. Man did not have sin, corruption, or defects. Thus, after creating man, God referred to the creation of man as being very good (Gen. 1:31). Because God is good and upright, He prepared a good and upright vessel to contain His holy life; He did not prepare an evil or crooked vessel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN HAVING CREATED LIFE</h2>
<p>Although man was created in God&rsquo;s image and according to God&rsquo;s likeness and was created good and upright, the human life is only a created life; it is not like the uncreated life of God. The human life was created and has a beginning and an ending, but God&rsquo;s life is uncreated and does not have a beginning or an ending. God&rsquo;s life is from eternity to eternity. No matter how high the human life may be, it is still inferior to God&rsquo;s life. God&rsquo;s life is eternal, but man&rsquo;s life is finite. God&rsquo;s life is divine and glorious, but man&rsquo;s life at its best can only be clean and sinless, not divine or glorious. Man was not created with God&rsquo;s divine, glorious nature. The human life is outside of God and has nothing to do with God. Although man has God&rsquo;s image and His likeness, unregenerated man does not have God&rsquo;s life in his deepest part. Although man has a spirit, the created human spirit does not have God&rsquo;s life in it. This spirit enables man to know God and to fellowship with God, but it does not have God&rsquo;s life or God&rsquo;s nature. Man is merely a creature created by God; the created man does not possess the uncreated life of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN BEING THE CENTER OF ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>In the universe God&rsquo;s attention is focused on the earth, and the center of the earth was the garden of Eden. After God created man, He put man in the garden of Eden (2:8). This shows that God&rsquo;s attention is focused on man. Man is the center of the universe. Man is God&rsquo;s treasure. The earth is important to God because man is on the earth. God wants man, God loves man, and man is the desire of God&rsquo;s heart, because God has determined to gain man so that He can carry out His heart&rsquo;s desire and fulfill His purpose through man. God wants man to have His life and nature and thus be like Him. Man does not have God&rsquo;s life and nature, but he has God&rsquo;s image and likeness. Man is a creature, but he has a spirit with which he can know God and fellowship with God. Man does not have God&rsquo;s life, but with his spirit he can receive God&rsquo;s life. Man is a vessel to contain God&rsquo;s life. Of all the creatures on earth, only man has the image and likeness of God, and only man has a spirit to receive God&rsquo;s life. Therefore, God&rsquo;s attention is focused on man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD GIVING MAN A WILL<br />
IN ORDER TO CHOOSE HIS PURPOSE</h2>
<p>God created us so that we would have His life and become the many brothers of Christ. God wants man to choose this purpose. God created man in His image and according to His likeness, and He created man with a spirit, but He did not put His life into man. Rather, He made man with a will so that man might choose to receive God&rsquo;s life. God wants man to exercise his will to cooperate with Him.</p>
<p>Therefore, after creating man, God put man in front of the tree of life in the garden of Eden (vv. 8-9). God&rsquo;s intention was for man to choose the tree of life in order to receive life. The tree of life signifies God&rsquo;s eternal life (3:22). God put man in front of the tree of life so that man might choose to receive the life of the tree of life, that is, to receive the life of God.</p>
<p>God put the tree of the knowledge of good and evil next to the tree of life. Many people think that if the tree of the knowledge of good and evil had not been next to the tree of life, there would not have been a problem. However, because God is so great, He gave man a will to choose between the two trees. If God had to force man to take of the tree of life, He would not be great. But because He is so great, He gave man the ability to choose. God honors man by giving man this capacity.</p>
<p>Some people think that if God had put His life into man when he was created, there would not have been any problems. But this is not what God did. God would rather give man the ability to choose. If God had done everything to accomplish His will, His wisdom would not have been manifested. God is not afraid of obstacles or troubles. In order to manifest His wisdom, He gave man the ability to choose to receive His life.</p>
<p>God created all things so that man could receive His life. But man still did not have God&rsquo;s life after the heavens, the earth, and all things were created. Although man had God&rsquo;s image and likeness, had a human spirit, and was good and upright, he did not have God&rsquo;s life. The man whom God created was humanly complete, but he lacked the life of God; he was devoid of God&rsquo;s purpose. God did everything for man, but He did not put His life into man. How then did the life of God enter into man? The Bible reveals that God lets man choose to receive His life.</p>
<p>Hence, the highest point of creation was merely the culmination of God&rsquo;s preparation of the material needed for His purpose. The purpose of God&rsquo;s plan was for man to receive His life. Creation only prepared man as a vessel to receive God&rsquo;s life, but God will not put His life into man without man&rsquo;s consent. Creation merely prepared man to receive God&rsquo;s life; it did not give God&rsquo;s life to man. After man was created, he had to exercise his will to receive the life of God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Redemption in God's Plan &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
