   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY CHRIST FOR THE BUILDING Psalms 111 to 125 Scripture Reading: Psa 111:1, 10b; 112:1a; 113:1-3; 115:18b; 116:13, 17-19; 117:1-2; 118:22-24, 26-27; 119:14, 24, 36, 59, 62, 103, 105, 111, 164, 167; 122:1-9; 125:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the preceding chapter we have covered Psalms 107, 108, 109, and 110.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this group of four Psalms, Psalm 110 is the climax.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No other Psalm is higher regarding Christ than this Psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is very short, and it has only a few main points, but these points are exceedingly significant.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we come to Psalms 111 through 119, which are full of the saints' praise to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may call these Psalms the "Hallelujah Psalms."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because we have just touched the peak concerning Christ in Psalm 110, we must shout Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the first verse of Psalm 111 begins with Hallelujah, and we have Hallelujahs throughout all these Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These praises are "in the assembly and in the congregation" Psa 111:1 ; "in the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hallelujah" Psa 116:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>PSALM 118 CHRIST THE CORNERSTONE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now we come to Psalm 118, which all Bible teachers recognize as the last Psalm regarding Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not forget the five points concerning Christ in Psalm 110: He is the enthroned King, the Victor, the Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, the Warrior, and the Coming One.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is indeed wonderful, but there is one item missing in Psalm 110: there is no mention of Christ for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now, in Psalm 118 we have Christ for the building presented to us in a marvelous way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 22: "The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is just a short verse, but we cannot express how much this verse means to us and to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It has been used and quoted many times in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is Christ for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ today is not only the enthroned King, the ordained Priest, the Victor, the Warrior, and the Coming One; He is also the stone that was rejected by the builders.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Jewish nation, the Jewish people, were the builders of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God used them to build up something upon this earth for Himself, but they rejected the best stone of all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even the Lord Jesus, when He was on this earth, quoted this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was quite frank.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He asked the Jews whether they had read the Scripture in Psalm 118: "Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Matt 21:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today Christ is the stone for God's building: "And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth into an holy temple in the Lord" Eph 2:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner" 1 Pet 2:4, 6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner" Acts 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even Peter before the chief priests said that Christ is made the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Included within Christ as the cornerstone are His resurrection, His ascension, His enthronement, and His ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is not only the King and the Priest, but also the stone for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In another sense, He is also the Builder; but the point upon which we must now focus is that He Himself is the material for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is the cornerstone, and we are all the other stones produced out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the living stone, and we have all been made living stones by Him 1 Pet 2:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is the resurrected stone, and in His resurrection we have been made the living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, He is not only the building stone, but also the stone for producing many more stones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the leading living stone, which produces so many others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Praise the Lord!</S>
