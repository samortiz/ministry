The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s testifying was only a prophecy, a foretelling, not a charge. Hence, he should not have taken this as a command but as a warning. Although Paul did not know exactly what was awaiting in Jerusalem, he knew, through the warning of the Holy Spirit, that bonds and afflictions awaited him.</p><p>In verse 24 Paul continues, &ldquo;But I consider my life of no account as if it were precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify the gospel of the grace of God.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s word here is related to the Lord&rsquo;s New Testament move in propagating the resurrected Christ through the gospel.</p><p>In 20:24 the Greek word rendered &ldquo;life&rdquo; also means soul. Paul&rsquo;s word in this verse implies that he sensed that he would be martyred.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SCOPE OF PAUL&rsquo;S TEACHING</h2><p>Verse 25 continues, &ldquo;And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom, will see my face no more.&rdquo; This verse indicates that in Ephesus Paul proclaimed the kingdom of God. We have seen that the kingdom of God is the main subject of the apostles&rsquo; preaching in Acts (1:3; 8:12; 14:22; 19:8; 28:23, 31). This is not a material kingdom visible to human sight, but a kingdom of the divine life.</p><p>In 20:25 Paul tells the elders of the church in Ephesus that they will see his face no more. This indicates that Paul realized beforehand that he would be martyred.</p><p>Acts 20:26 and 27 say, &ldquo;Wherefore I testify to you on this day, that I am clean from the blood of all men; for I did not shrink from declaring to you all the counsel of God.&rdquo; Literally, the Greek word translated &ldquo;on this day&rdquo; means &ldquo;on today&rsquo;s day,&rdquo; a very forceful expression. Paul&rsquo;s word in verse 27 about not shrinking from declaring all the counsel of God indicates that he carried on a great work in Ephesus. Here we have an indication of the scope of Paul&rsquo;s teaching to the dear saints in Ephesus.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />PLACING OVERSEERS AMONG THE FLOCK</h2><p>Paul&rsquo;s word in 20:28 is very important: &ldquo;Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers, to shepherd the church of God, which He obtained through His own blood.&rdquo; As in 1 Peter 5:2, the Greek word for &ldquo;flock&rdquo; literally means &ldquo;little flock.&rdquo; This flock is little in number (Luke 12:32) compared with the world. It is a little herb for the supply of life, not a big tree for birds to lodge in (Matt. 13:31-32 and notes), not a huge religion like Christendom.</p><p>In 20:28 Paul tells the elders of the church in Ephesus that the Holy Spirit had placed them among the flock as overseers. It was the apostles who appointed the elders in every church (14:23). But here Paul, the leading one, who did the appointing says that the Holy Spirit did it. This indicates that the Holy Spirit was one with the apostles in their appointing the elders and that the apostles had done it according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>From Paul&rsquo;s word concerning the Holy Spirit placing overseers among the flock we see that the existence of the churches is altogether due to the Holy Spirit, not due to the apostles. Although the apostles had appointed the elders, here Paul says that this was the work of the Holy Spirit. This reveals that a church comes into existence only through the work of the Holy Spirit. In other words, the work of the apostles concerning the churches should be absolutely the work of the Holy Spirit. Because the Holy Spirit establishes the elders, it is the Holy Spirit who establishes the churches.</p><p>The overseers in verse 28 are the elders in verse 17. This proves that overseers and elders are synonymous terms denoting the same persons. To make an overseer a bishop of a district to rule over the elders of various localities in that district is grossly erroneous. This is what Ignatius taught. His erroneous teaching gave the ground to rank and brought in hierarchy.</p><p>The Greek word for &ldquo;overseer&rdquo; is <i>episkopos,</i> from <i>epi,</i> meaning over, and <i>skopos,</i> meaning seer; hence, overseer (bishop, from Latin <i>episcopus</i>). An overseer (1 Tim. 3:2) in a local church is an elder. The two titles refer to the same person: elder, denoting a person of maturity; overseer, denoting the function of an elder. It was Ignatius in the second century who taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder. From this erroneous teaching came the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope. This teaching is also the source of the Episcopal system of ecclesiastical government. Both the hierarchy and the system are abominable in the sight of God.</p><h2 class="head1">SHEPHERDING THE FLOCK</h2><p>In Acts 20:28 Paul speaks of the elders shepherding the flock. The main responsibility of the elders as overseers is not to rule over the flock but to shepherd the flock, to take all-inclusive tender care of the flock, the church of God. The elders are not placed in the church by the Holy Spirit as rulers but as shepherds. Shepherding the flock of God requires suffering for the Body of Christ as Christ did (Col. 1:24). This kind of shepherding with suffering will be rewarded with the unfading crown of glory (1 Pet. 5:4).</p><p>According to 1 Peter 5:1-3, the elders are not to lord it over the flock; that is, they are not to exercise lordship over the ruled (Matt. 20:25). Among the believers, besides Christ there should be no other lord; all should be servants, even slaves (Matt. 20:26-27; 23:10-11). The elders in the church can take only the leadership (not the lordship), which all the believers should honor and follow (1 Thes. 5:12; 1 Tim. 5:17).</p><h2 class="head1">THE VALUE OF THE CHURCH<br />AS A TREASURE TO GOD</h2><p>In Acts 20:28 Paul says that the church of God has been obtained &ldquo;through His own blood.&rdquo; This indicates the precious love of God for the church and the preciousness, the exceeding worth of the church in the eyes of God. Here the apostle does not touch the divine life and nature of the church as in Ephesians 5:23-32, but the value of the church as a treasure to God, a treasure which He acquired with His own precious blood. Paul expected that the elders as overseers would also treasure the church as God did.</p><p>Both the Holy Spirit and God&rsquo;s own blood are divine provisions for the church He treasures. The Holy Spirit denotes God&rsquo;s Person, and His own blood, God&rsquo;s work. God&rsquo;s redemptive work acquired the church; now God&rsquo;s Person, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), cares for the church through the overseers.</p><p>God&rsquo;s own blood is the blood of Jesus Christ (1 John 1:7). This also implies that the Lord Jesus is God. In the following message we shall consider in more detail the meaning of God&rsquo;s obtaining the church through His own blood.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_163.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_165.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Acts &nbsp; pg 164</div><br></body></html>
