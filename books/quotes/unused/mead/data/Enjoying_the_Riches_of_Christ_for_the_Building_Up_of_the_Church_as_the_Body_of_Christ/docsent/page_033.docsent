   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT EATING, DRINKING, GROWING, TRANSFORMATION, AND BUILDING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:2; 5:7b-8; 10:3-4, 16-18, 21; 11:23-25; 12:13b, 3b; 3:6, 9b, 12a</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From the verses in the Scripture reading above we can see the unique matters of eating, drinking, growing, transformation, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word transformed is used in 2 Corinthians 3:18, which says, "But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Transformation is also indicated in 1 Corinthians 3:9 and 12.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 9 says, "For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's cultivated land, God's building."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 12 says, "But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A farm is not a mine; a farm is for growing plants.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in verse 12 we do not have plants; we have gold, silver, and precious stones which are good for building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The farm grows plants, yet eventually we have precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Transformation may also be illustrated by petrified wood.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Petrified wood is from trees that have become stone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The matters of eating, drinking, growing, transformation, and building are not merely our teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are the revelation in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many in Christianity often refer to 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Brethren published books dealing with the eleven problems in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first of the eleven problems is the problem of division 1:10 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some said they were of Paul, some were of Apollos, some of Cephas, and some said they were of Christ 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To this Paul said, "Is Christ divided?" v. 13 . Secondly, this book deals with the excommunication of an evil brother 5:1-13 . A sinful brother committed incest with his stepmother, so Paul told the Corinthians to remove the evil man from among them v. 13 . In chapter six is the dealing with lawsuits among believers 6:1-11 and dealing with the abuse of freedom 6:12-20 . In chapter seven is the dealing with marriage life 7:1-40 . Following this is the dealing with the eating of things sacrificed to idols 8:1 11:1 with the vindication of Paul's apostleship and authority 9:1-27 . In chapter eleven are the matters of head covering 11:2-16 and the Lord's supper 11:17-34 . Then in 12:1 14:40 is the dealing with the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lastly are the dealings with the matter of resurrection 15:1-58 and the collection of the gift 16:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to teaching, the Brethren were right, and we have come to know their teachings very well, but I have the burden to convince you that teachings alone are not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We ourselves can publish many books on the eleven problems in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just on the matters of division and excommunication there are many things to say.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, what would be the use of mere knowledge about these things?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>None of these problems is the central concept of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The central concept, on the negative side, is that the Corinthians were sick with all these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This sickness was due to their emphasis on knowledge and the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were sick with divisions, sinfulness, lawsuits, wrongness toward marriage, idol sacrifices, and many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, this is because they had too much teaching, too much knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Knowledge puffs up 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, they overemphasized and misused the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the other hand, however, the Corinthians were short of the eating and enjoying of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Medical doctors today tell us that certain sicknesses are due to the shortage of vitamins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The best cure for these sicknesses is not to take medicine but to take the proper vitamins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some diseases, however, require an antibiotic, a germicide to kill the germs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 1 Corinthians Christ is the real vitamin, and the cross is the real germicide, the antibiotic.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul said, "For I did not determine to know anything among you except Christ, and this One crucified" 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Corinthians were sick with many divisions because they were short of the proper "vitamins."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To feed a patient quickly, doctors may feed him intravenously.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When a patient is brought into a hospital in serious condition, he is fed through the veins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then after a few days, he can be fed through the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The main thing the doctors care for is the feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this book Paul was feeding the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The best cure for problems is eating.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Regrettably, both the fundamentalists and the Pentecostals have not seen the crucial matters in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is hard to hear a message in Christianity telling us that 1 Corinthians is for eating, drinking, growing, transforming, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, all the messages from this book are on teaching, doctrine, gifts, and the manifestation of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The King James Version translates build as edify in 1 Corinthians 14 vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Greek, edify means to build; it is the verbal form of the noun for house.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, most people do not understand it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Not many speak of building up.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many say that to speak in tongues edifies them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As long as they are edified, they are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Speaking in tongues may edify the speaker, but it does not build up the church vv.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>4-5 .</S>
