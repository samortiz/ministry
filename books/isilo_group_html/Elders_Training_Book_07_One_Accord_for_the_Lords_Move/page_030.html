<p>Paul&rsquo;s leadership goes through the second section of Acts to the end of Hebrews. His leadership was altogether based upon his divine revelation because in the divine revelation the design can be seen. In other words, the divine revelation is the blueprint, the design. Regardless of how much Barnabas could do or Apollos could teach, they never put out a design, a blueprint. We cannot read one chapter of Barnabas&rsquo;s or Apollos&rsquo;s writings in the Bible. But Paul has fourteen Epistles in the Scriptures. His blueprint is perfect, completed, and finished in all details. We do not have another blueprint. If there were two blueprints and two designers in the building work, this would create trouble and confusion. Some would build and others would tear down. While the building is going on, there would be fighting.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s leadership was based upon his divine revelation, which is the real design of God&rsquo;s building. The designer&rsquo;s instructions concerning the building are according to his blueprint. In the Lord&rsquo;s move on this earth from Acts through Hebrews, there was one teaching and one leadership based upon this one teaching. In the first twelve chapters of Acts was the teaching given by Peter, and the leadership was based upon his teaching. Thus, the leadership was with Peter. In the last sixteen chapters of Acts was the teaching and the revelation of Paul, and the leadership was based upon his teaching. Thus, the leadership was with Paul.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE WORD OF THE LEADERSHIP</h2>
<p>In both of these leaderships, there was the practice of taking the word of the leadership. Paul told Timothy to go somewhere and he went (1 Cor. 4:17). Paul told another one to stay in a certain place and he stayed (Titus 1:5). Today&rsquo;s practice is that the one taking the lead would not dare to say, &ldquo;Brother so-and-so, go to that place.&rdquo; Today&rsquo;s leaders would not do this. Everybody pretends to be so spiritual.</p>
<p>A brother in the leadership may tell another brother, &ldquo;In these days I have been very much with the Lord concerning your future. I feel that you need to go to the Lord and see what he will tell you concerning going to Greece.&rdquo; Then the brother may respond that he is not clear, so he will go to the Lord and pray. Actually, this brother has already decided that he would never go to Greece. Greece was not his choice, but he was pretending to be very spiritual. He would not say that he did not like Greece. Instead he would say, &ldquo;I will bring this matter to the Lord. I will pray and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading.&rdquo; Deep in his being, though, he has already made the decision not to go. He may wait for a whole week before he would let the brother who is taking the lead know what his decision is. When he comes back he might say, &ldquo;I have been praying desperately, day after day, and I was made clear that the Lord does not want me to go to Greece.&rdquo; This is very &ldquo;spiritual.&rdquo; The leader is &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; and the follower is &ldquo;spiritual,&rdquo; but there is no spirituality. Then who goes to Greece? Maybe only a brother who could not do anything would feel burdened to go. This is today&rsquo;s poor situation.</p>
<p>From 1932 to 1949 in mainland China I had no thought about being in the leadership and I never wanted to be a leader. In this matter of sending others, not only did others pretend to be spiritual but I did also. I may have been so sure that a certain brother should go to Greece, but I did not want to be considered as a dictator or be misunderstood as being a pope who gives decrees to others. I may have said to a brother, &ldquo;Do you realize that in Greece there is some need? Would you please pray about this, and pray to the Lord to see if you are the right person to go?&rdquo; Actually within me, the brother I was talking to was the right person already. I confess that I was timid because I was quite concerned about being designated as a dictator or controller.</p>
<p>I can boast that no church in the United States has ever received a letter from me telling them what to do. The leading ones in the churches can testify this for me. Whenever the brothers came to me, I always told them to go back to the Lord and pray. Some have said that there is no need to go to Brother Lee because he always answers the same way&mdash;&ldquo;Go to the Lord and pray.&rdquo; Seemingly I was &ldquo;spiritual,&rdquo; yet there was some pretense.</p>
<p>I must confess that none among us, including me, dared to practice the truth in the genuineness of the proper way. In the Acts and the Epistles Paul told Timothy and his other co-workers to go to certain places, to remain in other places, and to come to him (Acts 17:14-15; 19:22; Phil. 2:19, 25; Col. 4:7-8; 1 Tim. 1:3; 2 Tim. 4:9, 11-12, 21; Titus 1:5; 3:12). He gave the orders. There was not one among his co-workers who received an order from him that would say, &ldquo;Let me pray for a couple of days and I will let you know.&rdquo; Their practice was absolutely different from our present practice because they all honored the same leadership based upon the same divine revelation.</p>
<p>We have not practiced in this way because of the strong background and heavy surrounding of Christianity. On the one hand, control is practiced along with hierarchy, especially in Catholicism with the pope as the highest authority. Then there is the so-called &ldquo;freedom,&rdquo; which is actually a kind of scattering or dispersion. This kind of so-called freedom, which is actually a dispersion or scattering, is worse than controlling because it does more damage to the church, the Body of Christ. To some extent controlling is always hated. But the dispersion or scattering under the cloak of freedom is somewhat welcomed. In Protestantism both control and dispersion can be seen. A capable minister, a strong and knowledgeable teacher, might exercise control. Others would not go along with this kind of control. They want to stay in a kind of dispersed freedom.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 07: One Accord for the Lord's Move &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
