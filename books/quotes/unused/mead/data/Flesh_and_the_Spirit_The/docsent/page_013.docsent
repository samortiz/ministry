   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is why Paul comes to the conclusion that we need to walk according to the spirit Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To walk is to have our being and our living with all that we say and do.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our living and our being with all that we say and do must be according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to walk according to the spirit, according to the One who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have no more liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Christian walk is not a matter of right or wrong and of loving or hating.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is a matter of walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only this life, this kind of walk, can be recorded in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nothing else counts in the heavenly account.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why the Lord said, "Apart from Me you can do nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What we do apart from Christ can never be recorded in the heavenly account.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the good things we do apart from Christ, regardless of how good they would be, are not a help to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The walk according to the spirit is for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only the persons who walk according to the spirit can be the proper members for the building up of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not have such a walk, sooner or later we will be a trouble to our local church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may say, "I am for the church; I love the church so much."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But you have to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you do not walk according to the spirit, either you will go away or you will be a trouble in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No other life can build up the church life, but the life that walks according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This walk saves us from all kinds of bugs, germs, troubles, dissensions, opinions, and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This walk according to the spirit saves us to the uttermost, making us a profit to the building up of the church, not a trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is only one life with one walk which fits in the building up of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That life is Christ with the walk according to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No doubt, we have an enemy in our flesh, but we do not need to fight against him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have the Lord within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not need to strive to fight against the enemy; nor do we need to strive to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should do only one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul tells us clearly that this one thing is to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we walk according to the spirit, the enemy can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The enemy is right in your flesh, so close to you, yet he can do nothing to touch you, because you are walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This walking, spontaneously, is your worshipping, your serving, and your working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Christian life plus the church life is a life of walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have the flesh and in addition to this we have such a wonderful human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today our human spirit is regenerated, indwelt by Christ, by the Holy Spirit, and by God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have such a wonderful human spirit for our application.</S>
