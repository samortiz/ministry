<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Be the Mediator of a Better Covenant</H2><P>In His death Christ made the better covenant for us with God. In ascension He became the Mediator, the Surety, of the better covenant made by Him through His death (Heb. 8:6; 9:15-17; 7:22). As the Mediator, He is the Executor in His heavenly ministry of the new covenant which became the new testament which He bequeathed to us by His death with all the riches of the new testament. As the Surety He is not only the pledge but also the Guarantor to guarantee all the blessings of the new testament bequeathed to us by His death.</P><P>In ascension Christ became the Executor of the new testament (9:15-17). The word testament means a will. In this will many blessings have been bequeathed to the believers. Every will requires someone to execute it, to carry it out. In His ascension Christ became such an Executor.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Be the High Priest to Care for His Believers<br>and to Dress the Lampstands&#151;the Churches</H2><P>In His ascension Christ is the High Priest to care for all the believers and to care for the lampstands&#151;the churches (Heb. 4:15; 7:26; Rev. 1:13; 2:1). In the Old Testament type the priest cared for the lampstand by dressing it that the lampstand might shine brightly. Likewise, today in His ascension, Christ as our High Priest cares for His believers and cares for the churches as the lampstands.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Be the Administrator of the Divine Government<br>over the Universe</H2><P>Finally, Christ's ascension made Him the Administrator of the divine government over the universe (Rev. 1:5; 5:5-6). This fact is fully revealed in the book of Revelation. In Revelation 1:5, Christ is called "the Ruler of the kings of the earth." Today the One who governs the entire world, the Administrator of the entire universe, is not any king, any president, or any world organization. The head Ruler of God's government over the universe is Christ. He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords, and He administrates the entire universe for the purpose of fulfilling God's eternal plan. All the world situation is under His rule, not under the control of any nation. Jesus Christ is the Administrator of today's universe.</P><P>Our experience confirms the fact that Christ is ruling over the world situation in order to fulfill God's purpose. I was born and raised in China. I had no thought of coming to America. But about thirty-five years ago the Lord managed the world situation in such a way that many of us in the churches were forced to leave mainland China and to go to Taiwan. Then later the Lord arranged the situation again, causing us to leave Taiwan and to go to America. In this way the Lord's recovery was brought into the English language. If we had never come from China to America, the Lord's recovery would have been concealed in the Chinese language. Today the English language is spoken worldwide. After the Lord's recovery entered into the English language, it was brought to six continents. It was Jesus Christ as the Administrator of the universe who did this. Hallelujah!</P><P>Today in His ascension Christ is managing and administrating the entire universe. He will continue to do this until He comes back. This is the Christ whom we must experience, and this is the Christ whom we enjoy.</P>
