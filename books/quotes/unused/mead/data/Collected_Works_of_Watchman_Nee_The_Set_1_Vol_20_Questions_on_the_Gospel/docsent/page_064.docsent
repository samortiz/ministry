   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Forgiveness through God's People</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 20:23 says, "Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is not the mention of forgiveness in this verse strange?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Does this mean that the apostles have the authority to forgive sins on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do not understand the meaning of this verse, we will not be able to refute the pope's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The authority of our forgiveness as related to salvation is in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you go to Peter and he does not forgive you, does this mean that you are not saved?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No, salvation and the forgiveness of sins depend absolutely on receiving the precious blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then what does forgiveness in this verse mean?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It refers to a declaration which the church makes under the direction of the Holy Spirit and is based on the church's understanding of a person's forgiveness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must notice that it says, "Whosever sins you forgive," not "Whom you forgive."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"Whosever" is plural not singular; it is corporate not private; it is not by an individual but by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"Whosever sins you forgive" means that the church declares that the sins of a certain man have been forgiven and he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Someone may come to the church declaring, "I have heard the gospel and believed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Please receive me that I may be baptized and break bread the same way as the other disciples."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to receive him, the brothers have to know whether his sins have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the brothers know that his sins have been forgiven before God and that he is a child of God, they can declare that he has been forgiven and saved, and receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the brothers are not clear from within, they cannot make such a testimony for such a one; therefore, they cannot receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The forgiveness of the church is based on the forgiveness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church merely declares what God has already done.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through the church, God announces the condition of a man before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must pay attention to verse 22 since verse 23 follows it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only after verse 22 can we have verse 23.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 22 says, "And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Based upon the power and instruction of the Holy Spirit, the church determines whether one's sins have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not based on individual feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a person is saved, and the church is not sure and asks him to wait for a little, this will not affect his forgiveness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, after Paul was saved and came to Jerusalem, he desired to join himself to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But they were all afraid of him and did not believe that he had believed in the Lord and become a disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only after Barnabas testified for him was Paul able to be with the disciples coming in and going out in Jerusalem Acts 9:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the church cannot forgive or retain one's sins directly; it only declares that one's sins are forgiven or not forgiven before God, deciding if he may have fellowship and communion among the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Forgiveness to Restore Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First John 2:1 and 2 say, "My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must be clear about the special emphasis of the Gospel of John and 1 John.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Gospel of John shows the gospel among men; whereas 1 John shows the gospel in the heart of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Gospel of John has two lines: grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When grace is mentioned, truth is also mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First John also has two lines: God is love, and God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the one hand, it speaks of love, and on the other hand, it speaks of light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is the relationship between grace and truth, and love and light?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Love is in God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When it is expressed among men, it is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Light is in God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When it is expressed among men, it is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Gospel of John brings God to man, while 1 John brings man to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Gospel of John speaks of the matters of life, salvation, eternal life, and so forth; whereas 1 John speaks of fellowship, drawing near to God, and going to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Gospel of John deals with the matter of salvation; whereas 1 John deals with the matter of fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The beginning of 1 John speaks of the matter of fellowship, and chapters one and two speak on the forgiveness in this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are two kinds of relationships between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One is a kindred relationship in that we are saved and are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This relationship can never be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Let me ask: is a son no longer a son of his father because of his misbehavior?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No. If a son does not want to be his father's son, can he stop being his father's son? No. If a father denies his son, is the son no longer a child of his? No. If you are a certain man's son, can someone else or even Satan annul this fact? No. We can respectfully say that even God cannot deny this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, after a person is regenerated and becomes a child of God, no one is able to overthrow this relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This relationship can never be severed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Nevertheless, there is another type of relationship which is subject to interruption.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the relationship of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For example, although you are your father's son, if you do something wrong one day, you will be afraid to see your father for fear of his rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The more serious the mistake, the more you will be afraid to see him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Though your family relationship can never be cut off, your communication with your father may be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our relationship with God is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After we are saved, there is still the possibility that we will commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Whenever we sin, our fellowship with God is immediately cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In order for the fellowship with God to be restored, our sins must be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we commit sins we must, according to 1 John 1:9, "confess our sins."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must say, "O God, I was wrong in this matter; please forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After confessing this way, our fellowship with God can be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>By what means are we cleansed from our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are cleansed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many Christians try to use time to wash their sins away, instead of applying the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>How do they do this?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Some may commit a sin and stay in their bad feelings for several days, thinking that God could not forgive them so quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After five or ten days, when their heart is at peace, they think that the sin is no more.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They try to wash their sins away by using five or ten days instead of applying the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must remember that forgiveness of sins comes by the blood, not by forgetting.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We are not forgiven because we have forgotten our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Rather, the blood of His Son Jesus washes away all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God can only forgive our sins under the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Someone once asked a child what a person should do if he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The child answered, "He should do two things.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>First, he should feel sorrowful for several days, and second, he should be forgiven."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The theology of this child is the theology of many people.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is also the thought of many older people.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It seems that only if we suffer enough will we be forgiven; otherwise, we cannot be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Brothers and sisters, even if one suffers many days, he still cannot earn one percent of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>While we should have a sorrowful and penitent heart for our sins, our forgiveness does not depend upon our sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Rather, it depends upon the blood of Jesus who saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we confess our sins, God will forgive us through the blood of the Lord, and the fellowship between God and us will be restored.</S>
