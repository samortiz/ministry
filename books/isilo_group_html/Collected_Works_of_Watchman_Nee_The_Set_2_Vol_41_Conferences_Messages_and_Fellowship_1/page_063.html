All those who follow the Lord faithfully are likely to receive a similar label. Let me ask one question: Even though you are sober-minded before men, are you beside yourself to God? If you have never been beside yourself to God, you are only a half Christian. A Christian should be like Paul, who was sober-minded before men, but beside himself to God (2 Cor. 5:13).</p><p>For a Christian to be beside himself does not mean that he is beside himself with insanity. Rather, he is beside himself in a proper way. This kind of being beside oneself does not make one silly in actions and words; it is being beside oneself to God. Such a one is clear in his actions and words. He is sober-minded before men, but beside himself to God. The Bible tells us that both the Lord and the believers were considered by others to be crazy. Others may have felt sorry for Paul. He was educated, capable, and could do many things. Yet he chose to follow a supposedly dead man from Nazareth, and he preached that this One had risen from the dead. However, God was pleased with Paul because Paul was a man who was beside himself to God. Only such people can genuinely work for the Lord. Today the Lord is seeking for a group of men who are beside themselves for God's work. If there is not such a group of men, the Lord's work will not see any result. The Lord is after a group of people who are sober-minded before men but who are beside themselves to God. He can only use such men, and only such men can accomplish God's will and glorify His name. How many people in the church today are beside themselves to God? The more people there are who are beside themselves in the church, the brighter the future of the church will be. The church surely needs a group of people who are beside themselves.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING BESIDE OURSELVES<br />IN THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>What kind of people were beside themselves to God in the Bible? What were they like? The kind of men who were beside themselves were those who preached the Lord's resurrection from the dead. They were determined to die if need be. Whatever circumstance they faced, whether death, imprisonment, or beating, they were determined to speak about the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Other men may have thought, "If others will not listen, why should we bother to speak? Should we not do something more proper and ordinary?" At that time, the Roman Empire was the greatest empire on earth, and it persecuted the so-called Galileans everywhere. However, the gospel had spread throughout Judea by 30 to 40 A.D., and it spread throughout the whole Roman Empire by 80 A.D. The Romans could not do anything about this group of Galileans. They were not wise. They were country folks, yet the gospel spread throughout the whole of the Roman Empire through these "foolish" ones. Hallelujah! This group of "foolish" ones, who were beside themselves, who did not love themselves, who did not care for themselves, and who were not in themselves, produced the church. The Lord often chooses men who are crazy in the eyes of men. Yet the Lord greatly uses them. In men's eyes, all the great servants of the Lord are crazy. When Paul was led before the rulers and the kings, he was not afraid. He began to speak to them. He had spoken already to the crowd outside. Now he spoke to the men inside. Thank the Lord. It was through such men that the church was started, and through them the church continues until today. But are there such men today? God does not want men who are afraid of many things. He wants men who are beside themselves to Him. Today God is calling for men who will be beside themselves.</p><p>At one time the Roman government was doing all that it could to persecute the Christians. However, the result of this persecution was the multiplication of the church. James was killed, but Christians continued to speak. The church in Jerusalem was persecuted, and the disciples fled for their lives, but they preached the Lord Jesus wherever they went (Acts 8:1-4). How different the situation is today than in those days! Today we do not have any persecution from a Roman empire, yet neither do we have men who are beside themselves for the gospel. Today the church needs men who are beside themselves, like those in the book of Acts. It needs men who are not ashamed, who do not know what shame is, and who only know to risk their lives and their all to preach the Lord.</p><p>We see from the book of Acts that many disciples were beside themselves. Church history also shows us that many faithful followers of the Lord were beside themselves. They were used by the Lord to preach the gospel and save sinners. There has never been a shortage of such men throughout the ages. In North America there was a very brilliant preacher by the name of David Brainerd, who set out to preach the gospel to the Indians at an early age. He risked his life for the gospel. In five years, he traveled more than three thousand miles on horseback for the gospel. He died of exhaustion at the age of thirty, but he left behind countless fruit.</p><p>Henry Martyn wanted to go to India to preach the gospel. Before he left, a doctor examined him and said, "Your health is too poor. If you move to India, you may not adjust to the weather there, and you may not live long." He answered, "In your opinion, how many more years do I have?" The doctor said, "Seven years at the most." When Henry Martyn heard this, he was very happy, and he said, "I have seven more years to accomplish many good works!" In 1806 he set off for India. After preaching in Persia in 1811, he tried to return home via Asia Minor. He died instead in the city of Tokat, Turkey due to sickness in 1812.</p><p>One woman had six sons, five of whom had gone to India for the gospel and died there. When others asked what she would do with her sixth son, she answered that she would also consecrate him for the preaching of the gospel.</p><p>In China God has raised up some men who have risked their all to preach the gospel. We find such men in Foochow, in Chefoo, and in many other places.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 41: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (1) &nbsp; pg 63</div><br></body></html>
