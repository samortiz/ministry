   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE FIFTY-FOUR THE PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ASIA MINOR AND EUROPE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PAUL S COMPANY 20 Scripture Reading: Acts 20:13-38 THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>PURCHASED WITH GOD S OWN BLOOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 20:28 Paul charges the elders of the church in Ephesus to shepherd the church of God, which He obtained through His own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word translated obtained also means acquired or purchased.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we purchase something, we acquire it, or obtain it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God acquired, obtained, the church by purchasing it In order to purchase anything, we need to pay the price for that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What was the price God paid to purchase the church?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Paul s word in 20:28, God obtained the church by paying the price of His own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The phrase His own blood in verse 28 is very unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is quite bothering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Can God have blood?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is God; He is not a man or a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How, then, can God, the Creator, have blood?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some may try to explain this by saying that the blood in 20:28 is the blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But how can Jesus blood be God s blood?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus is God, but 20:28 does not speak of Jesus; this verse speaks of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we consider this, we realize that it is very difficult to explain theologically.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>More than two centuries ago, Charles Wesley wrote a hymn that speaks of God dying for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this hymn Wesley says:</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Amazing love! how can it be</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That thou, my God, shouldst die for me?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this hymn Wesley goes on to say, Tis mystery all!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Immortal dies!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here Wesley declares that God died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I was translating this hymn into Chinese years ago, I was troubled by this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was not sure whether to be so bold as to translate it literally to indicate that God died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do you have the boldness to say that God died for you?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Charles Wesley saw the vision concerning this and declared in his hymn that God died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE GOD-MAN</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The God who died for us is not the God before incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Prior to incarnation, God certainly did not have blood, and He could not have died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was after the incarnation, in which God was mingled with humanity, that He died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Through incarnation, our God, the Creator, the eternal One, Jehovah, became mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, He was no longer only God He became a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the God-man, He surely had blood and was able to die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the God-man died on the cross, He died not only as man but also as God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The One who died on the cross was the One who had been conceived of God and born with God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because He was a God-man, the very element of God was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The divine element was mingled with His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the conception of the Lord Jesus, the God-man, the divine essence out of the Holy Spirit Matt 1:18-20; Luke 1:35 was generated in Mary s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such a conception of the Holy Spirit in the human virgin, accomplished with both the divine and human essences, constituted a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature and produced the God-man, One who is both the complete God and a perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctively, without a third nature being produced.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the most wonderful and excellent Person of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The conception and birth of the Lord Jesus was God s incarnation John 1:14 , constituted of the divine essence added to the human essence, hence, producing the God-man of two natures divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through this, God joined Himself to humanity that He might be manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 and might be the Savior Luke 2:11 who died and shed His blood for us.</S>
