[1]  Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Vol. 1 CONTENTS
[2]  In order for the children of God, especially new believers, to receive a greater supply of the Word, we, by the Lord s grace, wish to present some crucial truths in the Holy Scriptures so that the children of God may receive a foundation in the Word of God.
[3]  Hence, we must use the Bible to show man his condition so that he may realize his need for God s salvation.
[4]  The children of the devil 1 John 3:10, see also v. 8; John 8:44 .
[5]  God s love not only accomplished our salvation but also gave us a way to obtain salvation.
[6]  Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God 1 John 3:1 .
[7]  In addition to causing us to be saved and to escape destruction, God s love imparts the divine life into us so that we may be His children.
[8]  In this chapter we will consider the redemption of Christ.
[9]  The problem within our being is the sinful nature.
[10]  His death solved our problems on the negative side, resulting in our redemption.
[11]  The Lord s resurrection proves that His death satisfied God s righteous requirements.
[12]  After the Lord died and resurrected for us, He ascended for us.
[13]  His death solved our problems, His resurrection enabled us to obtain God s life, and His ascension brought us into a heavenly position.
[14]  Without the Lord s return, we could not enjoy His full redemption.
[15]  Although we were delivered from the punishment and power of sin through the Lord s death and resurrection, we often still sense the presence of sin.
[16]  In this chapter we will consider the work of the Holy Spirit.
[17]  Salvation originated in God s love, was accomplished through Christ s redemption, and is applied through the work of the Holy Spirit.
[18]  The Holy Spirit reveals to man that God s charge to believe in the Lord Jesus is not only a God-given grace but also a commandment to sinners.
[19]  After the Holy Spirit regenerates us, He indwells us.
[20]  When we believe in the Lord Jesus, God not only imparts His life into us through the Holy Spirit, but also gives us His Spirit, putting the Spirit within us.
[21]  As the seal on the believer, the Holy Spirit causes the believer not only to belong to God but also to be like God; He not only designates the believer as belonging to God but also shows that he is like God.
[22]  The Holy Spirit is not only a seal on the believers, proving that we belong to God and are God s inheritance; He is also the pledge, guaranteeing that God s inheritance in the heavens belongs to the believers and is the inheritance of the believers.
[23]  On the one hand, the Lord Jesus told us that the Holy Spirit would be in us John 14:17 , and on the other hand, that He would come upon us Acts 1:8 .
[24]  The work of the Holy Spirit outside the believer is not just to come upon the believer to empower him but also to give him spiritual inspiration and gifts.
[25]  In this chapter we come to the matters of repentance and believing.
[26]  God...to give repentance Acts 5:31; see also 2 Tim 2:25 .
[27]  Then He touches man s feelings and gives him a repentant heart so that he will turn from everything apart from God back to God.
[28]  One day, however, God, by the Holy Spirit, has mercy on them, causing their thinking to turn from sin, the world, and other things back to God.
[29]  God s salvation not only causes us to escape perdition and obtain eternal life, but it also saves us under God s authority, allowing heaven to rule in us and us to be subject to the heavenly reign.
[30]  We have already seen that there is a difference between worldly repentance and the repentance spoken of in the Bible.
[31]  Similarly, man s definition of believing and the Bible s sense of believing differ from each other.
[32]  True repentance is a gift of God; true believing, even more so, is a gift of God.
[33]  Faith that leads to salvation cannot be generated by man; it is given by God.
[34]  God imparts faith into man through the revelation of the Holy Spirit.
[35]  When the Holy Spirit reveals the Lord Jesus and His redemption to man Gal 1:16 , causing him to see and know the Lord Jesus and His redemption, faith is automatically generated in man.
[36]  One who desires to believe in the Lord Jesus must believe in the Scriptures, for the Scriptures testify concerning Him v. 39 . Moreover, the Lord Jesus is the living Word of God 1:1 . The Scriptures are the words written by God 2 Tim 3:16 . The living Word of God, the Lord Jesus, is the reality of the Scriptures, the written Word of God.
[37]  Once a person believes in the Lord Jesus as described above, he immediately obtains the following ten items:
[38]  Once we believe, God forgives all our sins, solving our problems with Him.
[39]  In this chapter we will begin to see the contents of God s salvation.
[40]  The first aspect of God s salvation is forgiveness, which is also the first blessing that a person receives upon believing.
[41]  Since the Lord Jesus died and shed His blood to fulfill God s righteous requirement, God according to His righteousness, can and must forgive us of our sins, blot out our sinful record, and spare us from judgment.
[42]  When God put all our sins on the Lord Jesus, who bore them for us and was judged for us, our record of sin was cancelled before God and our sins were returned to Satan for him to bear.
[43]  Although only God possesses the authority to forgive sins, and although the Lord Jesus was a man, He was God incarnated on the earth.
[44]  Although the blood shed by the Lord Jesus on the cross satisfied all God s righteous requirement upon sinners, and although God can grant sinners the gift of forgiveness because of the Lord s blood, a sinner cannot obtain God s forgiveness without repenting and believing.
[45]  If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins 1 John 1:9; see also Psa 32:5 .
[46]  Since a believer has believed, he needs only to confess, that is, to confess his sins in order for God to forgive Him.
[47]  Our experience tells us that the more we are forgiven by God, the more we fear God; the more we receive God s forgiveness, the more fear we have toward God.
[48]  If we confuse them with one another, we will be perplexed and unable to understand the truth concerning forgiveness in the Bible.
[49]  Once a sinner believes in what Christ s blood has accomplished for him according to what God has said, he receives God s eternal forgiveness in this age, which causes him to be eternally saved, never to perish.
[50]  The fourth kind of forgiveness is the forgiveness in the kingdom, which concerns God s punishment of the believers in the millennium and will be exercised in the coming age.
[51]  In the evening of the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus breathed into the disciples in order for them to receive the Holy Spirit, and then said, Whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven them v. 23 . This shows that the church forgives people s sins; that is, the church decides whether a person s sin has been forgiven by God by the power of the Holy Spirit who indwells the believers the church . The church may not forgive a person s sins according to its own opinion.
[52]  The sixth kind of forgiveness is the personal forgiveness of the believer.
[53]  This is the believer s forgiving of others today and it is related to escaping future punishment in the millennial kingdom.
[54]  In this chapter we will consider the matter of cleansing.
[55]  The Bible reveals that cleansing is a blessing in God s salvation that immediately follows forgiveness.
[56]  When God forgives us, He spares us from the accountability that is related to sin.
[57]  One stage of cleansing occurred when the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption, another takes place when we are saved, and still another occurs after our salvation.
[58]  When the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption, He completed the work of cleansing.
[59]  On the cross the Lord Jesus finished a perfect cleansing on our behalf and placed it before God.
[60]  According to the typology in Leviticus 16, He brought His own blood into the Holy of Holies in the heavenlies and sprinkled it before God Heb 12:22, 24 to make propitiation for our sins so that we might be cleansed and from all...sins...be clean before God Lev 16:30 .
[61]  Once we believe that the Lord died and shed His blood on the cross to make propitiaton for sins, the Lord s blood causes God to forgive us of our sins and to spare us from the punishment of sin; it also washes away our sins and removes the filthiness of sin from us.
[62]  Since the Lord s blood satisfied God and the requirements of His law, washing away our sins so that God and His law no longer condemn us, our conscience, which represents God and His law within us, will not condemn us.
[63]  We are not only filthy in our conduct before God, but our nature is also defiled.
[64]  Our outward behavior is filthy, and our inward nature is defiled.
[65]  Thus, there is not only the aspect of the blood but also the aspect of life in the cleansing that God has prepared for us in His salvation.
[66]  The aspect of the blood stresses the removal of the filthiness in our behavior before God, His law, and our conscience; the aspect of life stresses the removal of defilement in our nature.
[67]  The washing of regeneration means that we obtain God s life and nature in addition to our original life and nature and that God s life and nature deliver us from our own life and nature and, thus, from the filthiness that belongs to our life and nature.
[68]  This means that the Holy Spirit, as the living water in us, cleanses every part of our soul with God s truth and God s life, eliminating all that opposes God, all that rejects God, and all that is not for God, according to God, from God, or of God.
[69]  Many of our ungodly and unrighteous acts against God were committed before men, and many of our sinful, evil, lewd, and filthy deeds were known to those around us.
[70]  Thus, when we believe and are saved, God also, through a particular means, cleanses away the dirtiness of our sin in the eyes of men and before men.
[71]  At the time of our salvation, God first washed away our sins by the Lord s blood so that His life might enter into us to do its work of cleansing to deliver us from the life of the old creation.
[72]  Since we often fail and sin in the process, God still cleanses us moment by moment by the Lord s blood and with His life so that the working of His life in us may not be disrupted.
[73]  From the time we were saved, the Holy Spirit has been moving and operating in us by the Lord s life, causing us to put off all that is of man and not of God and all that is not in agreement with God, until we arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ through the operation of the Lord s life Eph 4:13 .
[74]  Although we are saved and cleansed by God and although we have the Spirit of God and the life of the Lord leading us to live a holy life and walk in a pure pathway, we often fall, fail, sin, and become defiled.
[75]  For this reason God continues to wash us instantly with the Lord s blood.
[76]  The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from every sin 1 John 1:7 .
[77]  From the moment of our salvation until the redemption of our bodies, the Lord s blood cleanses us from our sins continually to restore the cleanness that we obtained when we were saved.
[78]  The Scriptures speak quite clearly concerning the matter of sanctification.
[79]  Christ Jesus, who became...to us from God... sanctification 1 Cor 1:30 .
[80]  Hence, if we touch what God loves and what is in accord with His holy nature, He gives us a comfortable and marvelous inward sensation; but if we contact what God hates and what opposes His holy nature, He causes us to feel grief and pain inwardly.
[81]  This causes us to be different from the world in conduct and appearance until we are full of God s holy nature and completely live out God s holy life to become perfectly holy.
[82]  Positional sanctification is the fact of sanctification that we obtained in Christ when we believed.
[83]  Although we may not have the experience of sanctification, we obtained the fact of sanctification in Christ when we believed; that is, we gained the position of sanctification.
[84]  The experience of sanctification concerns the holy life we live after our salvation.
[85]  Although we obtained the fact and position of sanctification upon believing, the experience of sanctification occurs only after our salvation.
[86]  According to the order in 1 Corinthians 6:11, justification follows sanctification.
[87]  Holiness is God s nature, whereas righteousness is His procedure.
[88]  Sanctification causes us to be according to God s nature, and justification makes us right according to His procedure.
[89]  If we are not according to His nature, we cannot be right according to His procedure.
[90]  Therefore, in the order of God s salvation, we are first sanctified and then justified; we are first made according to His nature and then made right according to His procedure.
[91]  Without the Lord Jesus accomplishing redemption for us on the cross to satisfy God s righteous requirement, God could not justify us by His grace even if He so desired.
[92]  The Bible shows that the second aspect of justification is before men.
[93]  Let us now look at the matter of being reconciled to God.
[94]  This complete change before God is our reconciliation to God.
[95]  He now has reconciled in the body of His flesh through death Col 1:22 .
[96]  Although man has problems with God and needs to be reconciled to Him, he has given no thought to this matter nor could he devise a way to be reconciled.
[97]  But God, who has never had a problem with man and does not need to be reconciled to man, wants man to be reconciled to Him.
[98]  In order for us to be reconciled to Him, God accomplished a way of restoration through the Lord s redemption.
[99]  If the Lord did not accomplish propitiation for our sins, God could not reconcile us to Himself; even if we were to turn to Him, He could not accept us.
[100]  However, the Lord s redemption solved every problem and removed every barrier between us and God so that we might return and be reconciled to Him and He might receive us gladly.
[101]  Through the Lord s shedding of His blood on the cross, God made propitiation for our sins, solved all the problems between us and Him, made peace, and reconciled us to Himself.
[102]  Boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation Rom 5:11 .
[103]  There are at least three results to being reconciled to God.
[104]  Formerly, we took pleasure in drinking, smoking, gambling, movies, or dances, but now that we have been reconciled to God, we boast and joy in God and with God.
[105]  Once we consider how God loved us, how He came and reconciled us to Himself, how He sent the Lord Jesus to accomplish all that was necessary for this reconciliation, how the Lord Jesus died, bled, and was resurrected for us, our heart of love is stirred toward Him.
[106]  Regeneration is a great subject in the Scriptures and a very important part of God s salvation.
[107]  God forgives us, cleanses us, sanctifies us, justifies us, and reconciles us to Himself so that He can regenerate us.
[108]  Man assumes that he would be free from all problems if he only received the forgiveness of sins and was justified before God.
[109]  God s salvation not only grants us an outward position of being accepted by Him but also involves our inward regeneration, through which we receive a life that pleases Him.
[110]  Therefore, even if our life is faultless, we still need to be born anew, to receive the life of God, so that we can understand the things of God s realm and participate in the kingdom of God.
[111]  Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God John 1:13 .
[112]  THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF REGENERATION Through the Finished Redemption of Christ
[113]  As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life John 3:14-15 .
[114]  The bronze serpent was lifted up on a pole to be judged by God in place of the sinning Israelites so that those who were poisoned and should have died would live when they looked on it.
[115]  Similarly, the Lord Jesus was lifted up on the cross to be judged by God in place of us sinners so that we who deserve death would obtain eternal life as soon as we believe into Him.
[116]  When He died, He released the life of God that was hidden in Him into us, giving us His life and making us the many grains.
[117]  By means of the living word of God, He operates in us, regenerating us 1 Pet 1:23 , causing us to receive the life that was released by God through the Lord Jesus death and resurrection.
[118]  We do not need to do anything but believe this in order for the Holy Spirit to enter into us, give us God s life, and cause us to be regenerated, to be born of God.
[119]  Made us alive ; Has the life ; Has eternal life Eph 2:5; 1 John 5:12; John 6:47 .
[120]  The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God Rom 8:15-16 .
[121]  As soon as we are regenerated, the Holy Spirit comes into us and witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God with His life and nature.
[122]  After being saved, whenever we pray, we love to call God Abba, Father.
[123]  Eternal life is a great topic in the Bible; it is the greatest blessing God gives us in His salvation.
[124]  Obtaining eternal life and enjoying the blessings of eternal life are divided into three different periods.
[125]  If we do not differentiate between these three periods in our examination of what the Bible says about eternal life, we will not be clear.
[126]  I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe 1 John 5:13 .
[127]  In Christianity, many think and suggest that those who believe in the Lord cannot know whether or not they have eternal life in the present age.
[128]  However, 1 John 5:13 clearly says that the Word of God, the Bible, enables us to know that we have eternal life.
[129]  We have the eternal life of God to uphold us inwardly, and we have the Lord s and the Father s hands to protect us outwardly.
[130]  The enjoyment of eternal life in eternity in the new heaven and new earth is the full enjoyment of God s salvation, which all the saved ones will share in eternity.
[131]  The water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life John 4:14 .
[132]  When we were sinners, we were under all kinds of bondage.
[133]  The Lord came to save us and to deliver us from bondage so that we might obtain release and freedom.
[134]  The Lord s salvation delivers us not merely from sin and death but also from bondage; it enables us to obtain not only justification and life but also release, freedom.
[135]  Fall under the judgment of God ; Has been condemned already ; The wrath of God abides upon him Rom 3:19; John 3:18, 36 .
[136]  Everyone is a sinner before God; they are waiting for death under God s judgment, condemnation, and wrath.
[137]  God s righteous wrath is waiting to burst forth like thunder because of man s sins before Him.
[138]  He...will save His people from their sins Matt 1:21 .
[139]  We were drowning in sin and could not rescue ourselves; the Lord came to save us from our sins, making us free and happy.
[140]  From the Self, the Flesh, and the Old Man
[141]  In the putting off of the body of the flesh ; You have put off the old man Col 2:11; 3:9 .
[142]  Man s strongest bondage and entanglements come from his flesh and the old man.
[143]  Release to the captives,...and...release those who are oppressed Luke 4:18; cf.
[144]  When we believed and received the Lord s salvation through His Holy Spirit of power and His resurrection life, the Lord delivered us out of the kingdom of darkness, that is, out from under Satan s authority.
[145]  Casting all your anxiety on Him because it matters to Him concerning you 1 Pet 5:7; see also Psa 55:22; Phil 4:6-7; Matt 6:25-34 .
[146]  To Be Obtained in the Future From the Corruption of the Old Creation
[147]  For the anxious watching of the creation...the creation was made subject to vanity...in hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God...We ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly awaiting sonship, the redemption of our body Rom 8:19-23 .
[148]  Although the Lord s salvation released us from slavery, bondage, and troubles and gave us the enjoyment of freedom, there is a form of slavery in us that will remain until the Lord returns and His salvation delivers us fully.
[149]  God s salvation includes all the topics we previously covered, such as forgiveness, cleansing, sanctification, justification, reconciliation, regeneration, eternal life, release, and other such blessings.
[150]  A person who receives these heavenly blessings in Christ is saved.
[151]  However, in the Bible God speaks of at least five kinds of salvation, and if we do not clearly distinguish between these five kinds of salvation, we will be confused about what the Bible says about salvation.
[152]  By grace you have been saved through faith Eph 2:8 .
[153]  Even though God has grace, it is not possible for us to be saved if we do not have faith.
[154]  Although the Lord s grace comes to save us, our faith causes the Lord s grace to come upon us and to be efficacious in us.
[155]  The Lord s salvation saves us from our sins.
[156]  Whoever receives the Lord s salvation does not need to fear God s coming wrath because the Lord on the cross received the punishment of God s wrath in our place and drank the cup of God s wrath for us.
[157]  Restore to me the gladness of Your salvation ; You surround me with the ringing shouts of deliverance Psa 51:12; 32:7; see also Luke 15:24, 32; Acts 8:39; 16:34 .
[158]  This is our living of salvation, which is lived out by our daily relying on the Lord after our salvation.
[159]  The third kind of salvation spoken of in the Bible is environmental salvation.
[160]  This is the salvation God gives us today in our troubling environment.
[161]  Who has delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us; in whom we have hoped that He will also yet deliver us 2 Cor 1:10, see also vv.
[162]  The Bible also speaks of the salvation of our soul.
[163]  People usually divide man into two parts, the soul and the body, but in the Bible, God tells us that man has three parts, spirit and soul and body 1 Thes 5:23 .
[164]  If we are willing to sacrifice our soul s enjoyment for the Lord s sake in this age, even to the extent of losing our soul-life, we will find our soul-life in the future; that is, we will obtain a reward when the Lord returns, and our soul will enjoy the joy of the millennial kingdom with the Lord.
[165]  The assurance of salvation means that we can be assured of our salvation.
[166]  Assurance is not merely a matter of knowing but also a matter of being certain.
[167]  Many think that salvation is something in the future, so they think that there is no way for them to know whether they are saved now.
[168]  But in His Word, the Bible, God clearly tells us that salvation is a matter for the present; moreover, He assuredly tells us that we can know that we are saved.
[169]  Once we believe, we are saved, and at the same time, we can know that we are saved.
[170]  God, through the apostle John, not only tells us that we have passed out of death into life the moment we believe John 5:24 , but He also assuredly tells us that we can know that we have passed out of death into life.
[171]  For this purpose, God did a work of life in our spirit and is using His life to cultivate us so that He can use this life in us to swallow up our outward body and completely redeem us by His life from our inward spirit to our outward body in the future.
[172]  Thus, by the testimony of the Holy Spirit within and by the feeling we have from the Holy Spirit s testimony, we can know that we have the life of God and are saved.
[173]  We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers 1 John 3:14 .
[174]  God is love, and since we have received His life, we surely have His heart of love.
[175]  Moreover, because we were begotten of Him, we love all those born of Him 5:1 .
[176]  Faith in the Lord gives us life and causes us to pass out of death into life, but our love for the brothers lets us know that we have life and that we have passed out of death into life.
[177]  The apostle said that we are determined to be well pleasing to the Lord because we know that we will obtain a building from God, eternal, in the heavens, that is, because we know that we are saved and will see the Lord in the heavens and enjoy His presence.
[178]  In Christianity today, people have many different views on salvation.
[179]  Some think that it is impossible to know that we are saved; others think that we can still perish after we are saved.
[180]  Not that we have loved God but that He loved us 1 John 4:10 .
[181]  If our salvation was because of our love for God, it would not be reliable because our love easily changes.
[182]  God saved us not only because of His love, by His grace, and according to His righteousness but also through His covenant.
[183]  Through the blood shed by the Lord Jesus, God made a covenant with us to save us Matt 26:28 .
[184]  God s life, which is the eternal life, entered into us and brought us into an eternal relationship with God, a relationship of life that we can never break.
