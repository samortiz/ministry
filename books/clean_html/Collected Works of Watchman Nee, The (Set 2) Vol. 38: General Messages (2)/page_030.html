<h2 class="head1">OFFENDING GOD'S TESTIMONY<br />BRINGING IN HIS DISCIPLINE</h2><p>God often disciplines His children for the purpose of vindicating Himself. God wants to let men, as well as the devil, know that He has no part in a certain matter, that it is something done by man himself. If man cannot maintain God's testimony, He has to step forward to maintain it. God will maintain His testimony, even if man cannot; He will maintain it by Himself. If a man does not maintain God's testimony, he will suffer God's discipline. There are many kinds of sins. Some sins are related to ourselves alone; God pays less attention to them. But if anything that is related to God offends Him, He will step forward and immediately discipline us. He has to immediately declare that He has nothing to do with the matter. Therefore, we have to be very careful before the Lord. It is wrong to commit any sin in general, but in particular, we should not commit the sin of offending the testimony. In general we have to ask God in fear and trembling to keep us from sin. In particular we have to ask Him to keep us from the sin of offending the testimony. We have to learn to know God and learn to not offend Him. Whenever God declares Himself as God, He will not compromise nor implicate Himself with man. Man can fail, but he can never offend God's testimony. We can look at the stories of many men in the Old Testament, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and David. They were chosen by God, and God delighted in them. Their histories also show failures and shortcomings. Yet God judged them only briefly, and then He dropped the matter. Have you ever wondered why God behaved in this way? This was because the wrong things they committed did not offend God's testimony. Whenever God's testimony is offended, the consequence is grave and terrible. This is not a distinction between the Old Testament and the New Testament. This is a distinction between offending the testimony and honoring the testimony. It is a tremendous thing, a terrible thing, to offend God's testimony; God will not allow us to get by. We must learn to fear God in this matter.</p><p>Hebrews 12:10 says, "For they disciplined for a few days as it seemed good to them; but He, for what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness." God disciplines us for our profit, which is our participation in His holiness. God wants us to partake of His holiness. Whenever God disciplines, He disciplines for the purpose of vindicating Himself.</p><p>Have you ever realized that Satan's mouth is stopped whenever God disciplines us? Once God disciplines us, Satan has nothing more to say; he cannot accuse us any longer. The discipline from God is for the purpose of maintaining Himself; it maintains His own holiness. As a consequence, the enemy sees that God has no part in a certain matter. When you are under discipline, the first thing you should pray for is God's vindication, not your deliverance from the discipline. Whenever you are disciplined, you have to tell the brothers and sisters that you were disciplined because you offended God in a certain matter. It may be a simple word, but it will testify to the fact that God has no share in the matter. Some brothers and sisters have clearly done something wrong and experienced God's discipline, yet they continue to cry because the discipline is too severe and because they are in trouble. Yet they should not cry about this. God's discipline is for the purpose of absolving Himself in a matter; it is for the purpose of vindicating His name. His name is upon you, and if you are not careful, you will implicate Him. Therefore, He has to vindicate Himself. When you are disciplined, you should bow down and worship the Lord, saying, "I will gladly accept this discipline. I will gladly stand in this position. I will gladly let the devil, the church, and the world know that God has no share in this matter and that the wrong is all on my part." The more you submit to His disciplining hand and the more you vindicate God, the easier it will be for you to go through the discipline. But the more you try to run from the discipline and the more you struggle, the more you will not get away.</p><p>This matter has a great deal to do with God's way. We have to learn to know God in this matter. This will deliver us from many cumbersome things. At the same time, we must allow God to be glorified through our failures. If we do well and glorify God, we should thank God's grace for it. If we do not do well, we should still glorify God in the things which He uses to vindicate Himself. May the blood cover us in saying these words and may the blood cover all those who read these words. This is a sober matter, and we should pay much attention to it.</p>
