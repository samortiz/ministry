Although the book has not been reviewed by the speaker, it is being published at this time to meet the present need
We worship God that we could have this conference to concentrate our attention on this one topic-the building of the church
We will cover many verses from the Scriptures, all of which are very important and which you must read carefully and attentively
In Revelation when the apostle John saw the vision of Babylon, the corrupted city, he was in the wilderness, a place of desolation
He needed to be brought to a mountain, a high place, a transcendent realm, that he might have a sufficiently far-reaching and great view
We must realize that the visions in the book of Revelation were revealed by God to a deeply and highly experienced person-the apostle John
When John saw the visions on the island of Patmos, all the other apostles had already died, and he was the only one left
God had to carry him away from the plain and even away from himself onto the top of a high mountain for him to see the vision
In between these two sections is another section from Genesis 3 through Revelation 20, which is the main body of the Bible
To summarize it briefly, this section simply deals with matters on the positive side and matters on the negative side
When this serpent came, he injected his poison into the man whom God had created in His own image and for His own glory
When John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus were on the earth, they called those who followed Satan 'offspring of vipers'
In the Old Testament, the children of Israel, one time while journeying through the wilderness, did something that offended God
If you read the newspaper, you will see that not one day goes by without an occurrence of robbery, adultery, fornication, theft, or murder
The serpent entered in Genesis 3, and it is not until Revelation 20 that he will be cast into the eternal lake of fire
Thanks be to God that on the earth we have not only night but also day and not only the negative side but also the positive side
Since that time, a war has been going on among mankind on the earth-the war between the serpent and the Son of God
From then on, there is no direct mention of the tree of life until the end of Revelation, where the tree of life appears again
In one section it is referred to in the way of a beginning, and in the other section it is referred to in the way of a conclusion
The beginning and the end of the Bible clearly mention the same topics with the same items as their content and center
All these corresponding items show us what God intends to have, what He wants to do in the universe, and what His focus and goal are
Now we want to see what the vision revealed in these two sections is and what the important points of the vision are, point by point
The Bible uses only two chapters to describe in a general way how God created the heavens, the earth, and all the things in the universe
It goes on to say that the Spirit of God came to brood upon the surface of the waters and that following this the light came
From our experience we know that the brooding of the Spirit of God is for life and that the illuminating of light is also for life
The first kind of life that was generated was the lowest form of life-the plant life, which is without consciousness or feeling
After we are saved, the one thing God wants to do in every one of us is to cause each one of us to be conformed to the image of His Son
God in Christ comes into us as the mold to conform us to His very form so that we may be His living image to express Him
We thank God that because we have believed in Christ, received Christ, and been joined to Christ, His authority has become our authority
On the day when Christ comes back to the earth to be King, the overcoming saints will be co-kings with Him to reign together with Him
Rather, God wanted the many Adams to become a great Adam collectively to be His one complete image and His one corporate representative
God's desire in Genesis 2 was that the descendants of Adam who were in Adam would all be the one unique image of God
Rather, in our assembling together we are built together and coordinated together to become a great person as God's one complete image
In the beginning God collected millions and millions of Adam's descendants and put them all in Adam to make them a great Adam as God's image
If we read the Bible to the end, we will realize that this tree of life is God Himself, because God Himself is life
It is not difficult to understand that the food we eat every day enters into us and becomes our nourishment and our constituents
Because we all have a certain amount of spiritual experience it should not be difficult for us to understand what is implied in this picture
Sometimes we may meet a very uncultured brother who may not have much education, may speak in an unclear way, and may do things awkwardly
We have nothing to boast about in ourselves as earthen vessels, but we should always praise God for the gold within
The oyster then secretes a kind of life juice to cover the grain of sand, and after a long time, this grain of sand becomes a pearl
Once we receive God as our gold, His life and our life mingle together, causing us to be transformed into pearl
Sometimes they are like an intense fire burning him, and sometimes they are like heavy weights pressing down on him
We also should allow Him to flow in us so that more and more we would have the element of gold in us and be transformed into pearl
Such an entity will be a city, a house, and a Body built by God, and it will also be His glorious, loving counterpart
We have clearly said that the first two chapters of the Bible describe a picture and that the last two chapters also describe a picture
Rather, He wants all those who have been saved by grace to gather together so that they would all become one man
We who have Christ neither bear Christ's image nor exercise Christ's authority in a scattered, independent, or individual way
Rather, we all have become members that have been aggregated together into one Body bearing Christ's image and exercising Christ's authority
God Himself dwells in this mystical man, and all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily in this mystical man
The reason man surpasses all the other creatures and is the highest among the creatures is because man has this excellent spirit within him
The reason God created this excellent spirit for man was so that man would have a spirit to contact and receive God who is Spirit
In the same manner, as human beings of visible substance, we are like earthen boxes, but within us there is a precious and excellent spirit
Once a person receives the Lord as bread, then God who is within the Lord enters into him and becomes his life
Peter said that we are 'partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust'
Corinthians 3 says that we 'are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit'
Because the Holy Spirit is doing a work of transformation in us, we are being transformed into pearls of great value and precious stones
Recall that John the Baptist testified that the Lord Jesus, while He was on the earth, was the Bridegroom, the One who had the bride
The vision set forth at the beginning of the Bible is like a blueprint at the beginning of a building instruction manual
Christ will win a complete victory, having dealt with the serpent, sin, death, and all that is in enmity with God
In the city the twelve gates are the twelve tribes of the children of Israel and the twelve foundations are the twelve apostles of the Lamb
These two groups include all the redeemed and saved persons among the Jews and the Gentiles in both the Old Testament and the New Testament
When we read this portion, we have to read it as if we were looking at a picture, and we must try our best to understand its meaning
Indeed, Christ is the universal Bridegroom, and all the redeemed people of God are collectively the universal bride
In the first two chapters of Genesis we see that a part of Adam was taken out to become Adam's counterpart, who was Eve
In Ephesians 5 the apostle Paul tells us that this picture typifies the relationship between Christ and the church
The river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God, and the tree of life grows on both sides of the river
The meaning of this picture is that within this corporate man there must be the reigning of God; that is, God must be on the throne
In this age when you go and look at the societies among the human race, it is difficult to find one that is not in confusion
In the same way, whenever someone comes into a church that has been built up, he cannot but bow his head and worship, saying, 'God is here
In the first two messages we briefly looked at the revelation at the beginning and at the end of the Scriptures
We pointed out that both at the beginning and at the end of the Bible, the central revelation is the mystical building
In other words, God's intention as revealed in the Scriptures is to build a dwelling place for Himself and a Body for His Son, Christ
Beginning from this message, we will look at the long, middle section of the Bible from Genesis 3 to Revelation 20
The difference is that the tabernacle was God's movable dwelling place, and the temple was God's fixed dwelling place
Not only so, in the original language of the Old Testament, both the tabernacle and the temple were called the house of God
From that day on, God had a dwelling place or habitation on the earth, and He dwelt among the children of Israel
The book of Numbers clearly tells us that the journey of the children of Israel in the wilderness was centered on the tabernacle
It has four sideseast west north and southand on each side are three gates on which the names of the twelve tribes of Israel are inscribed
Do not think that the situation of the New Jerusalem will be brought in only at the time of the new heaven and new earth
A rough model of this situation was already in existence when the tabernacle was raised up at the foot of Mount Sinai
When they encamped, they raised up the tabernacle, and the twelve tribes offered sacrifices and worshipped around the tabernacle
The warfare reveals that God wanted to have a piece of land upon which He could securely set up His dwelling place on the earth
After the children of Israel crossed the Jordan, they conquered city after city and occupied place after place
Originally, God dwelt in the heavens, but when He was born in Bethlehem, He came to put on flesh and to be among men
His incarnation was His tabernacling among men, and His body was the tabernacle that God had raised up among men
The Jews, who were utilized by the devil, hated the Lord Jesus and crucified Him, thus destroying Him as the temple
As a result, in His resurrection many people were built together to become the enlarged temple, which is the church
In Exodus, when the children of Israel were building the tabernacle in the wilderness, the principal material they used was gold
The garment worn by the high priest had a breastplate and shoulder pieces, which had precious stones enclosed in settings of gold
Paul went on to say that they should not build with wood, grass, and stubble but with gold, silver, and precious stones
At this point we should be even more clear that gold and precious stones are altogether materials for building God's dwelling place
The entire Bible shows how we human beings who are made of clay have received God as our life and are thereby being transformed within
In the Old Testament we see that God chose some of the forefathers such as Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
As Jacob went out from Beer-sheba toward Haran, he came to a certain place and spent the night there because the sun had set
In this dream there was a ladder set up on the earth, its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it
Jehovah was standing above it, and He spoke to him, promising to give him and his descendants the land on which he lay
He rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head, and he set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it
Most readers of the Bible know that oil in the holy Scriptures denotes the Holy Spirit who is God coming forth to reach and enter into man
When Peter confessed to the Lord Jesus, 'You are the Christ,' the Lord immediately said to him, 'You are Peter '
The pouring of the oil upon the stone indicates the mingling together of God and the saved ones, and this mingling becomes the house of God
In Genesis 2 we see that the flow of the water of life produces gold, bdellium, and precious stones as materials for the building
At this point, the vision of building is clear enough-God uses the way of pouring the oil upon the stone to build His house on the earth
Jacob stayed in his uncle Laban's home for twenty years and then returned from Paddan-aram and dwelt in Shechem
God was calling Jacob to go back to the place where God had appeared to him when he was fleeing from his brother
When the Israelites came to the foot of Mount Sinai, God wanted them to build a tabernacle to be His dwelling place on earth
God had a group of people on the earth who were coordinated, knit, and built together to be the dwelling place of God
Satan knew that what God ultimately wanted was a builded city, so before God could do that, Satan did something to produce a counterfeit
God saved Noah and his household from that destruction, and Noah's building of the ark was again a story of building
Not long afterward, Satan came again to corrupt the descendants of Noah, and he instigated them to build Babel
They wanted to build a city and a tower with its top reaching heaven so that they might make a name for themselves
The people utilized by Satan were building something, and Abraham, who had been called out by God, was also building something
On the other hand, Lot, Abraham's companion, went down to another city, the third corrupt city recorded in the Bible
One day, however, God delivered the Israelites out of Egypt so that they no longer had to bake clay into bricks to build cities for Pharaoh
Ezra said that on the first day of the first month of the year he began to go up from Babylon to return to Jerusalem
Satan wants to utilize man to build the great Babylon, while God wants to gain a group of people to build the New Jerusalem
On the perimeter of the tabernacle were the hangings, which were like an enclosing wall, and within these hangings was the outer court
The innermost item was the Ark, which was also called the Ark of the Testimony because it contained the two tablets of the testimony
Outside the Ark on the north side of the tent was the showbread table upon which the bread was continually set
These four items and all the boards inside the tabernacle were either overlaid with gold or were completely made of pure gold
The record of the tabernacle in Exodus first mentions the altar and the laver and then speaks about the hangings of the outer court
The spiritual meaning of this is that in God's building there is first the altar, and then from the altar the hangings are produced
In the same principle the four pieces of furniture within the tent are mentioned first and then out of these four items the tent is produced
Since man has been damaged by Satan and has the poison of sin, sin must first be dealt with in order for man to draw near to God
Everyone who has been redeemed by God must ultimately be put on the altar and offered to God as a burnt offering
Our living must be judged, our clothing must be judged, our family must be judged, and our career must be judged
The first sentence that the church of God must tell someone who comes to listen to the gospel is, 'Dear friend, you are a sinner'!
All those who have not passed through this kind of judgment and have not been judged at the bronze altar cannot be redeemed
All those who have been redeemed are required by God to consecrate themselves to be offered as burnt offerings
If we want to be built by God into His dwelling place, then all we are, all we have, and all we can do must be judged before God
If we receive His all-inclusive death, we will not only pass through the judgment, but we will also be redeemed
The altar was covered with the bronze plates beaten out of the censers carried by the two hundred fifty rebels who were judged by fire
The laver, however, was made of the bronze from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance of the tabernacle
We all know that the hangings formed the boundary of the outer court, which may also be considered the boundary of God's building
Spiritually speaking, the experience of the bronze sockets is produced through the experience of the bronze altar
If we want to be built in the church, then we and all that we have must sooner or later pass through God's judgment
It is only after such a judging that we have the foundation for the building, the bronze sockets of the hangings of the court
No doubt these items denote redemption, because the people of Israel gave this silver for the redemption of their lives
A person who has passed through the cross and the washing and renewing of the Holy Spirit has the white linen hangings upon him
Because his conduct is pure and white before man and God, a boundary or separating line has been established in his living
We cannot merely be good Christians, well-behaved Christians, cleansed Christians, or faultless Christians in an outward way
We have already said that when you entered the tabernacle, that is, the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, everything you saw was of gold
The law that was written on the tablets was on the one hand a covenant and on the other hand a testimony, the testimony of God
We need to see that the Ten Commandments are not only the laws of God and the demands of God but also the explanation and revelation of God
The laws and commandments declare to us Gods nature intention procedures and ways so that we may know what kind of God He is in the universe
The ark made of wood overlaid with gold typifies the Lord Jesus as the One with two natures-the divine nature and the human nature
The spiritual meaning of the Ten Commandments being placed in the Ark of the Testimony is that the entire explanation of God is in Christ
In the New Jerusalem, Christ is the lamp and God is the light, and God as the light shines through Christ as the lamp
The fact that the showbread table was also made of wood overlaid with gold spiritually means that it comes out from the Ark of the Testimony
The Christ with two natures, divinity and humanity, is the heavenly bread given by God to us that we can live by Him in the presence of God
In the morning if you do not eat the Lord to the full and once again enjoy the Lord, then you will not only be empty but also dark within
Today God in Christ dwells in us as our life, and our experiences as Christians altogether hinge on how we deal with this Christ
At such a time the sense of sweetness between God and us and the fragrance in the presence of God are truly indescribable
These experiences are indications that we have experienced the Ark, the showbread table, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar
If you have the fine white linen hangings without and are full of the pure gold within, your situation is truly quite good
In other words, they are saying that it is enough merely to have the pure gold, so why do we need to talk about building?
May God have mercy upon us, and may He open our eyes to see that there is the need for building after receiving the pure gold
There were twenty on the south side, twenty on the north, and eight on the west, and all of them were made of wood overlaid with gold
Just as the Ark was made of wood overlaid with gold, so the tabernacle was also constructed with wood overlaid with gold
Please remember that you are a board and that in you there is the life of God and the mingling of divinity and humanity
Every saved person is a board, and when all the saved ones are connected and coordinated together, they become the tabernacle
In many instances, the basic numbers of God's building were the numbers three and five or multiples of these numbers
Another example is the ark, which was two and a half cubits in length and one and a half cubits in width and in height
The problem is that some brothers and sisters think that they are three cubits by themselves and do not need others to match them
On the day of Pentecost when Peter stood up to speak, the Bible says, 'Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth'
When Paul wrote his first Epistle to the Corinthians, he began by saying, 'Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus
Our concept is that it would be more convenient to have one tenon set against one socket, but God's thought is not like this
The day before yesterday their condition was excellent, and yesterday it was also good, but today their condition is very poor
The fact that each board was one and a half cubits in width indicates that we need to be connected with others
The fact that each board had two tenons fixed in two corresponding sockets indicates that we need others' confirmation
If in our living and work we constantly have the confirmation of the brothers and sisters, then we will surely be well-protected
Lastly, on the boards overlaid with gold were rings of gold, and through these rings were bars overlaid with gold
Since they had been overlaid with gold and joined together in gold and through gold, they became a solid entity, a builded structure
We have briefly seen the spiritual meaning of the tabernacle in the Old Testament in regard to the matter of building
Now in the second step He is gaining the church to be a vessel for His Son, Christ, that Christ may put Himself into the church
The Ark was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold, and the main part of the tabernacle was also made of acacia wood overlaid with gold
It is at this juncture that we see that a Christian must not only care for his outward living and walk but also for the divine life within
The day the glory of God filled the tabernacle was truly a great moment, because God had gained a dwelling place on the earth
We would have to believe that wherever there was such a group of people, God Himself would be expressed and glorified among them!
After the tabernacle was raised up, the glory of God filled the tabernacle, and from then on, God spoke to Moses in the tabernacle
Everything in the lives of the children of Israel was centered on the tabernacle, and the tabernacle was centered on the Ark
It is a pity that this situation was maintained for only a short time before the Israelites became degraded and fell into desolation
As recorded in the book of 1 Samuel, the people of Israel fought with their enemy and were defeated, and the Ark of God was captured
God protected the Ark by His divine power, and as a result, the Philistines returned the Ark, sending it into the midst of the people of God
Rather, you see Christ mainly in the homes of the individual believers and in the individual believers themselves
As a man according to God's heart, David had a desire to build a temple for God so that God might have a resting place on the earth
The first one was the original tent, which first had been kept in Shiloh and then later had been moved to Gibeon
Because he was a man of war, and there was still no peace in the land, God did not let him accomplish this matter
At Gibeon during the night, God visited Solomon and appeared to him in a dream, asking him what he desired to have
In other words, to have the church without Christ is improper, and to have Christ without the church is also abnormal
The light of the truths in the Scriptures always shines brighter and brighter as one proceeds through the Scriptures
The tabernacle was ten cubits wide and thirty cubits long, and the temple was twenty cubits wide and sixty cubits long
The tabernacle was ten cubits high, and the temple was thirty cubits high-three times higher than the tabernacle
When you looked upward from within the four sides of the tabernacle, what you saw was beautiful, but downward it was not good to look at
If we look back at the past thirty or forty years, we will see that the way that God took among us was also like this
Thirty years ago, our knowledge of the church somewhat had the flavor of Abraham's life of pitching tents and building altars
Just as the Ark and the major parts inside the tabernacle were made of wood overlaid with gold, so it was with the interior of the temple
Like the Chinese, the ancient Jewish people had the custom of planting cypress trees in the ground above their graves
The doors of the temple were made of cypress wood, signifying that the death of the Lord Jesus is the great entrance into the church
From a spiritual perspective, cedar wood signifies the resurrected Christ and those who have been resurrected in Christ
The doors of olive wood with the carvings of cherubim signify the Holy Spirit as the entrance to spiritual matters
The first matter is that He died, the second matter is that He resurrected, and the third matter is that He became the Spirit
All those who want to be built together in the church must first be those who have died with Christ; that is, they must be cypress
In the temple there were not only different kinds of wood but also stones, precious stones, and other materials
When Peter confessed to Jesus, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,' the Lord told him right away, 'Simon Barjona
Later on in his first Epistle, Peter tells us that we, the saved ones, coming to the Lord, are living stones being built up together
In the tabernacle there had been only one showbread table and one laver, but in the temple there were ten showbread tables and ten lavers
Our experience of the cross the Holy Spirit and Christ as our life light acceptance and sweetness should be renewed deepened and enlarged
The preaching of the gospel must be with greater impact so that when people come in, they would be strongly convicted and saved
At the same time, the believers' consecration to God must also be increased so that there is truly a large altar
In other words, the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit and the washing by the Holy Spirit must be more intense, frequent, and renewing
In the same way, the showbread table and the golden lampstand, which signify Christ as our life supply and light, must also be enlarged
In other words, Christ is the center of the church, and He is also the center of all of the saints' spiritual experiences
After reading these messages, we should be able to clearly see that the problem in the universe today is not with Christ but with the church
In other words, the tabernacle, which was in coordination with the Ark, was always in one of four different situations
The second situation, which is the reverse of the first, is the situation in which the Ark was without the tabernacle
The third situation is the one in which the Ark and the tabernacle were both present, but the condition of the tabernacle was improper
The original tent had been built by Moses according to the heavenly pattern that God had revealed to him on Mount Sinai
Only that tent was according to God's heart because it had been built according to God's measurements and was therefore what God wanted
Should he establish only one church in this city according to God's desire, or should he establish more than one church?
Feeling that he has no way to work with Peter in Jerusalem Paul begins to preach the gospel by himself and as a result many people are saved
The gospels that Peter and Paul preach are the same, and the spiritual messages that they give are also similarly accurate
The divisive meeting that Paul established might have had the 'Ark,' but the 'tabernacle' would not have been right
He went on, saying, 'You pay attention to the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, and they also pay attention to this'!
It was all right as long as the believers pursued being outwardly filled with the Holy Spirit and paid attention to being spiritual'
In terms of the type of the tabernacle, what he was actually saying was, 'It is all right as long as we have the Ark
Why is it that today in Taipei there is a church on almost every street and sometimes even several churches on one street?
Although Christianity today is in a state of confusion, most Christians have not gone so far as to say that they do not want the church
According to his good intention, he built a tent for God, knowing in his heart that this was only temporary and not permanent
God told him that a son would be born to him and that his son would be a man of rest, and it was he who would build a house for God
In this situation, there is not only Christ who is so rich but also the church that is proper, strengthened, enlarged, and stabilized
If a city has only one church, then no matter how big the church is, it cannot shine brightly enough to cover the entire city
On the surface, the church is being divided, but because of this division, God can have many small lampstands in a city
The problems that we encounter today are not concerning spiritual matters but concerning the matter of the church
God's desire is to make all the vessels in the church very balanced, with the proper sizes and the fitting weights
If he sees a brother studying the Bible, underlining verses and taking notes, he tells him, 'Oh, these are all dead letters
When he sees the saints cleaning the chairs in the meeting hall, he tells them, 'Oh, do not waste your precious time cleaning the chairs
In another example, suppose a brother has learned some lessons about obeying the inward feeling and the anointing
You can ask him how he is doing in his ushering and then ask him how he has been doing in his Bible reading in recent days
If the gifts are relatively small, the fighting is not so serious, but if the gifts are bigger, the fighting is more intense
Just as Solomon accomplished the building of the temple, Christ in His resurrection will build the church until His return
The reason why the record of the Bible does not tell us this is to indicate that the church may be destroyed, but Christ cannot be destroyed
The record of the Bible clearly shows us that while the enemy was trying to destroy the temple God was focused on the recovery of the temple
Ever since that time, God's desire has been that we thoroughly come out of Babylon to recover the building of the church
The dwelling place that He wants to obtain on the earth has been misunderstood by men as well as destroyed by the enemy
Like David, we should always consider God's heart's desire and regard as important what He regards as important
Only in this way can God's heart be fully satisfied, and only in this way can God be glorified in the church and in Christ
May the Lord bless us that we may treasure Him and likewise treasure His chosen and builded vessel, the church
In this message we want to continue to see the vision concerning the building of the church in the New Testament
Later, the disciples remembered that the Scriptures said that the Lord Jesus would be devoured by the zeal of God's house
What He meant was that one day the Jews would nail His body on the cross but that on the third day He would be resurrected
Both Paul and Peter tell us clearly in their Epistles that the church is the temple of God and the house built by God
In this message we will try to look briefly at the vision of the building of the church in the entire New Testament
If we read it with spiritual insight, the more we read it, the more we will discover that the Bible's line of thought is very meaningful
Now we want to consider the first four books of the New Testament-the Gospels-from the perspective of the types in the Old Testament
We all know that the four Gospels begin by telling us that the Lord Jesus who came to be our Savior was called Emmanuel
He was the same as any ordinary man-He ate when He was hungry, He drank when He was thirsty, and He slept when He was tired
His countenance was no different from others, except that His visage and form were more marred than that of any man
He was like a root out of dry ground and did not have an attracting form or beautiful appearance that people would desire Him
One day when the Lord went into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, 'Who do men say that the Son of Man is'?
In Acts 1, however, there were at least one hundred and twenty Galileans, including Peter, James, and John, who were wood overlaid with gold
These standing boards were united by the golden rings and golden bars and became the tabernacle, which is the church
The beginning of Romans shows us that a person who does not know God and who rejects God commits all kinds of sins
Chapter two tells us that such a person, after being put under the law and living under his conscience, still commits sins
Chapter three shows us that this man, who is under God's condemnation, eventually is justified by believing in the Lord Jesus
Those who are the components of the church may still be under the control of the flesh and the influence of the world
Not only so, in the church in Corinth there were also the problems of fornication and of things sacrificed to idols
If this happened, then all of us would have to give way to him and let him go everywhere to lay his hands on people to heal them!
After you have received the cross, then you will know whether or not you should speak and to what extent you should speak'
Corinthians says that when spiritual gifts fall into the possession of fleshly believers, such believers may become a trouble to the church
Although his gift may seem to benefit the church somewhat in the beginning, in the end it will damage the building of the church
Strictly speaking, the real building up of the church depends not so much on the gifted persons but on ministers like Paul
Those in the church who still try to live before God by depending on their works are a big problem to the building of the church
In relation to Christ, the church is the Body of Christ, and in relation to God, the church is the dwelling place of God
Following Ephesians, Philippians shows us the practical living of those who are being built together in the church
There is still another aspect of the church revealed in the Bible, and that aspect is the practice of the church
The three books of 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus are needed to deal particularly with the practice of the church
It is a matter of loving not only those who are your equal but also those who are not on an equal standing with you
One day Onesimus was saved in a prison through Paul, and when he was released, Paul wrote this letter for him to bring to Philemon
If today's church lacks this kind of love, then there will be a great problem when we talk about the practical church
Since Christ has already nullified Judaism, those who are in the church of Christ must not remain in the Jewish religion
And Second Peter speak about God's discipline and dealing in the church, or in other words, God's governmental administration
The children of God must live and walk according to the rules and regulations of the divine government in the universe
Everyone who has not been regenerated and saved, who has not pursued spiritual growth, and who is against God's building will be judged
Recall that in the beginning we mentioned the two lines of building-the line of God's building and the line of Satan's building
Although we still have the factors of division in our flesh, all the divisive factors will be nullified if we receive Christ and the cross
In this way the church experiences the real building up to be the Body of Christ and the dwelling place of God
Only such a church knows the resurrection power of Christ and is being conformed to the image of Christ in His death by such a power
The church that appears in each locality is a lampstand, a small model of the New Jerusalem, through which Christ shines forth
One day the Jews killed and tore down the body of the Lord Jesus, but on the third day His body was resurrected
His resurrected body denotes not only Himself alone but also the thousands and thousands of people whom He regenerated in His resurrection
Corporately, they are the church, which is the enlarged Body of the Lord, the tabernacle and the temple where God dwells
If they are handling lumber, they must do some sawing and planing so that the lumber will fit the required measurements
After the materials have been properly worked on, then they can be put together according to the blueprint and be built into a house
Just as a builder buys the building materials, so God has bought and redeemed us with the blood of His Son to be materials for His building
Some may begin to doubt and ask, 'When we heard the gospel, we were told that after we were saved, we would have peace
Soon afterward, however, they again experience trouble in their lives and changes in their circumstances, and their faith gradually wavers
Today technology has advanced to such an extent that diamonds can be artificially produced through intense heat and great pressure
In the same manner, we who are common materials like lumps of clay need to be transformed if we want to be built together in the church
For some unknown reason, it seemed that after a while an invisible hand mysteriously came upon us, bringing sufferings
Sometimes the sufferings are so heavy that it seems that we can no longer bear them, and we may even ask for death
They do not notice that verse 20 goes on to say, 'Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets'
Our hymnal contains hymns that were selected from over ten thousand hymns and may be considered a collection of the best Christian hymns
We cannot find a hymn in our hymnal that contains the word building, much less find a hymn whose topic is the building
All of God's children need to see how much this matter of the building of the church is neglected among the children of God
We should not despise this aspect of God's work, nor should we depreciate the desire of God's children for this matter
We are not only saved are not only spiritual and are not only loving the Lord but we are also being built together to be the glorious church
Is there anything else in the universe that is more blessed or pleasing to God and more satisfying to God's heart's desire?
Every piece of wood in a house is connected to other pieces of wood that are above it, below it, on its left, and on its right
Whenever they came together, they would whisper with each other as if they had some secrets that could not be told to others
When someone says, 'I cannot be joined to others,' then we should be clear that this one has problems with the building
In the building of the church, the brothers and sisters should be able to be separated from others as well as joined to others
When they need to be joined, they should be able to be joined, and when they need to be separated, they should be able to be separated
We must use the building as a yardstick to test whether the spiritual condition of the brothers and sisters is proper or not
The more these ones pray, the more they sense the presence of the Lord, and the more they enter into fellowship with the Lord
When Moses went to meet God at Mount Sinai, his first step was to take Aaron with him and to leave the people of Israel behind
Similarly, Moses was on the mountain for only forty days at the most, while most of the time he was being mingled with the people of Israel
These brothers who think that they are following the pattern of prayer set by the Lord Jesus and Moses have never mingled with Gods children
If you pray to such an extent that you become independent and cannot pray with others, then you must immediately be balanced by the building
When we want to fully enjoy Christ taste the riches of the Lords love and feel the rich presence of the Lord then we must come to the church
In another example, suppose the responsible brothers and sisters in a home meeting are in coordination and in one accord
The reason that they have God's blessing and presence is because they are willing to be balanced by the building
Only such a builded church can be the tabernacle and dwelling place of God for God and man to have rest together
Gods eternal intention is to build for Himself a glorious dwelling place a glorious church among His saved ones through the life of His Son
All the work that God is doing upon us who have been saved is for us to be built together to become a spiritual house in which He can live
They rose up as one man and coordinated together, each one doing his part to build the tabernacle of God in one accord
Later, when the Israelites built the temple, their response to God's desire was even stronger and more glorious
He said to the congregation of the Israelites, 'Who will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to Jehovah'?
The people rejoiced because they had offered willingly to God with their whole heart, and David also rejoiced with great joy
He set his face toward God to seek Him in prayer, supplication, and confession of sins with fasting and sackcloth and ashes
God then sent Gabriel to Daniel in a vision to promise him that the people of Israel would recover the holy temple and the holy city
Thank God that in the first year of King Cyrus , God, in order to fulfill His promise, stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia
When they arrived at Jerusalem, they gathered together as one man and endeavored in one accord to rebuild the temple
However, if you look at the whole picture, you will see that His ultimate goal is to recover His glorious church
We should also lead the believers to love the Lord, be zealous for Him, draw near to Him, and fellowship with Him
When we release messages on other matters, we sense that there is no echo within and that our speaking misses the mark and is not powerful
If we do not go in the direction of the church, we will feel that we have not carried out the ministry that God has committed to us
Around 1930, there were only a few of us who were serving the Lord, and almost every one of us fell into various kinds of trials
We then asked him, 'Does this mean that we who serve the Lord will always live a little longer regardless of the condition of our health'?
After he saw our expressions, he went on and said, 'Brothers, according to the Bible expositors, the Lord Jesus is returning soon
He also said, 'Brothers, please observe the present, real situation of Christianity in the East and in the West
Brother Andrew Murray spoke about fellowship with the Lord as well as the indwelling Christ and the indwelling Spirit
Penn-Lewis spoke about dying with the Lord, and after her, someone else received special knowledge concerning resurrection
He went on to say, 'Today there are a good number of authoritative scholars who know the Bible and can interpret the truth
Bible colleges for the training of Bible students and special books on Bible exposition have proliferated and are innumerable
The reason God wants us to preach the gospel and save sinners is that we may gain material for the building of the church
When we read the book of Ezra together, we especially noticed the matter of how the Israelites recovered the temple
We will still actively preach the gospel and thoroughly present the truth, and we will also lead many to pursue spirituality
Although the brothers in prison have physically lost their freedom and cannot say much or do much, they are praying day and night
We feel that the Holy Spirit has given this word a strong confirmation and that the spirit of the saints has had a strong response
The Lord has not only revealed to us His vision of the building but has also begun a marvelous work in our hearts
A few days ago we reached such a high peak in our spirit through the message that we all fervently responded to this glorious vision
Nearly all of these books merely explained the meanings of the seven seals, the seven bowls, and the seven trumpets
If we compare the beginning and the end of Revelation just as we compared the beginning and the end of the Bible we will discover new light
It does not have two dimensions only-the length and the breadth, but it has a third dimension as well-the height
Another special feature of the city is that it needs no artificial light or natural light because it is illuminated by the glory of God
In the holy city New Jerusalem, this light, which is God, shines out through the lamp, which is Christ the Lamb
If we read Revelation 21 carefully, we will find that the throne of God and of the Lamb is at the center of the city on a high peak
The walls around the city are clear as crystal, like a great glass lampshade, diffusing and shining forth the light of the city
These seven lampstands are the lampstands in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea
With regard to time, the seven lampstands at the beginning exist in the present age, while the one at the end exists in eternity
Unlike us who hang our lamps from the ceiling, the Jewish people in ancient times set their lamps on lampstands
The existence and formation of all the lampstands, whether small or great, are due to the fact that they have passed through trials
The great lampstand will be in the new heaven and new earth, but the seven small ones are located in different cities and localities
The seven small lampstands refer only to the saved ones in various cities and localities in the New Testament age
The two kinds of lampstands are the same in nature and principle but different in measure, time, location, and constituents
We have pointed out many times that the great lampstand, the New Jerusalem, is the issue of God's work throughout the ages
After doing a work of creation, God began to do His work of building, first in the Old Testament age and then in the New Testament age
In the past several decades we have been paying particular attention to the matter of the church among God's children
Because of this, we have frequently encountered questions and arguments from many brothers and sisters outside the recovery
These friends of ours in the Lord argue with us, saying, 'When we preach the gospel, is it not for the church?
When two or three meet at a home in one accord, zealously loving the Lord, praying, and reading the Scriptures, this is also the building
The Christians who do not meet with us will buy the books that we publish as long as the books are on being spiritual
Previously, we had published a book whose original title had been Being Holy and Without Blemish, and many copies were sold
Later, we thought that the title of this book did not fit its content very well, so we changed its title to The GloriousChurch
Many of them have come back to the West and testified that we have to thank the Lord for raising up your work in China in the East
The only thing that annoyed them was the matter of the church, which was like a dead fly in the sweet ointment
They would rather spare themselves these troubles and stay in their own homes to read the Bible, pray, and draw near to the Lord
During the first week they may read the Scriptures and pray every day, but after two weeks, these practices may begin to decline
You may feel that you are very strong, and you may criticize the church meetings as being poor, weak, depressing, and tasteless
When the brothers and sisters visit him to pray and have fellowship, he will be greatly touched and exceedingly happy
When he comes back to the meeting, although the condition of the church will be the same as before, his feeling will be quite different
The place that he previously had thought was cold, tasteless, and boring will become the warmest and sweetest place to him
Many times you may feel confused and unclear within, and no matter how much you pray and seek the Lord you cannot get clear
As long as there is the building up of the church, the presence, the blessing, and the expression of the abundant grace of God will be there
Being spiritual in an independent way, no matter how high the degree of spirituality, cannot meet the Lord's need today'
The question they asked was, 'Brother Lee, how can we have a church today that is truly according to God's desire'?
Please remember that when we are speaking of the practical church, we are not referring to the great lampstand at the end of Revelation
We need to continue learning to be built together in the church in our locality by rejecting our own choices and tastes
If the only purpose of the church was to cultivate you as a beautiful flower, then there would never be any real building
We should commit ourselves without reservation into the hand of God who is the Craftsman, allowing Him to do the work of breaking first
Sometimes He may cut us with an axe, other times he may shave us with a plane, and still other times He may use a saw on us
If we truly want to be built, we need to be pressed, even to the point of nearly suffocating, for an extended period of time in the church
Our glorious Lord would be expressed in the church, and the light of God would shine forth in Christ through the church
It is regrettable that very few among God's children have seen this matter, which is clearly revealed in the Word
If he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
Finally, the church spoke to him, and when he still would not listen, the church considered him as a Gentile and tax collector
Suppose that one day a problem like that described in Matthew 18 occurred, and someone wanted to tell it to the church
Above the palm is the lower arm, and above the lower arm is the upper arm, and above the upper arm is still the head
If the fingers were to say, 'We are good friends with the palm, but we are enemies with the arm,' this would also not be acceptable
How could we be like the worldly people, not submitting to authority or keeping the order and always quarreling?
When such a situation exists, then there will be the church and the expression of Christ, the expression of God
They saw that the number of people in our meetings was about the same as the number in theirs but that our meetings were very simple
They replied, 'First, we will sing two songs, then we will keep silent for two minutes, and then we will start our discussion
It is not a matter of the elder brother or sister being authoritarian or of the younger siblings losing their freedom
It proves that those brothers and sisters have not learned the lesson of submission and have not known authority and order
We would see how blessed a place the church is, and whoever comes to this place would definitely meet the true and living Lord
May He also bless all the local churches that they all may become golden lampstands appearing gloriously in different localities
