   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FAITH AND OBEDIENCE Notes from the Conference in 1932 Issue No. 30 Scripture Reading: Rom 6:11-14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today I will speak about the principles of Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The entire New Testament shows us that there are only two principles of Christian living; everything else is merely fruit that issues from these two principles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Patience, meekness, truthfulness, temperance, and whatever else are not the principles of Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are only two principles of Christian living: one is faith; the other is obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All good fruit issues from these two principles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In our fellowship with the Lord, we need faith and obedience every day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the New Testament, many verses speak about faith and obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I will only mention Romans 6:11 and 13.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 11 says "reckon."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 13 says "present."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 11 speaks of faith in reference to what Christ has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 13 speaks of presenting our members to God, which will preserve the ground we gain through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we can balance the principles of faith and obedience, all spiritual experiences will open before us, and we will be able to enter into these experiences freely.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What are faith and obedience?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the objective truths are in Christ and have been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the subjective truths are in the Holy Spirit and will be accomplished by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do not know if all of you understand the difference between redemption and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Redemption was accomplished more than nineteen hundred years ago, while salvation was accomplished on the day you believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, redemption is objective; it has been accomplished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Salvation is subjective; it is what the Holy Spirit accomplishes in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The order of these two matters cannot be reversed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus did not accomplish salvation nineteen hundred years ago, neither did the Spirit within me accomplish redemption today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One was accomplished long ago; the other is waiting to be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose I have not yet believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When you preach the gospel to me, you can only say that redemption has been accomplished; you cannot say that salvation has been accomplished, because I have not yet been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Salvation is accomplished only after I have believed in the Lord, but redemption was accomplished long before I believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the redemptive work is past.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the objective works are in the past; they are absolute and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All subjective works are accomplished in the present and in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One has been accomplished; the other is waiting to be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the one hand, death, burial, resurrection, and ascension are accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the other hand, the death which the Holy Spirit puts within you is accomplished only when you believe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The resurrection of Christ took place more than nineteen hundred years ago, but it is manifested in you on the day you believe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everything objective is in the past; it is absolute, complete, and nothing can be added.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everything subjective is accomplished in the present and in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Receiving something objective and receiving something subjective require two completely different principles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since the objective has been accomplished, we should just believe.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since the subjective is accomplished now and in the future, we need to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we pay attention only to one side, we will go astray by either becoming theoretical or ascetic.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The objective death, resurrection, and ascension require our believing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, it is not enough just to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Day by day we also need to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Crucifixion with Christ requires obedience; the power of resurrection requires obedience; and the place of ascension requires obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brothers and sisters, we need an outward Savior and an inward Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need the Word incarnated in the flesh and the Word manifested in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need the Christ of Golgotha and the Christ in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Savior who is without demands our faith, whereas the Holy Spirit who is within demands our obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now I would like to speak about some experiences in order for us to understand faith and obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What does believing mean?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is something that we cannot give up even for a single day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Objective truths need our believing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A man should not say that he needs to die, resurrect, and ascend.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, he should say that he has died, resurrected, and ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Faith means that you have known, seen, and acknowledged.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A man cannot believe in what he has not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whether it is death, resurrection, or ascension, there must first be the revelation of the Holy Spirit before there can be the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A doctrine is a presentation of the facts, while a truth is the reality behind what is presented.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many times, many doctrines are not truths to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When something is really there, it will not only be a doctrine, but a truth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The death of the Lord Jesus on our behalf is not only a doctrine, but also a truth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Theology is about doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In other words, doctrines are theology.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The objective truth requires that we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must know that it is real.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In Greek, truth means reality.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The death of the Lord is a truth, which means that the death of the Lord is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The resurrection of the Lord is a truth, which means that the resurrection of the Lord is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The ascension of the Lord is a truth, which means that the ascension of the Lord is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is what we call the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>How do we know that these truths are real?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Every time we receive a truth, it is not due to what was said by the preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The only One in the whole world who can bring men into the truth is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Preachers can only speak doctrines to men, but there must be the revelation of the Holy Spirit before men can have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Brothers and sisters, have we seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I am not speaking about our death, resurrection, and ascension with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I am only speaking about the Lord's death on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the past we did not know sin, neither did we know God or Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Perhaps one day when we heard someone speak about the death of the Lord Jesus on our behalf, there was one word that touched our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As a result we said, "Oh, that is what this is!"</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Suddenly we "saw" sin, we "saw" God, we "saw" Christ, and we "saw" salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We saw that our sins were forgiven, and we had the boldness to say that our sins were forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Someone might have asked us how we knew our sins were forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Despite their question, we were very clear about it because we had seen.</S>
