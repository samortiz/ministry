   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A WORD ABOUT MEEKNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me say a further word about meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The New Testament tells us that we do not fight against flesh and blood, but against the Devil, against the enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must fight against the Devil, God s enemy, day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, we are not to fight against people, not even against those who oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Toward all men, including the adversaries and opposers, we must be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although we fight Satan and the principalities in the air, we do not fight people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, we love them all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Young people, do not go to the campuses to fight with the students.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Never say, We shall defeat the students and take the earth!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not go to the campuses to fight go there to be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to be so meek that, even if a persecutor hits us on the right cheek, we would turn to him the left cheek.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be meek means not to resist or to fight back.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, as we turn our left cheek to the persecutor, we should pray, Lord, bind the powers of darkness!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While we are being meek toward other people, we must fight against the powers of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The enemy is not the people; it is Satan and his angels, the evil powers in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>HUNGERING AND THIRSTING</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we are being meek toward others, we must hunger and thirst for righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We ourselves must be right with everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must be right with our parents, our husband or wife, our children, our in-laws, our relatives, and our neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The people of the heavenly kingdom are righteous in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not think that, if we are mournful and meek, we can afford to be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No, we must hunger and thirst for the highest righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>RIGHTEOUS WITH OURSELVES,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>MERCIFUL TOWARD OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although we must be strict with ourselves in righteousness, we must learn to be merciful to others and not to place demands on them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is wrong for any Christian to place demands on others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you are truly strict with yourself, then you will know how to be merciful to others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But do not try to be merciful to others without first being righteous with yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every sloppy person is merciful to others because he has already been merciful to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If he sleeps late every morning, he will be very merciful to others who sleep late.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kind of mercy is not mercy at all; it is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No one who is sloppy knows how to be merciful to others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only a strict person, a righteous person, knows how to be merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you would be merciful to others according to the fifth blessing, you must first be righteous toward yourself according to the fourth blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must be righteous and strict with ourselves, never making excuses for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But when others offend us, thereby exposing their shortage, we must be merciful toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All those who are self-righteous condemn others and never let them go.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word spoken by the Lord on the mount is completely different from this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To ourselves, we must be righteous and strict, serious and sober.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But toward others we must be merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Himself God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, if He were righteous to the uttermost in dealing with us, we would all be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although God is righteous in relation to Himself, He is full of mercy in dealing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As fallen sinners, we surely need God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We also must learn to be righteous with ourselves, and merciful toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This matter of being righteous toward ourselves and merciful toward others is not firstly a matter of outward behavior; it is firstly a matter of our inward attitude, of our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a brother taking the lead, either as an elder in the church or as a brother in the brothers house, you may find it difficult to be strict with yourself and yet be merciful toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Suppose everyone is supposed to be home by a certain time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To come home later than that time is not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Likewise, it is not right to inconvenience others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, when some young people come home, they like to throw their shoes anywhere they please.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I knew of one co-worker, a preacher and teacher of the Bible, who used to throw his socks without any concern for where they landed around the room.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One time this brother and I were guests in a certain home.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The hostess, quite concerned, spoke to me about this brother s sloppiness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What a shame that was to me!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some of the brothers living in the brothers houses may act the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Other brothers may be unhappy about being required to wash dishes; therefore, they may not clean them thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is never righteous to take advantage of others, to invade their rights.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Not doing an adequate job in washing dishes is taking advantage of others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you are such a one, you are not a righteous person.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you are a leader in the brothers house, you must be strict with yourself about the time, about excessive talking, about noise, about washing dishes, and about many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not say this is too much.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It may seem too much to you, but it is not too much to Christ who lives within you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In everything you do, you must be strict with yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, as one taking the lead in the brothers house or in any aspect of the church life, you must also be merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sometimes a leader may warn a sloppy one about his dishwashing, saying, This is your first warning about the way you wash the dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After two more warnings, you will have to move out.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Remember the word of the Lord Jesus about how many times you must forgive your brother 18:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even if a certain brother does not clean the dishes thoroughly after you have spoken to him a number of times, you must still be merciful to him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do not drive away even such a sloppy and pitiful brother.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Instead, be merciful to him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This does not mean that you go to the opposite extreme and say, I have learned that I must be merciful toward this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, from now on, I will never talk to him about the way he does the dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Let him do the dishes any way he wants.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We ll just have to tolerate it in order to keep him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This attitude is not right either.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You need to take care of such a sloppy brother day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Let him have a turn at washing the dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But each time he does so, you must be patient and merciful toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is easy for us to be either strict or sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But we must learn to be strict on the one hand and merciful on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we give others a strict dealing, we must immediately be merciful toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is an important lesson for elders to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The kingdom people are both righteous and merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When you are righteous, you must be absolutely righteous; and when you are merciful, you must be very merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Although righteousness and mercy are two opposite poles, they must meet in your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Your righteousness must come together with your mercy.</S>
