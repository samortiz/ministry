   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALKING BY THE SPIRIT AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After Galatians 1 through 4, the emphasis of chapter 5 is no longer on the law, ordinances, religion, and traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, this chapter speaks of walking by the Spirit, living by the Spirit, and being led by the Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>16, 25, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is difficult for translators of the Bible to decide whether Spirit refers to the Holy Spirit or to our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the context, the Spirit here is the Holy Spirit, who dwells in and mingles with our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Again, we may use a hand in a glove as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The gloved hand is neither a hand alone nor simply a glove, because the two have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ as the divine Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, is mingled with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we have seen, Christ is revealed in us, He lives in us, we have put Him on, and He is now being formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, we two are one; He becomes us, and we become Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord is the Spirit, and the Spirit is mingled with our spirit to be one spirit 2 Cor 3:17; Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This oneness is not a matter of our natural mind, heart, or flesh but of the Spirit in our spirit, as 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He and we, we and He, are now one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now, whatever we do, we must do it in the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We leave behind all the negative things the law, ordinances, religion, traditions, and the flesh and we remain in the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why after Galatians deals with so many negative matters, the last portion of chapter 5 emphasizes only the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Day by day we need to walk by the Spirit in our spirit, be led by the Spirit, and have our life in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not need to ask whether we should do one thing or the other.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must simply walk by the Spirit and be led by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the Spirit leads one way, we do that, but if He leads another way, we do that instead.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many years ago when brothers and sisters would come to ask me for advice, I would have much to say to them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, today I am much simpler.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If someone asks me to fellowship with them for half an hour, I am often clear that the answer to their question will take closer to half a minute.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The answer to many questions is simply, Go according to the Spirit in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we would do everything according to the Spirit in our spirit, we will be freed from problems and saved from turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many dear ones ask me, Brother Lee, your burden is so heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Are you afflicted and have many worries?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the contrary, I remain joyful and healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Worry comes not from the spirit but from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Similarly, anger comes from our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we remain in our mind, worries come to us, and if we stay in our emotions, we become bothered and lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, if we walk by the Spirit, all our worries and anger are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The traditional teachings of Christianity have made the experience of Christ to appear too complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead, it is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may compare the Spirit in our spirit to electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once electricity is installed in a building, the building has whatever we need.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we need heat, we can plug in a heater, and if we need light, we can simply flip a switch.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ as the Spirit today is the electricity within us, providing us with everything that we need, and our spirit is the switch to turn Him on within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must be unloaded of all our negative burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Lord s recovery we must not care for the law, ordinances, religion, traditions, or the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We care only for Christ as the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit, causing these two spirits to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can turn on the switch of our spirit by calling on His name to enjoy Him as the divine electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>COMING TO THE BIBLE AND CONTACTING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>BY PRAYING IN THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I was young, I would buy many books, especially expositions of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever I studied a certain part of the Bible, I would spread out my books on my desk, my bed, and even on the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I also used different Greek lexicons and concordances of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I liked to compare, investigate, study, search, and research in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today, however, I prefer to open the Word, choose a few verses, and enjoy them by praying in the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we pick up Galatians, we may pray, There are no more ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No more law.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No more religion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is only Christ revealed in me, living in me, put upon me, and formed in me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today this Christ is the Spirit in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Oh, these two spirits are mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By praying in this way we will receive much nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some Christians today do not pray enough, but others pray with too many stories for the Lord and many details concerning persons, places, activities, and intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our Father in heaven already knows the things that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, we should forsake the way of telling the Lord stories.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To pray in this way is tiring, and it wastes the Lord s time and ours.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If someone prays like this, he may even become bored with his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the one hand, he will feel that he needs to pray, but on the other hand, his prayer will be burdensome.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Eventually, he may go for a long time with no prayer at all.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then he will say, Father, I repent.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I did not pray for three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>From today on, I will recover my prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After this, he will begin to pray again, but he will do it in the same, old way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the practice of the law, ordinances, religion, traditions, and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even when we come to the dining table, we may give a word of grace in a traditional way, praying in the same way time after time.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This also is a practice of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need to drop the old way of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When we come to eat, we may simply feel to say, Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Praise the Lord!</S>
