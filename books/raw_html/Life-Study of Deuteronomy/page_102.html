<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Curses in Being<br>Brought to a Nation as a Horror,<br>a Proverb, and a Byword among All the Peoples</H2><P>God's people would be cursed in being brought to a nation as a source of horror, a proverb, and a byword among all the peoples to which Jehovah would drive them (vv. 36-37). The peoples would talk about the children of Israel in a despising, joking way. Because they had been taken into captivity, they would also be cursed in the fields and vineyards being left to the locusts, worms, and sojourners (vv. 38-44). These curses would thus become a sign and a wonder forever with the children of Israel (v. 46).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Curses in Their Enemies Coming<br>to Eat the Produce of Their Cattle and the Fruit<br>of Their Ground and to Besiege All Their Towns</H2><P>According to verses 47 through 57, the people would be cursed in their enemies, a nation from far away, coming to eat the produce of their cattle and the fruit of their ground and to besiege all the towns, causing the children of Israel to eat the flesh of their children. Begrudging their brother, their wife, and the remnant of their children, they would not give to one of them any of the flesh of their children whom they would eat. This actually took place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Curses Coming in Great<br>and Persistent Plagues, in Malignant and<br>Persistent Sicknesses, and in All the Illnesses<br>of Egypt to Reduce Them in Number</H2><P>Because the children of Israel did not do all the words of God's commandment and did not fear "this glorious and awesome name"&#151;Jehovah their God&#151;curses would come in great and persistent plagues, in malignant and persistent sicknesses, and in all the illnesses of Egypt to reduce the people in number (vv. 58-63a).</P>
