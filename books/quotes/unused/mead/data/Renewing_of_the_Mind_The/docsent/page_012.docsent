   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Concerning Obedience</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us take baptism as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This truth is quite obviously and accurately revealed to us in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many Christians disobey the teaching of the Bible, while creating many distinctions not because the head has trouble, but because the heart has trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suppose a believer hears that baptism is according to the Bible and is something that God has clearly commanded.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he hears about baptism and looks in the Bible, he will find God's will and obey, saying, "God, this is from You; I am willing to obey."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if another believer, after hearing about baptism, refuses to obey and dismisses it as being meaningless, he will not understand even if he reads the Bible later.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When he subsequently hears others speaking about this truth, he will be motivated like a lawyer in court.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He will not care whether the other side is reasonable; he will only care for his own reason.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first motive of a lawyer is to defeat the other side in the debate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, when problems arise, the question is not the condition of the head, but whether or not the motive is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning Listening to a Message</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The same is true in regards to listening to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When someone preaches something that is different from our belief and practice, we should ask God if his speaking is really improper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If his speaking is not improper, then are we improper somewhere?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we can learn humbly before God, our hearts will be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Consequently, even though our thoughts may be improper at times, our minds will not be improper all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, if our motives are not proper and we only want to argue, we will always be able to find a couple of verses to oppose the truth taught by others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Christians study the Bible like a lawyer studying a law book; their purpose is only to defend their own case.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, it is their motive that is corrupted first, not their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They first have a tendency to covet in their heart; then their mind and whole being are dragged into the peril of covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Concerning Reading the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Among our brothers and sisters, is there anyone whose mind cannot understand the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I would say the reason we do not understand the Bible is that our heart is improper.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit will guide us into all truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I often wonder why some people understand the Bible so poorly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason is that they are improper in the inclinations of their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Perhaps they are too subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a result, their nous cannot receive the light of God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The heart becomes corrupted, and the nous follows.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the heart is not calm and balanced, the mind will become corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Someone said that Eve did not fall because she ate the forbidden fruit, but because her motive was not proper in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When she spoke with Satan, her heart was dissatisfied with God and already corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Soon after, Genesis 6 says that every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart was only evil continually.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The nous becomes corrupted after the heart has been corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One brother in the West said that before Eve ate the forbidden fruit, she had fallen already.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When she added the words "neither shall ye touch it" in her conversation with Satan, her heart was not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By Genesis 6, God pronounced every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart to be only evil continually.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, the heart is improper; second, man is alienated from the life of God; and last, man's imagination and thoughts become totally evil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Any Christian who has a proper heart can read the Bible; he can receive God's light from the Bible, he can know God's will easily, and he can receive full grace from God.</S>
