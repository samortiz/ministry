<h2 class="head3">Prayer Meetings</h2>
<p>Regarding prayer meetings, the church cannot be without prayer. The prayer meetings should be held in small groups, just like the Lord&rsquo;s table meetings. They should be held in small groups throughout the year so that people will not have to go to the meeting halls. According to the Bible, every local church needs four kinds of meetings. First, the church needs a meeting to supply life by releasing the truth. Second, there is a need for a meeting to teach the truth by expounding the Scriptures. Third, we need to meet to break bread to remember the Lord and to worship the Father. Fourth, we need to meet to pray, telling God of our needs and praying to execute His will on the earth. These four meetings are indispensable.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Small Group Gatherings<br />
and Preaching the Gospel in the Homes</h2>
<p>A small group should gather once a week in the homes, and we also need to preach the gospel in our homes. Strictly speaking, every brother and sister, whether strong or weak, progressing or backsliding, should preach the gospel in their home. We should keep the principle of preaching the gospel in our own homes and not ask others to preach for us. We all know that the best tasting rice is the rice that we have cooked for ourselves. Even if we do not know how to &ldquo;cook,&rdquo; it only takes a little practice. Therefore, we encourage the brothers and sisters to open their homes. Every household should preach the gospel. Sometimes the wife can preach the gospel, the husband can give a testimony, and the children can strengthen the words of their parents. Sometimes the children can preach the gospel, the mother can give a testimony, and the father can strengthen the words of the children and the mother. It is very meaningful when the whole family rises up and preaches the gospel. Some recently recovered saints, who used to be unwilling to meet, are taking the lead in this kind of family gospel meeting. In addition to the aforementioned meetings, we suggest having a small group gathering every other week and a family gospel meeting in the intervening weeks. In this way, we will have five kinds of meetings.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are five kinds of meeting: a meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning to supply life by releasing the truth, a meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day evening for breaking bread, being held jointly in the districts halls on the first Lord&rsquo;s Day of every month and in small groups on the remaining Lord&rsquo;s Days of a month, a prayer meeting on Tuesday night, a meeting for teaching the truth on Thursday night, and then small group gatherings and family gospel meetings on one of the convenient remaining nights of the week.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A LONG-TERM VIEW,<br />
BEING ENLARGED IN CAPACITY,<br />
AND MAINTAINING A SUITABLE ATMOSPHERE<br />
FOR PEOPLE TO REMAIN</h2>
<p>Although these are meetings of the church, they may be a burden to saints who are newly saved or recently recovered. We should never force others to attend these meetings; instead, we should lead them slowly. We should not ask a brother who has been recently saved to attend too many meetings; instead, we should ask him to join a small group gathering. If he can attend a small group gathering every week, his inner man will be nourished, and he will gradually be strengthened. We also need to be aware of the capacity of a newly recovered brother. A person who has only recently recovered from an illness cannot eat too much at the beginning; he can only increase his intake of food gradually. However, once his condition improves, his appetite will return, and he will ask for more food. Likewise, after a dormant brother returns to a small group gathering, his spiritual appetite will slowly return, and he will spontaneously ask about the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. After attending these two meetings for a period of time, he will ask about meetings related to the release of the truth. Then we can bring him to the meetings where he can be supplied with life related to the truth of the economical Spirit and the essential Spirit and eventually to meetings that release the truth by expounding the Scriptures. In this way, we can gradually lead the saints into a fuller meeting life.</p>
<p>I hope that we would not create an atmosphere that causes people to feel that they are worldly unless they attend every meeting of the church. This kind of atmosphere will kill them. Seriously speaking, attending every meeting does not ensure that one is spiritual. In fact, for some, it might be better to meet less frequently. I know a sister who felt as if the Lord ignored her prayers for her husband&rsquo;s salvation. When I heard this, I told her that if she would go to less meetings for a few months, her husband would believe in the Lord, because her constant attendance made her husband afraid to believe in the Lord. When she slowed down, it was possible for her husband to catch up with her. If we treat the saints who do not attend every meeting as if they love the world more than the Lord, we will create a standard that can be attained only by angels. We should not have this kind of situation.</p>
<p>The church can be compared to a restaurant that prepares many different kinds of food. Even though many different dishes are available, no one expects every customer to eat them all. It is wonderful when a saint with a large capacity and supporting schedule can attend all the meetings, but we should not give others an impression that they are less spiritual if they do not attend all the meetings. This will discourage many and may even cause them to turn to the world because of their discouragement. These are words based on experience.</p>
<p>In the past twenty-eight years the church in Taipei baptized nearly fifty-eight thousand people, but not many remained because we did not make adjustments concerning our meetings. Those who did not remain often said, &ldquo;I have believed in Jesus and been baptized, but since I cannot go to so many meetings, I will not go to any meetings.&rdquo; We lost many in this way.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that these over fifty thousand people can be recovered. Many of them meet at least once a year and continue to give financial offerings. This shows that they have not forgotten the church. When they come to meetings, they should not be looked upon coldly or condemned for loving the world, and when they give an offering, they should not be criticized for not being in the meetings. No one can withstand such treatment. If we display this kind of attitude, we will drive many brothers and sisters away.</p>
<p>Among those who have been saved, some may not be so much for the Lord, some may have difficult situations, and some may have many human responsibilities, all of which restrict their ability to attend many meetings. We should sympathize with their situations. Even if some can attend only the first Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting of every year, we should love them and be thankful that they have not lost contact with the church. Our capacity must be enlarged. As long as we care for them continuously, they will progress gradually.</p>
<p>Since some saints come to a meeting only at the beginning or at the end of a year, we should make an announcement during these meetings and ask them to leave us their telephone number and address so that we can update our information cards. In the past, we ignored the information cards we received, but if we can determine which saints come once a month or even once a year, we can take care of them according to their situation and regain many of them.</p>
<p>It is good to attend the meetings, but we should realize that this is not possible for everyone. We all want to see an abundance of fruit, but this requires a long-term view. We need a long-term view in order for the church to uphold the saints. The fruit on a tree is often hidden among the many branches and leaves of a tree. Our &ldquo;tree&rdquo; may be full of leaves but have little visible fruit, but next year we may bear ten pieces of fruit. This is progress, and as long as the saints remain in some of the meetings of the church, they will have a chance to progress.</p>
<p>I hope that our capacity will be enlarged and that we will be open to everyone. If we are, the saints will keep coming. Some may come once a year, others may come twice a year, and still others may come three or four times a year or once every month. Because of this situation, the church needs five kinds of meetings. If someone can &ldquo;eat&rdquo; all five &ldquo;meals,&rdquo; this would be wonderful. However, it is still good if someone can eat only one meal or even just half a meal. This should be our attitude; I hope we all understand this.</p>
<p>Although some brothers and sisters do not meet, they are still preaching the gospel and telling others to believe in Jesus, as well as encouraging their relatives, friends, and children to come to the meetings. We should maintain an atmosphere of receiving all the brothers and sisters. We should not have any &ldquo;laws&rdquo; that kill people, and we cannot forsake our fifty thousand dormant brothers and sisters. We need a broad heart to go forth to restore the dormant ones and those who have lost contact with us. The Lord Jesus considers one lost sheep to be more precious than ninety-nine who are not lost (Luke 15:3-7). Therefore, we must treasure the dormant saints and those with whom we have lost contact. We must take care of them with the Lord&rsquo;s heart.</p>
