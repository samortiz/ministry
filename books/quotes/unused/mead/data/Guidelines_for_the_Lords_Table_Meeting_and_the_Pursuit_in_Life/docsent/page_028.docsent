   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAW, THE WORLD, THE SELF, THE FLESH,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE OLD MAN, AND ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>HAVING BEEN CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 6 shows that we who are baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are a group of people identified with the death of Christ: Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled v. 6 . Galatians shows that I, the flesh, and the religious world have been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Galatians 2:20 says, I am crucified with Christ ; 5:24 says, They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts ; and 6:14 says, The world has been crucified to me and I to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Colossians 2:14 says that the ordinances were nailed to the cross, and verse 15 says that the rulers and the authorities of the air were hung on the cross: Wiping out the handwriting in ordinances, which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This shows clearly that the law and the written ordinances were nailed to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans, Galatians, and Colossians list only a few items that are related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since the believers in Rome were not clear regarding the significance of baptism, the apostle Paul asked, Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rom 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then he went on to say, Our old man has been crucified with Him v. 6 . Because the Galatian believers tried to keep the law by themselves, Paul asked them why they still wanted to keep the law since they had already been crucified Gal 3:2-3 . Since the Colossians wanted to go back to Gentile philosophy and the ordinances of the Old Testament, Paul told them that both Gentile philosophy and the ordinances of the Old Testament had been nailed to the cross Col 2:14, 20-23 . Today our focus should be the crucified Christ, not the keeping of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since the believers were not clear, Paul pointed out that the law, the world, the self, the flesh, the old man, and even all things have been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The problems that occupied the believers in Rome, Galatia, and Colossae had already been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>GOD S WORK IN MAN BEING</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF HIS PLAN</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AND THE MANIFESTATION OF HIS WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Question: In the Old Testament God s work in man was outward, but in the New Testament it seems that God s work in man is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why is God so complicated?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Answer: God spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the principle of God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is all that He needs to do in order to create.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The principle of incarnation, however, is not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God established the types in the Old Testament before the New Testament age so that through these types men could comprehend the eternal purpose of God which is presented in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This purpose is to gain man and to accomplish what He wants to do in man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Old Testament whenever God wanted to call man to work for Him or whenever He wanted to move through man, it was always done through the Spirit of God coming upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the New Testament in order for God to gain man, He gives the Holy Spirit to man and puts His life within man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, from the day of our salvation, the Holy Spirit has been dwelling and spreading in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In God s creation He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But in order for God to accomplish His eternal goal, He had to pass through a process with numerous steps.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This process is for the manifestation of God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, the Old Testament presents types, and the New Testament presents the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Old Testament God worked on man outwardly, and in the New Testament God works on man inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All of His work is for the accomplishment of His plan and the manifestation of His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE SALVATION GOD GIVES TO MAN IN HIS PLAN</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>BEING A FULL SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Question: Is the salvation that we have received from God complete?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Answer: In the Old Testament age God gave the land of Canaan to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After they crossed the Jordan River, the entire land of Canaan was theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Their enjoyment of Canaan began when their feet stepped on the land.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even though they were able to enjoy only the part of the land they walked on, the entire land of Canaan was for their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the New Testament age the Holy Spirit has been in us from the day of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Holy Spirit is Christ, and Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God are in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But our knowing and enjoying the Holy Spirit depend upon our actual experience of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The day we were saved, we received everything, but we still need to hear the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The truth we hear points out and shows us that all that is in Christ is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In God s plan Christ intends to work His glorious and great person into us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We received everything that Christ is at the time of our salvation, even though we did not understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, God repeatedly sends His servants to tell us that all things are ours.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since we may not have heard clearly the first time, God arranges the environment so that we can have a better comprehension of what we have received when we hear it a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since our knowledge and comprehension of salvation are very limited by our natural concepts, God gives us more of His divine speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the reason we have writings such as Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, and Revelation in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This, however, is not to say that the riches of Christ were not our portion before we heard God s further speaking after our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In fact, all the riches were our portion, but we did not know it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, God in His Word reveals and shows that all things are ours, item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At the same time He shows that not only were we finished on the cross, but all things were dealt with on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The only reason we think that we are poor is because we have not seen the full salvation that God has given us in His plan.</S>
