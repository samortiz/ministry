<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Present Condition</H2><P>Every Tuesday we preach the gospel in our homes. On Wednesday afternoon there is a sisters' prayer meeting. On Thursday afternoon there is a Bible study meeting. On Saturday evening there is a brothers' prayer meeting. Every Lord's Day morning there is a table meeting and an edification meeting. There are about thirty who attend. In the afternoon there is a gospel meeting which usually has about forty or fifty who attend. Eleven brothers and twelve sisters have been baptized, including the eleven who were added in June of this year.</P><P>The preceding description of the condition of the church in Changchow was written according to what a few brothers were able to remember of the history. There is really not much of it that is worth saying. However after reading Collection of Newsletters, we have come to know that this kind of mutual fellowship is really necessary, so we wrote concerning what the Lord's grace has done in Changchow. We want the brothers and sisters who walk together with us in the Lord's way in all the localities to know the general situation, and we also ask you all to pray for us because we are still immature. We also lack workers for the day to day work of visiting each house and watering the brothers and sisters. Even more we lack workers among the sisters. Our most desperate need now is the watering work. The Lord's Day is the time of sowing, but the seeds must be watered during the week before they can grow. We deeply hope that the brothers and sisters in one accord will pray more for the work here so that all the glory may be given to the Lord's holy name. Amen.</P><P>Brothers Chen Ch'eng Ch'ing and Kuo Shu P'an usually bear the responsibility for speaking in the meetings. The rest of the brothers also give testimonies from time to time.</P><P>The responsible brothers in the meeting are: Chen Ch'eng Ch'ing, Teng Chu Ch'in, Wu Feng Yuan, and Kuo Shu P'an.</P><P>The address of the meeting is: 30 Po Ai Road, South Market End, Changchow, Fukien.</P><P>Wu Feng Yuan, Chen Ch'eng Ch'ing,<br>Teng Chu Ch'in, Kuo Shu P'an<br>July 11, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM CHIA HSING, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>Peace to my brother in the Lord, Brother Lee:</P><P>Thank Him for protecting me and allowing me to arrive safely in Chia Hsing. Everything was peaceful upon my arrival in Chia Hsing because Brother Lo Yung Tien, who walks with us together in the way in the Lord, assisted me.</P><P>I have almost nothing to do in the day except read. Every time I think of you and the meeting there, it really makes me feel lonely. By leaving you all and the warm atmosphere of mutual love, I have really felt the coldness elsewhere, especially yesterday on the Lord's Day. My heart really hurts with loneliness. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>I am the youngest in my family; therefore, when I first came here, I felt really weak. Brother Lo and I can only pray for God to revive His work Himself. May God prepare a meeting place for us. May the Lord Himself establish His table. Now we can only pray and wait. First we pray that the Lord will keep our standing and cause us to be sheep who follow Him. We do not want to run in front of Him by acting in the flesh or by being zealous for Him. At the same time, we pray that we will not shrink back so that we can be His strong, enduring soldiers. Of course there are a few brothers here who hope that Mr. Nee can come for a visit. We think that if the Lord gives us a meeting place, you will be willing to come here to nourish us through our relationship as members.</P><P>Every day I only read the Bible and other books. My heart is not at ease. Sometimes I think, "Be bold, be bold." Sometimes I think, "Wait, wait." Sometimes I wonder how I could bear responsibility for the Lord's work, because I am so immature and weak. At other times, I think the Lord is great, that He bears the responsibility, and that He knows everything. So I am fearful and worried one minute and peaceful and confident the next. But now I have only one thing&mdash;prayer. I endure and wait to see the Lord express His glory. I do whatever He says. I keep thinking of the principles in John 5:19, and I am willing to live according to these principles: (1) I can do nothing by myself; (2) I see that the Lord has done; and (3) I do so accordingly.</P><P>I now know that since this place has a few brothers who desire the Lord, it should have the Lord's table. What do you think? However we must wait until the brothers have the same view, and the hand of God arranges it. Do you think this is right?</P><P>In your prayer, please do not forget to pray for us so that the Lord would revive His work in Chia Hsing. If you think there is the need to mention it in the prayer meeting, it would be good to do so. Finally, ask the Lord to keep me as an empty, righteous, holy, and faithful vessel in His hand!</P><P>I hope we do not have fellowship only in our prayer, but at the same time I hope you will have a little time to help me by your letters so you can give me some light and exhortation.</P><P>The weather is very hot, but it is bearable. I have written enough. Until we meet again. May the grace of the Lord be with you always!</P><P>Your little brother in the Lord,<br>Chang Yu Chih<br>August 6</P><P>(Note: Brother Chang Yu Chih was a student in Shanghai. Recently he has gone to Hsiu Chou Private Secondary School in Chia Hsing, Chekiang to be a teacher.&mdash;Editor)</P>
