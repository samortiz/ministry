   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX THE CHARACTERISTICS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE OVERCOMING LIFE Date: December 19, 1936, evening</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Foochow</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading: Col 3:4; Phil 1:21; Gal 2:20; 1 Cor 1:30</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Last night we pointed out how man tries to overcome by his own efforts and how these efforts are futile.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even God cannot do anything with us when we try to overcome by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why God allows man to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He allows man to fall in order to show him the kind of person that he is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of course, God has no intention for man to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if man does not fall, he will not see himself and not acknowledge that he cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We see from the Bible that God's provisions for man are always excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The blood of Christ has satisfied God's righteous judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The cross of Christ has crucified our old man together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, God has dispensed the life of His Son to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet many people think that the life of Christ within us is mainly for us to have some power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have not seen the salvation of Christ clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After they are saved, they try to imitate Jesus, copying Him like they copy calligraphy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who copy well are regarded as being good Christians, and those who do not copy well are regarded as being bad Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They pray for the Lord to give them the strength to be like Jesus, to be holy and humble like Jesus, to live a heavenly life, and to have a life of prayer like Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man wants to do things by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No one wants to hear someone saying, "You cannot do anything; you are too evil."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many people have reviled me and have said that Watchman Nee is an evil person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I never get angry about this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the contrary, I tell them that they have not said enough.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Watchman Nee is actually more evil than they think.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Within my small heart are the sins of the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has utterly given up all hope in me; He does not cherish any hope for me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is what man has.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God does not want man to live his own life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has given Christ to man so that He would become man's life and so that man would live out His life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is life?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Life is something within our being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without life we would cease to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If Christ were taken away from us, we would cease to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul did not say that he wanted to be like Christ, that he had to trust in Christ, or that he had to trust in His power, that he had to imitate Christ, or that he had to take Christ as his pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He said that Christ is our life Col 3:4 , and that for us to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul recognized that his life was simply Christ, and that he lived because Christ was his life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If Christ had been taken away from him, he would have ceased to live.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE OVERCOMING LIFE BEING CHRIST HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's provision for us in the gospel is for Christ to become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What does it mean to say that our life is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Galatians 2:20 says, "I am crucified with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This word is not a goal for us to attain.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We could never accomplish this goal, because this is something that only the Lord Himself can do.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This verse goes on to say that "it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In other words, Christ is living within us instead of us living by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our heart is deceitful above all things and very evil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Unless Christ lives within us, there is no way for us to not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since man's heart is evil and beyond any remedy, God must set man aside and install Christ His Son within him to be his life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What is the overcoming life?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The overcoming life is simply the Son of God living within us to overcome sin on our behalf this is the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The overcoming life is not the Lord giving us the strength to be holy or pure in our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The overcoming life is Christ being obedient in our place, Christ praying in our place, and Christ being humble in our place.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ lives in us to do everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is a world of difference between these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Have we seen the difference between applying Christ's power to act in a humble way and having Christ within us as our humility?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we see the difference, we will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Last year when I was conducting a conference in Chefoo, Mrs. Witness Lee said to me, "I have overcome in many areas.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have made confessions to my mother-in-law, and my mother-in-law has said that there is no longer any problem between us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But I still have two little children who are quite rowdy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is difficult for me to overcome in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I try to be patient whenever they are noisy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I can overcome the first five or six times, but I lose my patience when they become rowdy for the seventh or eighth time.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Can you pray for me that God would give me a better environment so that I can overcome?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I answered, "No. I cannot ask God to make you overcome; God will not make you overcome, He will only make you fail.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Victory is something that only God can accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christ within you is your victory.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God does not help you overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If it were up to you to overcome, you might overcome when your children shout four times, but by the fifth time you will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But if the Lord takes care of your children in your place, would you lose your patience?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You would not lose your patience after they shouted five or ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In fact, after fifty or a hundred times, you would still come out more than a conqueror."</S>
