   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Three The Firstfruits, the Harvest,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Late Overcomers Scripture Reading: Rev 14:1-5, 14-16; 15:2-4 The rapture is not mainly for our enjoyment but for God s enjoyment; we need to be raptured to heaven, not for our happiness but for the fulfillment of God s purpose 12:5, 7-10; 14:1, 4b: The meaning of rapture is to be taken into the Lord s presence; in order to be taken into the Lord s presence, we must be in His presence today Luke 21:36; 2 Cor 2:10.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The rapture is for defeating the enemy and satisfying God Rev 12:5; 14:1, 4b: God has a need for us to be raptured; we must be raptured to heaven that we may fight against the enemy 12:5, 7-11.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord needs the man-child to fight against His enemy, but He needs the firstfruits even more for His satisfaction 14:1, 4b.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible reveals two aspects of the rapture: the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of the majority of the believers Matt 24:40-41; Luke 21:36; Rev 3:10; 1 Thes 4:15-17; Rev 12:5; 14:1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Leviticus 23:10 we see a type of the rapture the type of the crop ripening in the field Matt 13:24; Rev 14:14-16: The reaping of God s crop is what we call the rapture; this reaping indicates that the believers will be taken away from the earth Matt 13:30, 39b.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Part of the crop the firstfruits ripens earlier and is reaped earlier; the rest of the crop the harvest ripens later and is reaped later.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to Revelation 14 there are two kinds of rapture the rapture of the firstfruits and the rapture of the harvest vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>4b, 14-15.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The firstfruits in Revelation 14:1-5 are the living overcomers who will be the first ripe ones in God s field; hence, they will be reaped before the harvest as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb: The firstfruits will be caught up to the heavenly Mount Zion, to the place of God s dwelling in the third heaven, in order to be in the presence of God and Christ 14:1, 4b.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The firstfruits are raptured to the house of God in Zion as the fresh enjoyment to God; this is for God s satisfaction Exo 23:19a; Lev 23:10; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 20:17a: The firstfruits satisfy the hunger of God the Father and the Lamb, the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whereas the man-child is for fighting to deal with the enemy, the firstfruits are for the satisfaction of God and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The firstfruits are believers who are saturated with Christ; they have been fully occupied by Christ and taken over by Christ Eph 3:16-17a; Gal 4:19.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The firstfruits have the name of the Lamb and of His Father written on their foreheads; this is the designation of their being one with the Lamb and with the Father and of their belonging to Them Rev 14:1b.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The one hundred forty-four thousand firstfruits are believers who are for the accomplishment of God s eternal purpose v. 1: The number twelve signifies the mingling of divinity with humanity; this mingling is for the completion of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Twelve multiplied by twelve means completion of completions, the completion in God s administration for the fulfillment of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The firstfruits are the earliest ones among God s crop to reach maturity Heb 5:14 6:1; 1 Cor 2:6; Eph 4:13; Phil 3:15: To be transformed is to be changed in our natural life; to be matured is to be filled with the divine life that changes us Rom 12:2; Eph 3:19b.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For God s expression there is the need of maturity; only a mature life can bear God s image and exercise His dominion Gen 1:26.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The harvest in Revelation 14:14-16 is the rapture of the majority of the believers: Whereas the firstfruits are taken to the throne in the heavens before the great tribulation, the harvest is taken to the air the barn Matt 13:30; 3:12 toward the end of the tribulation, that is, at the last trumpet 1 Thes 4:16-17; 1 Cor 15:52; Rev 10:7.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All those included in the rapture of the harvest must pass through the greater part of the great tribulation Matt 24:21; Rev 3:10: The harvest will be left to pass through the great tribulation because green, unripened fields need strong sunshine to ripen 14:15; Matt 13:39b.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a sense, the great tribulation will be the strong sunshine which will ripen all the believers who were not ready before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If today we do not give up the world and live to Christ, Christ will leave us on earth to pass through the great tribulation Matt 16:26; 2 Cor 5:14-15: At that time the believers will give up the world and realize that the best way to live is to live to Christ James 4:4; 1 John 2:15-17; Rom 14:7-8.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The time will come when all the believers will realize that they need to ripen and mature Mark 4:26-29; 1 Cor 3:1-2; 14:20; Col 1:28.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The harvest will be reaped by the Son of Man; He came as the Son of Man to sow the seed, and He will come again as the Son of Man to reap what He has sown Matt 13:37; Rev 14:14.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Regarding the rapture, we all need to receive the warning and to see God s purpose and our responsibility to cooperate with Him 2 Tim 4:8; Rev 16:15.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Revelation 15:2-4 unveils the rapture of the late overcomers, who overcome Antichrist, his mark, the number of his name, and his image: Although they are slain by Antichrist, in the eyes of God they are victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The late overcomers sing the song of Moses and of the Lamb v. 3a: The song of Moses indicates God s triumphant judgment over the enemy of His people Exo 15:1-18.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The song of the Lamb indicates Christ s redemption experienced by God s people in the presence of their enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The late overcomers praise God for His works and His ways, that is, for His acts and His principles Rev 15:3b-4; Psa 103:7.</S>
