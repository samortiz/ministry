   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Maiden's Glory 6:10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 10 says, "Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here the Holy Spirit speaks through the mouth of a third party again and brings out the maiden's glory through exclamatory questions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All four questions refer to the maiden.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Holy Spirit likes to stimulate the thoughts of the believers with questions; He arouses their attention once again to consider God's work and understand what is pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every time the Holy Spirit poses a question, it comes after a renewed perfecting on the part of the maiden.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was the case in chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is repeated again in chapter eight.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here we see the same pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every time the believer reaches a higher level of experience, the Holy Spirit uses questions to reveal the history or reason behind the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Looketh forth as the morning."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She has arrived at the morning again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word "morning" is the same word as "day break" in 2:17 and 4:6.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Her shadows have fled away; there is no further barrier between her and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She enters into a life without barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although it is not yet high noon, it is nevertheless morning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Her future is as bright as the morning light, and her hope is as promising as the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She can look forward to everything, as morning looks forth toward the day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The future and the hope of the morning is high noon.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She has already received the promise of high noon Prov 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way of a righteous man in the hand of the Lord goes only as far as high noon; there is nothing after high noon.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Fair as the moon."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The emphasis here is not on the waxing or waning of the moon, but on the beauty of it, which is the soft glow that emanates from it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She is heavenly, yet she shines on earth and reveals her testimony to those in darkness Psa 89:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Clear as the sun."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that there is no shadow; she is full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Both the sun and the moon signify her heavenliness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The moon signifies the grace within her, while the sun signifies what she is in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In herself, she is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Like the moon, she has no life and no vitality of her own, and the light and life come from the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When she faces the sun, there is light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When she turns her back to the sun, there is darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, as far as her being in the Lord is concerned, she is clear as the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She is a totally new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is only light; there is no darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just as the Lord is the sun, she is also a sun.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Terrible as an army with banners."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only does she have a future that is full of hope, and a life that is absolutely heavenly, but she is a victor who constantly triumphs in her victory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She is "terrible as an army with banners."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She goes from victory to victory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you know such a one?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Have you seen her?</S>
