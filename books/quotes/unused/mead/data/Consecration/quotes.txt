[1]  After we have been born again, there is still much work for God to do in our lives, and there is also much service that we can render to God.
[2]  We need to allow Him to do His work in us; we need to allow Him to use us; and we need to allow Him to lead us over the stretch of road that lies ahead.
[3]  When we really meet the love of God, we feel that our all must be offered up to Him; yet at the same time we feel that our richest offering is as refuse in the light of His love.
[4]  I trust you will remember that your consecration to God does not mean that you become preachers or workers, or that you engage in any sort of Christian activity; it means that you become a sacrifice to God.
[5]  Examine the history of the church and see how many there have been who, before they met the impact of God s love, were like powerful oxen out in the world plowing great fields or pulling huge carts; but when the love of God laid hold of them, they were at once on the altar, while their friends and relatives bemoaned the tragic waste.
[6]  We have just explained that the significance of consecration is the offering of oneself as a sacrifice to God for His satisfaction.
[7]  If we have not presented ourselves as a sacrifice to Him, we shall never be able to do anything for Him.
[8]  One of the troubles in the Christianity of today is that numbers of Christians who have never allowed God to do His work in them want to devote themselves to work for Him.
