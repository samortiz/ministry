<h2 class="head2">Experiences on the Road from Hunan<br />to Kweichow to Yunnan</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>My younger sister and I left Ch'ang-sha on December 29 and have arrived safely in Kweichow. We are now waiting for the train to K'un-ming, according to Sister X's instructions. The road was very difficult, but we received the Lord's grace and peace. We have more than enough money for our traveling expenses, and we are not bothered by the change in climate. Please do not worry about us any longer. The road from Hunan to Kweichow is still peaceful, but there are not many buses. We had to wait, and we were delayed for a long time. It is the eighth day of our trip, and we are still not in Yunnan. The Lord has led me to travel a long distance to increase my knowledge of the world. I have discovered that the people in Kweichow are suffering much and really need the gospel. I pray that the Lord will send more workers. Peace in the Lord. Please greet all the brothers and sisters in the church.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Chang Jing-yuan<br />January 8, in Kuei-yang</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>To my sister in the Lord, Sister X:</p><p>I have read your letter. Thank you for sharing everything with me! We have been preserved by the Lord and are safe. Are you busy with the work? I think of you. My sister and I experienced the Lord's provision in providing tickets to K'un-ming on December 28. We left on the twenty-ninth. I wrote a letter while we were waiting to change trains in Huang County, western Hunan, which I gave to a person from Hangchow, Mr. Lee, to mail for me when he passes through Chungking. We received much grace from God on this journey. After arriving in K'un-ming, I will have to work. Thank and praise the Lord! We spent New Year's Day in Huang County. We had to wait for the train, so we went into the city to sightsee. God's Spirit led us into a China Inland Mission where we met a Western brother, Mr. Bei. We spoke a little about the matter of meeting according to the principles of the Bible. He was very satisfied. We were there during their New Year's gospel meetings, and the Lord gave me an opportunity to preach the gospel once and to testify of the Lord's leading and protection in grace. Glory to God. Peace in the Lord. Please greet Brother Chang, Miss Wang, and Miss Chang.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chang Jing-yuan<br />January 1, in Kuei-yang</p>
