   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PICTURE OF MAN AND GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In principle, both the things of man and the things of God mentioned in 2:11 should refer to matters Paul has spoken of in the first two chapters of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the proper way to understand not only the Bible, but also any kind of writing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose your father writes you a long letter in which he speaks about many things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At a certain point, he may say, If you don t have adequate knowledge, you will not be able to understand these things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The phrase these things certainly refers to all the matters previously mentioned in the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In like manner, the things of man in 2:11 must refer to what Paul has said concerning man in the foregoing verses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The same is true regarding the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By this we can see that 1 Corinthians 1 and 2 give us a revelation, a clear view, of both man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In these chapters we see a picture of man and also of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These two chapters give us simultaneously a portrait of both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1 Corinthians 1 and 2 we have a twofold vision, a vision of the things of God and of the things of man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Have you seen this twofold vision?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Have you seen that within Paul s portrait of man we also have a portrait of God?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Have you seen that as we behold the things of man in these chapters, we see the things of God?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What a marvelous revelation is contained here!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have pointed out that, in principle, both the things of man and the things of God in 2:11 refer to what Paul has already written in this Epistle concerning man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, if we would know the things of man and the things of God, we must consider what Paul covers in these chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>EXAMPLES OF THE THINGS OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1:10-12 Paul speaks of certain things of man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, in verse 10 he says, Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Speaking the same thing is certainly one aspect of the things of man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may think that speaking the same thing is a common, ordinary matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, have you ever seen a group of people who always spoke the same thing?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do you know of even one married couple who truly speak the same thing?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is very difficult for a husband and wife to speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brothers, how often do you and your wife speak the same thing?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1:10 Paul urges all the believers at Corinth to speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This kind of speaking is not an aspect of the life of fallen man, but an aspect of saved people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I read this verse years ago, I shook my head in disbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To me, it was impossible for all the believers in a locality ever to speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Does everyone in the church in your locality speak the same thing?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is a fact that we often speak different things both in the church life and in our married life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Speaking differently is a predominant characteristic of fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The failure to speak the same thing causes many problems both in married life and in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But even though it is common for us to speak different things, the desire of God is that all His saved and redeemed people speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, according to this desire, Paul beseeches the believers at Corinth to speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1:10 Paul goes on to say, That there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here we have divisions, the mind, and opinions, all of which are things of man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here Paul touches the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Often we may not speak differently, but inwardly we hold to different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, a brother may say that sisters should wear a head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although his wife may not say anything, inwardly she may disagree with him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This shows that this brother and his wife are not of the same opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Paul s word in 1:10, we should not only speak the same thing, but also be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We often have different opinions in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For instance, one brother may prefer a smart elder, another brother may prefer one who is gentle, and yet another brother may prefer an elder who is slow and deliberate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This exposes the fact that among these brothers there are different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Such opinions certainly are aspects of the things of man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 1:11 Paul continues, For it was made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of the household of Chloe, that there are strifes among you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The strifes mentioned in this verse are also things of man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In verse 12 Paul goes on to say, Now I mean this, that each one of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here we have the preferences among the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These preferences also are things of man.</S>
