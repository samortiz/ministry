<h2 class="head1">RESTRICTING OUR TEMPER AND WORDS</h2>
<p>Those who take part in the service and bear responsibilities in the church must restrict their temper and their words. A person without a temper is not very useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. Having a temper, however, does not necessarily make one useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. Useful ones are not without a temper, but their temper has been dealt with by the Lord. In order to be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, our temper must be dealt with. A person who does not have a temper is useless, but a person whose temper has not been dealt with is also useless. A person who is never angry or anxious will not be that useful in the service, nor will a person who is quick to become angry or anxious be useful. In order to be useful in the service of the church, a serving one must be capable of getting angry or of being anxious; however, his anger and anxiety must be dealt with. I hope that we will not be those who have a temper but those whose temper has been dealt with.</p>
<p>The temper of all the serving ones, especially of the elders, must be dealt with. The elders bear the responsibility in the church. They must deal with many chaotic things, which can easily provoke them to anger. Every situation is an opportunity for the elders to lose their temper. No one has as many opportunities to lose his temper as the elders. But the elders must not lose their temper. Once an elder loses his temper, his position, weightiness, function, and value are finished. The elders must have a temper, but their temper must be dealt with and restricted. We should not think that the elders do not have a temper. The elders who have a restricted temper can be good elders. The temper of a good elder can be compared to a punctured rubber ball. Although many problems and situations may push him to lose his temper, there should be a &ldquo;hole&rdquo; in him that enables his temper to leak out.</p>
<p>Although such an elder may be provoked by the saints, his anger will quickly dissipate because he has been worked on by the Lord and broken by the cross. As soon as his anger &ldquo;inflates,&rdquo; it &ldquo;deflates.&rdquo; Only such brothers can be elders, and only such brothers are worthy of being elders. This should be the experience not only of the elders but also of the deacons and the serving ones. Our temper must be broken and restricted; otherwise, we cannot serve the church or the Lord.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our words must be restricted. James 3:8 says, &ldquo;The tongue no one among men is able to tame; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison,&rdquo; and verse 2 says, &ldquo;If anyone does not stumble in word, this one is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.&rdquo; Our words are a test to us. They manifest the kind of person we are and often prove how much we have been dealt with and the lessons we have learned before the Lord. If we fear the Lord and live in His presence, we will not be loose with our words. If we have been dealt with and are learning the lessons, we will be restricted in our words. We can speak for the Lord only when we learn to not speak for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. If we cannot learn how to not speak for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, we are not qualified to speak for Him. If our tongue cannot be disciplined by the Spirit, we will not have the utterance of the Spirit, nor will we be used by the Spirit. If our mouth is not restricted by God, we cannot serve Him, and we are not qualified to serve Him.</p>
<p>Solomon says, &ldquo;When there are many words transgression does not cease&rdquo; (Prov. 10:19). In the church there are many people with many matters. If we speak &ldquo;many words,&rdquo; it is inevitable that we will get into trouble. We may unconsciously spread right and wrong, initiate strife, cause the work of the church to suffer loss, and hurt the life of the saints by being inaccurate or false in our speaking. We must be cautious and restricted in our speaking. We should examine whether our words are correct, accurate, and spiritual, and we should examine whether the place and the time of our speaking are fitting and whether the audience is fitting. When we speak, we must be restricted and led by the Lord with regard to the content, the place, the time, and the audience. Otherwise, we will utter &ldquo;many words.&rdquo; This may seem trivial, but it is quite important and worthy of our attention. We must be watchful.</p>
