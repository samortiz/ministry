Let us read Psalm 133: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is/For brothers to dwell in oneness!/It is like the fine oil upon the head/That ran down upon the beard,/Upon Aaron's beard,/That ran down to the hem of his garments;/Like the dew of Hermon /That came down upon the mountains of Zion./For there Jehovah commanded the blessing:/Life forever" (Heb.).</P><P>In this short psalm of three verses, there are four important things expressed by four words: first, oneness; second, oil; third, dew; and fourth, life. The way to practice the church is in these four things: the oneness, the oil, the dew, and the life.</P><P>This psalm is one of fifteen psalms, from Psalm 120 to 134, which are called Songs of Ascent. These are songs chanted by the children of Israel while they were coming together and going up to Mount Zion to worship God. They did this three times a year at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles (Deut. 16:16). Hence, these songs were the songs for their meetings. Even though the church was not in the Old Testament, the people of Israel were a type of the church. In particular, Psalm 133 is related to the way of the practice of the church life.</P><P>In the previous chapter, we saw two things that are crucial to the practice of the church life. One thing is the oneness as the ground of the church life, and the other is Christ as the reality of the church life. We need the ground and the reality as well. If we invite people for dinner, we need a table and also a lot of food. We cannot just serve people a table without the food, nor can we serve people the food without a table. The proper church life is a life of a proper ground, which is the oneness, and of the reality, which is Christ.</P><P>Some have advised me not to talk too much about the ground of the church and to just talk about Christ, the reality. They appreciated the Lord's presence and the reality, but they did not want to speak about the ground of the church. I said to them, "What you appreciate may be likened to tea. You drink the tea, yet you don't appreciate the teacup. It seems that you are saying, `Tea is so nice, but the cup is not good for drinking.' Yes, I know the cup is not good for drinking, but you need a cup to put the tea in. To serve tea, you need the cup as well as the tea. Likewise, to practice the church, we need the ground as well as the reality of the church."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ONENESS</H2><P>I appreciate Psalm 133. Verse 1 says, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is/For brothers to dwell in oneness!" They kept the oneness by coming to the one place appointed, chosen, ordained, by God. No one had the right to set up another place for their coming together to worship God. Their worship to God was kept as one for generations and generations because they kept the ground of oneness.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Life and Way for the Practice of the Church Life &nbsp; pg 57</div><br></body></html>
