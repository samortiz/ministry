   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This building in the divine life is the building of the jasper wall of the holy city, the New Jerusalem, which is not the result of piling a piece of jasper upon another piece of jasper, but the issue of the joining of all the jasper stones by the transforming Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This building is also the building referred to in Ephesians 4:15-16 as the issue of the believers' growing into the Head, Christ, in all things, that is, "all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love."</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now let us mention them briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, in Matthew 16 after the Lord had led us to know Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, He immediately told us that upon this foundation of our knowledge of Him, He would build His church for resisting the gates of Hades vv.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Third, in Romans 12 the apostle exhorted us that we should think so as to be sober-minded concerning ourselves, as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith, that we may be coordinated with all the members as one Body, that is, the building of God vv.</S>
