   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE SECRET OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN PHILIPPIANS Scripture Reading: Phil 1:17, 20; 2:3a, 4, 14, 21; 3:2, 4-8; 4:6a, 11; 1:19-21a; 2:12b-13, 16a; 3:3, 8b-9a; 4:4, 6b, 13, 23</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we consider the secret of experiencing Christ according to the book of Philippians, I would like to say a further word about the secret as seen in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE WORD, FAITH,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 1:13 is a crucial verse: "In whom you also, hearing the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse speaks of hearing the word of truth, of believing in Christ, and of being sealed with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, three things the Word, faith, and the Spirit are implied here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without the Word, there can be no faith, no believing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Faith comes through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we did not have the Bible or the preaching of the gospel, it would not be possible to have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the Bible, Abraham is the father of those who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Galatians 3:8 Paul says, "And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because God preached the gospel to him, Abraham could believe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, had there been no speaking of God, Abraham could not have believed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Faith is the result of God's spoken word infused into those who hear the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From our experience we can testify that if we had not heard the gospel or read the Bible, we could not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the early years of my ministry, I did a great deal of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Often after a meeting, people would come to me for help.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of explaining a lot to them, I preferred to have them read a verse, perhaps John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First I would read the verse aloud and then ask the others to read it one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time, I did not practice pray-reading, but I did know the effectiveness of repeating the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After having the seeking ones repeat a verse, I often asked them to insert their name at the appropriate places.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, I would have them insert their name as we were reading John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through reading the Word in such a way, many received faith and were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Receiving faith through the Word is not a matter of psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the contrary, this has much to do with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Wherever the Word of God is preached, the Spirit of God is present.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus once said, "The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life" John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the light of this verse, we believe that God's Word is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Believing this, we need to present the Word of God to others in a living way, encouraging them not simply to read it with the mind, but to take it in by an exercise of heart and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever the Word is taken in this way, spontaneously something rises up in a person which causes him to believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When faith rises up, the Spirit is present also.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot separate faith from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, faith is a function of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we read the Word in a proper way and the Word is infused into us, it becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then the Spirit functions to produce faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Faith, therefore, is the result of the function of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit enters into our being, especially into our spirit, through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may even say that the Spirit comes in as the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we handle the Word of God rightly, the Word will enter into us and become the Spirit functioning in us to give us faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then in our experience we shall have the hearing of the Word, the believing in Christ, and the receiving of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Preachers of the gospel often use Ephesians 2:5 and 8 to tell people that we are saved by grace through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But many who use these verses in preaching the gospel may not realize that the faith through which we are saved comes from the Word with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Saving faith is produced by the infusion of the living Word with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This kind of faith is not a mere doctrinal faith; it is a living faith that comes from the Word with the Spirit.</S>
