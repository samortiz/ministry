CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.&rdquo;</strong>  Ephesians 5:32</p>
<p>The focus of the Old Testament&mdash;leading to Christ for redemption.</p>
<p>The focus of the New Testament&mdash;the church redeemed and built up in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. ATTITUDE IN READING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>1. TO CONTACT GOD HIMSELF</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;You search the Scriptures...and you are not willing to come to Me [the Lord] that you may have life.&rdquo;</strong>  John 5:39-40</p>
<p>2. TO RECEIVE THE SUPPLY OF LIFE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.&rdquo;</strong> Jeremiah 15:16</p>
<p>3. TO RECEIVE ENLIGHTENMENT</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.&rdquo;</strong>  Psalm 119:130</p>
<p>Therefore, every time you open up the Word of God, you should pray from the depth of your being:</p>
<p>O God, I am coming to read Your Word.<br />
I am coming to You,<br />
to contact Yourself;<br />
my heart longs for You,<br />
my spirit is also open to You,<br />
that I may be enlightened by Your Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE BEST WAY TO READ THE BIBLE&mdash;<br />
PRAY-READING</h2>
<p>Take in the Word of God by means of prayer, letting your reading and your praying be mingled together as one.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition.&rdquo;</strong>  Ephesians 6:17-18a</p>
<p>The best way to pray-read is to practice it together with other saints.</p>
<p>Four Keys:</p>
<p><strong>Quick!</strong> Do not hesitate.</p>
<p><strong>Short!</strong> Do not compose.</p>
<p><strong>Real!</strong> Be genuine, not pretending.</p>
<p><strong>New!</strong> Be fresh, not old.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE PRACTICE<br />
OF READING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>1. READ DAILY</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;They received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily, to see whether these things were so.&rdquo;</strong> Acts 17:11</p>
<p>2. READ CONSECUTIVELY&mdash;read both the Old Testament and the New Testament each time.</p>
<p>3. READ AT MOST ONE CHAPTER AT A TIME (IN PRINCIPLE)</p>
<p>4. LEARN TO PICK UP THE FACTS AND THE MAIN POINTS</p>
<p>5. MEMORIZE THE PRECIOUS VERSES</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom...&rdquo;</strong>  Colossians 3:16a</p>
<p>6. MUSE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate [muse] day and night.&rdquo;</strong>  Psalm 1:2</p>

<p>God has many blessings of life, most of which are received through man&rsquo;s reading of the Bible. Among them the main blessings are:</p>
<p>1. ENLIGHTENMENT</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.&rdquo;</strong>  Psalm 119:105</p>
<p>2. NOURISHMENT</p>

<p>After reading through this lesson, you must be eager to become one who reads the Bible and knows God. If you do not yet have a plan and a life of reading the Bible, we hope that by the grace of the Lord you will make a resolution that from now on you will practice the following:</p>
<p class="indent1">Spend twenty minutes every day in the Word.</p>
<p class="indent1">Read one chapter in the Old Testament and one in the New Testament.</p>
<p class="indent1">Pray-read one verse.</p>
<p>If you would take care of the Bible given by God in this way, in time you will reap the highest blessings of life.</p>
