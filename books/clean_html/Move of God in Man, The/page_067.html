<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. God Having Blended the Body Together</H2><P>First Corinthians 12:24 says that God has blended the Body together. Because of our different characters, dispositions, intentions, and opinions, it is difficult for us to be blended. However, as long as we are in the church life, God blends us. The longer we remain in the church life, the more we will be blended. No one can resist God's blending. God is the most skillful One; therefore, God has a way to blend us. When God is blending, it is difficult for us to resist. This blending is not outward; it is altogether inward. God's blending is God's move in man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Same God Operating All Things in All</H2><P>In the church as the Body of Christ, the same God operates all things in all. First Corinthians 12:6 says, "And there are distinctions of operations, but the same God, who operates all things in all." Quite often I propose things to the elders and co-workers because of God's operation within me. God first is living; then He is moving and working within us every day. We all have experienced God's living, moving, and working within us. This is God's operation. God is busier than we. He is working to blend us and to build up the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. God Being among You (the Church)</H2><P>Eventually, God's moving in us in the building up of the church will have a consummation: whenever we come together, the strangers who come in will see and admit that God is among us (1 Cor. 14:25). This is the outward speaking of the strangers. Actually, we not only have God among us, but we also have God within us. Even our meeting is God's moving in us. This is the building up of the church by God's moving in man. The entire history of the church is a part of the history of God moving in man.</P>
