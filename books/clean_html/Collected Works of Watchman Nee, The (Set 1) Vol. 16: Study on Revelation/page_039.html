THE GREAT SIGN<br>(REVELATION 12:1-6)</H2><P>When a sign is revealed, it causes men to know what will come to pass. Beginning from Revelation 12:1, the apostle John prophesies again because 10:11 says, "You must prophesy again." Following Revelation 11:15-18, we see the situation after the sounding of the seventh trumpet. Hence, Revelation 12:1—22:21 is his prophesying again; it supplements the first section (chapters six through eleven). Chapters six through eleven provide the outline, arranged in sequence, whereas chapters twelve through twenty-two give the details.</P><P>The first section ends with 11:15: "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever." Because it says that the kingdom goes on forever and ever, this section covers all the things through the new heaven and new earth. Hence, this is not speaking about the millennial kingdom. Therefore, we can say that chapters six through eleven cover everything through the new heaven and new earth. Then chapters twelve through twenty-two speak again in detail about all the crucial things in the first section. This is like Genesis 1, which speaks of God's work in six days, while chapter two speaks again about what was done on the sixth day in specific detail. Chapters six through eleven of Revelation are in the principle of Genesis 1, and chapters twelve through twenty-two follow the example of Genesis 2.</P><P>In Revelation 9:1 a great star falls from heaven to the earth. This is the great red dragon in 12:3.</P><P>Chapters twelve through fourteen are written symbolically, chapters fifteen through sixteen are written literally, and chapters seventeen through eighteen are again written symbolically. God's wrath and judgment are never written symbolically; they are always written literally.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 12:1</H2><P>"And a great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars."</P><P>Some people say that the "woman" here refers to the church, but this is not correct because: (1) before the second coming of the Lord, the position of the church before Christ is that of a virgin (2 Cor. 11:2); (2) the church has never been typified as a mother, and it has never had any daughters (names like "mother church" cannot be found in the Bible); and (3) the church is raptured at the end, but this woman is never raptured.</P><P>Some people say that this woman is Mary, but this is also incorrect. (1) How could Mary be depicted by the description in Revelation 12:1? (2) The Lord Jesus was the firstborn Son, but this woman already has other children (12:17). (3) This does not agree with the prophetic nature of this book. If the woman were Mary and the man-child were the Lord, then this description would be historical and would be contrary to the prophetic nature of this book because this book is the revelation of Jesus Christ.</P><P>Who then is this woman? Let us consider a few things. First, every woman (singular in number) in this book refers to a city (17:18; 21:9-10). Second, J.K. Seiss says that the sun refers to the Lord, the moon to the devil, and the twelve stars to the twelve tribes. While it is possible to say that the sun represents the Lord and the twelve stars, the twelve tribes, how can one infer that the moon stands for the devil? Third, Robert Govett says that the sun refers to grace (this is possible), the moon refers to the law (how does he explain this?), and that the stars refer to the twelve tribes (which is correct).</P><P>A third school says that the sun, moon, and stars refer to Christians. Their basis for such an interpretation is 1 Corinthians 15:41. However, the stars in 1 Corinthians 15:41 are general, while the "twelve stars" in Revelation 12:1 are specific.</P><P>Our answer is that the "woman" refers to Jerusalem in the nation of Israel. The reasons for this are:</P><P>(1) By reading Genesis 37:9-10, we immediately know that the sun refers to Jacob, the moon to the mother of Israel, and the twelve stars to the twelve tribes. Explained in this way, we realize that what is described here is the city of Jerusalem, which represents the nation of Israel. (These three, the sun, the moon, and the stars, cannot be explained separately; they have to be viewed together.)</P><P>(2) The one "clothed with the sun" is obviously the mother of Israel. (She is only clothed with the sun; she is not the sun itself.) "The moon [was] underneath her feet." This means that she is being forgotten. "On her head [was] a crown of twelve stars"; these are obviously the twelve tribes (Gen. 37:9-10).</P><P>(3) "Travailing in birth" (12:2). In Isaiah 26:17-18; Jeremiah 6:22-25 (Zion is Jerusalem); 13:19-21; 30:6-7; Micah 4:8-10; and 5:1-3, the prophets clearly say that Jerusalem will suffer a tribulation just as a woman travails in giving birth.</P><P>(4) In Revelation 12:7 the angel, Michael, helps her. Daniel 12:1 clearly says that Michael will rise up to help Israel during the great tribulation.</P><P>(5) This woman typifies Jerusalem in the nation of Israel. God commands her to flee to the wilderness (Rev. 12:6, 14). In Matthew 24:16-20 the Lord expressly says that they would flee. Luke 21:20-24 also states this very clearly.</P>
