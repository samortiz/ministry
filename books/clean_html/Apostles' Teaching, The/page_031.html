<h2 class="head3">The Seven Bowls&mdash;the Third Woe,<br />
the Last Plagues of the Great Tribulation&mdash;<br />
the Negative Contents of the Seventh Trumpet</h2>
<p>We have seen that the contents of the seventh trumpet include the eternal kingdom of God and of Christ and the judgment of the dead. Now we need to see the seven bowls as the negative contents of the seventh trumpet. The seven bowls will be the third woe, the last plagues of the great tribulation (Rev. 11:14, 18a; 15:5-8; 16:1). The first woe is the fifth trumpet, the second woe is the sixth trumpet, and the third woe is the seven bowls of the seventh trumpet. Human words cannot describe how terrible these three woes will be.</p>
<p>The first four bowls are the consummating supernatural calamities to utterly damage men&rsquo;s habitation in the universe (Rev. 16:2-9). The first bowl will be God&rsquo;s further judgment on the earth, causing an evil and malignant sore upon the worshippers of Antichrist (Rev. 16:1-2). The second bowl will be God&rsquo;s further judgment on the sea, causing the sea to become blood and every living soul in the sea to die (Rev. 16:3). The third bowl will be God&rsquo;s further judgment on the rivers and springs, causing them to become blood that men have to drink (Rev. 16:4-7). The fourth bowl will be God&rsquo;s further judgment on the sun causing it to burn men with fire, and men being burned to blaspheme the name of God (Rev. 16:8-9). The fifth bowl will be God&rsquo;s ultimate judgment on the kingdom of Antichrist executed on his throne, causing his kingdom to become darkened and his people to gnaw their tongues for pain and blaspheme God for their sores (Rev. 16:10-11). The sixth bowl will be the damage on the great river Euphrates, causing it to dry up for the preparation of the way for the kings from the rising of the sun for the war at Armageddon (Rev. 16:12 with v. 16). Between the sixth and seventh bowls is the insertion of the preparation for the war at Armageddon.</p>

<h2 class="head1">THE PREPARATION<br />
FOR THE WAR AT ARMAGEDDON</h2>
<p class="indent1">Three unclean demonic spirits like frogs out of the mouths of Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet will go forth to gather the kings of the whole inhabited earth for the war at Armageddon on the great day of God (Rev. 16:13-16). During the gathering of the kings by the three unclean spirits, the Lord will remind the remaining living saints concerning His coming (Rev. 16:15). After this insertion of the preparation for the war at Armageddon is the seventh bowl.</p>

<h2 class="head3">The Seventh Bowl&mdash;the Concluding Plague<br />
of the Great Tribulation</h2>
<p>The seventh bowl will be the concluding plague of the great tribulation: the greatest earthquake and the great hail (Rev. 16:17-21). That earthquake will be the last earthquake in the whole universe and the biggest one. The earthquake will divide the great city&mdash;Jerusalem&mdash;into three parts and the cities of the nations will fall (Rev. 16:19a). Babylon the great (the material city of Rome) will be destroyed (Rev. 16:19b). Every island will flee and mountains will disappear (Rev. 16:20). The great hail (each weighing about one talent&mdash;approximately one hundred pounds) will smite men, and men will blaspheme God (Rev. 16:21).</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Giving of the Reward to the Overcomers, Judged at the Judgment Seat of Christ</h2>
<p>After the seven bowls is the giving of the reward to the overcomers, judged at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10; Rev. 11:18c). Right after the rapture of the majority of the saints, there will be the judgment seat. At the judgment seat, the Lord will give a reward to the overcomers. The marriage of the Lamb in Revelation 19:7-8 should be after the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The War at Armageddon</h2>
<p>After the judgment seat, the giving of the reward, and the marriage of Christ and His overcomers, He will come with His bride from the air to the earth (Matt. 24:27-28) to fight against and defeat Antichrist at the war of Armageddon (Rev. 16:14, 16). The war at Armageddon will be the last war of this age. At Armageddon Christ will tread the great winepress of the fury of God on the evildoers of the earth (Rev. 14:19-20). That war will be a winepress to press all the evildoers. Christ with His bride&mdash;the overcomers&mdash;will fight Antichrist, the ten kings, and their armies and overcome them within one hour (Rev. 17:12-14) to destroy the destroyers of the earth (Rev. 11:18d). Christ will cast Antichrist and his false prophet alive into the lake of fire (Rev. 19:19-20), into which the devil, Satan, whom they follow, will be cast also, to suffer the eternal torment by fire (Rev. 20:10). It is by this war that the nation of Israel with their holy city Jerusalem will be rescued from the siege of Antichrist, and at that time the whole house of Israel will repent to the Lord and be saved by Him (Zech. 12:10-14).</p>
