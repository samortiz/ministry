   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE AGGREGATE OF THE ALL-EMBRACING BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE FULL GOSPEL OF GOD IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FOR THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ACCORDING TO THE DIVINE ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The all-inclusive Spirit, whom the all-inclusive Christ as the threefold seed in humanity has become, is the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God in Christ Gal 3:14 for the divine dispensing according to the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This all-embracing blessing comprises many items.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To know these items is to have a "master key" to open every book of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. The Processed and Resurrected Christ</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Coming Back to His Disciples and Breathing</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Himself as Such a Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>into His Disciples</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the day of His resurrection, the processed and resurrected Christ, who has become the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God, came back to His disciples and breathed Himself as such a life-giving Spirit into His disciples for them to receive as the Holy Spirit to be their life, their person, and their everything John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some who hold a tritheistic concept of the Trinity have opposed us for saying that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, there is a clear word in the Bible that says that the very Christ who is our Redeemer and Savior is now the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit," and 2 Corinthians 3:17a says, "And the Lord is the Spirit," which Spirit is "the Lord Spirit" who transforms us v. 18 . Brother Nee received this light concerning the Spirit almost fifty years ago, and the light we have received in recent years is even stronger and more profound.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today we have the boldness to say that the life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To repeat, on the day of His resurrection, the processed and resurrected Christ, who has become the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God, came back to His disciples and breathed Himself as such a life-giving Spirit into them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 20:22 says, "And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Old Testament the title the Holy Spirit was not used; this title was not used until the beginning of the New Testament, when God was incarnated Matt 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The title the Holy Spirit definitely denotes a person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The use of this title in John 20:22 makes the breathing in that verse different from the breathing in Genesis 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The breathing in Genesis 2:7 was the breathing of a breath, not of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the breathing in John 20:22 is called the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Surely this denotes not merely a breath but a person, the breather Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy Spirit whom we are to receive is the Triune God reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow and also the reaching of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit is the ultimate expression of the Triune God; thus, when we receive the Holy Spirit, we receive the totality of the Triune God.</S>
