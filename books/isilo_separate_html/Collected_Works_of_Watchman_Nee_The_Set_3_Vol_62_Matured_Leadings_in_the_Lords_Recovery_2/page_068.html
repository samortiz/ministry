We should not think that we know more than others. A teaching spirit is a proud spirit. It will only debilitate others' spirits; it will not edify and supply others. Isaiah 50 says we must have a tongue of a learner before we can strengthen the weak with our words (v. 4). We must learn to listen, to fellowship with the Lord in our spirit, and to look to Him for light before we can help others with a suitable word.</p><h2 class="head2">Our Words Must Be Accurate and Full of Supply</h2><p>In visiting others we have to be careful with our words. Our words must be accurate. Many words should be held back, and we should not speak them easily. Often our words are inaccurate because our tongue is untamed. Many of us think that we are only wild in our thinking. Actually, we are wild in our speaking as well. If we apply ourselves to learn this lesson, we will discover that the tongue is just as difficult to bridle as the mind. In 1935 God asked me to do something. He wanted me to learn to be accurate in my speaking. At that time I felt this was very difficult. Within one day I would apologize to others many times. Once my child was filling a tub with water. About eight to ten drops of water spilled onto the floor because his hands were shaking. When I saw this I rebuked him, saying, "How can you wet the whole floor?" After I said this something within me said, "Not even half of the floor is wet. How can you say that he has wet the whole floor?" I had to apologize to my son.</p><p>Many times the Holy Spirit is released through our speaking. But many times death is also released through our speaking. Therefore, never talk about things related to church service when visiting others. If others ask us about a certain elder, we should not answer him directly. Many times such discussions turn into gossip, criticism, and complaints. The result is death. We should learn to be accurate in the words we use in our fellowship. We should only speak words that supply life and should not touch gossip, criticism, and condemnation.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Raising Arguments</h2><p>In visiting the brothers and sisters, we must be careful to not raise any arguments. If brothers and sisters have questions regarding the church, individuals, the truth, or the work, we should not argue with them at all. We visit them because we care for them. We are not there to discuss what is right and what is wrong. If arguments occur in our visitation, it is to no one's benefit. Such arguments will only bring both parties into the darkness of the mind. Therefore, in visiting others, we should avoid arguments. If our spirit is strong enough we will do our best to lead people to touch God in their spirit. In this way, we will avoid many negative problems.</p><h2 class="head1">ARRANGEMENTS CONCERNING VISITATION<br />FOR SHEPHERDING</h2><p>The assignment of visitation should be based on the name lists which are distributed to the various districts. Our visitation should pay much attention to the care of the new ones and to conducting make-up lessons for them. The assignment of visitation in the various districts should be open to changes. If the number of those engaged in visitation in a district is not enough, the church should assign saints from other districts to come to the aid of this district. Church visitation is for making up the lack in district visitations. There are a few kinds of visitations which can come under the description of church visitations.</p><h2 class="head2">Special Visitations</h2><p>Visitation for special occasions includes many things, such as funerals, marriages, moving, changing jobs, starting new jobs, unemployment, sickness, etc. Anything that a man encounters which causes a change in the environment can be considered a special occasion. The most dangerous period that a man faces is in the transitional time when he experiences a change in his environment. The church has to strengthen such a one with visitations. Everyone moving to Hong Kong as well as every visitor should receive proper hospitality. The church has to pay attention to all the needs that accompany changes in the brothers and sisters. If the church can cover this kind of visitation work, it will be strong. But if it does not do anything, nothing will happen.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_067.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_069.html">Next</a> </body></html>
