Being in the Common Fellowship</h2><p>The believers also need to be in the common fellowship of the enjoyment of Christ as the believers&rsquo; common portion for the keeping of the oneness of the Body to witness that Christ is neither divisible nor divided (1 Cor. 1:2, 9-13).</p><h2 class="head3">7. Having the Common Fellowship,<br />Thinking, and Love</h2><p>Another prerequisite is that the believers have the common fellowship in the spirit and have the common thinking and common love in one spirit, with one soul, and on one common standing for the testimony of the oneness of the Body of Christ (Phil. 2:1-2; 1:27). If you have fellowship only in your district, that is not common fellowship but a particular fellowship. The common fellowship is universal. Our fellowship, therefore, must be universal.</p><h2 class="head3">8. Living and Walking by the Spirit</h2><p>Next, the believers should live and walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25) and walk according to the mingled spirit (Rom. 8:4), setting their mind on the mingled spirit, which is indwelt by the pneumatic Christ, the indwelling Spirit, to impart life within them and for them to put to death the practices of the body (Rom. 8:4, 6, 9-13).</p><h2 class="head3">9. Being Conformed to the Death of Christ</h2><p>A further prerequisite for entering into the building is that we be conformed to the death of Christ, to have the self, natural man, flesh, distorted disposition, peculiarities, personal preference and tastes, etc., crucified with Christ by the power of the resurrection of Christ (Phil. 3:10).</p><h2 class="head3">10. Magnifying Christ</h2><p>If we would enter into the building, we need to magnify Christ through living Him by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19-21).</p><h2 class="head3">11. Ministering Christ</h2><p>A further prerequisite is that we minister Christ, dispensing Him, to all contacts.</p><h2 class="head3">12. Discerning the Spirit from the Soul</h2><p>We need to discern the spirit, which is of power, love, and sobermindedness, from the soul (Heb. 4:12; 2 Tim. 1:7). All these twelve points are prerequisites for us to be built up together.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Builders of the Divine Building</h2><p>At this juncture we need to go on to consider the builders of the divine building. Some may think that Christ alone builds the church. However, the New Testament reveals that although Christ surely is building the church, He is not the only builder of the divine building.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Christ the Head</h2><p>The first builder is Christ the Head, who speaks the words of God, imparts the divine life, and gives the Spirit without measure (Matt. 16:18; John 3:34). Unless we have enjoyed the impartation of the divine life and have received the Spirit without measure, we can have no part in the divine building, for the Lord Jesus cannot build us into the divine building. Yes, the Lord is building the church, but we must be those who are listening to His word, partaking of His divine life, and sharing His immeasurable Spirit, that is, sharing His Spirit immeasurably.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Gifted Persons</h2><p>The gifted persons, especially the apostles and the prophets, perfect the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-12).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
