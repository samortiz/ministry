   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>My burden in this message concerns the need of the blending.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Even among us who are in the recovery, not many have the realization that we need the blending, and we need it desperately.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The heavy burden in the ministry that is on my heart and in my spirit is the matter of blending.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the past three months, I offered to the Lord many prayers, asking Him to do something in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the present time, there are more than sixteen hundred local churches established by the Lord in all the six continents.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I receive letters from abroad quite often telling me of the situation in different places around the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As I look at the whole situation of the recovery, seemingly it is quite encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Apparently, the churches are going on well and are flourishing, increasing, and growing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the more I know this and the more I feel encouraged, the deeper I am burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It seems that the Lord within me is saying, "Is this all that I want?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you believe that My Body can be built up in the common situation that is among us today?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is the present situation satisfactory for Me to go on?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I feel deeply that it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After I had remained in the United States and had spoken for the Lord for a little over thirteen years, we moved from Los Angeles to Anaheim and we changed the way of practicing the Lord's recovery somewhat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some people say that beginning from that time, my speaking changed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They say that after the move to Anaheim, my speaking was not as powerful as in the previous thirteen years, from 1962 to 1974.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the people who say this do not know the burden that I received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the first period of my ministry in this country, I traveled to many places to hold meetings and to speak mainly on the experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I agree that my ministry at that time was rich and powerful and full of impact.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when we were flourishing in Los Angeles, we felt that we needed to move to a new place, and we came to Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From that time I received a burden to change from always holding conferences to conducting semiannual trainings to get into the life-study of His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although I had given message after message, still the Word, the holy Scriptures, had not been opened up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the long run there was the need for the opening up of the holy Word so that people could see the life in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, each year for the past twenty-one years I have conducted two annual trainings lasting ten days each.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the present time nearly the entire Bible has been finished; only a few books remain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the Lord wills, perhaps by the end of 1995, we will finish the entire life-study of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have received many letters from people who appreciate all the truths that have been opened up to the church from the life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They have reached many people on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are the riches kept in storage in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever you desire to know a particular truth in Genesis, you can simply open the life-study, and you will taste how sweet, how enlightening, how supplying, and how nourishing it is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In approximately 1980 I began to see the truth of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To open up the entire Bible from the first page to the last is needed, but what is the central matter in the Holy Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This central matter is the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The economy of God is for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After seeing this, I checked with myself, "Where is the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You have opened the Bible book by book to the saints, and there are more than sixteen hundred local churches raised up on this earth, but where is the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You have the churches, but where can you see the Body?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because of this, I became burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I said, "Lord, I must confess to You and admit that although I saw the Body of Christ and I preached and taught the Body of Christ for years, even I myself am not very much in the reality of the Body of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I was confessing my dullness and shortcomings to the Lord concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, the present burden has come to me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You should not pay so much attention to the spreading of the recovery, to the increase of the churches, and to the good meetings of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You must realize that there is a great lack, a shortage, that is, the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is for this reason that there is a need for the blending.</S>
