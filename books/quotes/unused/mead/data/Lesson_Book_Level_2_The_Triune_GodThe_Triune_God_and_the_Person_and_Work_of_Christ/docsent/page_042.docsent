   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DIED AS GOD A. For an Eternal Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet if Jesus were only a sinless man, we would still have a great problem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His death would be good for only one man; in fact, it would be good for only one sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let us explain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God requires man to die because of sin even one sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose in your entire life you committed only one sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a sinless man, Jesus could die as a substitute for that sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if you were to sin again you would have to die for that second sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Well, you know that you have sinned more than once in your life!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How could one man, Jesus, die for all your sins and for all the sins of mankind?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And how could it work for us two thousand years after His death?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have pointed out before that although Christ became a man, He was still God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was a genuine man, yet also the complete God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His being God added an eternal element to His redeeming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hebrews 9:14 says that the Lord offered Himself up through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has accomplished an eternal redemption for us Heb 9:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now Jesus' blood is effective for all men of all times.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It can cleanse every sin of every man on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. To Give Eternal Life</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But redemption alone is not the goal of the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His ultimate goal is to dispense His divine life into man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the aspect of Christ's death as the grain of wheat, which we saw earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who could give man the eternal, divine life except God Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the second reason why Christ had to be God: only God could release the divine life into man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Praise the Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the unique God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No one could do what He did for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a man without sin, He was qualified to shed His blood for us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As God, He has made His death eternally effective.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has accomplished an eternal redemption and He has released the divine life of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>HERESIES CONCERNING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are clear about the previous points, we will realize how seriously wrong it is to say that Christ was not a real man or that He was not God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If either is true, then Christ's redemptive work would be utterly annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We would all perish.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet, as absurd as it is, there have been people throughout Christian history who have taught such heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even today some say that Christ was God but not really a man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If that were true, then Christ could not shed human blood for man's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Others say that Christ was a man but not God, and that He died merely as a martyr.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If that were true, His death would not be eternally effective and He could never put God's life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Still others say that Christ was neither God nor man but a third kind of being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is as ridiculous as the other teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible never gives any ground for such heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By now you should be very clear that the Lord Jesus was fully God and fully man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was the complete God and a genuine man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His death was the accomplishment of redemption for all mankind.</S>
