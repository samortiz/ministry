Lord, we do feel that we are not competent to minister before You in such a matter, so we do trust in You for all the need
In these few chapters we will be able to see only some practical principles concerning the church without getting into many details
Many passages in the New Testament tell us that this purpose was purposed not only in Christ but also for Christ
It is an eternal matter in the eternal purpose of God, and it is the center, the subject of God's eternal plan
The intention, the desire, of God is not to have heaven, not to have the earth, and not to have many different items
The church is the central thought of God's intention, but before the New Testament time God never told anyone about this
Please remember that the heavens are not only for the glory of God to be manifested but also as a preparation for Christ to have the church
The heavens, the earth, and all things are for the church, but before the New Testament time God never told this to anyone
One day the Lord came, and He died, resurrected, ascended, came down as the Holy Spirit, and raised up a number of persons
The church was a mystery hidden in God in the past generations until in the New Testament time it was revealed to the apostles and prophets
Whenever you meet the Brethren and talk with them, they may tell you that the church is the Body of Christ and the house of God
If a person were to grow one hundred times larger than he is now, he would still be the same person, but in an increased and enlarged way
Verses 27-29 say, 'John answered and said, A man cannot receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven
While he was sleeping, God opened Adam's side, took a rib out of him, and made this rib into a woman as a bride to match this bachelor
One day God caused Christ to sleep on the cross, and while Christ slept there, God opened Christ, and something came out of Christ
It is to produce all the members of the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is a bride to match Christ as His increase
The universe is for the human race, the human race is for the church, and the church is the increase of Christ
It is by means of a person's body that he can speak, walk, demonstrate his wisdom and knowledge, and do many things
In these days we are endeavoring to publish a little magazine entitled The Stream and we will now publish some more messages in booklet form
Now we know what the source, the nature, and the essence of the church are and what the function of the church is
If we look at it as a whole, it is a body, but if we look at it as the parts, there are many, yet the parts are still one body
All the local churches throughout the generations and in all the places are the members composed together as one universal church
Nineteen hundred years ago there was one in Jerusalem one in Samaria one in Antioch one in Corinth one in Ephesus and another one in Rome
The universal church is an issue of all the local churches throughout all the generations and throughout all the places
All these local churches throughout all the generations and places, added and composed together as one, are called the universal church
It is universal as a whole and local in its parts, and all these parts added together and composed as one, are the Body of Christ
In the New Testament there are twenty-seven books, including the twenty-one Epistles plus the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3
The church is something of God's eternal purpose, something planned, purposed, by God in eternity past and for eternity to come
If we have the revelation from the Word of God, we will realize that the church is the center of God's eternal purpose
The church is something out of Christ Himself and a part of Christ Himself as His increase and as a counterpart to match Him
The church is something real and is very substantial; it is not something 'in the air' or merely a theory in our mind
It is something composed of all the redeemed believers in the New Testament time built together with the Triune God
Is there a verse in the twenty-eight chapters of Matthew, for example, to prove that the church today is in heaven?
In Acts 2:34, when Peter stood up to speak on the day of Pentecost, he said that David had not ascended into heaven
The spirits and souls of all the dead saints, both from the Old Testament time and the New Testament time, are in Paradise and not in heaven
There was one in Ephesus, one in Smyrna, one in Pergamos, one in Thyatira, one in Sardis, one in Philadelphia, and one in Laodicea
We must come to a city within human society to gain the materials from human society for the building up of the church
We do not belong to the satanic system of this world, and we are separated from it, yet we still remain here and live here
The great commission committed to the church by the Lord is that the church must bring the Lord as the gospel to human beings
We have been committed to preach Christ as the gospel to people, so the church must be expressed among people on this earth
God has His eternal purpose, and He must do something to accomplish His purpose on this earth through the church
We may not realize how much damage is done when people say, 'Since the church is heavenly, it must be carried out in heaven'
To have two city halls in New York because it is so big means that we divide the one New York City into two cities
On one day the apostles baptized three thousand people, and on another day five thousand were saved and baptized
He did not pray and bless the loaves and then distribute them in a messy way to let the people fight over them
For the one hundred twenty disciples in Acts to take care of three thousand or five thousand on one day was not very difficult
We should not ask people there what kind of church they have, just as we cannot ask them what kind of moon they have
The church is expressed on this earth in localities, and where there is an expression of the church, that expression must be one
Another believer, who was distributing tracts to the riders on the car, came to them and realized that they were brothers
One of the oldest among them told him, 'We belong to the church to which you, Paul, Peter, Martin Luther, and all the saints belong'
We must remember well that the content of the church cannot be and should not be anything other than the Lord Christ Himself
If one of us today were to go there, they might tell us not to come back until we cut our hair and change our shoes
We may keep all things, and we may lay all things aside, but we insist on Christ as the center and as everything
The elders are the ones who take the responsibility to care for the church, and the deacons are the ones who serve the church
To be an elder, a person has to be broken, broad-minded, full of Christ, humble in the spirit, and patient in the spirit
He must also have some amount of spiritual knowledge, and he must be filled with God as love and saturated by the Spirit as wisdom
The first brother came to the church in Shanghai first and after a certain time the second brother was brought in through the first brother
When it came time for the church to establish elders, the second brother was established as an elder, and the first one was not
From that time onward, the first brother complained and asked why the second had become an elder, and he, the first, had not
Corinthians 11 tells us that God is the head of Christ, Christ is the head of every man, and man is the head of the woman
He must be suppressed and put down, and he must learn the lessons to be broken, to be humble, and to be patient
Especially today in the twentieth century, throughout the whole world the human race is inclining toward independence
Even the children want to be independent of their parents, and the students want to be independent of their teachers and school
On the way to Jerusalem as the Lord was going to be crucified, the disciples argued about who was the greatest
The expression of the church, the content of the church, and the order of the church are the three most practical matters in the church life
Before the New Testament time, it was never revealed to anyone but was hidden as a mystery in God, who created the universe
The practice of the church is local, not universal, it is expressed in localities, its content is Christ, and it has a proper order
The proper order of the church is seen in Philippians 1:1, which speaks of the saints, the overseers, who are the elders, and the deacons
As long as there is a body there must be authority, and as long as we have a family, a home, there also must be authority
In order to keep a right order in the church and among the saints, we must be under the lordship and headship of the Lord
The more you submit yourself to the headship of the Lord, the more you are qualified and equipped to be an elder'
Ephesians 5 tells the wives to submit to their husbands, but it tells the husbands to love their wives, not to rule over them
If we want to practice the church life, we have to learn the lesson of always submitting ourselves to the headship of the Lord
If our relationship is wrong with the Head, we will be wrong with the Body, and to be sure, we will be wrong with the other members
If we are not under the headship, we have no ground to say anything to the brothers and sisters in an adjusting way
To not submit to the headship of the Lord and yet say something to the brothers and sisters simply means that we are rebellious
We must realize that if we are going to practice the real church life, we must submit ourselves under the headship of Christ
If we are under the headship of Christ, we will have a pure motive and a right attitude, even if we speak very frankly
If we are not under the headship of Christ and simply pretend to be nice, we are being political; we are playing politics among the saints
They simply knelt and bowed down before the Lord, taking the Lord as the Head, realizing His headship, and letting Him come in
The best way to glorify Christ and honor the Lord is to take Him as the Head, praying, 'Lord, You are the Head
In the church, if we all realize the headship of Christ, there will spontaneously be a wonderful, spiritual order among us
There will be a situation in which each one knows where he stands and what is his right position in the order of the church
In such a family, even the youngest one will know what his position and standing is, and each one will be right with the order of the family
There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus'
Galatians 3 says we have been baptized into Christ, while 1 Corinthians 12 says we have been baptized into the one Body
In Christ, the problem of male and female has been done away with, but in the church there is still male and female
In the church, while the racial problem and social problem are gone, the problem of male and female still remains
If each of us submits ourself to the headship of Christ and takes His lordship in a real way, there will be no problem
If there is a problem between brothers or sisters, that means there is a problem between us and Christ the Head
It is possible for us to realize the real church life only when we realize the headship of the Lord in a practical way
We are not going to organize something among the Christians, and we have no intention to set up a church of another kind
The real church life requires that we know how to exercise ourselves to apply Christ as our life and realize His headship among us
Although there is not such a word as charter in the New Testament, there may not be another word to express this aspect of the church
Christ accomplished His work on the cross, Christ brought the church into being through the cross, and the church brings in the kingdom
Without Christ there is no source of the church, and without the cross there is no means for the church to be brought into being
Christ brought all negative things, including sin, sins, the soul, the flesh, the self, Satan, the evil world, and death, to the cross
When foreigners come into this country, they must first pass a checkpoint so that everything they have can be examined
He must check, 'Is my flesh, my self, my personal desire, my will, my mind, my idea, and my thought on the cross'?
If we ask the brothers in this way, they will realize in their conscience that they have not passed through the cross
In order to check with people in this way, we must first check whether we ourselves have passed through the cross
He replied, 'Brother Lee, do you think that you are in the spirit and have passed through the cross to check with me'?
For us all to take Christ as life and to take nothing else is a wonderful rule, regulation, and bylaw for the church
We must be careful to check whether or not we are according to this regulation of the spiritual charter of the church
We are a group of persons who are saved regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit coming together to experience Christ in a corporate way
A history of the creeds of the church, containing all the different creeds since the apostolic fathers, requires several large volumes
One aspect of the Holy Spirit in this age, or dispensation, of grace is illustrated in the holy Scriptures by the rain from heaven
We may be right in everything, but we may be short of one thing; we may be short of the Holy Spirit with the anointing
We not only love Him, but we respect Him as the Head, and we are under the headship, the authority, of the Head
Whatever we do, practice, and suggest in the church must be checked as to whether it is under the headship of Christ
In 1948 we had some conference meetings with several hundred people, and for the first few days she would offer a living prayer every night
Sister Nee's prayer was nice, living, bold, and strong, but all the leading ones felt that it did not fit the need
If some brothers and sisters insist upon baptism by immersion, and others insist on baptism by sprinkling, they will fight
Others can take the same attitude, and we can kneel down before the Lord and pray, 'Lord, what do You lead us to do'?
Many dear, lovely brothers and sisters may not feel happy if someone speaks in tongues in the meeting, so that person must be general
If someone speaks to oppose the Lord Jesus, we must stand and fight their speaking, but with all other things we must be general
If we insist on opposing speaking in tongues, we are wrong, and if we insist on speaking in tongues, we are also wrong
We do not take the way of the denominations, such as the Mennonites, the Brethren, the Methodists, or any other kind
We should not do things according to our past experience, and we should not make decisions according to our background or past knowledge
If we like something, it may be that the Lord does not like it, or if we do not like something, perhaps the Lord does like it
If we do this, the Lord will go a long way among us, and many wonderful things will come out because we have paved a free way for the Lord
There is a great difference between the way people practice Christian churches today and the record of the churches in the book of Acts
Today people practice to have rules, regulations, creeds, and an outward charter, but in Acts we cannot find such things
The first local church, the first expression of the church, came into being through the prayer of the one hundred twenty for ten days
To keep the teaching of the apostles is to keep the teaching of the Lord, because the teaching of the apostles is the teaching of the Lord
At that time, they did not take the Lord's word in the way of theory; rather, they learned the Lord's word in a practical way
They did not study theology, but they learned how to follow the Lord, how to have a daily life in a new way, and how to have a church life
What they had was a living God, and they brought all things to this living God; they brought all their problems to this living Lord
If we are going to practice the real church life, we must learn how to pray in a practical, prevailing, living, and fresh way
A praying member is a functioning member, but if a member does not have a prayer life, he can never be a functioning member
If we are going to have a real church life, we must learn how to have a prayer life and even pray with fasting
We must learn to pray, and we must learn how to pray in a corporate way, as the church coming together, as a part of the church life
The service of a leading one, an elder, a deacon, or a serving one in the church, is firstly a matter of prayer
It is hard enough to pray by ourselves, but to ask all the leading ones and serving ones to come together to pray is more difficult
Everyone comes trying to convince others, having the intention, desire, and hope to push something each feels is important
If we open the door to merely discuss the church life, we open the door to let the enemy come in and bring in many opinions and thoughts
If we are going to learn to pray with others in such a way, we must first give up our self and our own thoughts
We must pray each day until we all see the same thing and have the same inner anointing and the same assurance
One of the largest cities in China, with a population of more than one million, was a big field for the Lord's work with much potential
The church there did not have any improvement for a number of years, and the news of their troubles and problems always came to us
Forget this way and come to the Lord in a new way to pray, to let the Lord come in, and to let Him speak something
On the one hand, before we come to practice the church life, we first must read the Scriptures and many spiritual teachings
We should know how the Methodists, Presbyterians, Baptists, Anglicans, Lutherans, and others practice the church
We should also know the way practiced in the Epistles and taught in The Normal Christian Church Life and other proper writings
On the other hand, however, in order to practice the church life in a living and prevailing way, we must not depend on all those teachings
We need the freshness, newness, impact, life, anointing, power, and authority, and there is no other way to have this but by prayer
Many times people have a formula which they bring to the Lord and ask Him to carry it out according to their own way
Whenever there is a problem or a need, we may declare a fast among the whole church, whether for one meal or for a whole day
There is no other way to solve the problems, to have the Lord's guidance, and to bring the Lord's people into spiritual reality
For many years even up until this day, the elders in the church in Taipei have come together a number of times each week
Only one such time is to take care of the saints' affairs; all the rest are simply to pray, mostly early in the morning
The Lord told us clearly that He would build His church and that the gates of Hades would not prevail against it
In order to have a prayer life, especially a corporate prayer life, the prayer life of the church, we must learn to consecrate ourselves
In our prayer we should not 'take a car' to drive among the situations; we should rather 'take the airplane' and fly above them
The leading ones especially must pray much, even more than others, and they must help others to have a real prayer life
In some denominations, it is possible that only three people come to the prayer meeting: the pastor, his wife, and the custodian
If we cannot get through, we should fast, and we may even need to spend a night without sleep in order to pray through
We should not forget how the disciples came to the Lord concerning an epileptic demon, asking, 'Why were we not able to cast it out'?
May the Lord impress us, more than with any other matter, that we must go to Him to pray for the practice of the church life
On the positive side, it was so that man would express God, and on the negative side, it was to deal with the enemy of God
The two aspects of the divine commission of the church are to express God in Christ through the Spirit and to deal with the enemy of God
The purpose of the messages in this book is not to help us merely to know some truths, doctrines, or teachings
If we read Ephesians again with this point of view, we will see that the entire book can be summarized by these two aspects
If we are not in the reality of the Body life, we have no ground to fight the battle; we have been defeated already
The ground and standing for us to fight the enemy is the church, and the church is in Christ, in the Spirit, and in the heavenlies
Why is spiritual warfare in the last chapter of Ephesians and not in the first, the second, or even the fifth chapter?
We also must realize that spiritual warfare is not a fighting against humans, that is, against flesh and blood
In the past years and even up until today, it is difficult to say how many rumors the enemy has been constantly spreading
Truth here does not refer to the doctrine of the word of God, because the word is related to the sword in verse 17
If we do not have truth, but rather everything in the church is false, we lose our girding up, and we can never be strengthened
In order to maintain truth, sincerity, faithfulness, and reality among the saints, we must do everything in a real way
If we want to realize the church by the grace and mercy of God, we must speak truthfully and faithfully to the brothers
We should not tell a brother that nothing is wrong and then turn around and say something different to someone else
The gospel is a good pair of shoes to protect our Christian 'feet' from being dirtied and hurt by the earthly touch
Wherever we go, we should tell people that we are Christians and that they must believe into Christ Jesus as the Lord
If for example we see certain things in the church we should not talk to one another as if reporting news providing material to gossip about
The more we know something about the church, the more we need to bring it to the Lord, to touch the throne by our prevailing prayer
If we are properly realizing the church life, we will stop all gossiping and be prevailing, living, active, and positive in prayer
We must take the ground and standing of the church, identify with the heavenly Head, and pray in a prevailing way for the church
The only thing we must do is to bring this matter to the Head and pray, 'Lord, be merciful to us and be merciful to that brother
By praying in this way, we will be those standing in the opening to shut the way for the enemy to come in to attack and damage the Body
We are not dealing with mere humans; we are dealing with the evil forces of darkness, the kingdom of the enemy
We must also learn how to exercise in the word in the spirit in a living way, and we must learn how to pray and petition
We will learn all the lessons spontaneously, and there will be no need for others to teach and direct us; we will be directed already
