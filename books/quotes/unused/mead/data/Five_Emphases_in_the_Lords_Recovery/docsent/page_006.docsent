   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second emphasis in the Lord's recovery is a wonderful person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is the central subject of the Bible, and His riches are unsearchable Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter I would like to present a living biography of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first point in the biography of Christ is in John 1:1: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is the Word of God, and the Word is God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Word, who is Christ, is the One who was, who is, and who is coming Rev 1:4b .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is all three tenses past, present, and future, because He is the same yesterday, today, and forever Heb 13:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the past He is Christ; in the present He is Christ; and in the future He is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ was the Word in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"In the beginning" in John 1:1 refers to eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ was in the beginning without any beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the first item of Christ's biography.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is not only the Word of God but also the Word who was God in eternity past without any beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ as the Word of God is the speaking of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the explanation, definition, and the content of our unlimited God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, Colossians 1:15 tells us that this Christ is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is not only the definition and content of our God but also the image and expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is invisible, yet this invisible God has an image.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hebrews 1:3 says that Christ is the effulgence of God's glory and the impress of His substance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the second item of the biography of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>MAN CREATED IN GOD'S IMAGE TO RECEIVE THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the beginning of time and in the creation, God created man in His own image Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since Christ is the image of God, we were created in the image of Christ, who is God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A photo is the image of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because we were made in the image of Christ, we are photos of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the third point of the biography of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Genesis 2 man as the photo of Christ was put before the tree of life v. 9 . Also before man was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the tree of death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Genesis 2:17 says, "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There were two trees in front of man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If he ate the tree of life, surely he would get life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If he ate the other tree, he would become dead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, man as the photo of Christ has two destinies life or death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man has these two choices.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Adam and Eve heard God's explanation about the two trees, the subtle one, the serpent, was crouching there, waiting for an opportunity to poison them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He put a doubt, a question mark, into Eve when he asked her, "Hath God said...?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Gen 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A question mark is shaped like a snake standing upright.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every doubt and question about what God says is the snake, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The woman was caught when she began to talk to the serpent, the subtle one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She should not have talked with him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, she should have referred the serpent to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then she would have had protection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, she boldly answered the serpent's question and got caught.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She did not take the fruit of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead, she took the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and received death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The knowledge of good and evil, right and wrong, issues in death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whatever we do apart from Christ as life issues in death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To love people apart from Christ is death; to hate people apart from Christ is death; and to be neutral apart from Christ is death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To do anything apart from Christ is death, and not doing anything apart from Christ is also death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only He is the tree of life.</S>
