However, we should not do this in a legal way as if we were using a textbook: first, lesson one, then lesson two, and so forth. First, we must be released. We must have a spirit that is very free and which can sense the feelings of others. Then when we come to the new ones to have a home meeting in their home, we should not have a subject that we have already decided to cover. That will kill the meeting. We can sing, pray, or praise to make ourselves so released and also to release others. By this, the new ones will open up to us and say something. By listening to them, we can sense their feelings about their situation. Then we can speak something to them that is according to their need.<p>A new one may say, &#8220;In these two days since my baptism, I have not had any peace within.&#8221; What should you say? If you were to say something concerning consecration because you had prepared this subject for the meeting, that would not fit and would not meet this new one&#8217;s need. You must follow the spirit to speak something to this one. It is best not to speak something too quickly, but first ask him why he did not have peace within for these two days. There must be some reason. In his answer you may find out the cause of his problem. He might say that after he was baptized, he began to think of his father and of what his father might feel concerning his becoming a Christian. Now you know the cause of his being troubled and can speak something to meet his need.<p>Sometimes you need to ask the new ones a question in order to find out something, but do not ask too many questions. It is better to solve one question at a time. This new one is troubled when he considers his father; he may feel that his father might rebuke him or reject him. Your answer will depend upon your learning, your knowledge. You may use Acts 16:31: &#8220;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household.&#8221; You can read this verse to him and tell him, &#8220;This is a great promise to the believers. All believers have the right to expect that their whole family will be saved. You do not need to worry about your father; you have to believe the Lord&#8217;s Word. Sooner or later your father will be saved.&#8221; In this way you can strengthen him.<h2 class=head1>FOUR CRUCIAL PRACTICES OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2><p>Four crucial practices of the Christian life are reading the Bible, praying always, keeping morning watch, and attending the meetings. It would be marvelous if we could cover these four crucial practices in two home meetings.<h2 class=head2>Reading the Bible</h2><p>Although you may have strengthened and encouraged a new one, this alone is not adequate. You still have to grasp the time to go further, to speak something more. You should not go to a home meeting with a prepared subject, but you must have a purpose. To have a purpose in going to a home meeting is different from making a decision as to what you are going to speak. If you are going to visit a man who was baptized only two days ago, you must have a burden, a purpose, to feed, or nourish, him. You may say, &#8220;This verse, Acts 16:31, is very good and comforting. The Word is straight and pure. We Christians should know the verses in the Bible, so we need to read the Bible. From the first day that we believe in the Lord Jesus, we must pick up the practice of reading the Bible. Second Timothy 3:15-16 says, &#8216;From a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation....All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.&#8217;&#8221; Then you can fellowship with him and charge him to set aside some time to read the Bible every day.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise and Practice of the God-Ordained Way &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
