   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Concerning the Value of Justice</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Job 22:23-28 says, "If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up./If you put injustice far away from your tents,/And place your gold nuggets in the dust/And your gold of Ophir in the stones of the brooks,/Then the Almighty will be your gold nuggets/And precious silver to you./For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty,/And you will lift up your countenance to God./You will pray to Him, and He will hear you;/And you will repay your vows./You will also decree something, and it will be established for you;/And light will shine on your ways."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everything from verse 24 on is based on verse 23.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The gold nuggets, the gold of Ophir, and the precious silver are all related to the injustice spoken of in verse 23.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A man places gold nuggets, the gold of Ophir, and precious silver in the dust and in the stones of the brooks for the sake of dealing with injustice and for the sake of delighting oneself in the Almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here again we have a change in valuation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are tested at such a critical juncture, and we are asked to choose between gold nuggets, the gold of Ophir, the precious silver, and Jehovah, which one will we choose?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a choice will separate those who are God's from those who are not His.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All those who belong to God will surely choose Jehovah as their delight.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They will be able to lift up their countenance to God and will be blessed by God in three things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, their prayers will be heard.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who prefer gold nuggets, gold of Ophir, and precious silver will find that their prayers are not heard.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second, whatever they decree will be established for them because the Lord Jehovah will delight in their choice and decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Third, light will shine on their ways.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every step of their way will be filled with light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the result of a change in the concept of value with those who turn to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sooner or later we have to help a new believer get out of his old realm; we have to rescue him out of his own concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When a situation arises, we have to ask him, "What would you choose?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to help him to choose God's justice and to reject the gold nuggets, the gold of Ophir, and the precious silver.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The value of justice is more than any treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Between the Enjoyment of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>and the Unseen Reward</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hebrews 11:24-26 speaks of a change in concept of enjoyment and suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moses saw the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He saw that all the enjoyment of Egypt was but enjoyment of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He considered it great riches to suffer together with the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was well qualified to have the enjoyment of sin because he was the son of Pharaoh's daughter, the richest and most powerful person on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, considering the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was very clear about this change in valuation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was willing to suffer all reproaches and hardships because he saw the significance of that unseen, great reward.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Between the Knowledge of Christ and All Things</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Philippians 3:7-8 says, "But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here we see that Paul also had a change in his concept of value.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What things were gains to him, these he counted as loss on account of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why was Paul able to reject the things that were gains to him?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was able to consider them as loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He reckoned the Christ whom God had anointed as Lord, as King, and as the most excellent One.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For His sake he suffered the loss of all things and counted them as refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the kind of change in valuation that happens to a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>BRINGING OUT THE PRECIOUS FROM THE WORTHLESS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>TO BE AS GOD'S MOUTH</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Finally, we want to conclude with the words of Jeremiah 15:19 which tell us that if we bring out the precious from the worthless, we will be as God's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we cannot tell the proper value of things, God will reject us and cast us aside.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He requires that we bring out the precious from the worthless so that we can be His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to see the importance of such a change in concept of value.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May the Lord grant us the light to have a thorough change in our concept of value so that we will know to choose the most excellent portion.</S>
