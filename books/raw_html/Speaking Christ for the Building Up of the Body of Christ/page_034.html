 <h2 class="head1">AVOIDING MENTIONING PEOPLE&rsquo;S NAMES<br />
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE</h2>
<p>We need to avoid mentioning people&rsquo;s names as much as possible in the meeting. Unless it is necessary for some reason, it is much better not to relate negative stories. If it is really needed, we may refer to negative stories, but it is altogether wrong to mention people&rsquo;s names. Even in giving a positive story or testimony concerning a certain person or persons, it is also wise not to mention their names, if possible, that we may stay away from exalting people and from making mistakes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING LIBERAL AND WRONG INTERPRETATIONS<br />
OF THE HOLY WORD</h2>
<p>We should also avoid liberal and wrong interpretations of the holy Word. In our speaking, especially in public meetings, when we interpret any part of the holy Word, either a single word, a phrase, a clause, a sentence, a paragraph, a chapter, or a book, we must not take the liberal way as some of the liberal translations. Also we must do our best to avoid wrong, erroneous, and mistaken definitions and significances.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING SPEAKING<br />
A NUMBER OF UNRELATED POINTS<br />
WITHOUT A SUBSTANTIAL EMPHASIS</h2>
<p>Whenever we speak in the meetings, we must avoid speaking a number of unrelated points without a substantial emphasis. There was a dear brother among us in the church in Shanghai about fifty years ago. Whenever he spoke, he had many good points. However, one of the elders in the church said, &ldquo;Every sentence that this brother speaks is a treasure, but when these sentences are put together, they mean nothing.&rdquo; We must always try to speak with some definite emphasis; otherwise, our speaking will be minimized.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING ANY KIND OF DEBATE, ARGUMENT,<br />
 OR DEPRECIATION OF OTHERS&rsquo; SPEAKING</h2>
<p>We should never debate, argue, or depreciate others&rsquo; speaking in the meetings. People do have a tendency to debate with others. There was one brother among us who was strong in his opinion. If the fellowship was to &ldquo;go west,&rdquo; he would go &ldquo;east.&rdquo; When we dealt with this brother, we exercised much wisdom. If we intended to go west, we would say we needed to go east. He would disagree with this and say that we needed to go west. Then we would go west. This brother just liked to go contrary to whatever anyone else felt. Some of us may be in this category of liking to debate or argue. If the opportunity arises in a meeting, some may say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you, brother.&rdquo; That kills the entire meeting. To have a living Christian meeting, we must avoid any kind of debate or argument. We should also not belittle anyone or depreciate others&rsquo; speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: What is the difference between reading something in the meeting and speaking it?</em></p>
<p>Too much analysis of this matter does not help. We need to endeavor in a simple way not merely to read but to speak. By our practice we will learn how to speak the hymns or perhaps to speak something from the printed publications of the ministry. We should not analyze what it is to speak, talk, read, or declare something in the meetings. All these things are very close. Speaking the printed material is very close to reading and declaring. But there is a difference. Reading is more according to the letter, while speaking is more free, automatic, and spontaneous. Often you may not speak exactly what is printed. You can add a few words which do not affect the meaning. We need to practice speaking so that we can enter into the full reality of the new way in our meeting life. The more that we practice speaking, the more we will learn.</p>
<p>How much better the meetings in the new way are than the old message meetings depends upon our practice. Our practice in the meetings may be compared to a basketball game. If you put a basketball in my hands, I could not play well with it. But if you give the same ball to five trained players, they will play in a skillful way. To play ball we need certain skills; without learning them we can never function skillfully. The success of the game depends on the players. Christianity, however, has annulled the function of the members of Christ by building up one speaker as the &ldquo;coach&rdquo; to &ldquo;play ball&rdquo; by himself.</p>
<p>To meet together in the biblical way should be easier today than at the apostles&rsquo; time. At the time of the apostles the believers did not yet have the completed New Testament. They only had the Old Testament and some songs and hymns. Today, however, we not only have the Old Testament but also the New Testament. We may speak directly from the Bible in a meeting. To speak from the Bible is more than adequate for a meeting because the Bible was written in such a spiritual, economical, and rich way. No one can speak a message that can compare to any page of the Bible. We also have a good hymnal and a number of good books, such as <em>Truth Lessons, Life Lessons,</em> the Life-study Messages, <em>The Experience of Life, The Economy of God,</em> and <em>The All-Inclusive Christ.</em> We may bring any of these books to the meeting, and when we open them, something marvelous will be there. We do not necessarily need to speak starting from the first section of a chapter, but we can use any page. We may &ldquo;play ball&rdquo; from any section. In a meeting you may say, &ldquo;Let us read a section of <em>Life Lessons</em> concerning the two aspects of the Spirit.&rdquo; Or you may say, &ldquo;Let us speak the nine titles of the Spirit as listed in this section.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have spent much time with much consideration preparing our writings. Our writings contain many selections prepared to impress people with the truth. Now we may simply come to them, not merely to read them, but to speak them in a living way in fellowship. In a meeting in which we speak in this way, people will surely receive the riches of Christ. Recently a co-worker among us testified that in every place that he served, the most difficult thing for him to do was to give a message in the regular meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. As the Lord&rsquo;s Day approached, he began to suffer by preparing his message. He had to go to many books to try to select some portions and put them together. All of us, though, have the riches in a condensed form as our rich &ldquo;groceries.&rdquo; What we need is simply to learn how to &ldquo;cook.&rdquo; Moreover, these groceries are inexhaustible; they can be used again and again.</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 14:26, however, we should not need to have any printed material (other than psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs) to use in the meetings to help us speak. But all of us are used to relying on something in the meetings from our old way of practice. If I am used to walking with a cane and you suddenly take it away, I will not be able to walk. Temporarily, I still need a cane to rely on until I am able to walk without it. I once had tuberculosis, and it took two and a half years for me to be fully healed. During my sickness, I could not walk without something or someone to help me. We have to realize that we have been crippled by the traditional and unscriptural practice of Christianity. Many of us cannot &ldquo;walk by ourselves.&rdquo; If the speaker is suddenly taken away from our meetings without anything to replace him, that will be hard. Thus, we may temporarily use the <em>Life Lessons,</em> the <em>Truth Lessons,</em> the Life-study Messages, or some other spiritual books with weight. We should not use them in the way of one person speaking or some persons reading but in the way of everyone speaking. We can use these materials by speaking them corporately. The meeting should be opened up for everyone to speak. In the long run, we all will get used to speaking. Eventually, we will not need a cane, that is, the printed material, in our regular church meetings.</p>
<p>We may use a &ldquo;cane,&rdquo; such as the <em>Life Lessons,</em> the <em>Truth Lessons,</em> or the Life-study Messages to help us at the present time. But I warned the church in Taipei that we must avoid something&mdash;if we use such a cane, this can build up a bad habit. We may rely on it too much, and then it could never be taken away. While we are walking with the cane, we also have to learn how to walk without it. Sometimes we need to walk without the cane. If we get tired we may use the cane again to rest. Gradually, we must learn and be fully strengthened to walk without the cane until we no longer need it.</p>
