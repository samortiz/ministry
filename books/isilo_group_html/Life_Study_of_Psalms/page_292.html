THE PRAISE OF GOD'S ELECT<br>FOR GOD'S BEING REAL, TRUSTWORTHY,<br>AND FULL OF BLESSING TO HIS ELECT<br>AND TO ALL THOSE WHO FEAR HIM, UNLIKE THE IDOLS</H2><P>Psalm 115 is the praise of God's elect for God's being real, trustworthy, and full of blessing to His elect and to all those who fear Him, unlike the idols. This psalm says that the idols made of silver and gold are not real but false. We should not put our trust in them. "They have mouths, but they do not speak;/They have eyes, but they do not see./They have ears, but they do not hear;/They have noses, but they do not smell. /They have hands, but they do not feel;/They have feet, but they do not walk;/They make no sound in their throat" (vv. 5-7). In actuality, idols are not real and can do nothing. Thus, they are not trustworthy, and they have no blessing to give. But our God is real. He can speak, and He can give blessing. "Jehovah has been mindful of us; He will bless us;/He will bless the house of Israel;/He will bless the house of Aaron;/He will bless those who fear Jehovah,/Both small and great" (vv. 12-13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI.

They praised and thanked God in the presence of all God's people, in the courts of His house, and in the midst of Jerusalem. They praised and thanked Him for His salvation, deliverance, preservation, bountiful dealing, and abundant benefits.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE EXHORTATION<br>OF GOD'S ELECT<br>TO ALL THE NATIONS<br>TO PRAISE JEHOVAH FOR<br>HIS GREAT LOVINGKINDNESS<br>AND EVERLASTING FAITHFULNESS</H2><P>Psalm 117 is the exhortation of God's elect to all the nations to praise Jehovah for His great lovingkindness and everlasting faithfulness. The two verses of this psalm say, "Praise Jehovah, all you nations;/Laud Him, all you peoples. /For His lovingkindness is great toward us,/And the faithfulness of Jehovah is forever./Hallelujah."</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_291.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_293.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 292</div><br></body></html>
