   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A GREAT LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After defeating the enemy, the Lord Jesus went to Galilee of the Gentiles Matt 4:12-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we had no record in the Bible, we could never realize that His going to Galilee was the shining of a great light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He went there to shine upon all the people sitting in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was not simply an outward preaching; it was a shining.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why did those young fishermen follow the Lord Jesus when all He said to them was, "Follow Me" Matt 4:18-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did not preach very much.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To Peter and Andrew He said, "Follow Me," and they followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus, the Nazarene, told people to follow Him and they did.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Peter and Andrew left the boat and the sea; James and John left the net and their father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why would people leave everything and follow Him?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a great light, He shined upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Lord Jesus came to that fishing wharf, He shined upon those young fishermen, and they followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many of us have experienced the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I can testify that I experienced the shining of the Lord Jesus as a great light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a sense, He has shined upon all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even today we are still under His shining.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can never get away from Him; the shining binds us to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Apostle Paul, when he was Saul of Tarsus, persecuted the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On his way to Damascus, the Lord Jesus shined upon him from the heavens Acts 9:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Saul said, "Who art thou, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus said, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul experienced the shining of the Lord Jesus, and he was blinded by it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have all been blinded and attracted by the shining of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Lord Jesus came to shine over the ones sitting in darkness, only the young people were caught.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were mending the nets with their father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only the two sons followed Him; the father did not.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the ones He called were young people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you are not preoccupied, you are young.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Lord was born, two old seekers of God, Simeon and Anna, were in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They did love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the Lord Jesus did not go to the temple and call them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He went to the seashore and called the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In any country a fishing wharf is a dirty place where many low-class people may be found.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet, the Lord Jesus went to the fishing wharf to find the young fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus shined upon these young, uneducated fishermen and said to them, "Follow Me."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They left everything and followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The young ones, the wild ones, the backward ones, the uneducated ones, the dirty ones these followed the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The young people are the right persons for the Lord's move today not only in the U.S.A., but also in Europe, in Africa, and in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps Simeon and Anna had died by the time the Lord Jesus came out to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus did not go to the temple and call the old people to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, He went to the fishing wharf to find some young fishermen who were not preoccupied.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They were dirty and they were empty, but they were not preoccupied.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be preoccupied is to be old.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They were without religion, without Bible knowledge, and with only a poor background of fishing, but the Lord Jesus called them to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The principle is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all need to be young and unoccupied.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord will never use any old, preoccupied people for His move upon the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all should be the young fishermen, not young preachers or young priests or young Pharisees, but young fishermen who are so simple, so empty, and so unoccupied.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These are the right persons for the Lord's kingdom.</S>
