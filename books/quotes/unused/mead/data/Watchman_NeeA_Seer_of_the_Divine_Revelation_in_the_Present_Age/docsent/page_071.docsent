   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY REVELATIONS RECEIVED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY WATCHMAN NEE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Watchman Nee fully believed in the scriptural, fundamental faith held by all true Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He believed in the verbal inspiration of the Bible and that the Bible is God's holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He believed that God is triune Father, Son, and Spirit distinctly three, yet fully one, co-existing and coinhering each other from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He believed that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, even God Himself, incarnated as a man with both the human and the divine life, that He died on the cross to accomplish redemption, that He rose bodily from the dead on the third day, that He ascended into heaven and was enthroned, crowned with glory, and made the Lord of all, and that He will return the second time to receive His followers, to save Israel, and to establish His millennial kingdom on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He believed that every person who believes in Jesus Christ will be forgiven by God, washed by His redeeming blood, justified by faith, regenerated by the Holy Spirit, and saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a believer is a child of God and a member of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He also believed that the destiny of every believer is to be an integral part of the church, which is the Body of Christ and the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In addition to these five basic aspects of the Christian faith, Watchman Nee was further enlightened to receive clear revelation from the Lord concerning fifty-three other scriptural teachings, which are crucial for fully understanding and practicing the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>FROM 1920 TO 1932 1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Assurance of Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One of the first basic items which the Lord revealed to Watchman Nee was the believers' assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Throughout all of China in those days, the scriptural teaching of the assurance of salvation was seldom taught by any Christian group.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Watchman Nee, however, became exceedingly clear concerning this matter and preached the gospel to Christians to help them realize that they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was able to show from the written Word that the believer can be absolutely assured of his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He would help the doubtful to take a Bible verse like John 3:16 and digest it until it became a definite word to them that they could never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He also pointed out to them that the Spirit of God dwells in them and witnesses with their spirit that they are God's children Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A further evidence of the assurance of salvation was given by Watchman Nee from 1 John 3:14: "We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Distinction between Grace and Law</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Most Christians in those days did not have the assurance of salvation, because they did not know the distinction between grace and law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Watchman Nee received the Lord's clear revelation that salvation is by grace alone, not by works of law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If salvation were a matter of law, it would depend upon our own works.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But salvation is of the Lord's grace, depending only upon what He is and what He has done for us.</S>
