   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD BEING MINGLED WITH MAN, AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>MAN BEING MINGLED WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before incarnation God had only one element, which was God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After His incarnation He not only had the divine element but also the human element.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time, because the Lord had not yet died through crucifixion, there was no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although He had the resurrection life in Him, the fact of resurrection had not yet been accomplished in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After He was raised from the dead, the element of resurrection was added into Him in addition to His divine and human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then there were not only the elements of God and man in Him but also the element of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to God s original intention, He wanted to mingle with man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, He became flesh, obtaining the human element in addition to the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At that point, God had already worked Himself into man, accomplishing the purpose of mingling Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why was there a need for the element of resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The reason is that the incarnation of God was only a one-way mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man had not yet entered into God and been mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, incarnation put God in the same position as man, but God and man, man and God, had not been fully mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was only after resurrection that God was fully mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you were saved, your salvation was in the principle of incarnation, which is the bringing of God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you were saved, incarnation took place in you, and God came into you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, at that moment, was there any mingling between God and you, or you and God?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Strictly speaking, according to the principle of incarnation, in our salvation God and man were not mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, God and man were just put together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This may be likened to people baking bread or cakes at home.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They first put water into the flour.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At this time the water and the flour have merely been put together but not mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After putting the water into the flour, the next step is to mix, blend, and knead them together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At this time the water truly becomes mingled with the flour and the flour with the water.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The two the water and the flour, the flour and the water are mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Incarnation brought God into the same position as man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The two were put together but were not fully mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In His thirty-three and a half years of human living, the Lord Jesus was God who had put on man and was living a human life on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God simply came and stayed where man was.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Strictly speaking, God and man were not fully mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While the Lord Jesus was living on the earth, His living was the living of the incarnated God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In those thirty-three and a half years, especially in the last three and a half years, the Lord s living, strictly speaking, was not the full living of the mingling of God and man because He had not yet resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At that time God had entered into man, but man had not yet entered into God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is one side of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other side, the last three and a half years of the Lord s living were truly a living of the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, there are two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, the Lord s living was not the living of the mingling of God and man because the Lord had not yet died and resurrected, and man had not yet entered into God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The incarnation of the Lord brought God into man, but He had not yet died and resurrected and had not yet brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can only say that God was living a life in man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Apparently, He first lived on the earth and then died.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the other hand, in reality He died first, and then He lived.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the beginning of His last three and a half years, He was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Baptism put Him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When He came up from the water, He was a person of resurrection and was already mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His living in the last three and a half years on the earth was a living of man being mingled with God.</S>
