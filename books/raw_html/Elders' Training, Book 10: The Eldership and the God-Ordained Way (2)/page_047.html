<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XV. THE TEST OF SOME FLESHLY CORINTHIAN BELIEVERS<br>CHARGING THAT THE APOSTLE, BEING CRAFTY,<br>TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEM WITH GUILE THROUGH TITUS,<br>WHO TOOK CARE OF THE GIFTS<br>FOR THE JEWISH BELIEVERS&#151;<br>2 CORINTHIANS 12:16-18a</H2><P>The Corinthians accused Paul of sending Titus to collect the offerings for the Jewish saints in Judea and, by so doing, stealing money from them in guile. To this the apostle responded that both he and Titus walked in the same spirit and in the same steps (v. 18b). In fact, the apostle, like parents for their children, would most gladly have spent (money) and been utterly spent, that is, exhausted (himself), on behalf of the believers' souls (vv. 14-15).</P><P>This shows that the Apostle Paul, when slandered by the fleshly believers, did vindicate his honesty and generosity for the benefit of the evil-intentioned slanderers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVI. THE TEST OF SOME JEWISH BELIEVERS<br>TROUBLING THE GALATIAN BELIEVERS AND<br>DESIRING TO PERVERT THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST<br>WITH A DIFFERENT GOSPEL, THAT IS, THE JUDAIC<br>OBSERVANCES OF THE LAW&#151;GALATIANS 1:6-7</H2><P>The Judaizers considered the observing of the law a gospel. The apostle cursed these heretical Jewish preachers (vv. 8-9). The apostle, a slave of Christ, was not persuading men or seeking to please men (v. 10). Thus, he condemned the heretical ones. For the truth of the gospel we need to learn of the apostle's faithfulness, frankness, and boldness in cursing the heretics and not trying to please men.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVII. THE TEST OF PETER BEING HYPOCRITICAL<br>IN RELATION TO THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL<br>DUE TO HIS FEARING OF THE BELIEVERS<br>OF THE CIRCUMCISION&#151;GALATIANS 2:12-13</H2><P>Paul opposed and condemned Peter to his face and rebuked him in front of all (vv. 11, 14). In doing this, Paul was not merciful, and many would consider him unwise. Later, however, Peter still recommended Paul and confirmed his teachings as having the same standing as the rest of the Scriptures (2 Pet. 3:15-16).</P><P>Paul was faithful to the truth of the gospel and honest toward Peter for his correction, and Peter was humble in bearing Paul's rebuking. In his old age, Peter wrote a letter in which he recommended Paul highly and confirmed the standing of his writings among the Scriptures. We all need to learn of both Paul and Peter in their spiritual virtues.</P>
