   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Beseeching the Lord of the Harvest</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Thrust Out Workers into His Harvest</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The King of the heavenly kingdom considered Himself not only the Shepherd of the sheep, but also the Lord of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His kingdom is established with things of life that can grow and multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is the Lord who owns this crop.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are both the flock and the crop.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The flock is made up of living animals and the crop of living vegetation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Under the hand of the Lord Jesus, nothing is lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He does not care for lifeless things, but for things that are living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everything under the care of this heavenly King is living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all need to see a vision of the Lord Jesus as the Lord of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 38 the Lord told us to beseech the Lord of the harvest that He may thrust out workers into His harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Firstly, in His economy, God has a plan to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then His economy requires His people to beseech, to pray, for it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In answering their prayer, He will accomplish what they have prayed concerning His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many times when we sense the need for workers, we sound out the call for help.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But from now on, whenever you sense the need for workers, you must firstly pray to the Lord of the harvest, saying, Lord, here is Your harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You are the Lord of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We call on You to thrust out some reapers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lord, send more reapers into Your harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Praying like this will make a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To pray like this means that we have seen a vision that our Christ, the kingly One, the Shepherd, is the Lord of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever you pray that the Lord would send reapers into His harvest, you honor Him very much.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How different this is from inviting people to help you in your work!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you do that, you do not honor Christ as the Lord of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, it is a matter of your work, not of His harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You become the master of that work, and He is not considered as the Lord of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we need to call on Him and say, Lord, You are the Lord of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The work in this field is Yours, and this harvest is Your crop.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We call on You for Your crop.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Lord, send Your reapers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Recently, a brother told me that the church life in his locality was wonderful and that I should come there for a visit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although this brother s talk was nice, it was rather natural.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It had no vision whatever.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead of inviting me, this brother should have prayed, Lord, the church in my locality is the harvest of the heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Lord of the harvest, I call on You to send reapers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is the church in your locality your harvest or His harvest?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since it is the Lord s harvest, you have no right to invite others to go there to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To do this is to infringe upon the Lord s honor.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In doing this you fail to recognize that you are not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the Lord of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The only thing you can do is to ask Him to thrust out reapers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need further revelation regarding this aspect of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I believe that the twelve disciples prayed according to the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although the Bible does not tell us this, I believe that they did pray.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is a principle in the Bible that, whenever you pray to the Lord for something, the Lord will send you to accomplish that for which you have prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The twelve disciples prayed for the Lord of the harvest to send out reapers, and the Lord answered their prayer by sending them out.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whoever prays will be the one sent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, you may pray to the Lord regarding the shortage of elders.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, do not pray according to your ambition, lest the Lord not answer your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You may simply pray, Lord, there is the need of elders.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After a certain period of time, the Lord may say, How about you?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The twelve prayed, and eventually the twelve were sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>THE APPOINTMENT OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In 10:1-4 we have the appointment of the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Prior to chapter ten the Lord carried out His kingly ministry alone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But beginning in this chapter the twelve apostles were added for the enlarging, the spread, of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A. Giving Them Authority</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>to Cast Out Demons and to Heal Diseases</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Verse 1 says, And calling His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they should cast them out and heal every disease and every sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The authority here to cast out unclean spirits and heal diseases is a foretaste of the power of the coming age Heb 6:5 , that is, of the millennium, in which all demons will be cast out and all diseases healed Isa 35:5-6 .</S>
