   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED NINETY-TWO THE CHURCH THE REVELATION OF THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall continue to see the revelation of the mystery of Christ, the church, given by Christ in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Second Time in Matthew 18:15-20</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church was revealed by Christ the first time in Matthew 16:15-20.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second time the church is revealed by the Lord is in Matthew 18:15-20. a. Concerning the Local Church</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Matthew 18:15-20 we have a revelation of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 17 says, "But if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church revealed in Matthew 16:18 is the universal church, which is the unique Body of Christ, whereas the church revealed here is the local church, the expression of the unique Body of Christ in a certain locality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Chapter sixteen relates to the universal building of the church, whereas chapter eighteen relates to the local practice of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both indicate that the church represents the kingdom of the heavens, having authority to bind and to loose.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus says, "On this rock I will build My church."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in 18:17 we have the local church, for this verse speaks of a church to which we can go when we have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matthew 18:17 says that if we have a problem to be solved by the church, we must go to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If this church is not the local church but the universal church, we would not be able to "tell it to the church."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In fact, Matthew 16:18 is included in 18:17.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot have 16:18 without 18:17.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, if we have 18:17, we have 16:18.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the context of 18:17, in the local church we have both the reality and the practicality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that if we would be in the kingdom of the heavens in a practical way, we need to be in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a chapter dealing with relationships in the kingdom, the Lord Jesus eventually speaks concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This proves that the practicality of the kingdom today is in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the local church, it is impossible to have the practicality and reality of the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many Christians talk about the kingdom life, but without the practical local church life, this talk is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In chapter sixteen the Lord Jesus revealed the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the universal church requires the practicality of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without the local church, the universal church cannot be practiced; rather, it will be something suspended in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The local church is the reality both of the kingdom and of the universal church. b.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For the Administration of the Church in Its Locality</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The revelation of the church in Matthew 18 is, in particular, for the administration of the church in its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 18:15-20 we have the administration, or the government, of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the church there is the need of administration, of government.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we have a problem with a brother which we cannot solve with two or three, we should bring it to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church has government.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The administration or government of the church is in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not have the local churches, we do not have this government.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the local church there is the government which is a real restriction and test to the flesh and the self.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we know how independent our natural self is, we shall be willing to submit to the government, the administration, in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all need to learn submission because of our independent self.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is why we need the government and restriction of the local church.</S>
