   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Church Listening to the Elders and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Elders Learning to Listen to the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once a local church has had elders appointed, it should listen to the elders, not to Timothy and Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The elders are the overseers of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The highest authority in a local church is the elders; however, the authority of the elders is received from the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The apostles give the authority to the elders, and the elders administrate the local church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, everyone who is an elder, an overseer, must learn to listen to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because their being elders is due to the apostles, they cannot overthrow the authority of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is all right for the church not to receive the commands of the apostles directly, but it is not all right for the church not to receive the commands of the elders directly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the elders need to learn to listen to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is what God has arranged with respect to the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Being the Ones to Remove the Elders</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After the meeting in Hangkow, some brothers misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They thought that though the elders are appointed by the apostles, they did not have to listen to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When there were brothers who did not respect the elders and problems occurred, the letter of accusation by two or three was sent to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In other words, the authority for the appointment of the elders is with the apostles, and the authority for the removal of the elders is also with the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A local church cannot expel an elder; rather, the apostles need to bear the responsibility of removing elders.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the reason why the letter of accusation by two or three was sent to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why is there the need of two or three people?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because this is not a matter of personal opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some people speak loosely, and this is not allowed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is the need of a letter of accusation by two or three in order to oppose a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This makes it a sufficiently troublesome matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At least two or three accusers are needed to accuse an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why is a letter of accusation used instead of spoken words?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Spoken words can easily become rumors; but since a letter of accusation is written down, it can become a formal accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, there must be a letter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way, one cannot speak loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anyone who does things loosely must bear the responsibility for it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE APOSTLES BEARING</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>AND THE ELDERS BEARING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here you can see that the apostles appoint the elders, and the apostles also remove the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, the direct administration of a local church is not in the hands of the apostles; it is in the hands of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The apostles bear particular responsibility for expanding the work, not for administrating business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The administration and care of a local church are the responsibility of the elders, not the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The apostles take care of carrying out the work of the church as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Bible makes a clear distinction between the workers, the local churches, and the elders concerning their limit of authority, the arrangement of their work, and their coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we are here to try to find out the way to go on properly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>HOW THE CHURCH MAKES DECISIONS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A brother once asked how a matter should be decided in the work or in the church after it has been discussed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I think that every worker or every elder in a locality has the common feeling that a message meeting is rather easy but a business meeting is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no problem when it comes to spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The greatest problem is with the business meeting, because in that kind of meeting, it is very easy for everyone to have his own view; everyone's opinion is different.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many of the problems lie especially with the matter of decision making.</S>
