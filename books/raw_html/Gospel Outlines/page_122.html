<h1 class="title">CHRIST&rsquo;S RESURRECTION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Acts 2:23-24, 32-33; 3:15; 5:30-31</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Lord is the Lord of life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is God incarnated. Since the life in God is the eternal life, the life in Christ is also the eternal life.</li>
	<li>Because the eternal life is in Christ, the Bible refers to Him as the Lord of life; and He is not only the Lord of life, but also the life itself.</li>
	<li>Because He is the Lord of life, He cannot be held by death. Death is a tremendous power; when it comes, no one can resist it. But the power of life overcomes the power of death. Since the Lord Jesus is the Lord of life, death has no power over Him. Though He entered into death, yet He came out of death and was resurrected.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord has fulfilled the requirement of death
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since men have sins, death has a requirement upon men. Sins bring in the requirement of death upon men.</li>
	<li>Christ died to bear men&rsquo;s sins; He died to taste death for all.</li>
	<li>Men&rsquo;s sins cause the law of God to sentence men to death. God&rsquo;s law says that he who commits sin must die.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s death satisfies the requirement of the law of God. It takes away the death that was the result of the requirement of the law.</li>
	<li>Since Christ has both fully tasted and taken away the death required by the law, death not only has no power over Him but also has no power over those who are redeemed. This is why He died and rose again. <em>In giving this message, more development is needed. Only a few main points have been presented here.</em></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The meaning of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The resurrection of the Lord is the proof that His death has satisfied the requirements of the law of God. It frees men from sin and death.</li>
	<li>The resurrection of the Lord causes men to have His life and causes men to be united with Him.</li>
	<li>The resurrection of the Lord makes men righteous, justified, and accepted by God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Believe the resurrection of the Lord
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To believe in the Lord is to believe that the Lord has been resurrected. To believe the resurrection of the Lord includes the confession that the Lord died for you.</li>
	<li>When one believes the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, he is united with Him. By this he is justified and has life.</li>
	<li>When one believes the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, he receives the peace of mind and the power of life. He is reconciled to God and can live a life that is acceptable to God.</li>
	</ol></li>
