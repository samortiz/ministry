   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TO LIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In these recent months the churches have been brought back to the Word and to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe also that the churches are seeking to live Christ, a life that builds up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We thank the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The messages that have been given on the book of Philippians have greatly helped the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The same is true of the messages given in the trainings on Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet not too long ago the Lord rebuked me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He pointed out what a lack there is of Christ in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is not practically lived out in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As I knelt there before Him, I took the lead to confess my shortage of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May the Lord reveal to us how we lack the practical living by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I was not rebuked for raw sins or worldliness; by His mercy and grace I can testify that these things do not touch me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the Lord said, "You may not be worldly or immoral, but how much Christ do you live?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I had to confess that it is very little.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I believe that most of you also can say that you do not easily fall into rough sins or worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such things have little appeal for you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in your daily walk, how much of Christ has been wrought into you?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Your policy is to behave properly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You feel condemned if you tell a lie, for example.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But do you ever feel condemned that you have not lived Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you act properly, you have no sense of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that unknowingly you are paying attention to ethics and morality, caring for human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>NOT GOOD BEHAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Occasionally I take a look at my diary.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A number of times I have recorded that I did not do well in something, or that I was wrong, or that I was mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But rarely does an entry say, "Today I was short of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Does not this indicate how much I cared for good behavior?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our attention is on virtuous behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we are proud, we regret that we lack humility.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But when we treat others kindly, we may be short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may be prompted by our natural love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are in naturalness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is possible for us to live a life which expresses the human virtues, like kindness and consideration of others, but to live by Christ is foreign to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why is it so hard for us to live out Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even back in 1970 we heard many messages on Christ being our life and on taking Him as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those messages were well received by the saints, and a number of hymns were written on taking Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the messages have become a faded memory, and we are left with only the doctrine and some hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>PRESERVED IN CHRIST BY PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many times you have had the experience, while praying, of praying yourself into the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At these times you were taking Christ as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At such times of prayer, when you were one with the Lord, taking Him as your life, you wanted to linger with Him, even to be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But once that time was over, it seemed you immediately slipped back into yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is because of this that the Word tells us to pray unceasingly 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Unceasing prayer is the only way for us to be preserved in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have tried other ways, like exercising faith, but from experience I tell you, without praying we are outside of Christ; with prayer we are in Him.</S>
