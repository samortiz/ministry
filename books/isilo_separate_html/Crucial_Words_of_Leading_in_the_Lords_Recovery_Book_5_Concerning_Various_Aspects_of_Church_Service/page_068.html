<h1 class="title">SPENDING OURSELVES FOR<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S MULTIPLICATION AND INCREASE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; Acts 1:8</h1>
<p>Even though I have been in America, for the past five years my heart has been in Taiwan. I have been observing and continually seeking in which direction the Lord desires for us to move. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been in Taiwan for thirty-six years. During the first twelve years, I spent seven to eight months a year in Taiwan and the rest of the time in Southeast Asia. During those years many full-time serving ones were produced, and the number of saints on the island grew to almost forty thousand. At that time we increased by leaps and bounds. Twenty years later, however, the number of saints in Taiwan has not increased but has decreased. It seems as though the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in Taiwan is grinding to a halt.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAIWAN&rsquo;S PROSPERITY AND PROGRESS BEING<br />
FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S MULTIPLICATION AND INCREASE</h2>
<p>Even though the saints continue to love the Lord and zealously preach the gospel so that new ones are regularly baptized, few new ones have remained. The churches in Taiwan have a more solid foundation, and the saints have progressed in knowing the truth and growing in life. However, if we look at the numbers, we see that there is hardly any multiplication or increase. We must be burdened to find out why the Lord&rsquo;s work on the island of Taiwan has not advanced. We must identify what has caused the Lord&rsquo;s work to stop, or rather, to hibernate.</p>
<p>I have been observing this matter for the past five years, and up until last October I had not come to a conclusion. However, as soon as I finished writing the notes of the Life-study of the New Testament, I became very clear. I put my pen down and said, &ldquo;I am going back to Taiwan.&rdquo; It seems as though my age would not allow me to do so, but because of the burden in me, I came back so that together with the brothers we could move forward with the work in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Last October, when we held a conference entitled <em>The All-inclusiveness and Unlimitedness of Christ,</em> we spoke of Christ&rsquo;s multiplication and increase. These two words, <em>multiplication</em> and <em>increase,</em> express my burden for Taiwan. The churches on the island of Taiwan have been under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing since 1949. We have witnessed His blessing for the past thirty-six years. The whole world is amazed at Taiwan&rsquo;s prosperity and progress. Security is good, the transportation system is developed, education is available to all, and the economy is booming. Furthermore, instead of the government restricting the church from preaching the gospel, it grants the church many favors to preach the gospel. Because of these five points, we do not have any excuse, nor can we evade our responsibility. We must not say that the gospel cannot be spread throughout all of Taiwan. We need to seize this opportunity to spread the Lord&rsquo;s work in Taiwan. Taiwan is not large. The freeway from Keelung in the north to Kaohsiung in the south is a little more than four hundred kilometers. We have a rich spiritual possession, together with security, transportation, education, a good economy, and favors from the government, so we have no excuse for not spreading the gospel throughout Taiwan.</p>
<p>Two hundred years ago, when transportation was not so developed, the Western missionaries went from Europe and America to China to preach the gospel. It took them half a year to travel by boat. For six months they suffered severe seasickness, and some died shortly after they arrived in China. Those who survived the journey established schools to produce qualified teachers. This was a preparation for the preaching of the gospel to the local people. In this way, after only two hundred years the Western missionaries preached the gospel throughout the two major countries in Asia&mdash;China and India. Besides this, the missionaries translated the Bible into the local languages of some of the other countries in Asia. They also undertook such a difficult task for the Lord&rsquo;s work in Africa. Even though the circumstances were difficult, it took them less than two centuries to spread the gospel throughout the whole world.</p>
<p>We have been here for over thirty-six years. When I left Taiwan, there were dozens of churches and thousands of saints meeting regularly. However, we have been here for more than a quarter century, and yet we have not spread the gospel throughout this island. All the saints who love the Lord should repent and ask for the Lord&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD DESIRING PEOPLE&rsquo;S SOULS</h2>
<p>I returned to Taipei with a heavy burden. Therefore, in the first message of the conference last October, I spoke of the unlimitedness of Christ. Christ&rsquo;s multiplication is unlimited, and His increase is also unlimited. Contrary to this fact, however, we have entered into a state of hibernation. This is unacceptable. I remember the first time I went to Kaohsiung in 1949. There were one hundred people in the meeting. That was thirty-six years ago. If we use one hundred as a base number and if the rate of annual increase is ten percent, we would have about three thousand people meeting in Kaohsiung today. However, the regular attendance in Kaohsiung is less than fifteen hundred. There are more than three hundred towns and villages in Taiwan. There are not more than fifteen churches in the great plain from Chiayi to Tainan. From the viewpoint of statistics, we owe the Lord very much.</p>
<p>For many years all the churches have been stable, without any turmoil, problems, heretical teachings, or disputes. We worship the Lord for this. However, we cannot say that we have satisfied the Lord&rsquo;s heart. The Lord charged us to go and disciple all the nations (Matt. 28:19). He also said, &ldquo;You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (Acts 1:8). We have not even taken the gospel to the area surrounding Kaohsiung, not to speak of the uttermost part of the earth. We all need to bring this matter before the Lord. We must see that the Lord does not desire something outward; the Lord desires souls. The church in Kaohsiung has been stable for over thirty years. It would not be too much for there to be eighteen thousand saints meeting in Kaohsiung today. Neither would it be too much for there to be thirty to forty churches that were established by the saints sent out from Kaohsiung.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_067.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_069.html">Next</a> </body></html>
