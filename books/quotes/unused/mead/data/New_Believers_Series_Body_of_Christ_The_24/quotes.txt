[1]  THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; 4:11-13; 5:29-30; Gen 2:21-24; 1 Cor 10:16-17; 12:12-30; Rom 12:4-8 I. THE CHURCH BEING OF CHRIST
[2]  This typifies the relationship between Christ and the church.
[3]  God gave us not only the grace, power, and nature of Christ, but He also gave us the Body of Christ.
[4]  The Bible shows us that Christ is the Head of the church and the church is the Body of Christ.
[5]  If the basis of the first "church" is not the Body of Christ, one can, of course, set up a church that is based on the Body of Christ.
[6]  In conclusion, whatever falls short of the Body of Christ or goes beyond the Body of Christ is not the church.
[7]  First Corinthians 12:12-13 says, "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.
[8]  The Body of Christ has two basic principles: First, apart from that which comes out of Christ, there is no Body of Christ; second, apart from the operation of the Holy Spirit, there is no Body of Christ.
[9]  Ephesians 4:11-13 says, "He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."
[10]  God's intention in giving the church these ministers of the word is for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[11]  On the other hand, we testify that the church is the Body of Christ and that this Body is one.
