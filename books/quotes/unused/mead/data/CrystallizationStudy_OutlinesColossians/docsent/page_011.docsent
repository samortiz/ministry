   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Eleven The New Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Fellowship of the New Man,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>the Consciousness of the New Man,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>and the Believers Equal Status in the New Man Scripture Reading: Col 3:10-11; 4:7-17; Philem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1-2, 10-22 In Colossians 4:7-17 we have an illustration of the revelation of the new man given in 3:10-11 and a record of the fellowship of the new man: Paul s purpose in 4:7-17 is to present an illustration, a detailed portrait, of the living of the new man: In spite of all the differences among nationalities, races, and classes, there was on earth in a practical way the living of the one new man created in Christ Jesus Eph 2:10, 15.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There were not merely local churches in various cities there was one new man in a real and practical way Col 3:10-11.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The apostle s fellowship shows us that the new man as practiced at the apostle s time was an issue of the apostle s work, which encouraged the believers to seek after Christ, the constituent of the new man, as their enjoyment 1:12-13, 27; 3:4, 10-11.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Within Paul there was the sense, the consciousness, of the new man 4:7-17: Both the saints in Colossae and Paul and those with him were members of the new man in actuality and had the consciousness of the new man: The fact that Paul mentioned many names indicates that he had the consciousness of the new man vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>9-17.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because Paul had the consciousness of the new man, he charged Tychicus to make known to the Colossians all that concerned him v. 7.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul s word regarding the reading of letters proves that there was no difference between the church in Laodicea and the church in Colossae; his word implies fellowship, oneness, harmony, and intimate contact v. 16.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to be conscious of the church, of the Body, and of the new man: The record in the book of Acts regarding the church reveals that the believers were church-conscious 5:11; 8:1, 3; 9:31; 11:22, 26; 12:1, 5; 13:1; 14:23, 27; 15:3-4, 22, 41; 16:5; 18:22; 20:17, 28: In their concept there was nothing of individualism; they did everything with a consciousness of the church 2:44; 4:23, 32.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Based upon the record in Acts, we have the principle that whatever we do and whenever and wherever we meet, we must be church-conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the church life we should learn to have the consciousness of the Body, a Body-consciousness 1 Cor 12:12-27: In order to live and move with other members of the Body, we need to have the consciousness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Wherever there is Body-consciousness, individual thought and action are ruled out Acts 9:1-19.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Like Paul, we should have the consciousness of the new man, realizing that all the saints in all the churches are the new man Eph 4:24; Col 3:10-11: Any church that isolates itself from other churches has a consciousness only of itself, not a consciousness of the totality of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are conscious of the new man, we will not think that the churches in our country have nothing to do with the churches in other nations; instead, we will realize that all the churches are the one new man today Eph 2:15; Rev 1:11; 2:1a.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By means of the traffic among the churches, we experience in a practical way the living of the new man; such a living has Christ as its reality Col 1:12; 2:16-17; 3:4.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The subject of the book of Philemon is an illustration of the believers equal status in the new man: The case of Onesimus and Philemon illustrates that in the new man all the believers have an equal status.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This Epistle serves the special purpose of showing us the equality in eternal life and divine love of all the members of the Body of Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1, 9.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The equal status of the believers is a matter of love, which comes out of faith; in the new man the believers love one another in faith v. 5; Titus 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because of the divine birth and living by the divine life, all the believers in Christ have an equal status in the new man; this is based on three facts: Christ s death has abolished the ordinances of the different ways of living for the creation of the one new man Eph 2:15.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have all been baptized into Christ and made one in Him Gal 3:27-28.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the new man Christ is all and in all Col 3:11.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Epistle to Philemon should be regarded as a continuation of Colossians 4 and considered an illustration of how in the new man all social rank is put aside Philem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>1-2, 10-22: The distinction of social rank and status among the believers has been nullified because the believers have been constituted with the all-inclusive Christ, who is their life Col 3:4.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Epistle to Philemon Paul gives the churches an illustration of how slaves and masters have been reconstituted with Christ; as a result, they are all part of the new man and have an equal status in the new man vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>10-11.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the practice of the economy of God, it is crucial that all social ranks and differences among races and nations be swallowed up Col 3:10-11: In the new man distinctions on the basis of color have been nullified; Paul strongly taught this, and we must consider it part of the full knowledge of the truth 1 Tim 2:4; 2 Tim 2:25; Titus 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we see that the believers have an equal status in the new man, there will be no problems among us concerning social rank, nationality, or race 1 Cor 12:13; Gal 3:28; Col 3:10-11.</S>
