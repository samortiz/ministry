The fourth section, chapters nine through eleven may be considered as a parenthetical section, dealing with God's selection by grace
The four other main sections are condemnation, justification, sanctification , and transformation for practicing the Body life
The first section, the section of condemnation, reveals that all mankind is in a fallen condition, condemned by God under His righteous law
Most students of the Scriptures pay attention only to sanctification; they neglect conformation and glorification
Regeneration is accomplished in our spirit, but 12:2 shows us that after the Lord regenerates us in our spirit, He transforms us in our soul
While we are in the process of transformation and conformation, and before the time of our glorification, we are living on the earth
The conclusion of Romans is that while we are here on this earth, we practice the Body life as His living, functioning members
We should spend an adequate time to study it because it gives us a full sketch and understanding of the Christian life
The first section of Romans tells us something concerning the knowledge of God, the conscience of man, and the law of God
Outside of man in the universe there is a just and righteous God, and within man He made a conscience to reflect what He is
The knowledge of God comes from God Himself, and this knowledge to some extent has been installed into us through our conscience
Paul compared all of man's deeds with God Himself, with the knowledge of God, with the conscience, and with the law of God
His conclusion to the first main section of Romans is that all humans are shut up by the law; there is no excuse and no escape
In order to preach the gospel to tell people that they are sinful, we must find the best way to convince and convict them
In principle, we cannot convince people effectively unless we present to them either God Himself with the knowledge of God or the conscience
If we want to convince unbelievers that they are sinners, we must make God and the knowledge of God very clear to them
In light of the knowledge of God, our human conscience, and the divine law, we were sinful and under God's condemnation
We must bow ourselves to God and to God's divine law, being convinced by our conscience that we are sinners who need God's redemption
We have seen that the first section of Romans speaks of the knowledge of God , the conscience , and the law of God
After reading from 3:21 to 5:11 many times, we still may not know what this portion of the Word tells us and how to summarize it
The second main section of Romans gives us a full picture of how we are justified through the redemption of Christ
When we human beings measure ourselves against the standard of the glory of God, we realize that God's glory is higher than the heavens
No matter how high the standard of God's glory is, God's righteousness reaches that standard; it is just as high as God's glory
On the third day God resurrected Him; this resurrection was also a part of the process of God's setting forth of Christ
God set forth Christ through the entire process of His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to sit at the right hand of God
The shedding of blood and the resurrection of Christ are the main steps in the process of the setting forth of Christ by God
God placed Christ, set forth Christ, from the time that He shed His blood to the time that He ascended to sit at the right hand of God
We must never forget that propitiation includes Christ Himself, His crucifixion, His resurrection, and His ascension
We are not only reconciled to God, but by justification we are in God, and God is our boast, our enjoyment, and our everything
When we believe in Christ, we share propitiation, and under this propitiation and in this propitiation God's righteousness is ours
All Bible students agree that the things mentioned in this section and the thoughts contained here are very deep
There are several translations of this word, including grafted, as a branch grafted from one tree onto another
There are at least these different renderings of this one word: grown, planted, grafted, united, identified, joined, and incorporated
Based on our reckoning that we are dead to sin and alive to God, we present our members as slaves to righteousness
In chapter five we are told that we were born in Adam, but now we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ
In Adam we inherited sin and death, but now in Christ we receive righteousness, which is versus sin, and life, which is versus death
In order for us to understand how we are transferred into Christ, we need the definition and explanation in chapter six
In this way, our old man has been crucified and we are now walking in newness of life, which is the newness of Christ Himself
For this purpose we must present ourselves, especially all the members of our body, no longer to sin but to righteousness
In a positive sense it refers to the flesh, bone, and blood as a part of our physical body, the element and constituent of our body
All flesh in these verses indicates that fallen man lives under the control of the flesh, so in the eyes of God he has become flesh
Before the life of the old man is lived out, it is simply the old man, but once it is lived out, it is the flesh
The first law in chapter seven is the law of Moses; the second law, the law in the members of our body, is an evil law
Due to the fall, when man partook of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the satanic life was injected into the human body
According to the revelation of the Scriptures, all of our doing that issues from the tree of knowledge is something related to sin
When man took of the fruit of the tree of knowledge and ate it, the evil element of Satan entered into his body
The warring in Romans 7 pertains to unbelievers as well as to believers, because in Romans 7 there is nothing yet related to salvation
Within this evil life there is the law of evil which is the law of sin and death dwelling in the members of man's body
In their mind the opium smokers were convinced that they should not smoke, and they made up their mind never to smoke
No matter how hard they struggled against this addiction, they eventually were carried away captive to the smoking house
We have now mentioned four important terms-the law of God, the flesh, the law in the members, and the law of the mind
While we are still alive, we are obligated to the law, but when we are dead, we are liberated; we have no more obligations
For when we were in the flesh, the passions for sins, which acted through the law, operated in our members to bear fruit to death
Some may interpret this to say that we have no obligation toward the old man as a husband, that rather we are obligated to the law
In his reply, he said that on the one hand, the husband is the old man, but on the other hand, the husband involves the law
From this point of view, the husband is the old man, who is subject to the law, and we are the wife of the old man
In chapter six we are released from sin, while in chapter seven we are released from the law, both by our death with Christ
While we were living in the old man, we were under the bondage of sin, and at the same time we were under the obligation of the law
These are the most important matters in this section, but in these few chapters nearly every word is a key word
The physical body spoken of in chapter six is a body of sin, which in chapter seven is called the body of death
Sin, therefore, is something living, moving, acting, and doing things within us and through us, indicating that it is alive
By regeneration we received the divine life into our spirit, and with this highest life, there is the highest law
As we have seen, the third law, that is, the law of the mind, always responds and corresponds to the first law, the law of God
Because the third law is weaker than the second law, the second law always defeats the third law and brings us into captivity
Man had the created human life with the law of good within him to do the things which corresponded with God's demand, that is, God's law
The law of God makes a demand, and the law of good within our soul, our human life, always tries to respond to God's law
Whenever our mind sides with the side of good, the second law, the law of sin and death, comes in to interrupt and frustrate us
For our mind to stand with the flesh brings in death, but if our mind stands with the spirit, we will have life and peace
Because we were created became fallen and then were regenerated the same mind on one occasion can be good and on another occasion not good
The law of good in our mind always corresponds to the law of God, but this does not mean that the fallen mind is absolutely good
The law of God, that is, the law of letters, is outside of man, demanding us to do good and to do the will of God according to what God is
With these three parties there are three wills-the divine will of God, the devilish will of Satan, and the human will of man
According to biologists, it is a scientific fact that with any kind of physical life, there are principles and laws
The tree of life represented God, Adam was there representing man, and Satan was there as well represented by the tree of knowledge
Man was seduced to take in Satan, Satan entered into man, and the two-man and Satan, Satan and man-were joined together illegally
On the negative side, blood is for redemption, while on the positive side, the divine life is for regeneration
When we believe into Him in this way, we are redeemed on the negative side, and we are regenerated on the positive side
The body is the site of the satanic life, the soul is the site of the human life, and the spirit is the site of the divine life
In the ancient time there were three parties in the garden of Eden, and today the same parties are all within us
Even as God gave Adam a free will, a volition, to choose, He gives us the same volition and will with a choice
If we choose to make friends with Satan, there is no need for a telephone call; he is close to us, even within us
Although we do not say that Satan is omnipresent, we must realize that he dwells in man's flesh; this is a fact according to the Scriptures
As long as we are human beings, we are still in this fallen body, so we must be aware that the evil life with the evil law is still in us
Although this evil thing is in our body, we still must praise and thank God that the divine life is in our spirit
Whether we feel that we are sinful or holy, we still need the blood because we are still in this sinful body, the body of sin
The translations in the New American Standard Bible and the Revised Standard Version are also good and convey the same meaning
Of course the teachings concerning the Lord Himself who the Lord is what the Lord is and what the Lord has done for us are very necessary
There are many things involved with driving a car, but the most important thing is to be aware of what is immediately around us
Today, even a person who is crippled can drive a car, because it is not he who carries the car but the car that carries him
Our knowledge and understanding of the construction of a car and the arrangement of its parts is for one purpose-to drive it
Similarly, although we must study the Bible with its narratives and instructions, the real secret is in Romans 8:6
We may be very knowledgeable of the Scriptures, but if we do not apply Romans 8:6, whatever we know and do will accomplish little
Although we may listen to hundreds of messages, they may all miss what the real secret of our Christian life is
God's intention is to conform us to the image of His Son, that is, to make His Son the Firstborn among many brothers
Day by day, little by little, and part by part the Holy Spirit progressively conforms us to the image of Christ
In the first half there is the Spirit working within, and in the second half, the 'all things' work together for good without
We are currently in the process of conformation, but our aim is that one day when He returns He will glorify us; He will bring us into glory
In this one portion we can realize the three laws within us, the law of the Spirit of life, and the indwelling Spirit working within us
We are often troubled that we are weak, defeated, and sinful and that we cannot do good or overcome our weak points
He is the Spirit within us, and His sovereign hand is arranging all the necessary things to work together for us
Chapters fourteen and fifteen tell us especially how to receive one another as members; this is something for the Body life
Although the last chapter, Romans 16, may appear to have little to do with the Body life, it is full of the Body life
Regeneration has already been accomplished in our spirit, the center of our being, but what we need now is for our soul to be transformed
After we present our bodies, our soul needs to be dealt with, so the second thing that we should do is to allow our soul to be transformed
The presenting of our bodies and the transformation of our soul especially the mind are the necessary steps for us to practice the Body life
We must present our bodies, be transformed in our soul, and learn how to be fervent, that is, burning in spirit in order to function
For the church life we need to present our bodies, be transformed in our soul, and be burning in spirit for our function in the Body
Verse 4 says, 'All the members do not have the same function,' and the following verses tell us how to function
If we do not function but merely meet together again and again, we will not have a real and practical church life
Although the things mentioned in chapters twelve through sixteen may be considered the 'wills' of God, the Body life is the foremost item
If we are proper members of the Body, acting and functioning in the church life, then we will have everything else
As we saw in the previous chapters, the first five books of the New Testament are a history of the universal man, Christ with the church
Without Christ and His cross it is impossible for the believers to realize the practical life of this universal man
The book of Colossians especially deals with this matter, telling us that the portion which we received from God is Christ Himself
Verse 24 says of Christ crucified, 'But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God'
Christ is the power for us to do the things of God, and He is also the very wisdom, knowledge, and way for us to do them
Verse 30 continues But of Him you are in Christ Jesus who became wisdom to us from God both righteousness and sanctification and redemption
The King James Version renders the latter phrase as 'wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption'
Christ is God's wisdom to us, which includes righteousness for our past, sanctification for our present, and redemption for our future
The redemption mentioned here is the redemption of our body in the future , because it is mentioned as the last of the three items
In 1:7 Paul says, 'So that you do not lack in any gift, eagerly awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ'
In chapter three Paul said, 'And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ'
For if there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to the manner of man'?
They reveal that we may have the so-called gifts yet still be infants in Christ, not only childish but even fleshly in our Christian life
Following this are a few chapters concerning sanctification, and the last five chapters deal with the Body life
We should simply keep in mind that it shows us three main points concerning the Christian life, which are proved by many cases
The portion ordained and given to us by God is Christ Himself, not gifts, doctrine, knowledge, teaching, signs, miracles, or wisdom
Paul at the very beginning of this book declares, 'For indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified'
They may not know that Christ is the power, Christ is the wisdom, Christ is the energy, Christ is the strength, and Christ is the knowledge
Paul even declared to the Corinthians that he determined not to give them anything but Christ and Christ crucified
If we look at today's Christianity, we can see that Christ as wisdom given to us by God has been very much neglected
Another category is the Pentecostal churches, which pay their attention to gifts, mainly one gift-speaking in tongues
Wherever we go, if we talk with people about Christ Himself, only the hungry, thirsty, and seeking ones appreciate what we say
The robe in verse 22 signifies that Christ is our righteousness to cover us and to justify us, thus enabling us to match the Father's glory
If we do not know how to apply and experience Christ, we simply do not know the practical meaning of sanctification
Rarely can we find one hymn that tells us something about the Lord's second coming in the subjective way of life
The old creation, the self, the flesh, the natural man, and the soulish life all need to be dealt with by the cross
If a married couple is not able to get along well, this indicates that they are short of the experience of Christ and the cross
If all the members of a family appropriate Christ in their daily life and take the cross, everything will be right among them
If we then go to his wife to teach her to submit to her husband, she may say, 'You must tell my husband that he needs to love his wife'
All the problems with Christians and all the problems in the churches can be solved only by Christ experienced and the cross applied
In actuality, the gifts themselves do no harm, but the persons who are gifted often do a great deal of harm by the gifts
We cannot say absolutely that there has not been an exception, but it is rather difficult for us to point one out
The third main principle in 1 Corinthians is that a believer can be spiritual, soulish, or fleshly, even fleshy
He simply cannot discern spiritual things because he does not exercise his spirit, which is the spiritual organ to know the spiritual things
In the same way, we cannot know spiritual things if we live by the soul, by our mentality, reasoning, intellect, mind, will, or emotion
Fleshly denotes a person who does things under the influence of the nature of the flesh and partakes of the character of the flesh
In addition, before we quarrel with others, do something for others, or deal with others, we must learn to apply the cross to ourselves
We must realize that although we may have the best things, such as gifts, signs, knowledge, and wisdom, those things are not Christ Himself
There are eleven cases in this book, and in addition to the main principles and cases, there are several secondary principles
As we saw in the previous chapter, the first principle is Christ on the positive side and the cross to deal with the negative things
Christ is both theirs and ours , and we have been called into the fellowship, that is, the participation, of Christ
God has made Christ wisdom to us, including righteousness for our past, sanctification for the present, and redemption for the future
In our daily walk and in the church life, we must learn how to apply Christ as everything and to experience Him
Sin, self, the natural life, the old man, the worldly things, Satan, and darkness all must be dealt with by the cross
In order to experience Him apply Him and take Him as everything we must experience the cross of Christ to deal with all the negative things
There is no need for us to covet knowledge and the gifts; we must simply experience Christ under the work of the cross
He can be a spiritual man, a soulish or natural man, a fleshly man, or a fleshy man who is like an animal with no shame or feeling
He did not boast in himself, but in order to know the history of this apostle, we must read 1 and 2 Corinthians
His motive, his intention, his character, his real being, his activities, and his heavenly and spiritual ambition are all portrayed here
In this book there are also soulish people, exercising their mentality, reasonings, and knowledge to try to realize the spiritual things
Some in Corinth said that they were of Paul, others were of Apollos, others were of Cephas, and others even claimed that they were of Christ
On the negative side, the flesh has to be dealt with, while on the positive side, we must know that Christ is not divided
It is simply due to the fact that people do not know Christ on the positive side and do not experience the cross on the negative side
If they had applied the first principle, the principle of Christ and the cross, there would have been no lawsuit
To experience the cross is to deal not only with wrong and negative things but also with lawful things right things and even our own rights
We must learn how to experience the cross even in dealing with lawful things so that we may take care of others
We may have the thought that the experience of the cross is mainly to deal with wrong things, wrong attitudes, and other wrong matters
Although we have the right to do many lawful things, we need to take care of the building up of the Body and the members of the Body
It is also to help them to realize the real experience of the cross in order to deal with the natural man and the self
On the one hand, we should not be 'Pharisees' or make others to be 'Pharisees,' while on the other hand, we should not lower the standard
The Lord's table, however, is for the communion, the fellowship, of the saints; it is the Lord's feast for the fellowship of the Body
Today many Christians pay attention to the remembrance of the Lord, but they neglect and even oppose the matter of the Body
We must be humble to submit ourselves to His headship and be submissive to the Body that is we must be right with the Head and with the Body
Following this, verse 13 says, 'For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free'
The more we have the gifts, function with the gifts, and exercise the gifts, the more we need to build up the Body
These few were soulish persons because they tried to reason concerning the resurrection by their mental understanding
The ultimate consummation of the Body of Christ will transpire on the day Christ returns and life swallows up death
At that time the Body of Christ will be in its full consummation, testifying what Christ is and how much He is
Even if we give something on the Lord's Day, in the sight of God it still may not be in the principle of the Lord's Day
In the foregoing eleven cases, there are spiritual persons, soulish persons, fleshly persons, and fleshy persons
According to the history of the Jews, they were saved by the Passover in Egypt, delivered out of Egypt, and brought into the wilderness
We need to read the last part of chapter nine together with the first part of chapter ten; these two portions should not be separated
The end of chapter nine tells us that there is a race to run , and chapter ten tells us that the Israelites ran their race and failed
Is the principle that to be saved is one thing, but to be rewarded or suffer loss through fire even though we are saved is another
In this case, we may not receive the reward of the fullness of the riches of the good land but may suffer a certain kind of loss
When we minister, we not only pass on the knowledge about Christ to others, but we minister Christ Himself through the word into them
They are composed as letters not merely by knowledge or word but of the very essence, the very element of Christ
Apparently, we may not bring in anything of death, but we may draw people's attention away from life to many other things
When someone ministers, it may seem that there is nothing of death, but there may be no life there, only something other than life
The deeper meaning of this phrase is that when we deal with things or pay attention to things other than life, that is a killing
The living letters of Christ can be composed only by the Spirit, by the ministering of life, not by knowledge, teaching, or doctrine
Verses 17 and 18 of chapter three say, 'And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
Verse 18 says that we behold and reflect not 'in' a mirror but 'like' a mirror, since we ourselves are the mirrors
There is no need to see this person directly because we can see him in the mirror; the mirror reflects him by beholding him
As the mirrors, we originally beheld something other than Christ, but that has been done away with by Christ's redemption
Now as mirrors we are free and unveiled to behold Christ, and the more we behold Christ, the more His image is impressed into us
The real ministry of life is to help people realize how to behold Christ in an unveiled way as the mirrors and be transformed into His image
If a mirror beholds a person for merely half a minute, not much of that person will be reflected in the mirror
The longer we as the mirrors behold Christ, the more we are transformed into His image to become a full reflection of His image
We will know how to help others to be dealt with by Him, how to put off their veils, and how to turn their heart
By the working of the cross and the living Christ being wrought into us, we have the ministry and we become the ministry
Verse 16 says, 'Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day'
At this time however not only our body is consumed but our soul is also consumed while at the same time our soul is revived with our spirit
The relationship between the soul and the body is consumed, and the relationship between the soul and the spirit is revived and renewed
Because our soul is related to the body the Lord raises up suffering for our body in order to turn our soul away from the body to the spirit
It is purified from a relationship with the body and brought into a revived and renewed relationship with the spirit
Our soul will be purified, adjusted, renewed, and turned to the spirit to cooperate with the spirit and be incorporated with the spirit
Gradually, the more they suffered physically, the more their mind, will, and emotion were turned from the body to the spirit
In other books written by the apostle Paul, he called himself a servant or slave, but in this book he uses mostly the word minister
At that time around the Mediterranean Sea there was a custom that one could be sold to a master to be a bondman, someone without any freedom
The word minister, on the other hand, means that something of the Lord has been wrought into someone to make him the minister of the Lord
He may know how to submit to him, but he does not know what his master intends to do and what his thoughts and desires are
In order to be a minister and deal with people on behalf of his master, a person must be wrought by his master
The foreign minister of a country, such as the American ambassador to China, must be a man who knows the affairs of his government
If someone is a citizen of a country yet does not know anything about his government's affairs, he can never be a minister of his country
In the same way, if something of the Lord has been wrought into a servant of the Lord, he becomes a minister of the Lord
In 2 Corinthians the term minister is used more than in other books because in this book the servants of the Lord are wrought by the Lord
Something of the Lord's character, life, intention, desire, and purpose has been wrought into them to make them the ministers of Christ
Love is the source of grace; grace is the expression, the emergence, of love; and fellowship is the transmission of this grace to us
When we have the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, we enjoy the grace of Christ, and when we enjoy the grace of Christ, we have the love of God
They deal with gifts and knowledge on the negative side and with the living Christ working within us through His cross on the positive side
For thousands of years of human civilization, there has never been anything as prevailing and prominent as the law given to man
According to the human thought, not only philosophy and ethics but also certain religions formed among people are helpful to some extent
It is greater, better, and higher than all philosophies and teachings of ethics and all forms of religion on the earth
Galatians 3:19 tells us that the law 'was added because of the transgressions,' but it was not something originally intended by God
The law was not part of God's original purpose, and it is not a part of His ultimate purpose, His ultimate consummation
During the process of fulfilling God's eternal purpose, something happened, so the law was added to correct and adjust the situation
According to Galatians 3 God began to preach the gospel to mankind at least in Genesis 12 when He promised Abraham a seed
The message of the gospel is, 'In you shall all the nations be blessed,' and the content of this message is, 'your seed, who is Christ'
He does not say, 'And to the seeds,' as concerning many, but as concerning one: 'And to your seed,' who is Christ'
The content of the message is that Christ is the unique seed because God's intention and purpose is to give us Christ as everything
At a certain point in time, before the fullness of the time , God came in to promise that He would give a seed, Christ
On the one hand, Christ as the seed is a blessing, and on the other hand, this seed is the one who inherits the blessing
God's intention in giving us the law is that we will break the law in order to prove that we are sinful and that we need Christ
Even such a good thing as the law was utilized by the enemy, Satan, to frustrate God's people from contacting Christ
The Judaizers, those Jews who were so much for Judaism, stressed the law to such an extent that it substituted for Christ
It was written with the purpose to make us clear that the law is not Gods ultimate intention and it is not something of Gods original plan
Since the Christ of God has come, we are now in the schoolmaster's house, and we are even one with the schoolmaster
God's intention is that we enjoy Christ, have Christ, experience Christ, and live out Christ by and in the Spirit
If we are in the Spirit, then Christ is everything to us, but if we are in our self, our flesh, we will try to keep the law
Negatively speaking, we are dead and have nothing to do with the law, and on the positive side, the cross brings us into the Spirit
When we are in the Spirit, we have Christ as our life, we enjoy Christ as everything, we experience Christ, and we live out Christ
One day God came in and revealed not a religion, a system, a set of forms, teachings, or practices but a person in him
Although Paul was zealous for his forefathers' religion and was one hundred percent for it, God revealed Christ in him
Christ became life, revelation, and vision within him, and He became the preaching, the work, and the activity outside of him
The gospel of the living person of Christ realized and experienced by Paul was not taught to him by man but was a revelation by Jesus Christ
Paul, the writer of this book, proved to them that the primary item given by God is not the law but His promise
We must receive the Spirit to enjoy Christ as everything, to be in Christ, to be one with Him, and to be of Christ
Chapter three reveals that it is not a matter of keeping the law by ourselves, but a matter of being in Christ by the Spirit
Because we are full-grown ones, sons who are of age, we are entitled to the sonship to inherit whatever Christ is
Galatians 5 tells us that since Christ has set us free from the law and has made us one with Him, we should not go back to the law
If we return to the law, then Christ will profit us nothing, and we will be brought to nought, separated from Christ
Although the self and the flesh have been dealt with already on the cross of Christ, this has to be applied and experienced by us
It is difficult for translators to decide whether these portions refer to the Holy Spirit or to our human spirit
Verse 17 says, 'The flesh lusts against the Spirit,' and verse 22 speaks of 'the fruit of the Spirit,' both using the definite article
Although these verses contain the same grammatical construction, some versions render spirit in the former and Spirit in the latter
As we have seen, God's intention is that Christ be everything to us, and Christ is in us, that is, in our spirit
We know this because 14 contains the same thought saying Who gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age
The world as a whole is composed of many ages, and each age is the part of the world which we contact at the present
In our life, living, and daily walk, we know nothing of circumcision or uncircumcision; we only know one thing-to be a new creation
Eventually we have to say that this guiding, leading, enlightening, strengthening, helping, and speaking Spirit is the grace Himself
Grace in our spirit is nothing less than the Triune GodGod Himself in Christ as the Spiritenjoyed by us daily hourly and moment by moment
It is the gracious God in His Son by the Spirit to be enjoyed by us as our comfort our strength our peace our might and as everything to us
We must know this grace, and we must know how to exercise our spirit because this wonderful grace is in our spirit
If we do not know how to discern our spirit, we are like the children of Israel who wandered in the wilderness
The book of Hebrews speaks of the temple with its three parts-the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies
Similarly, Egypt, the wilderness, and the good land of Canaan correspond to our body, soul, and spirit respectively
To enjoy Christ as the Passover in Egypt was similar to enjoying the sin offerings on the altar in the outer court
We need not only the Holy Spirit; even more we need our human spirit which is able to cooperate with the Holy Spirit
Without the proper bulb to cooperate with the electricity, the electricity cannot be applied to perform its function
After the day of resurrection and the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit in all His aspects was given to the believers
We may pay much attention to the Holy Spirit while neglecting our human spirit, which is where the real need is
We can realize the things revealed in this book in a spiritual way not in a religious moral or ethical way or merely in the way of knowledge
The way of ethics belongs one hundred percent to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, not to the tree of life
We must forget about our natural mentality natural concepts mere doctrines and teachings our religious understanding and the way of ethics
Many Christians have never noticed that in the New Testament there is such a special term, the eternal purpose
Time bridges the two ends of eternity, and upon this bridge there is a process in which God's purpose is accomplished
Because God has an eternal plan, He needs an economy, a dispensation, arrangement, administration, stewardship, and government
In order to fulfill God's plan, God has an operation, and the grace of God is the spiritual and divine capital in God's operation
The church is a great matter; it was planned by God, and strictly speaking it is the very economy of God for His plan
What God planned and what He is operating to carry out is the church, so the church is the very center of God's economy
In order to understand the church, we must realize that it is the center of God's plan and the very substance of His economy
These verses once again mention the Three of the Divine Trinity-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-yet They are one God
These Three cooperate with one another for us to realize the fullness of God, that is, to make the fullness of God one with us
The fullness of God becomes our experience; that is, we are filled unto all the fullness of the Triune God, the fullness of the Godhead
Matthew 28:19 tells us to baptize people into the name, not into the names, of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
In the same way, throughout the book of Ephesians there are many verses referring to the Divine Trinity, but they are for our experience
In Galatians Paul said, 'It pleased God to reveal His Son in me' , 'It is Christ who lives in me' , and 'Christ is formed in you'
These verses do not speak of the Spirit of Christ or Christ in the Spirit; they clearly indicate that Christ Himself is in us
That there is one in us indicates that the Father is the Son and the Son is the Spirit; otherwise, there must be three in us
In the Scriptures it is clear and unarguable that the Spirit is in us, Christ is in us, and the Father is in us
We will see the whole picture that the Father is in the Son, the Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is within us
In order to understand the church, we have to know the church in the way of one God, one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body
To be baptized is to be buried, to have a clearance, a complete severance from the old living, the old creation, and all old matters
By His life He will swallow up death, and by the newness of life He will swallow up all the oldness of the old creation
Ephesians 2:15 tells us that Christ created one new man in Himself out of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles
The new man is not an individual man but a corporate man, because verse 15 says that it was created from two peoples
Besides these four aspects, the church is also God's habitation, His dwelling place in spirit , and the soldier, the warrior
Through the processes of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection the Triune God has imparted Himself into us as life
That the church is the Body of Christ means that it is the very expression of Christ, and Christ is the life within the church
Although the church on the earth may sometimes appear to be a mess, it is still in the principle of the fullness of Christ
That a wife is one with her husband typifies that the church is one with Christ; this is the great mystery in Ephesians 5:32
When Adam was a bachelor, he had no fullness, but when he was given a wife to match him as his counterpart, she became his fullness
Just as our body is the place in which we exist, our habitation, so the church is the Body of Christ to contain Christ and to express Him
If we know how to discern and exercise our spirit, we can realize God's presence, which is His indwelling in the church
We must learn how to discern and exercise our spirit in order to experience God's presence more and more in our spirit and in the church
The fourth main point is that this book shows us the real condition and nature of the materials for the building of the church
Even in Romans the apostle Paul did not reveal our original situation and condition so all-inclusively and deeply as in Ephesians
Ephesians tells us that we were not only sinful but dead in sins, and not only sinners but rebels joined as one with God's enemy
From these dry bones God built up His house, His dwelling place, and He formed an army to fight the battle for God
We may worry about the building of the church, but God does not worry because it already has been accomplished
Whenever and wherever a person repents before God and believes in the Lord Jesus, immediately the Holy Spirit comes into him
In the same way, the principle of the work of the Spirit is for us to 'tune to the station' of repentance and faith
By doing this, we tune ourselves properly and pick up the heavenly 'radio waves'; that is, in our experience we receive the Holy Spirit
Without the Spirit as the transmission we cannot be one with Christ; He will be separated from us by space and time
If any part of creation does not keep its position and breaks the order, the representation and expression of God is damaged in that part
Our walk must be a walk that expresses Christ exalts Christ testifies Christ ministers Christ releases Christ and shares Christ with others
In summary, our walk today must be a walk by the Spirit, in the Body, in the order and government of God, and in Christ
The seventh main point revealed in Ephesians is the enemy of God, Satan, the devil, who frustrates and damages God's purpose
The term ruler indicates that he has a kingdom, and under him are the principalities, authorities, powers, legions, and dominions
In his kingdom there are officers that help him to reign; these are the evil spirits, the spirits of darkness and wickedness
Ephesians shows us how the church expresses God's interests on the positive side and deals with God's enemy on the negative side
Man was created to rule the earth and in particular to rule over the creeping things, among which is the serpent, the devil
The church is the expression of the Triune God; 4:24 tells us that the new man was created according to God, that is, in His image
Chapter one tells us that God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing and that we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit
Chapter three tells us that we need to be strengthened with power through the Spirit into our inner man, our spirit
All the matters and teachings in Ephesians are realized in spirit, that is, in the Holy Spirit mingled with our human spirit
In order to realize and experience all that is mentioned in this book, we must know how to exercise our spirit
All spiritual experiences are concentrated into this mingled spirit-the Holy Spirit mingled with the human spirit
If we do not know how to exercise our spirit to realize the Holy Spirit, all of these matters will be mere doctrines in our memory
Students of the Scriptures may ask why the book of Philippians is inserted between the two sister books of Ephesians and Colossians
Because of this, Philippians, the book on the experience of Christ, immediately follows Ephesians, the book on the church
The more we love Christ and live in Him by Him and with Him and the more we experience Him the more we sense our deep need for the church
While we are on this earth, we live not by ourselves but by Christ as our life, and we live not for ourselves but for Christ as our purpose
If we live for ourselves, we cannot say that for us to live is Christ; we would have to say that for us to live is we ourselves
To say that Christ is magnified in us is abstract, but to say that Christ is magnified in our body is more concrete
We are living here to express Christ, exalt Christ, and honor Christ, and our life, living, and being are to follow Christ as our purpose
Conybeare tells us that the Greek word for supply is a technical word referring to the choragus the leader of the chorus on the Greek stage
The Spirit of God at the beginning of the Old Testament was not as rich as the Spirit of Jesus Christ after Pentecost
On the day of Pentecost the Spirit was poured out from the ascended Christ, and within this Spirit were all these elements
A cup of plain water contains only the water, but if we add tea, sugar, and other ingredients, the water becomes richer
When we take this dose, one element kills germs, another element supplies nourishment, and other elements supply other needs
By the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ we can live Christ to magnify Him, and we can say, 'For to me, to live is Christ'
The principle of this pattern is that someone with the highest life and position would be willing to live in a humble way
Christ has the highest life, the life of God, and He has the highest position, which is equality with God, yet He would not grasp that
The pattern given to us by Christ is that one has a life in the highest position, yet he is willing to live a life in the lowliest way
When they enjoy their own riches, they are generous to themselves, but in giving their riches to others they are not generous
If they mean business to take Christ as their life and pattern, they should lower their standard in the way they spend for their living
If we would not do this, if we would keep our standard and grasp our position, we will waste what God has given us
We cannot shine as luminaries until we lower the standard of our living and are willing to give up our rightful position
He gave up the high standard of being equal with God, put it aside, and lowered Himself to live in poverty as a lowly man from Nazareth
If we are serious, we have to lower our position and standard and be willing to be poured out on the altar as a drink offering
Although Paul was aged and very experienced in Christ, he did not have the assurance that he had arrived at the goal
In the Old Testament the good land of Canaan was the goal for all the people of Israel after they were saved and delivered out of Egypt
Paul's imprisonment provided the circumstances in which he was put into the mold of Christ's death that he might be conformed to His death
The word resurrection is composed with a prefix and should be translated extra-resurrection or out-resurrection
Of all those who share in that resurrection, some will enjoy a special resurrection, an outstanding resurrection
Christ is the resurrection in a general way , but Christ as the out-resurrection is a special portion of Christ as a reward
What things in verse 7 refers to the religious things, the things in Judaism as mentioned in the previous verses
In verse 8, however, Paul dropped not only the religious things but all things on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus
When we teach a young student addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, we initiate him by giving him the basic principles
They are like people who have never learned the principles of mathematics; no matter what problem they come across, they cannot solve it
We can never and should never forget Philippians 1:19, which speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
The current, the transmission, of the electricity is the electricity itself, just as the circulation of blood is the blood itself flowing
Without the blood, there is no circulation, but we use the term circulation to describe the movement of the blood
In the same way, the Holy Spirit is the transmission of the Lord, although in actuality the Spirit is the Lord Himself
Christ could not abide in us and we could not abide in Him until the things mentioned John 14 were accomplished
For Christ to be our power and our secret is not an objective matter; it is one hundred percent subjective to us
If we are impressed deeply with all of these points in the four sections of Philippians, this book will be very clear to us
We must take Christ as our life and our expression, our pattern and our example, our goal and our aim, and our secret and our power
In writing Colossians the apostle was much in the spirit, expressing from the spirit of prayer what was on his heart and in his spirit
By ourselves we cannot thoroughly explain what God is and what God intends to do; the answer is in the book of Colossians
The King James Version was translated in 1611 and John Nelson Darby published his New Translation in the second half of the previous century
An image is an expression; that Christ is the image of God means that He is the expression, the explanation, of what God is
God is embodied in Christ; all that God is and has within Himself, that is, all the fullness of the Godhead, dwells in Christ bodily
To find the meaning of fullness, we should not use our imagination but rather trace the usage of this word in the divine record
When the Son of God was incarnated as a man, with Him there was the fullness of God, and of this fullness we have all received
Christ as the mystery of God includes these three matters-the image of God, the embodiment of God, and the very center of God's will
The first chapter of Colossians reveals that Christ is God , Christ is part of the creation , and Christ accomplished redemption
The Firstborn of all creation refers to God's old creation, while the Firstborn from the dead refers to God's redemption
All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being'
To be sure, Christ is not the reality of the negative things in the universe, such as sin, the world, self, Satan, and the evil spirits
In the Scriptures many trees are types of Christ, such as the tree of life , the apple tree , the cedar tree , and the fir tree
Colossians 1:12 says, 'Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light'
If you do not have Christ you are a person of vanity but if you have Christ you are a person of reality you have Him and He is everything
He is not a religion, a doctrine, a set of teachings, or even Christianity, but an all-inclusive, real, and living Christ
The book of Colossians was written because many of those believers did not know how to experience Christ in such a way
You should appreciate that you are being shown the way to take Christ, experience Him, and apply Him as everything
They will be the living witnesses, the living testimonies, of how dear, how real, how precious, how rich, and how living Christ is
In Him also includes the meaning of walking by Him, just as travelling in a car means that we travel by the car
In the early days of the church, the Colossian believers were confused and carried away from the knowledge of Christ
According to church history, they were distracted by Gnosticism, a philosophy composed of Jewish, Egyptian, Persian, and Greek teachings
Verse 8 speaks of philosophy; in writing this, Paul had in mind Gnosticism, the teaching and thoughts of human wisdom
In China, for example, many Christians were distracted by the ethical teachings of Confucius from the real and living experience of Christ
We must reject and abandon not only the bad things but even the good things, the best teachings invented by man
We may consider that philosophy is good because it helps us to be better persons, to have a better living, which is a glory to God
We Christians have received Christ as our life and as our everything, and now we must learn not to know any good thing other than Christ
According to Colossians, the will of God is to make Christ everything to us, to give us Christ as our portion, our life, and our everything
What we are speaking here may be considered as instructions telling us that we need to know Christ and walk in Him
The more we know and realize Him, the more we sense that we need Him, and the more we are willing to experience Him
When we read, we need to exercise our mind to understand the words, and we may even need to go to a dictionary
At this time we will know Christ not merely according to the letter but according to spiritual understanding and realization
In the previous chapter we saw that eating drinking the feasts and the Sabbath are a shadow of the things to come but the body is of Christ
Following this, we need to pray in order to exercise our spirit to realize the spiritual matters, the spiritual content in this word
To walk worthily of the Lord and grow by the full knowledge of God is to live and walk according to spiritual wisdom and understanding
Verse 11 says, 'Being empowered with all power, according to the might of His glory, unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy'
It is that the Holy Spirit within us strengthens us, energizes us, and imparts the might of God's glory into us
The tenth main point in Colossians is found in 2:7, which says, 'Having been rooted and being built up in Him'
On the one hand, we ourselves need to be built up with Christ just as a little child needs to be built up into an adult
Although we have been rooted in Christ, the measure of Christ within us may be small; we may not have an adequate measure of Christ
As we are plants, Christ is the soil to us, and as we are the building, He is the very material with which we are built
We need to grow to a greater measure of Christ, and the way to grow in measure is by feeding on Christ, taking Him in, and digesting Him
We are identified with Christ in four things-in His death, in His burial, in His resurrection, and in His ascension
We realize that we have been united and identified with Christ; we are dead, buried, resurrected, and ascended in Him and with Him
In this way we enjoy Christ not only by ourselves but by and in the corporate Body, which is the church, the new man
The glory which is Christ Himself as life will shine out through our body to bring our entire body and our entire person into glory
Colossians 1:12 tells us that Christ is the portion of the saints, but we must know how to enjoy and apply Him
Joints are for supplying the nourishment needed by the Body, and sinews are for knitting the members of the Body together
Among the believers, some are joints that nourish and supply, while others are sinews that join, unite, and knit the members together
By this nourishment and knitting the Body receives the supply from the Head, and it grows with the growth of God
God increases within us, because what we receive from Christ the Head is something of God, even the fullness of the Godhead
The more we receive Christ, the more we have the increase of God, and it is by this increase that the Body grows and is built up
Among all the Epistles written by the apostle Paul, the two to the Thessalonians are the simplest, and they are among the earliest
Why then are these two Epistles placed toward the end of his fourteen Epistles in the arrangement of the New Testament?
We have clearly and thoroughly seen Christ as the Head the church as the Body and the way that the members of this Body should walk and live
These two books are found at this juncture because the second coming of Christ is the consummation of the life of the universal man
One of the best ways to study the Word is to compare two books, two chapters, two passages, two verses, or even two words
At the end of chapter two, verses 19-20 say, 'For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at His coming?
In chapter one the writer talks about the Christian walk; then he encourages the believers with the coming of the Lord
In chapter two Paul teaches us about the fostering of the believers and he ends this section with the coming of the Lord as an encouragement
Although the apostle used the Lord's second coming as an encouragement in his first epistle, some people misused it
The news concerning this must have come to the apostle, who then wrote the second epistle to adjust, correct, and balance the believers
For it is the mystery of lawlessness that is now operating, but only until the one now restraining goes out of the way
If we read this word carefully, we can realize that it is a correction, a judgment, and a balance for the extreme teaching
The believers had been encouraged by Paul's word concerning the coming of the Lord, but they were pushed too far
Throughout the centuries Christians have made many mistakes concerning the Lord's coming simply because they neglected to be balanced
Our hope as Christians is the second coming of the Lord Jesus, but some people believe in the Lord's coming in an unbalanced way
There are also many believers who overstress the second aspect when they study the different signs related to the end times
They can sleep well and rise late, being sure that the Lord Jesus cannot come back yet because all the signs have not been fulfilled
In the first Epistle to the Thessalonians there are three words which are very important-faith, love, and hope
It is this living faith, this saving faith, that not only turns us back to the Lord but also encourages us to go on
To faith are added more and more virtues until eventually love is added in two aspects-love for the brothers and love for all people
Although many times we are suffering or persecuted and have many problems, we sense a sweetness toward the Lord
Very often we cannot and would not do certain things and we determine to not be defeated simply because we realize that we will see the Lord
We are encouraged by the Lord's coming, but we realize that the Lord still gives us the time to do things in a proper way
Thessalonians 2:1 says, 'Now we ask you, brothers, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him'
If we do not know the proper meaning and usage of this word, we can never understand the Lord's coming in an accurate way
By the study of the entire New Testament, we know that the Lord's parousia will last for a certain period of time
Whereas no one can know the time of the beginning of the Lord's parousia, the end of His parousia can be determined by signs
The main emphasis of the two books to the Thessalonians is that the Christian walk and living is one of three dimensionsfaith love and hope
Faith is the beginning as the foundation the source love is the process as the structure the main part and hope is the end the consummation
The purpose of these two books is to show us that we need to walk, work, and live in the light of the Lord's coming
We dare not be defeated or love the world, the fleshy things, and the things of this age, because one day we have to meet Him
Rather, may the Lord be merciful that we would have the work of faith, the labor of love, and the endurance of hope
By studying these particular books carefully, we can realize that the Epistles, from Romans to Jude, are divided into two main groups
The thirteen books from Romans to Philemon are the first group, and the eight books from Hebrews to Jude are the second group
The first main group of Epistles, which speaks of the definition of the Body of Christ, is further divided into two sections
Without 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon, we would have the life of the church, but we would not know how to practice the church life
In Acts some elders are established, and in Acts 6 some persons are appointed, but just by Acts alone we do not know that they are deacons
In addition, we do not know what kind of persons the elders should be and in what way they should be established
Following the section concerning the matters of life, there are four books dealing with the practical side of the church life
While the Lord is delaying His coming, these few books help us to know how to conduct ourselves in the church life
No doubt there are some instructions, but these books present mainly the definition and meaning of the church as the Body of Christ
We must spend more time in the first nine books to experience what is taught and what is defined on the life side
We must take care of another important matter, the practice of the church life according to the teachings of life
We have to exercise in prayer, exercise in the study of the Word, exercise to visit people, and exercise in how to talk with people
Godliness includes many items; it includes everything relating to God and especially relating to our relationship with God
As a rule, what we see in many so-called churches is mainly the preaching of message after message without exercise
The way we take for the ministry in the church must include the way of the four books from 1 Timothy to Philemon, the way of exercise
If we sit and listen to someone speak year after year, we may think that we know everything, and we can easily criticize everyone
Of criticizing someone, we should try to do a better job than he does; then we will be clear, and we will be humbled
If someone says the chairs are arranged wrongly or the piano is played poorly, we may say, 'You are completely right
He trained the leading ones of the small groups how to practice and how to bring the saints in their groups into the same practice
Now he was charged by Paul to commit all that he had learned to others, who in turn would be competent to teach others
After we minister for a while in a certain place, some who are competent to teach others should be produced by our ministry
The main thought of this section of the Epistles is that we need instruction in order to know how to conduct ourselves in the church
While we have the principle, we need to pray and consider according to the situation, the present need, and the Lord's leading
Although these four books give us instructions for the practice of the church life, they still stress the inner life
There are a number of important points about the inner life in these books, because in his instructions Paul often refers to life
Although these books do not give us definitions concerning life, they give us many points relating to the inner life
1 Timothy 4:2 says, 'By means of the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, of men who are branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron'
These persons make their conscience to have no feeling; the sense, the consciousness, of their conscience has been destroyed
By reading all these verses, we can realize how much we need a good, pure, and sensitive conscience for the practice of the church life
It is the same root word used in Philippians 4:13, which says, 'I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me'
The apostle Paul learned to experience Christ as his life, empowering him all the time, and he learned to practice the mystery of godliness
He was pressing on toward the goal for the kingdom and at the end of his race he said that the Lord would save him into His heavenly kingdom
We must be empowered within by Christ as our power, and we must also be warned and attracted by His heavenly kingdom
We must realize that one day the Lord will appear to reward His servants, so we must fight, run, and keep the faith
No matter what kind of practice we may have or what kind of teaching we give, it must be something of the living Christ within our spirit
Apparently this book is nearly the same as 1 and 2 Timothy, although it is not as complete, but it is still part of the holy Scriptures
It is a principle that with all important matters and main points in the Scriptures, there is the need of confirmation
Not only do these books confirm each other, but the two recipients, Timothy and Titus, also could confirm each other
If only one of them had received instruction from Paul, there would not be a testimony or confirmation for that instruction
No matter how good the worldly system is, it is still according to the course of this age, and as such it is no doubt of Satan
We must lay these things aside and come back to the Lord and to His Word, to study His Word and seek His guidance in all things
The only things in which we should be the same as Christianity are those things that are entirely from the Spirit and from the Lord's Word
By the Lord's sovereignty, the short book of Philemon comes at the end of the section on the practice of the church life
Onesimus had run away from his master, and according to the custom in those times an escaped slave could be put to death
For this reason, Onesimus was put into prison, but while he was in prison, he met Paul, the messenger of the Lord
Following this, Paul sent him back to his master, Philemon, and entreated Philemon to treat Onesimus as a beloved brother
If a brother is a president or a king, it may be difficult for him to properly practice being a brother in the church
When differences of rank in human society are brought into the practice of the church, the nature of the church is changed
If someone attains to a high office, he will see the difficulty it causes; it will be hard for him to come down from his 'throne'
It is also difficult for the wife of an officer to come down off her 'throne' to talk with the wife of an enlisted man
In this respect, the United States may be better than other countries, but even in this country there is the problem of social rank
If we feel we are different from such a brother, if it is hard to humble ourselves to sit with him, we must be reminded that we are wrong
In the practice of the church life, we need to learn this basic principle, which will correct, adjust, and balance us
In this definition, there is the aspect of teaching and the aspect of instruction, the side of life and the side of practice
Why then is there the need to have another group of eight Epistles: Hebrews, James, 1 and 2 Peter, John's three Epistles, and Jude?
The latter group, however, was written by a composition of writers, including Paul, James, Peter, John, and Jude
There is the need of this book to help Christians, especially the Jewish Christians, know the position of the Old Testament and Judaism
The Old Testament is simply a type of Christ, and since Christ, the reality, has come, the type must be put away
The concepts of suffering, the cross, and judgment are found in these two books, but this is not the central thought
Many of the sufferings we experience are due to God's government, and judgment is also related to God's government
In the first thirteen Epistles, Paul does not deal with this point very much, so there is the need for 1 and 2 Peter as a supplement
In the same way, as the children of God we need to keep the rules and the regulations of the divine government
The supplement of 1 and 2 Peter tells us that we, the people of God, must realize that there is a divine government in the universe
John's three Epistles show us how God's children fellowship with the Father and with one another in the Father's family
The short book of Jude is a supplement to deal with apostasy, which was not dealt with in the first thirteen Epistles
Five mattersJudaism works and faith the government of God the divine fellowship and apostasyare all dealt with in these last eight Epistles
Because this supplement of eight books is added to the Epistles, every matter is covered, and there are no unanswered questions
Following these eight books, there is Revelation as the ultimate consummation and conclusion of the New Testament and the entire Scriptures
We have a picture of the work of God for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose, which consummates in a building
In nature in principle and in nearly every aspect this building is exactly the same as the golden lampstands in chapters one through three
The entire city of New Jerusalem is a great golden lampstand; Christ, the Lamb, is the lamp on this stand; and God in Christ is the light
Whereas all the local churches are the golden lampstands in time, the great, universal, unique lampstand is in eternity
The local lampstands are the same in nature, in life, in function, and in almost every aspect as the unique, great, universal lampstand
After the Lord accomplished redemption, He ascended to the heavens; it is at this time that God's judgment began
Revelation 4 through 20 is a long record starting from the time of the Lord's ascension until the time of His second coming
The Roman Empire, the Spanish Empire, and even the British Empire were judged by God because they did not correspond with the lampstand
God used Assyria and Babylon to judge other nations, including Israel, but afterward He turned around and judged these empires
According to the book of Revelation God is seeking after only one thingthe Body of Christ the church the lampstand as the testimony of Jesus
The one who conducts a training has the ground to say certain things to the trainees, but you do not have the same ground with others
Do not believe in yourself too much when you see the situation, because your realization about it may not be correct
Apparently a person's situation is of one kind, but in actuality it may be of another kind, so it is foolish to discern things too fast
After we are trained, our eyes are opened to a certain extent, and it is easy for us to discern things according to our new understanding
Never go to a place or remain in your place to discern things according to your training and then criticize and make divisions
When people are ready to receive something take the opportunity to minister something but if they are not ready you should not go too fast
We all need to keep the oneness, and in order to keep the oneness you must learn not to damage or make trouble
Rather, always minister something positive of life, something of Christ, and let it work in people to deal with the negative things
