<h1 class="title">COMPILING CHILDREN&#8217;S LESSONS<br />
THAT BUILD UP A PROPER HUMANITY<br />
AND LEAD THE CHILDREN<br />
INTO A PROPER ENJOYMENT<br />
(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 2:2; 3:15</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman" start="3">
<li>In order to do the children&#8217;s work well, we need to pay attention to these three aspects: the teaching material, the training of the teachers, and the leading of the elders; after brothers are designated to compile material, the leading of the elders and the training of the teachers should follow-2 Tim. 2:2; Eph. 4:12-16; Heb. 13:17.</li>
<li>At the end of each lesson that we give the children, we can impress them with a short verse from the Bible; by ministering the lesson, we will lay a good foundation for them to receive something brief from the word of God-2 Tim. 3:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We may tell them that as children they need to be proper human beings who behave in a good way to honor their parents; we can even use illustrations from nature; this will interest them very much-cf. Rom. 1:20a.</li>
	<li>Then at the end we can read them, &#8220;Honor your father and your mother&#8221; (Exo. 20:12), explaining that this is the word of God in the Bible; we can ask them to keep it in mind, recite it, and explain to us what it means.</li>
	<li>The next time they come together, we can have them tell us what they heard the previous week and whether they put it into practice; we may ask them in what way they honored their parents in the past week.</li>
	<li>We must not give them anything in a premature way; rather, we should prepare the lessons according to their age:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We should give the five- and six-year-olds one thing and the seven- and eight-year-olds something else.</li>
		<li>Premature knowledge damages children; we need some brothers and sisters who understand this principle to prepare the lessons.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Gradually, we can help the children to know who God is, not in a religious way but in a very practical way; we can lead them to the point that they realize there is an almighty One, who is God-Exo. 3:6; 20:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Following this, we can help them to know God&#8217;s creation and even the fall of man; for this purpose we should not merely tell stories; instead, we should present these matters in a very practical way, using many illustrations:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The best time to present the fall of man is after we have helped them to know what a proper humanity is.</li>
		<li>We can tell them that we are all fallen creatures and that there is sin within us that weakens us; to speak concerning the fall in this way is very realistic-Rom. 7:18.</li>
		<li>In the same principle, we can tell them how the Lord Jesus came to accomplish redemption; we should not speak this as a mere story.</li>
		<li>We can use the lessons concerning proper humanity and the proper way to behave.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Then we can point out to them that the Son of God has died for us, and we can tell them about the cross, the death of Christ, and redemption without passing on mere religious knowledge-1 Cor. 15:3-4; Eph. 1:7.</li>
	<li>After the children reach a certain age, we can go on to tell them that Christ is life, not as a mere story but based on their failures and desires-John 11:25; 14:6; Col. 3:4.</li>
	<li>Without giving them too much knowledge, we can help them in a practical way to realize what God, creation, humanity, the fall, redemption, and Christ are, and eventually we can help them to receive the Lord and be saved in a definite way.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Perhaps there are brothers and sisters among us who are especially experienced and burdened for the children and who are preparing songs for the children:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The poetry must be composed for the young ones in a very skillful way; it is better not to have songs if the songs that we have are of a low standard.</li>
	<li>The brothers and sisters should also prepare songs for the children&#8217;s meetings; we should not treat the little ones like the older saints and have them sing the same songs that we do.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Parents like to hear their children sing:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The parents may be unhappy if you persuade them to believe in Jesus; but they will pay attention to their children&#8217;s singing; when they hear the songs, they will be touched.</li>
	<li>In the home meetings, we need to help even the children to call, speak, or sing a hymn and to quote or speak the word of the Bible.</li>
	<li>Everyone, both young and old, likes singing; singing is very sweet; you must be like a nursing mother, making your little ones feel pleasant by giving them something sweet.</li>
	</ol></li>
