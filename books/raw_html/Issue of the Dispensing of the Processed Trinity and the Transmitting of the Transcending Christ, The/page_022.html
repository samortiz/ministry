<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>For Transforming the Believers into<br>a Treasure to God as His Inheritance</H2><P>Eventually, this sealing is for God's heritage. This sealing transforms the believers into a treasure to God as His inheritance. In the Father's dispensing we were all made sons of God, but in the dispensing of Christ, the Son, we, the many sons of God, have been made a treasure as God's heritage, as God's inheritance. The Greek verb translated "were designated" in Ephesians 1:11 means "to choose or assign by lot." Hence, the clause "were designated as an inheritance" literally means that in Christ we were designated as a chosen inheritance for God. This inheritance was chosen through the transformation of the sealing Spirit. Thus, in the Son's dispensing all the sons of God become a treasure to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Make the Believers a Mark of God's Image</H2><P>In the Spirit's dispensing He seals us, putting a mark upon us. This mark bears an image with a form. The more we are sealed, the more we bear the image of God (2 Cor. 3:18b; Col. 3:10). The more we are sealed, the more we look like God. Eventually, the image we bear becomes not just an image, not just a mark, but an expression. Through the Spirit's sealing we express God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT'S DISPENSING IN<br>HIS PLEDGING TO THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>Eventually, this sealing becomes a pledging (Eph. 1:14). The more a piece of paper is sealed, the more the sealing ink will be on the paper. Likewise, the more the Spirit seals us, the more the Spirit shares with us God's element. This sealing element becomes a pledge to guarantee that God is our inheritance. The sealing declares that we are God's inheritance. Eventually, such a sealing becomes a pledge guaranteeing that God is our inheritance. The Spirit's pledging guarantees that God is our inheritance. How good it is that we are God's inheritance and He is our inheritance! Although a brother may lose his job, he is still God's inheritance, and God is still his inheritance. Under the Spirit's sealing and pledging, we do not need to worry about anything. No matter what may happen to us, we are still God's inheritance, and He is still our inheritance. This is because we are participating in the Spirit's sealing and pledging as His dispensing.</P><P>The Spirit's sealing and pledging eventually make us God in His life and nature, but not in His Godhead. They also cause us to have the full assurance that we are God's and God is ours.</P>
