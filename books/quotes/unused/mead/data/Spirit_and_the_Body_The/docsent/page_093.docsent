   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DENOMINATIONAL NAMES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sometimes people have argued with me and said, "Brother Lee, denominational names are not important.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They are simply a matter of convenience and do not mean anything."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I replied, "If the names do not mean anything, why don't you get rid of them?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You say the name means nothing, yet you still bear the name Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You are Mrs. Smith, but you wear a name tag that says Mrs. Jones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you are Mrs. Smith, why do you go by another name? If, as you say, this means nothing and is just a convenience, then drop it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you keep the title Mrs. Jones, it must mean that Mr. Jones is your illegal husband.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How ridiculous for you to say that you have never met Mr. Jones and that you simply use his name as a convenience!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Throughout the years I have done a great deal of traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not care to talk to those sitting next to me on the airplane because they often ask me questions that are difficult to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In talking to people they usually find out that I am a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then the question is asked about what kind of Christian I am.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I find this an insult.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times I have said, "I am simply a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Please don't ask me what kind of Christian I am, for there is only one kind of Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I were to say that I am the moon, would you ask what kind of moon I am?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This would be foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is just one moon.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please don't ask me what kind of moon I am."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes people do not believe that I am simply a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They insist that I must be a certain kind of Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes I am very strong with them and say, "If you can't believe me, it means that you are absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I cannot lie to you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I simply am what I am.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am just a Christian."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>More than twenty years ago I met an American missionary at a retreat center in the Philippines.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He proudly told me that he was a member of the Church of the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Until then, I knew nothing of this denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The name, the Church of the Nazarene, sounds abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE UNIQUE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Babylonian spirit may still be in our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord's recovery is mainly to bring us back to the genuine oneness, to the unique husband, to the one Body, and to the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we lose this oneness, we are no longer in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, we are repeating the history of Christianity, which is a history of divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many Christians do not care about this matter of division.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They say, "The Lord is not narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why are you so narrow?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we know the Bible, we shall see that with respect to division God is more than narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He will not permit any husband other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Read Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16 and see how narrow our God is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He told His people that they had no right to worship Him in the place of their choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, they had to go to the unique place which He had designated for the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this matter, God was narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those in the charismatic movement talk about the Body, but they do not care about divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As long as we are not in the oneness, we are not in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead, we are in a division.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Most of those who came into the Lord's recovery before 1970 are clear regarding the unique oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, those who have come into the recovery after 1970 may not be clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>During the first seven years of the Lord's recovery in this country, we spoke again and again about the unique oneness and about the unique ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But even those who are clear about the oneness of the church may find that the vision is fading.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At times, the vision may even vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, the vision of the unique ground of oneness needs to be restored.</S>
