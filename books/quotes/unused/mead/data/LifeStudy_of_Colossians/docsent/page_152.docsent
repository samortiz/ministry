   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST REPLACED BY GIFTS AND KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament three books portray the replacements of Christ: 1 Corinthians, Galatians, and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians deals with gifts and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1 Corinthians 1:7 Paul said that the Corinthians came behind in no gift.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, they had much knowledge, including spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nevertheless, they were carnal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Their knowledge did not help them adequately, and their gifts did not build them up.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul told them that when he first came to them, he determined not to know anything among them except Jesus Christ and Him crucified 1 Cor 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul realized that the Corinthians were occupied with knowledge and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For this reason, he emphasized the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that the Corinthian believers needed to live a crucified life, a life of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1 Corinthians 1:22 Paul said, For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To the Jews, the crucified Christ was a stumbling block, and to the Greeks, He was foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Neither the Jews nor the Greeks cared for such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They preferred a Christ of splendor to a Christ crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, Paul told them that he did not want to know anything among them except Christ and Him crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the book of 1 Corinthians Paul eventually indicated that to have the church life we need the experience of Christ crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church life must be a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What the Corinthian believers needed was to live a crucified Christ and not pay their attention to knowledge and spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Corinth Christ was replaced by knowledge and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the charismatic movement today, Christ is also replaced by the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Where in charismatic meetings is Christ emphasized and realized properly?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today Christ is still being replaced by knowledge and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of course, He is also replaced by the various forms, rituals, and ordinances of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>CHRIST REPLACED BY RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the book of Galatians we see that Christ was replaced by Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Judaism was a religion in which people worshipped the true God according to His holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This religion included the law, which had been given by God through Moses, and also circumcision, the ordinances, and the traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul advanced in this religion and surpassed his contemporaries.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But one day, when he was on the way to Damascus, the Lord Jesus appeared to him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time, God revealed the living Christ into Paul Gal 1:16a .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, in the book of Galatians we have a clear record of how Christ was replaced by the Jewish religion with the law, circumcision, and the traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the book of Galatians was written, not only had the Jews replaced Christ with such a religion, but even many saints had been influenced to turn from Christ to the law and circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to Galatians 5:2, if we are circumcised, Christ will not profit us at all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who seek to be justified by the law are actually brought to nought from Christ v. 4 . This means that if we try to be righteous by keeping the law, we shall be severed from Christ, and He will be of no effect to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates clearly that the law can replace Christ and keep God s people from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, circumcision annuls the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The law had been given by God, and circumcision and many rituals had been ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Jews used all these things apparently for God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the law, circumcision, and the ordinances, the components of the Jewish religion, replaced Christ and were used to distract the believers from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The saints in Galatia were distracted from Christ to certain God-given and God-ordained things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In their case, Christ was replaced by religion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>CHRIST REPLACED BY CULTURE</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to the book of Colossians, Christ is replaced by culture.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Any culture is a composition of a number of items.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Western culture, for example, is a composition of Hebrew religion, Greek philosophy, and Roman politics.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the book of Colossians was written, the culture in the region of Colosse included Hebrew religion, Greek philosophy, asceticism, mysticism, and Gnosticism.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although the word culture is not used in this book, culture is nonetheless strongly indicated or implied.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In 3:11 Paul says that in the new man there is no Greek or Jew, no circumcision or uncircumcision, no barbarian or Scythian.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These terms indicate both religious and cultural distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Circumcision and uncircumcision refer to religion, whereas barbarian and Scythian refer to culture.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, the book of Colossians indicates that the ultimate replacement for Christ is our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As we consider the three books of 1 Corinthians, Galatians, and Colossians, we see many replacements for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ is replaced by knowledge and gifts, by religion with its law and ordinances, and by culture.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Among the Corinthians, Christ was replaced by knowledge and spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The same is true among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some people think that charismatic meetings are quite living.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But are these meetings living because of Christ or because of something else?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we are not careful, various things may come in to replace Christ in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If Christ is not replaced by knowledge or gifts, He may be replaced by religion or culture.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may use some man-made law or ordinance to replace Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Certain isms may come in to be a substitute for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our self-made and self-imposed culture may also replace Christ in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because there are so many different substitutes for Christ, we can say that in the experience of Christians throughout the centuries, Christ has been replaced in every way.</S>
