<h2 class=head5>(3) Withstanding to Stand</h2><p>Ephesians 6:13 and 14 say, “Therefore, take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness.” To withstand is to stand against. In fighting, the most important thing is to stand. In fighting against God’s enemy, we need to be able to stand. Having done all, we still must stand.<h2 class=head5>(4) Praying and Watching</h2><p>Ephesians 6:18 begins with the phrase “By means of all prayer and petition.” This phrase modifies the predicate “receive” in verse 17. By prayer we receive both the helmet of salvation and the word of God. This indicates that we need to receive the word of God by means of all prayer and petition.<p>The modifier “by means of all prayer and petition” actually is related to all six items of the armor in verses 13 through 17. It is by means of all prayer and petition that we gird our loins with truth, put on the breastplate of righteousness, have our feet shod with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace, take up the shield of faith, and receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Prayer is the unique way to apply the armor of God.<p>The believers wrestle against the Devil and his spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies not only by being empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength and by putting on the whole armor of God, but also by “praying at every time in spirit, and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints” (v. 18). Here Paul specifically says that we are to pray in our spirit, that is, in our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. This is the mingled spirit, our spirit mingled with God’s Spirit. Whenever we are in our spirit, we are also in the Holy Spirit, for our spirit is one with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17). Therefore, Paul’s charge to pray in spirit implies that we should pray in the Spirit of God, for the Spirit and our regenerated spirit are mingled in us.<p>In Ephesians 6:18 Paul speaks of “watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.” This indicates that we need to be watchful, on the alert for this prayer life. Furthermore, we need to watch unto prayer in all perseverance, making petition concerning all the saints and the apostles (vv. 19-20). As the new man, we must watch and pray so that we may fulfill the negative side of God’s purpose to fight against His enemy.
