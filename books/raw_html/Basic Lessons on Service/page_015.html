<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. By Drinking the Cup</H2><P>We also remember the Lord by drinking the cup (1 Cor. 11:25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) To Review the Redemption of the New Covenant</H2><P>Our drinking the cup is to review the redemption of the new covenant. For this point it would be good to read Matthew 26:27-28: "And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) To Receive God's Blessing</H2><P>To eat the bread is to receive life; to drink the cup is to receive blessing. In the Bible, the bread is called the bread of life (John 6:35a) and the cup is called the cup of blessing (1 Cor. 10:16a). Thus, to eat the bread means to receive the life supply and to drink the cup means to receive the blessing.</P><P>The cup indicates a portion&#151;either a portion of wrath or a portion of blessing. If we are condemned under God's judgment, the cup is a portion of wrath to us (Rev. 14:10). If we are forgiven and redeemed, the cup is a portion of blessing to us. The Bible does not say that we drink the blood but that we drink the cup. This means that the redeeming blood of the Lord Jesus becomes our cup, our portion.</P><P>When we drink the cup, we not only review the redemption of the new covenant but also receive God's blessing. This blessing is God Himself. Adam's fall caused man to lose God, but Christ's redemption brings God back to man. The losing of God in man's fall was the greatest loss. Now our gaining God back in Christ's redemption is the unique blessing. The cup as a portion is God Himself as the unique blessing to us.</P><P>Through this fellowship we can see how much the Lord's table implies. To remember the Lord is not merely to remember how He was God and how He became a man. To remember the Lord is to break the bread, to eat the bread, and to drink the cup in the reality of all their deep significances.</P>
