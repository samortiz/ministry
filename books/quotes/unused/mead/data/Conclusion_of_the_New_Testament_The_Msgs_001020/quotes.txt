[1]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE THE NEW TESTAMENT AND GOD'S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 1 Scripture Reading: Heb 10:7b; Matt 1:22; Luke 24:25-27, 44-46; Rom 1:2; 1 Cor 15:3-4; Col 1:25-27; Eph 1:9-10; 3:9-11; Rom 14:17; Rev 21:2, 10-11
[2]  In this series of messages we shall cover the conclusion of the New Testament.
[3]  In the Old Testament we can also see the matter of God's dispensing.
[4]  Genesis 1:27 says, "God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him."
[5]  Why did God create man in His own image?
[6]  Matthew 1:22 and 23 indicate this: "Now all this took place that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us."
[7]  The Development and the Reaping of the Seed Sown in the Old Testament
[8]  The kingdom of God is the Savior, the Lord Jesus, as the seed of life sown into His believers, God's chosen people Mark 4:3, 26 , and developing into a realm which God may rule as His kingdom in the divine life.
[9]  GOD'S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY God's Household Management, God's Household Administrative Arrangement, the Divine Dispensation
[10]  God's economy is an eternal plan made by God in Christ.
[11]  Regarding this, Ephesians 3:11 says, "According to the purpose of the ages which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[12]  Throughout the years we have given many messages on God's New Testament economy.
[13]  We need a vision of the central matter in the Bible the desire of God's heart to dispense Himself into His chosen people in His trinity for the producing of the church, which is the kingdom of God that will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal expression of the Triune God.
[14]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THREE GOD HIS PERSON 1
[15]  As we consider the various aspects of God's person, we shall see what kind of God intends to dispense Himself into us.
[16]  The Grace of Christ, the Love of God, and the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[17]  The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as life to us for our enjoyment John 1:17; 1 Cor 15:10 , the love of God is God Himself 1 John 4:8, 16 as the source of the grace of the Lord, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our participation.
[18]  These are not three separate matters but three aspects of one thing, just as the Lord, God, and the Holy Spirit are not three separate Gods but three "hypostases of the one same undivided and indivisible" God Philip Schaff .
[19]  Just before He was crucified in the flesh and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 , the Lord unveiled His mysterious trinity to His disciples in plain words John 14 17 , stating that the Son is in the Father and that the Father is in the Son 14:9-11 , that the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son 14:16-20 , that the Three, coexisting and coinhering simultaneously, are abiding with the believers for their enjoyment 14:23; 16:7-10; 17:21-23 , and that all the Father has is the Son's, and all the Son possesses is received by the Spirit to be disclosed, revealed, to the believers 16:13-15 .
[20]  The entire divine revelation in the book of Ephesians concerning the producing, existing, growing, building up, and fighting of the church as the Body of Christ is composed of the divine economy the dispensing of the Triune God into the members of the Body of Christ.
[21]  Chapter one unveils how God the Father chose and predestinated these members in eternity vv.
[22]  It is evident, therefore, that the divine revelation of the Trinity of the Godhead in the holy Word, from Genesis through Revelation, is not for the study of theology, but for the understanding of how God in His mysterious and marvelous trinity dispenses Himself into His chosen people so that we, as His chosen and redeemed people, may, as indicated in Paul's blessing to the Corinthian believers in 2 Corinthians 13:14, participate in, experience, enjoy, and possess the processed Triune God now and for eternity.
[23]  Modalism, Tritheism, and the Pure Revelation of the Triune God according to the Bible
[24]  Modalism teaches that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not all eternal and do not all exist at the same time, but are merely three temporary manifestations of the one God.
[25]  Certain of today's fundamental Bible teachers are actually tritheistic, perhaps unconsciously.
[26]  These teachers say not only that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinct but also that They are separate.
[27]  In this message we shall continue to be on the person of God.
[28]  The Father of Every Family in Heaven and on Earth
[29]  Ephesians 3:14 and 15 say, "For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, of whom every family in the heavens and on the earth is named."
[30]  The Father is the source not only of the regenerated believers, but also of the God-created mankind Luke 3:38 , of the God-created Israel Isa 63:16; 64:8 , and of the God-created angels Job 1:6 .
[31]  Since God is the source of the angelic family in the heavens and all the human families on earth, so it is of God that every family in the heavens and on earth is named, just as producers give names to their products and fathers give names to their children.
[32]  First Corinthians 11:3 says, "I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God."
[33]  God our Savior 1 Tim 4:10; Titus 2:13 and our Savior God 1 Tim 2:3; Titus 1:3; 2:10; 3:4 are titles particularly ascribed to God in the three books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, books that take God's salvation as a strong base for the teachings concerning God's New Testament economy 1 Tim 1:15-16; 2:4-6; 2 Tim 1:9-10; 2:10; 3:15; Titus 2:14; 3:5-7 .
[34]  Although God is invisible, the Son of His love Col 1:13 , "the effulgence of His glory and the express image of His substance" Heb 1:3 , is His image, expressing what He is.
[35]  Regarding the living God, Hebrews 9:14 says, "How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself spotless to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God."
[36]  God is also the immortal One dwelling in unapproachable light.
[37]  The saints who suffered martyrdom for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus recognized the very God, whom they served and who allowed them to be martyred, as such a sovereign Master, who is holy distinct from all things and true truthful in His nature and character and has made them holy sanctified, separated and true truthful, faithful to Him cf.
[38]  In this message we shall conclude our study of the aspects of God's person revealed in the New Testament.
[39]  God is the King in the parable of the marriage feast Matt 22:1-14 .
[40]  First, according to this parable, God sent "his slaves," the first group of the New Testament apostles, to call those who were invited to the marriage feast v. 3 . Later He sent "other slaves," the apostles sent later by the Lord v. 4 . In verses 6 and 7 we see that the King, angry with those who mistreated His slaves and killed them, "sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city." These were the Roman troops under Titus which destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70.
[41]  In this parable God to whom we pray is likened to our friend, and we are likened to His friend, indicating that in prayer God is intimate to us and we are intimate to Him in a mutual love.
[42]  In this parable God is the Lord v. 8 . This parable indicates that God as the owner of the fig tree planted in His vineyard came in the Son to the Jewish people as a fig tree planted in God's promised land as the vineyard to seek fruit from them.
[43]  The Unrighteous Judge in the Parable of Persisting Prayer
[44]  In the parable concerning persisting prayer in Luke 18:1-8 the unrighteous judge refers to the righteous God vv.
[45]  In the foregoing messages we covered many aspects of God's person.
[46]  Through the precious and exceedingly great promises given by God, we, the believers in Christ, who is our God and Savior, have become partakers of His divine nature in an organic union with Him.
[47]  Just as we are constituted physically of the food we eat, so we, believers in Christ, should be constituted of the God of which we partake.
[48]  If we enjoy God and partake of Him, we shall be constituted of Him.
[49]  C. GOD'S NATURE BEING DISPENSED INTO US FOR OUR LIVING IN SPIRIT, LOVE, AND LIGHT
[50]  Surely what God dispenses into us is what He is in His nature.
[51]  When God is dispensed into us, His nature is also dispensed into us.
[52]  For God to dispense Himself into us means that He is dispensing Himself into us with what He is in His nature.
[53]  In this message we shall begin to consider the many attributes of God revealed in the New Testament.
[54]  When we speak of God's attributes, we refer to all that belongs to God.
[55]  The divine love, as we have seen in the preceding message, is the nature of God's essence.
[56]  As in 1 Timothy 1:15, the "world" refers to fallen mankind, whom God so loved that, by making them alive through His Son with His own life, they might become His children.
[57]  First John 4:10 goes on to say, "In this is love, not that we have loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son a propitiation concerning our sins."
[58]  The divine riches are an aggregate of a particular attribute of God in many respects.
[59]  In Colossians 1:19 and 2:9 we see two aspects of the fullness.
[60]  According to 1:19, all the fullness was pleased to dwell in Christ.
[61]  For eternity Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of God, the embodiment of the expression of all that God is in His unlimited and untraceable riches.
[62]  Holiness is one of the main attributes of our God.
[63]  Revelation 4:8 says, "The four living creatures have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is coming."
[64]  The Father has regenerated His elect, imparting His holy nature into them 1 Pet 1:3 ; the Son has redeemed them with His blood from the vain manner of life 1 Pet 1:18-19 ; and the Spirit has sanctified them according to the Father's holy nature, separating them from anything that does not fit in with God's nature so that they, by the holy nature of the Father, may become holy in all manner of life, even as holy as God Himself is.
[65]  The manifestation of God's righteousness is mentioned twice in the book of Romans.
[66]  Romans 1:17 says that the righteousness of God is revealed out of faith to faith.
[67]  Now apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested through faith of Jesus Christ Rom 3:22 .
[68]  Because His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, was put to death by Him on the cross on our behalf, God is legally obligated to forgive us.
[69]  Romans 11:33 speaks of God's wisdom: "O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!
[70]  How inscrutable are His judgments, and untraceable His paths!"
[71]  At the very end of the book of Romans Paul says, "To the only wise God through Jesus Christ be the glory forever and ever!
[72]  First Corinthians 1:9 says, "God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord."
[73]  God is faithful in His word 1 John 1:10 , the word of the truth of His gospel Eph 1:13 , which tells us that He will forgive us our sins because of Christ Acts 10:43 .
[74]  In 2 Corinthians 1:12 Paul speaks not only of the simplicity of God but also of the sincerity of God.
[75]  Romans 9:15 mentions both God's mercy and His compassion: "He says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
[76]  Concerning the peace of God, Philippians 4:7 says, "And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus."
[77]  The peace of God is actually God as peace, infused into us through our fellowship with Him by prayer, as the counterpoise of troubles and the antidote to anxiety John 16:33 .
[78]  In 2 Corinthians 1:4 he testifies that the God of encouragement "encourages us in all our affliction, that we may be able to encourage those who are in every affliction through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God."
[79]  Acts 7:2 says, "The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham."
[80]  God not only has glory, honor, and majesty; He also has sovereignty.
[81]  In this message we shall consider: GOD'S GOOD PLEASURE GOD'S HEART'S DESIRE
[82]  Ephesians 1:5 says, "Having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will."
[83]  Ephesians 1:9 goes on to say, "Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself."
[84]  It is God's good pleasure, the desire of His heart, to have many sons for the expression of His Son.
[85]  As we have seen, Romans 8:29 says that God predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son.
[86]  To have us conformed to the image of His Son is for the expression of His Son.
[87]  According to God's desire and His plan, we, as the sons of God, should express His Son today, and we are destined to express His Son at the coming of His Son.
[88]  Eventually in Revelation 21 the New Jerusalem, which is the composition of all the sons of God Rev 21:7 and the consummation of the church, will be a corporate expression of Christ the Son of God, who will be the temple within the holy city and the lamp to shine out through the city vv.
[89]  E. LIFE AS THE MEANS AND EATING AS THE WAY
[90]  According to Genesis 1, God created man in His image with the intention of dispensing Himself into man.
[91]  The eating of the tree of life implies two things: first, that life is the means for God to dispense Himself into us; second, that eating is the way God is dispensed into us.
[92]  In the foregoing message we saw that God's good pleasure, God's heart's desire, is to have many sons for the expression of His Son so that He may be expressed in the Son through the Spirit.
[93]  For this purpose, God has manifested Himself, first in Christ as an individual expression in the flesh and then in the church, the Body of Christ, as the enlarged corporate expression in the flesh.
[94]  Ultimately, God will be manifested in the New Jerusalem as the consummated corporate expression in the new heaven and new earth.
[95]  We have pointed out that the fullness of God is the expression of God.
[96]  Because the fullness of God is embodied in the church, the church is the corporate expression of the Triune God.
[97]  When a church grows in Christ with the growth of God Col 2:19 , it will function as the house and household of the living God for His move on the earth and as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world.
[98]  C. IN THE NEW JERUSALEM AS THE CONSUMMATE CORPORATE EXPRESSION IN THE NEW CREATION
[99]  The final stage of God's manifestation will be in the New Jerusalem as the consummated corporate expression in the new creation.
[100]  And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
[101]  Revelation 21:12 says that on the twelve gates of the New Jerusalem are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel, and Revelation 21:14 tells us that on the twelve foundations of the New Jerusalem are the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
[102]  In Revelation 21:22 the Apostle John tells us that he saw no temple in the New Jerusalem, for the temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.
[103]  Since God and the Lamb are the temple, they could not dwell in it, and it is not their dwelling place.
[104]  On the one hand, the New Jerusalem, which is composed of all the redeemed saints, as the habitation of God, is the tabernacle; on the other hand, the New Jerusalem, which is constituted of the processed Triune God, as the dwelling place of all the redeemed saints, is the temple.
[105]  This indicates strongly that the redeeming God is mingled with His redeemed, through the processes He has gone through and the procedures they have shared in, for His expression in His eternal manifestation.
[106]  According to the context of this portion of the Word, the throne of God and of the Lamb is the center of the New Jerusalem, on which the redeeming God, as indicated by the expression "God and the Lamb", carries out His administration, based upon His redemption, in His eternal kingdom in the new heaven and new earth, to keep everything in the universe in the order that serves the purpose for His expression in His eternal manifestation.
[107]  In this message we shall begin to consider God's work as revealed in the New Testament.
[108]  Predestinating the Believers before the Foundation of the World
[109]  In His dealing with fallen mankind, God rejected Cain and justified Abel.
[110]  "By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained testimony that he was righteous, God testifying to his gifts" Heb 11:4 .
[111]  In this message we shall consider further God's work in the old dispensation, in His old administrative arrangement.
[112]  In his testimony before the Jewish religionists, Stephen spoke concerning God's calling Abraham, the father of the chosen race, out of the idolatrous generation: "The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, and said to him, Go out of your land and from your relatives, and come into the land which I will show you" Acts 7:2-3 .
[113]  Promising Abraham That through His Seed, Christ, the Blessing of the Gospel Would Come to All the Families of the Earth
[114]  As part of His work in the old dispensation, God promised Abraham that through his seed, Christ, the blessing of the gospel would come to all the families of the earth.
[115]  Galatians 3:8 says, "The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham: In you all the nations shall be blessed."
[116]  As the good land is an all-inclusive type of Christ, and as Christ who is the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 has become the Spirit, so the Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit as the processed God, is eventually the good land to us, the New Testament believers, as the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all the nations of the earth would be blessed in him.
[117]  Choosing the Children of Israel, the Descendants of Abraham, and Making Them His People as a Type of the Church
[118]  In His old administrative arrangement God chose the children of Israel, the descendants of Abraham, and made them His people as a type of the church Rom 9:11-13; Acts 7:38 .
[119]  The children of Israel, as the chosen people of God, are the greatest, collective type of the church, in which we can see that the church is chosen and redeemed by God, enjoys Christ and the Spirit as the life supply, builds God's habitation, inherits Christ as its portion, degrades and is captured, is recovered, and awaits Christ's coming.
[120]  Promising David, the King of the Chosen Race, That the Fruit of His Loins Would Be the Coming Messiah Christ
[121]  God promised David, the king of the chosen race, that the fruit of his loins would be the coming Messiah Christ.
[122]  Regarding this, Acts 2:30 and 31 say, "Being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins he would seat One upon his throne, he, seeing this beforehand, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that He was neither left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption."
[123]  The record of the New Testament reveals God's New Testament economy, which is God's dispensing of Himself into His chosen people for the producing of a corporate Body to express Him.
[124]  In Ephesians Paul gives us a very high word concerning God's eternal economy.
[125]  In Ephesians 1 and 3 we see that the economy of God was made for the purpose of producing a church in Christ.
[126]  If you read Ephesians 1:9-11 and 3:9-11, you will see not only the economy made by God in Himself according to His good pleasure, but also the goal of God's economy.
[127]  Having considered God's work in eternity past and in the old dispensation, let us now go on to view His work in the new dispensation, in His new administrative arrangement economy.
[128]  God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin that He might redeem those under law so that we might receive the sonship.
[129]  The New Testament way of speaking about the incarnation is to say that the Word, which is God, became flesh John 1:1, 14 and that God was manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 .
[130]  We need to realize that this God, who the Word was, is not only a partial God, that is, not only God the Son but God the Son, God the Father, and God the Spirit, the entire God.
[131]  When the Son became thirty years of age, God anointed Him for the carrying out of His commission.
[132]  Matthew 3:16 and 17 speak of this: "Having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon Him; and behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight."
[133]  Before the Spirit of God descended and came upon Him, the Lord Jesus had been born of the Spirit Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20 , which proved that He already had the Spirit of God within Him.
[134]  Another verse that speaks of God's work in anointing Christ is Acts 10:38: "Jesus, the One from Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and power, who went about doing good and healing all those who were oppressed by the Devil, for God was with Him."
[135]  Forsaking Christ Economically When He Was Judging Christ as Our Substitute Made Sin for Us and Bearing Our Sins
[136]  And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"
[137]  Condemning Sin in the Flesh through the Death of Christ in the Flesh
[138]  As part of His work in His new administrative arrangement, or economy, God condemned sin in the flesh through the death of Christ in the flesh.
[139]  God solved the problem of sin by sending His own Son "in the likeness of the flesh of sin."
[140]  Tearing the Veil to Open the Way to the Holy of Holies
[141]  When the Lord Jesus was crucified, God tore the veil to open the way to the Holy of Holies.
[142]  This signifies that the separation between God and man was abolished, because the flesh signified by the veil of sin taken by Christ in its likeness Rom 8:3 had been crucified Heb 10:20 .
[143]  Stripping Off the Rulers and the Authorities, Making a Display of Them Openly, and Triumphing Over Them in the Cross
[144]  When Christ was on the cross, God not only wiped out the ordinances of the law, but also stripped off the rulers and the authorities and made a display of them openly, triumphing over them.
[145]  In this message we shall continue to see God's work in His new administrative arrangement, particularly in Christ's ascension.
[146]  God has not only raised Christ from among the dead but also has seated Christ "at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is coming" Eph 1:20b-21 .
[147]  Acts 2:36 speaks of God's work in making Jesus both Lord and Christ: "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ this Jesus whom you crucified."
[148]  But as man, He was made the Lord in His ascension after He brought His humanity into God in His resurrection.
[149]  After this, God raised up Christ from the dead, seated Him in the heavens, subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church Eph 1:20-22 .
[150]  Designating Christ to Be the Judge of the Living and the Dead
[151]  Acts 10:42 says, "He charged us to proclaim to the people and solemnly testify that this is the One who was designated by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead."
[152]  After God seated Christ in the heavens, made Him both Lord and Christ, exalted Him to be a Leader and a Savior, made Him the High Priest, and designated Him to be the Judge of the living and the dead, He poured out His Spirit upon His slaves.
[153]  After God poured out the consummated Spirit upon the Body of Christ, He sent the resurrected Christ back to His chosen people.
[154]  Acts 3:26 speaks of this: "To you first, God, having raised up His Servant, has sent Him to bless you in turning away each one of you from your wickedness."
[155]  In this message we shall consider more aspects of God's work in the new dispensation.
[156]  God has called us into such a fellowship so that we may partake of and participate in Christ and enjoy Him as our God-given portion.
[157]  First Peter 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead."
[158]  Redemption and justification solve our problem with God and reconcile us to God.
[159]  In His work in the new dispensation God also glorifies the believers.
[160]  Sending Forth the Spirit of His Son into the Believers' Hearts
[161]  Galatians 4:6 says, "Because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!"
[162]  God gives us His Spirit of life not because we are lawkeepers but because we are His sons.
[163]  Verse 4 says that God sent forth His Son, and verse 6, that God sent forth the Spirit of His Son.
[164]  In this message we shall cover several more items of God's work in His new dispensation, and then we shall go on to consider God's work in eternity future.
[165]  First Peter 5:10 says, "The God of all grace, who called you into His eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground you."
[166]  Referring to the Hebrew believers' suffering of persecution, Hebrews 12:5-11 considers the persecution as God the Father's discipline of the believers who are God's genuine sons v. 7 . It says, "Whom the Lord loves He disciplines and scourges every son whom He receives" v. 6 , and all the believers as God's sons have become partakers of the Father's discipline v. 8 . It charges that we as sons of God do not make light of God's discipline v. 5 , but rather respect the Father as a discipliner and be much in subjection to Him who is the Father of our spirits, that we may live v. 9 . The Father disciplines us for our profit that we might partake of His holiness v. 10 which is the very characteristic of His holy nature.
[167]  Causing All Things to Work Together for Good to Those Who Love God and Who Are Called according to the Purpose
[168]  Hebrews 2:10 says that God is "leading many sons into glory."
[169]  The last step of God's great salvation is to bring His many sons into glory, into the expression of God.
[170]  As the Redeeming God Administrating within the New Jerusalem in the New Heaven and the New Earth
[171]  This depicts how the Triune God God, the Lamb, and the Spirit symbolized by the water of life dispenses Himself into His redeemed people under His headship implied in the authority of the throne for eternity.
