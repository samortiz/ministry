   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. As White Garments to Clothe the Overcomers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Revelation 3:5 the Lord said to the church in Sardis that he who overcomes will be clothed in white garments.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that Christ is the white garments to clothe the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To overcome here is to overcome the deadness of the Protestant churches, that is, to overcome dead Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To walk in white garments is to have a living that is unspotted by death and that is justified and approved in life by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The promise of being clothed in white garments is a prize to the overcomers in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What they have been walking in during this age will be a prize to them in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>White garments refer to livingness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be living is to wear the white garment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are spiritually dead, we are dirty; such a dead person is the dirtiest one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Also, if we are dead, we are naked.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need the living garment to cover us; this living garment is Christ Himself wrought into us by the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The only way to have this garment is to turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every Christian needs two garments.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first is the garment of salvation, signifying Christ as our righteousness objectively.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Luke 15, when the prodigal son returned home, the first thing the father did was to have the best robe placed upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Wearing that robe, the prodigal son was justified in the presence of the father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He had been a pitiful beggar, no longer worthy to be with the father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But once he had the robe upon him, he was justified and approved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that he was justified in Christ and that Christ became his justifying covering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was covered by Christ as his righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, the garment of justification is for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, besides this garment of justification, we need another garment to make us approved and well pleasing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fine linen, bright and clean in Revelation 19:8 denotes this second garment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to typology, the queen in Psalm 45 has two garments: one for salvation and the other for her to be with the king in His reign vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>8, 13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must run the race and reach the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we are running the race, there are many things that would frustrate us from reaching the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But after we have been saved, we need to mature and overcome all frustrations and distractions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yes, we have been saved and justified and have the first robe for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But we must go on to maturity and reach our destination Heb 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do so, then we will receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not a matter of Christ as our objective righteousness but of experiencing Christ as our subjective righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ as our objective righteousness has been put upon us, whereas Christ as our subjective righteousness comes out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must live out Christ as our second garment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This garment is for the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The white garments mentioned in Revelation 3:5 refer to this second garment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we have this second garment, we are well pleasing to the Lord and will receive the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Luke 15 the best robe is for our justification, our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Revelation 19 the fine linen is the wedding garment of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Revelation 3 the white garments are the clothing of the overcomers for them to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, Christ is our garment for our justification, for our marriage to Christ, and for our covering to enable us to express Christ, not ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 4 the Lord said, You have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white because they are worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The defiled garments indicate the presence of death or the absence of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To be an overcomer in that kind of situation is to keep oneself from death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that we need to be living and strong, and we must have an impact.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even when we stand up to share a testimony, we should not speak in a dead way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, we need to speak with our spirit strengthened and released.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should overcome the dead situation in religion, conquer all kinds of death, and wear a white garment, with no stain of death.</S>
