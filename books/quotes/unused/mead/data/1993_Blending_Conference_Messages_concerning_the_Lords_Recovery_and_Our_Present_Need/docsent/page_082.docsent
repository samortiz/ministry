   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Intimate and Thorough Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>That We May Be Blended Together</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first requirement is for the intimate and thorough fellowship that we may be blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The basis of our blending, the foundation of our blending, is our fellowship, and our fellowship must be intimate and thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Lord was ministering in the four Gospels, He went about contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Surely He was vital.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Surely He was absolute and desperate for God's increase.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He contacted some young ones and they were drawn to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They lived together, ate together, and did everything together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They had a wonderful, intimate, and thorough fellowship with one another day after day, and the Lord was speaking to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was blending them together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As He spoke, there was the training.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even in His silence, He was training them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Shortly after the Lord revealed to them that He was going to be crucified, James and John asked Him if they could sit on His right hand and on His left hand in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the other ten disciples heard this they were indignant Mark 10:35-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It seems that they did not gain anything during the Lord's earthly ministry, but something was built up within them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After witnessing the Lord's death, resurrection, and ascension, they and others who followed the Lord became different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the evening of the day of His resurrection, the disciples received the essential Spirit of life John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before He ascended, the Lord told them to return to Jerusalem and wait there until they received the promise of the Father, the outpoured Spirit Luke 24:49 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because they had witnessed the Lord's death, resurrection, and ascension and because they had received the essential Spirit of life, they were in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 1 tells us that the one hundred twenty disciples prayed like one person in one accord v. 14 . They stayed together, ate together, prayed together, and did everything together for at least ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Surely they had an intimate fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After ten days of prayer, the Spirit was poured out upon them on the day of Pentecost 2:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The day of Pentecost was a day produced by ten days of this kind of fellowship and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Among us there is a shortage of such an intimate fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to have an intimate and thorough fellowship in Christ as the element and sphere by exercising our spirit with much and thorough prayer, concerning our status, spiritual condition, and present situation in and with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such fellowship is the flowing, the current, of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to have this kind of fellowship for the sake of being blended together into one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The way to be blended is by much and thorough prayer, as fine flour of the wheat, with all the members of our group, with the Spirit as the oil, through the death of Christ as the salt, and in the resurrection of Christ as the frankincense, into a dough for the Lord 1 Cor 5:6-7a; Lev 2:1-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If by the Lord's mercy we are able to experience such a blending, we will be absolutely different from what we are today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The New Testament tells us that we, as the many grains of wheat John 12:24 become one lump 1 Cor 5:6-7a and eventually we become a loaf 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After we become a loaf, we mean something and we are something in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The loaf is the group.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the Lord's table, we often praise the Lord for the loaf, the bread, yet in actuality we may not be a loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the grains of wheat, we have not been ground, broken, and blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The way to become a loaf is to be blended together in the groups by the intimate and thorough fellowship with much and thorough prayer.</S>
