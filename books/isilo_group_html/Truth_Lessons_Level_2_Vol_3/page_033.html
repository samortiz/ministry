Peace</H2><P>Christ is also our peace. Ephesians 2:14 says, "He [Christ] Himself is our peace." Our refers to both the Jewish and the Gentile believers. The peace spoken of here is not the peace between God and man but the peace between one man and another. Through the blood of Christ we have been brought near not only to God but also to one another. Christ, who has accomplished full redemption for both the Jewish and the Gentile believers, is Himself our peace. Due to man's fall and God's selection and calling, there was a separation between Israel, God's chosen people, and the Gentiles. Through Christ's redemption this separation has been removed. Now the two are one in the redeeming Christ, who is the bond of oneness.</P><P>Christ is also the peace within us. In John 14:27 the Lord said, "Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid." The peace the Lord gives overcomes all troubles and fears, especially those caused by the persecution of religion. At that time, when the disciples heard that the Lord was going to leave them, their hearts were troubled (v. 1), and they were afraid because they were under the fear of the Jewish religion that was opposing and persecuting them. The Lord told them that He left His peace with them, a peace that was actually the Lord Himself. No matter what opposition and persecution we may face, the Lord within us is our peace, and we may experience and enjoy Him and thereby enjoy peace.</P><P>In 16:33 the Lord also said, "These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction, but take courage; I have overcome the world." This indicates that the believers have peace in the overcoming Christ. Although the Lord Jesus died, has been resurrected, and has ascended to heaven, we remain in the world where there is no peace, and we are often troubled by the world. But the Lord promised that He will be our peace and that we may have peace in Him. No matter how much the world persecutes us and troubles us, Christ is our peace and He has overcome the world.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>26. Joy</H2><P>Christ is also joy to the believers. In John 15:11 the Lord said, "These things I have spoken to you that My joy may be in you and that your joy may be made full." The context of this verse is the Lord's word concerning the vine and the branches being an organism to glorify the Father by expressing the riches of the divine life (vv. 1-11). For us to be branches of the divine vine and to bear fruit to express the divine life is a matter of joy&#151;a joyful life. If we abide in the Lord and keep abiding in Him by abiding in His love so that we may bear much fruit to express the riches of His life for the glorification of the Father, we will be filled with joy. Our joy always comes from our abiding in the Lord, from our abiding in His love, and from our fruit-bearing in His rich life for the glorification of the Father. It is in this kind of life that we are full of joy. Actually, this joy is Christ Himself. When He abides in us, His joy abides in us to be the source of our joy that our joy may abound and become full.</P><P>In Philippians, a book written by Paul concerning the experience of Christ, we are repeatedly told that we should rejoice in the Lord. In 3:1 Paul said, "Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, for me it is not irksome, but for you it is safe." Here Paul charged the Philippian believers, who were troubled by the Judaizers, to rejoice in the Lord. This indicates that to rejoice in the Lord is a safeguard, a security, that shields the believers from all troubles. Furthermore, 4:4 says, "Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice." Rejoicing is a sign of the believers, it is a portion measured by God to us, and it should be our living and condition. This joy enables us to live our days with joy in any kind of situation day by day, to endure and suffer long with joy (Col. 1:11), and even to have abundance of joy in much proving of affliction (2 Cor. 8:2).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth Lessons, Level 2, Vol. 3 &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
