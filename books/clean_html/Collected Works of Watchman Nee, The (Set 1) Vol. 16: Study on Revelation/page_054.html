<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Revelation 15:6</H2><P>"And the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in clean bright linen and girded around the breasts with golden girdles." </P><P>These seven angels are priestly angels because their clothing is that of the priests. They are probably serving God in the heavenly temple. In offering of the Old Testament sacrifices, the drink offering was poured out first, then the burnt offerings were offered. What the angels are doing here is similar to what was done in the Old Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Revelation 15:7-8</H2><P>"And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the fury of God, who lives forever and ever. And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power, and no one could enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished." </P><P>This means that from this time onward no one can enter into the temple of God to intercede. There is no longer any possibility of appeasing the fury of God (Lam. 3:44).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE SEVEN BOWLS<br>(REVELATION 16:1-21)</H2><P>"And I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the seven bowls of the fury of God into the earth." </P><P>The first through sixth bowls are similar to the plagues of the first through sixth trumpets, except there is a difference in degree. The first through sixth bowls are a repetition of the plagues of the first through sixth trumpets. However, the plagues of the bowls are more severe than those of the trumpets. The seventh trumpet includes the seven bowls; hence, the seventh trumpet repeats all the plagues of the first through sixth trumpets in greater severity. This is why the plagues of the seventh trumpet are the most serious of all.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The First Bowl<br>(Revelation 16:2)</H2><P>"And the first went and poured out his bowl into the earth; and there came to be an evil and malignant sore upon the men who have the mark of the beast and worship his image."</P><P>Those who suffer this plague are only those with the mark of the beast and who worship his image. This sore is similar to those which Lazarus had (Luke 16:20-21), from which there was no recovery. One of the plagues in Exodus was also a kind of sore (9:8-10). At one point, Job also had sores (Job 2:7), as well as Hezekiah (2 Kings 20:7) and the Philistines (1 Sam. 5:6, 9, 12). Sores are sometimes used by God as a kind of judgment (Deut. 28:27). These men in Revelation 16:2 had the mark of the beast; therefore, God gave them a mark also, a sore. This sore is "evil" because it is continually increasing. It is not that the trumpets are over and then the bowls begin. In the first trumpet, only the green grass and trees on earth are burned. In the first bowl, the people on earth are hurt directly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Second Bowl<br>(Revelation 16:3)</H2><P>"And the second poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man; and every living soul that was in the sea died."</P><P>The plague in the second bowl is more serious than that in the second trumpet; its scope is greater. The sea becomes blood like that of a dead man (dark blue and green in color). This plague will cause navigation to be greatly hindered. Furthermore, the fishing industry will be totally stopped (Psa. 105:29; Isa. 50:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Third Bowl<br>(Revelation 16:4-7)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Revelation 16:4</H2><P>"And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters; and they became blood."</P><P>In the third trumpet, only the third part of the waters became bitter and distasteful for drinking. Now everything becomes blood, which is completely undrinkable. God gives them blood to drink because they have persecuted too many Christians and prophets of God.</P>
