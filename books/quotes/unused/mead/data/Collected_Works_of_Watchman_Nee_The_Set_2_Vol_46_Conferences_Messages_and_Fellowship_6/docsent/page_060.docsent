   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIVE Scripture Reading: Gen 24:12-14; Exo 4:31; 12:27; 34:8-9; Josh 5:13-14; Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>7:13-15; 1 Sam 1:27-28; 2 Sam 12:20; Job 1:20-22; Matt 2:9-11</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can trace a line right through Revelation and see what the devil is fighting for.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the first chapter of Revelation we see Christ as the Lord of war, not as the Head of the church or as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Previously, John laid on His bosom, now he lay as dead at the feet of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord is revealed as a man of war.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Out of His mouth proceeds a sword, and His eyes are like a flame of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is a Lamb who is filled with wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Revelation we see two thrones at war.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Heaven and hell are in conflict.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are fighting to obtain the worship of man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Revelation 1 3 reveals Him as Lord, the One to be worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Chapters four and five are not prophetic; they do not speak of future things; rather, they are a picture of the eternal scene in heaven Rev 4:1-4, 6, 9-11; 5:6, 12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In heaven there is only one throne, which is for worship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everything has its beginning from the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John saw the throne and the One seated there who was worthy of all praise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The throne has never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders represent all spiritual beings and the four living creatures represent the whole creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The twenty-four elders are not part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The number of the church is twelve, not twenty-four.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The elders also have crowns and thrones, and they were enthroned and crowned before the Lamb was.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If it was possible for the church to be enthroned and crowned before the Lamb, then the twenty-four elders could represent the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, the church was never enthroned and crowned before the Lord was; therefore, we cannot say that the twenty-four elders represent the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since the sphere is the universe, the twenty-four elders are the twenty-four elders of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is "the brothers of the Lord"!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>David set up twenty-four groups to minister to God, so the twenty-four elders are a band who serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are kings and priests, and they represent the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are a special group who serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The living creatures represent all of God's creation, including man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This picture shows us that from eternity to eternity God has His throne and continual worship.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only four are represented in the four living creatures; two kinds are missing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fish and creeping things are not represented.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The creeping things represent demons and the dragon, and fish represent the unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the new heaven and new earth there will be no sea, so the creatures of the sea are not represented in this scene of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The creeping things are headed by the dragon and, of course, are not included in this worship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God does not need creeping things and fish to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the veil of the temple, which represents the body of Christ, the four living creatures the lion, the bird, the calf, and the man are embroidered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the veil was split, everything on it was also rent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By the death of Christ all of creation is redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In His body He redeemed all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The worship in Revelation 4 did not begin when John saw it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God has had this worship from before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the earth it is possible to have sin and the work of the devil; the earth is the sphere of the devil's activity now.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, the sea will be his sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All that transpires on the earth, however, does not move the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the earth men can worship lions, birds, and calves, but in heaven only God is worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God rests on His throne and that is the place of our rest too.</S>

   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Revelation 4 is a picture of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Revelation 5 time enters in. John saw the Lamb come.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Who can obtain for God what He wants?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only the Lamb can restore what God is after.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God's throne is from eternity to eternity in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Revelation 5 we see a throne.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Around the throne there are representatives of the physical and spiritual creation, and in the midst of it the Lamb comes upon the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Philippians 2 is the Lamb in time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Revelation 5 is the Lamb's return to heaven.</S>

   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Revelation 6 19 deals with the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It speaks of the tribulation because it is the last war; it is the end of the war between God and Satan.</S>

   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Satan is not ignorant of the events of Revelation 13 through 19.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He works up to this for the sake of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He risks the lake of fire and the bottomless pit for the sake of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At the present time, he does not receive direct worship through idols, but during the tribulation men will worship the dragon.</S>
