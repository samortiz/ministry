   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS THE LIFE SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AS GOD S EXPRESSION 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:8-9, 18; 5:21; Col 3:10; 1 Cor 1:30; 15:34; Rom 8:2, 4; 14:17; Phil 1:19; 3:9; Rev 19:7-8; Eph 4:24; Matt 5:6, 10, 20</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to have a proper definition of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Unbelievers, of course, do not know the meaning of righteousness in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But many believers in Christ also do not have a full understanding of the significance of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Strictly speaking, in the Bible righteousness signifies the expression of God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that, according to the Bible, righteousness is God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE LIVING EXPRESSION OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How can we say that righteousness in the Bible signifies the expression of God?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to answer this question, we need to see that in the Word righteousness refers in the first place to the fulfilling of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we keep the law and fulfill it, we are right.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if we break the law, or if we offend others by breaking the law, we are not right.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not have righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, the first meaning of righteousness in the Bible is that righteousness is the fulfillment of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The law denotes the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But what is the significance of the Ten Commandments?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Old Testament indicates clearly that the Ten Commandments are the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The ark was called the ark of the testimony Exo 25:16 , and the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony Exo 38:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The testimony here refers to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The law, therefore, is God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a testimony of God, the Ten Commandments were a picture of God, a description of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that the law is a clear description, definition, and explanation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It reveals what kind of God our God is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you study the Ten Commandments, you will see that our God is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is not common.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is separate, different from everything outside of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, one of the commandments declares that we should have only one God and not make any images or worship idols.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, we should not take the Lord s name in vain, and we should recognize that the Sabbath is a day of memorial of God as the unique Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By studying carefully the first four commandments, we see that these commandments indicate that God is jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is jealous because He is holy and unique.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible uses the marriage relationship to illustrate God s uniqueness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Just as a wife has a unique husband, so we, the people of God, should not have any other God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is our unique Husband, and we should not have another husband besides Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Just as a woman s husband is separate from all other men and thus is not common, so God is separate from everything else and is not common.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that our God is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we read the last six commandments, we shall see that God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is a just God, a God of justice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, He is a God of love and of light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, according to the description of God contained in the Ten Commandments, God is holy and righteous and He is a God of love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is our God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The last six commandments definitely reveal that God is righteous and a God of love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To honor our parents is surely right.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is right not to murder, not to commit fornication, not to steal, not to bear false witness, and not to covet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we fulfill these commandments, we shall be right with others in society.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moreover, fulfilling these six commandments is also a matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Certainly someone who commits murder does not have love.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you love others, you would not commit fornication, steal, or bear false witness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Neither would you covet others possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, the Ten Commandments present a God who is holy and righteous and full of love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we keep the Ten Commandments, we have righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This righteousness is the expression of God, that is, the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, according to the biblical meaning, righteousness is the keeping of the law to present to others an image, an expression, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this way we make known what kind of God we worship.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we are righteous, full of righteousness, this righteousness becomes the expression of the God we worship and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Suppose someone claims to be of God and says that he worships God and serves Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, this person steals, lies, and covets.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This would cause others to say that they would never believe in that man s God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Such a person would give others the wrong impression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But suppose we worship God, serve Him, and claim to be of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Suppose we also live a life that is holy, separated unto God, and a life that is righteous and full of love and light, a life that is considerate of others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We honor our parents, we do not steal, we do not bear false witness, and we do not covet.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In other words, we serve God and worship God and we are also righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As a result, we have the expression, the image, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then others will realize that our God is surely the true God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They will have the desire to take this God as their God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christ, our precious Redeemer, now dwells within us as the life-giving Spirit to be our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now we have a wonderful motivation and supply in us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As the Spirit, Christ supplies us, motivates us, and even carries us all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we live by Him and live Him out, our living will be genuine righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This righteousness is the living image, the living expression, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the reason we say that the Spirit is within us as life and that righteousness is the expression outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The purpose of the ministry of the new covenant is to minister into the saints the life-giving Spirit and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Both the Spirit and righteousness are actually Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Christ living within us is the life-giving Spirit, and Christ expressed through us is righteousness as the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In 3:8 and 9 Paul speaks first of the Spirit and then of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In verse 8 he says, How shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit be in glory?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Here we read of the ministry of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In verse 9 Paul goes on to say, For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Here we have the ministry of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is our reason for saying that the ministry of the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness.</S>
