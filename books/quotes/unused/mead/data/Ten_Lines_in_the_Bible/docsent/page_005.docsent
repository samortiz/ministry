   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The names of God tell us who God is; the attributes of God show us God s nature and character.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible not only contains numerous names of God, showing who God is, it also contains countless words describing what kind of God He is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are willing to spend time, we could find a hundred points on the attributes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, due to the limitation of time and energy, the thirty points we have found should be sufficient for now.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Among these attributes, there are five basic attributes; if we can remember these five, the rest can easily be remembered.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may say that these five attributes are primary and the rest are derivative.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The primary attributes of God are the sources, whereas the other attributes are derived from these five sources.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These attributes will be listed below.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we mention each attribute, we can give only a few references; we do not have the time to explain their meaning.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After reading the above attributes, we have some idea of the kind of God He is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can see that God is sometimes very joyful and sometimes provoked to anger; yet He is long-suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He also grieves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He never repents of His words, even though He sometimes repents of His actions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He carries out salvation, judgment, recompense, vengeance, and retribution without the slightest imprudence.</S>

   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not forget that all of God s attributes originate from these five basic primary attributes love, righteousness, faithfulness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When speaking of His heart, He is loving; when speaking of His works, He is righteous; when speaking of His word, He is faithful; when speaking of His nature, He is holy; and when speaking of Himself, He is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Countless attributes of God originate from these five points.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For example, truthfulness surely originates from faithfulness and goodness from righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I hope that the saints would commit these attributes to memory and consider them; this will certainly help us to know God.</S>
