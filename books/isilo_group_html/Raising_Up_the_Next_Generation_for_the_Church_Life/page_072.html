<p>The brothers and sisters should also prepare songs for the children&rsquo;s meetings. We should not treat the little ones like the older saints and have them sing the same songs that we do. <em>Hymns,</em> #1017, for example, says, &ldquo;Christ has put on human nature and become a man like me, / He has died upon the cross that I from Adam might be free, / He has risen and as Spirit He has come to live in me / That He might be my life.&rdquo; This hymn does not match the six-year-olds. They may be able to pick up the tune, but they will not understand the words. To prepare the proper children&rsquo;s songs is not easy; it requires much work. We can adopt the melodies of certain hymns, but if possible, we can also compose new melodies. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, p. 508)</p>

<p>When we were in northern China, the sisters who taught the children used content from the adults&rsquo; meeting. At that time the adults met upstairs, and the children met downstairs. When we spoke concerning vanity, they spoke to the children concerning vanity. When we spoke concerning dealing with the flesh, they also spoke concerning the flesh. After I found out about this, I told the serving ones that this would not work. I realized that after the children were baptized, they would not be able to listen to any messages, because before they were saved, they would have already heard messages for the edification of new believers. We should never do the children&rsquo;s work in this way.</p>
<p>Let us consider another example. One morning I was in the meeting hall, and I heard the children singing the hymn &ldquo;Rock of Ages Cleft for Me.&rdquo; This hymn is too deep for the children. Hence, some of the saints should receive a burden to write songs for the children. The songs should be simple and interesting. They do not need to be religious. We can sing about flowers and birds with a lively tune. Eventually, we can teach the children songs related to God. The children&rsquo;s songs should be of three levels, and each level should include at least fifty songs. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, p. 313)</p>

<p>Parents like to hear their children sing. When you visit your relatives, you may first give their children some candy and then teach them to sing a simple hymn. Their parents may be unhappy if you persuade them to believe in Jesus. But they will pay attention to their children&rsquo;s singing. When they hear the songs, they will be touched.

<h2 class="head1">HELPING EVEN THE CHILDREN<br />
TO CALL, SPEAK, OR SING A HYMN AND<br />
TO QUOTE OR SPEAK THE WORD OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>In the home meetings, we need to help even the children to call, speak, or sing a hymn and to quote or speak the word of the Bible. Suppose that you have baptized a couple, and they have a nine-year-old boy and a three-year-old girl. If you go to help them have a home meeting, you must train even the three-year-old girl. You can tell her that it is easy for her to call a hymn in the meeting and that it is even easier to sing a hymn. You may say, &ldquo;You know when you are going to have a home meeting and that some brothers will come to help you. Before we come, you can sing a hymn.&rdquo; If you tell the little girl this, she may be singing when you enter the home. Take her song as the start of the meeting. All the little ones like to sing. You may not need to help the little girl sing a whole verse or stanza of a song. If you can help her to sing one line, she may be happy. The little ones can be a very good help to the home meetings. You also can help them to pray. They can pray a simple prayer such as, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are so good. I love You and I know that You are with me.&rdquo; You can instruct the nine-year-old boy to speak some verses, to read some portion of the Word. In this way all the members of the family participate in the meeting. If we do this week after week with this family, they will accumulate many divine riches.

<p>Everyone, both young and old, likes singing. Do not explain that much to them; explaining is often sour, not sweet. Singing is very sweet. You must be like a nursing mother, making your little ones feel pleasant by giving them something sweet.
