<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XII. LOVINGKINDNESS AND JUSTICE<br>TO BE THE BASE OF THE REIGN<br>AND JUDGMENT OF CHRIST</H2><P>Psalm 101 reveals that lovingkindness and justice will be the base of the reign and judgment of Christ (typified by David&#151;vv. 1, 6, 8). It seems that this psalm does not belong to this section concerning God's recovery of the earth through Christ's reign. This psalm, however, is actually the conclusion of this section.</P><P>Psalm 101 is a word spoken to God by Christ, who reigns on the earth for God. At the psalmist's time the name of Christ, the anointed One, had not yet been revealed, so David, God's anointed, was used to typify Christ as the man anointed by God to reign over the earth for God. Therefore, this psalm unveils how Christ will reign over the earth with lovingkindness and justice and deal with all the wicked people. When Christ reigns on earth in the coming age, lovingkindness and justice will be the base of His reign and judgment over the earth.</P><P>Verses 1 and 2a say, "I will sing of lovingkindness and justice;/To You, O Jehovah, I will sing psalms./I will give careful heed to the way of the perfect." Remember, the "I" here is the word of David, a type of Christ, indicating that this word is the word of Christ to God. Thus, "I" here actually refers to Christ. Christ will sing to Jehovah of lovingkindness and justice. Christ will also give careful heed to the way of the perfect. If we are on the way of the perfect, Christ will give careful heed to our way.</P><P>Psalm 101 speaks in detail concerning the way Christ will reign, rule, and judge in the coming age. As we read through this psalm, we see many virtues that will be manifested in Christ's reign on earth. Today the earth is filled with injustice, but we have the hope that the earth will be recovered. One day God's title and right over the whole earth will be recovered through the reign of Christ. Then the virtues described in Psalm 101 will be manifested.</P>
