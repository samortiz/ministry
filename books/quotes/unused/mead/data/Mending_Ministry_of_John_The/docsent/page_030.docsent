   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST MOVING WITHIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the life within, which is Christ Himself, moves, that moving is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Fellowship means mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It includes mutual communication, participation, and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ enjoys you, and you enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is a transmission back and forth between the two of you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Within you there is a current for your daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather than doing things by yourself, you must do things by that current between you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may feel at a disadvantage if you do not have a strong will and it is hard for you to make up your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Be assured it is of no help to make up your mind to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To make up your mind to live Christ does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must realize that He is in you, moving in you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He moves, His moving is the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He Himself is the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is a flowing from Him to you and from you back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This transmission occurs even when you do what is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may have gone shopping even when you realized that the Lord Jesus did not agree with you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While you were on the way, there was some fellowship within, a current moving, which said, "Don't go!"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may have replied, as I myself have done many times, "Lord, You are not really that narrow, are You?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I don't go shopping like this very often.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not evil, like going to Las Vegas to gamble.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am going to buy something which is useful."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am sure many of you have had such experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indwelling Lord is dealing with you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As long as He is moving, the current is flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1933 I went to Shanghai for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a young man, I had no love for the world, but I did have an appetite for spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Shanghai was a densely populated city.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There were many missionaries there and a good many secondhand Christian bookstores.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In those days I was hungry to read spiritual books in English.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During those months my behavior was nearly blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My only fault was in going to the secondhand bookstores.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever the brothers did not occupy my time, I would slip away to those stores and buy those old books.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the while, I felt condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The fellowship within said, "You are doing things by yourself."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But I could not stop!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such books as George M ller's autobiography and the writings of G. H. Pember I had heard of previously.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now I had the chance to have a copy of my own.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I got back, I would put them on the table, happy to have them on the one hand but rebuked on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fellowship within was strong against me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In buying those books I was in myself; I was not living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I was doing what I loved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was not evil, but I was living myself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>While I had no heart for the horse races, which were famous in Shanghai, and no heart for the newspapers, I did find that going from bookstore to bookstore was a real entertainment to me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I did collect a good many books.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some of them I brought with me to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While I was living in Los Angeles, one day I put out for the trash collectors five big cartons of books.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These had been bought by me in Shanghai while offending the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Years ago I could not have told you how to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now, because of my experience all through the years, I can tell you there is no other way except, firstly, by fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Remember that you have a Companion who indwells you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is always with you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You are no longer single.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is your life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When He moves, He is the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do everything by this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you have your being by it, you will have a wonderful life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All day long you will live only Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You will not only be doing good and overcoming; you will be living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He will be lived out of you because of your living by fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>TWO SPIRITS</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This fellowship is the fellowship of Christ 1 Cor 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since Christ today is the life-giving Spirit, it is also the fellowship of the Spirit 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since Christ indwells our spirit as the life-giving Spirit, it is also the fellowship of our spirit Phil 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The fellowship is a matter concerning these two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As you practice, you will realize that the Lord Jesus is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When He moves, that is His fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This fellowship is, on the one hand, of the Spirit, and, on the other hand, of your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christ is the life-giving Spirit in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Here you enjoy Him and He enjoys you in mutual participation, communication, and transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Here you live by Him and He lives by you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You live Him out and He lives in you.</S>
