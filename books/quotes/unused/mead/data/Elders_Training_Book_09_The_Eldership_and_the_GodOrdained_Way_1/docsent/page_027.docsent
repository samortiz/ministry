   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Prophets and Teachers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Besides the elders as the priests and as the administrators, there are the prophets and teachers as illustrated in Acts 13:1-4.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Acts 13 in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These prophets and teachers are the ones who can help in the priesthood and in the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are like the Old Testament prophets who helped the elders, the kings, and the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today in God's administration on this earth, the principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Besides the ones who are the priests to receive the revelation from the Lord directly and the administrators to carry out what God spoke, there are the prophets and the teachers to help the eldership and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Apostles' Relationship</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>with the Churches and the Elders</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>after They Have Been Established</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the apostles appoint the elders and commit the church into the hands of the elders, what shall the apostles do in the future?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some say that the apostles have nothing to do with the church anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to their feeling, the appointment of the elders by the apostles was the termination of the relationship of the apostles with the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They say this by using Brother Nee's fellowship in The Normal Christian Church Life as a basis.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On page 66 of this book, Brother Nee says, "Once a church was established, all responsibility was handed over to the local elders, and from that day the apostles exercised no control whatever in its affairs."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this quote from Brother Nee's book, we should notice the phrase "in its affairs."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some quote Brother Nee's words without realizing the significance of this phrase.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brother Nee in his book entitled Church Affairs, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>149, 14-20, corrected this misuse of his word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The apostles were to keep their hands off of the administration of the local church in its business affairs, not in its need of the apostles' teaching, instruction, and charge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We saw that Paul wrote a letter to the church in Corinth charging them to remove a certain sinful man from the fellowship of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The apostle commanded the church to do this "Remove the evil man from among yourselves" 1 Cor 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Does this mean that the apostle took the church back under his administration?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No, not at all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If this had been the case, he would not have needed to tell others to remove the sinful one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He would have done it directly by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this sense, Paul as an apostle kept his hands off of the church administration but not from teaching, instructing, and charging the church.</S>
