<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(30)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 3, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER Y. U.</h2><p>Before I was saved in 1933, I was addicted to novels and drama. Later I borrowed some spiritual books from a sister and attended prayer meetings regularly. I am an optimistic person and I like to laugh and joke. After my mother passed away, I felt lonely. Every afternoon at three o'clock I would shut my doors and pray. At the end of 1940 I heard Brother Nee speak on the cross, and I felt as if he were speaking to me. Later, because of the pressure of my teaching job, I developed a heart disease. Prior to that I walked quickly and spoke fast. After I became ill, I could no longer move around freely. I often thought that I would die. While it seemed as if I was dying outwardly, I was also dying inwardly. A sister told me that this was a thought from Satan and that I had to reject it. I wondered how others could live the Christian life so joyfully while I lived in such pain. An elderly sister came and visited me and told me that the day of my salvation had come. I had a strange experience that day as I was washing my clothes in my room. A voice came and said, "I, Jehovah, am your help." Some sisters also prayed for me, and I was strengthened. From that time forward my joy came back. I am not working, yet God has supplied me richly. I live in a sisters' house. I do all the washing, cooking, heating, and other chores; they do nothing. I do not ask God to change the environment, but I ask Him to change me. Spiritually, I feel that I am poor and have many manifested weaknesses. I see the weaknesses in others, and I see the weaknesses in myself all the more. I have also seen that the Lord has given me one talent. If I deny this, I offend the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Being in Harmony with the Environment</h2><p>With respect to our past experiences, the Lord wants to bring every one of us into harmony with our environment. Everyone who is at odds with the Lord is at odds with his environment. We cannot choose our own experiences, and we cannot escape our own environment. We have heard three or four brothers and sisters who have testified to this fact, and we should have received some light from their testimonies. None of us can choose our own pathway. God's goal is to bring us into harmony with our surrounding environment. We should not argue with our experiences. Instead, we should submit to the Lord who arranges these encounters. The Holy Spirit is the One who makes all the arrangements inside of us and around us. As soon as we accept the Lord who has arranged these inward and outward circumstances, our many turmoils will be settled. The more we advance and progress along the way, the more we will be one with our environment. Of course, when we face sickness in our environment, we can ask for healing. When our emotions suffer a blow, we can ask for peace. We always expect others to treat us well, but often just the opposite occurs. Please remember that most of the time we lose our peace, joy, and blessing this way. If we can accept and approve of all of the environment and experience that the Lord has measured to us, peace, joy, and blessing will come to us. The Lord always brings us into harmony with the environment around us.</p><h2 class="head2">Accepting God's Arrangements</h2><p>It is easy to talk about the discipline of the Holy Spirit but very hard to see it in a genuine way. The Bible says that even our hairs have been numbered. It is easy to say this, but how much do we really know of this? Everything is under the Lord's arranging hand. At the beginning of our Christian life, we are wild and raw. It is not easy for us to accept God's arrangements. As we grow, we become more in tune with God's arrangements. Many people ask for things that are apart from the Lord's arrangements. If the Lord will not change and we cannot accept His arrangements and change ourselves, the only thing that will happen is that our days of struggling will be prolonged. They will become days of loss. The Lord does not have to change His ways, but we have to accept His ways. It is best to say, "Lord, I am willing to accept everything that You do." Spiritual progress has nothing to do with outward changes, but with inward acceptance. If God's hand lets go of us, we are finished; we have nowhere to turn. Everything falls into place if we accept God's arrangements in the environment. If we cannot accept them, we have to look to God for mercy to enable us to accept them.</p><p>We often think that we are withstanding Satan. Actually, we are withstanding God. The sooner we come into harmony with our environment, the better it is for us. The more we inwardly complain, the more the Lord's hand will be heavy upon us. We should be pliable, harmonious, and even transcendent in the Lord's hand. If we are dissatisfied with all that the Lord has done, there will be few alternatives for us. We have to believe that the Lord is arranging everything. Every time a strand of our hair turns white, we should praise the Lord. God's arrangements are so minute that even a strand of hair is in His hand. Can something greater than a strand of hair not be part of God's ordering? If a man presumes that he can reject his outward circumstances, he is rejecting God. The cross is heavy only if it is upon us. But if we are crucified on the cross, it will not be heavy to us. On the contrary, our own weight and burden will be upon the cross. The more we accept and give up fighting, the less problems we will have.</p><p>On the subject of spiritual poverty, we should realize that our way depends not on rich feelings or feelings of riches. We should only have the feeling of death in ourselves. Yet we bring life to others. If the Lord brings us to the place of death, neither poverty or riches are our business any longer. If we learn to accept poverty, the Lord will be rich in others. The sense of weakness and weakness itself are two different matters. The Lord will bring us to the point of weakness, and He will also bring us to a sense of weakness. This takes time. Many brothers who are beginners in His service feel as if they can do everything. They are strong because they have not passed through the experience of weakness; they have not gone through many years of stripping.</p><p>The Lord only gives us one feeling&mdash;the feeling of weakness. We feel that power is not with us but with others. In reality, we may be rich or we may be poor, but the Lord always puts a sense of weakness in us. This is the only way He can use us. It is not a matter of the Lord's power becoming our power. We remain weak all the time. The Lord's strength only rests on our weakness; it does not remove our weakness. None of us should crave a sense of power. We should not feel or sense this at all. Our feeling should always be one of weakness. We should leave it to others to feel our power and our riches. We must never advance from a feeling of poverty to a feeling of abundance. Instead, we should advance from a feeling of poverty to true poverty. On our side, we should only feel weak. Power and riches are the Lord's business. Moses' face shone, but he did not know about it. I am afraid many young people look into the mirror every day to see if their faces are shining. If we really knew that our faces were shining, probably we would soon lose the light. It is better that we do not know. This is the way.</p>
