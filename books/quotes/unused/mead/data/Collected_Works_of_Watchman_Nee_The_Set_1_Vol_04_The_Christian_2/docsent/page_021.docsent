   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse Thirteen</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 13: "And in the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"In the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus is with His church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This fulfills the promise in Matthew 28:20.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The realization of the Lord's presence is an extremely precious thought!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, His presence is not merely a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is also for searching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are faithful, with Him in our midst what is there to fear?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are not faithful, with Him in our midst, how shall we escape?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"One like the Son of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This One is our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ezekiel said that He had "the likeness as the appearance of a man" Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Daniel also said that He was "like a Son of Man" Dan 7:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Gospels, our Lord often referred to Himself as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why does it say here again that He was "like the Son of Man?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This shows the divinity of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although He was the Son of Man, He was also the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was the Son of Man on the earth, but now He has been resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is true that He was the Son of Man, but He was more than that.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus it says that He was like the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The designation of the Lord Jesus as the Son of Man and the expression here "like the Son of Man" is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the messages "Meditations on Genesis," we saw how God in the beginning created the primal heavens and earth, the angels of the heavens, and the inhabitants of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then the archangel sinned Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>28 , and the inhabitants of the earth followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, God judged them and the land in which they dwelt.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the land became void and without form as recorded in Genesis 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later, God recovered the land in six days.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because God wanted His will to be done on earth as it was in the heavens Matt 6:10 , He created man on the earth to have dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Unfortunately, man sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He lost his right of dominion and came under the control of the sinning angel Satan .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because man had failed and had become incurable, God became incarnated as a man, accomplishing what man had failed to achieve.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was the beginning of the Lord Jesus as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before God created man, He already knew that man would fail.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, He prepared a spiritual body for the Holy Son Gen 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was in this body that He later appeared to men Gen 18:1, Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1:26, Dan 7:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the fullness of the time came, He was born of a virgin, taking on a body of blood and flesh Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God put on the body of a man to become the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Son of Man is the designation of God when He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since He had this body of "blood and flesh," He was the same as other men in all respects.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since He became a man, the Son of Man, He redeemed men from their sins, ending the retribution that the first man deserved due to his sin and regaining what men had lost through Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because He gained the victory as a man, fulfilling the conditions that God had intended man to fulfill, which is to carry out His will on the earth and to destroy the devil's will, God then granted to Him what man deserved originally.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Originally God wanted the first man to have dominion over the earth Gen 1 , but man followed the devil's will and did not do the will of God, thus losing this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since the last Adam became a perfect man, "God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth" Phil 2:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus was a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He became the head of a new race, just as Adam was the head of the old race.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since He is a man, God will hand over to Him the power of judgment and will cause Him to be the King of kings in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The glory that the Lord Jesus gains in Revelation is not the glory of Himself as God; it is the glory of Himself as man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After the millennial kingdom, the Son will deliver the kingdom to God the Father in order that the Triune God may be over all things as the Lord of all things 1 Cor 15:24-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the history between the two eternities before and after our heavens and our earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Originally, our Lord Jesus Christ was God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In eternity past before the heavens and the earth, the terms "Father," "Son," and "Spirit" did not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>With His appearing to men, such terms came into use.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order to save mankind and to have God's will done on earth as it is in the heavens, He became incarnated as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>His thirty-some years on the earth were the actual period that He was the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Before He was incarnated, even though He already had a spiritual body, He was only "like a Son of Man" Dan 7:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After His resurrection, though He still had bones and flesh, He was no longer only the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, He was "One like the Son of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thank and praise God that He has saved us by becoming the Son of Man, and He will forever be the Son of Man to save us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should understand the way of God's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He wants to destroy Satan's power.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, He wants a will on the earth that is joined to His will in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We know that He has the power to totally destroy Satan and his army in a flash of time, but God does not want to do it this way; He wants man to co-work with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When man failed, He Himself became a man incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After He won His own victory, He called a group of chosen men to experience His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>His intention was still the same as it was before creation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Now the Head has ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We as His members should join to Him in one spirit in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Although He Himself has obeyed the will of God and has overcome the devilish power, He desires that we would represent Him on the earth, having a determined will to carry out God's will and resisting all the plans and acts of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To enter into a spiritual warfare against the devil by prayer is the work that the Lord has called us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This book of Revelation speaks of the warfare between God and Satan, how Christ overcame him, and how the saints of Christ overcame him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Only those who understand spiritual warfare can do an effective work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Our every move should be a loss to Satan and a gain to God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Now we will return to the text.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Here we see how this Christ who is like the Son of Man is in the midst of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the condition in the New Testament temple.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Old Testament temple with its golden incense altar, which represented the interceding Christ, and the showbread, which represented the twelve tribes of Israel, and the golden lampstand, by which they testified through the power of the Holy Spirit, have all been changed.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Now there are only seven golden lampstands and One like the Son of Man: the church and the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Here there is no one standing between the Lord and His church; the Lord is face to face with her.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This Son of Man will soon judge the world.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Before He judges the world, He will judge His church because judgment must begin first at the house of God 1 Pet 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should heed this point, that He is not interceding in the midst of the church; He is judging.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He is not sitting in the midst of them to receive their worship; He is walking in the midst of them 2:11 to examine their conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord Jesus here is "clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is the clothing of a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>However, this is not the clothing of a priest at work.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is what he wears when he is resting, because this garment is very loose, hanging, "reaching to the feet."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Furthermore, the waist is not girded with a girdle; the girdle is girded about the breast.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The long garment here is what a priest ordinarily wore Lev 6:10 , and it is different from the garment dipped in blood Rev 19:13 because He wears that garment only when He comes forth to judge.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Though the judgment had been announced by that time, it had not yet been executed.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This dress is also different from the glorious and beautiful dress that the high priest wore Lev 16:4 because at this time He is examining the lampstands in the temple and not coming forth to remove sins or to reveal the glory of His millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This garment is what the priest wore when he went out of the camp to examine the lepers.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He is girded with "a golden girdle."</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Old Testament high priests were girded with a girdle that was only sewn with golden threads Exo 28:2, 4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Therefore, even though their ministry was established by God, it was bound to terminate because they were merely men and were bound to die.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>What our Lord was girded with was of pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Therefore, it never loses its shining; it lasts forever Heb 7:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The place where He is girded deserves our attention: "girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle."</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Ordinarily a girdle is girded about the loin Matt 3:4; John 13:4 so that the garment can be brought close to the body for convenience at work.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>To be girded about at the breasts shows that the work is already finished; there is no longer any need to be girded about the waist.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>After Aaron, the Old Testament high priest, finished his work, he entered into the Holy Place to change into his glorious dress.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Similarly, after our Lord Jesus finishes judging His church in the air, He will be manifested in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The golden girdle also represents God's righteousness because when He comes to judge, "righteousness will be that which girds His loins" Isa 11:5 .</S>
