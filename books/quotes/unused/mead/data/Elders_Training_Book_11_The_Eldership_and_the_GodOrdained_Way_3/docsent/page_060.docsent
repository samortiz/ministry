   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHANGING TO THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must change our philosophy and logic and drop everything of the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must be willing to change to the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man cannot change the globe, but he has improved the means for traveling around the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man discovered the wheel as a means of travel thousands of years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today every means of travel depends upon the wheel, even the airplane.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But there have been many changes and improvements throughout the years since the discovery of the wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same way, we must have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have been speaking concerning the new way, the God-ordained way, for the past seven and a half years, but I have not seen much real practice of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today everyone welcomes the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thank the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But I still beg you all to have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The God-ordained way to meet and to serve is the present tide of God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When a tide comes in human culture, no one can stand against it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The tide and the trend in human culture will sift everyone who does not go along with it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today in human culture, democracy is a tide.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Communism has been practiced for about seventy years, and people have found out that it does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It has caused people to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now people who have been under the practice of communism are tired of it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They do not want communism or atheism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They want democracy and western culture with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is why we have the burden to go to eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should go, not with the element of old Christianity, but with the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE NEED OF BEING IN ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>IN THE ELDERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I want to share something more concerning our service as elders.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to take care of the church, the elders must be in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once you lose the one accord, the blessing is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the New Testament, the blessing of the outpoured Spirit, which is Christ Himself 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 , was brought in by the one hundred twenty being in one accord Acts 1:14; 2:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the book of Acts, the one accord is mentioned five times 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; 5:12; 15:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are not in one accord, we are through with the oneness of the Body, and the blessing in the church and in the work will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This should be a serious warning to us.</S>
