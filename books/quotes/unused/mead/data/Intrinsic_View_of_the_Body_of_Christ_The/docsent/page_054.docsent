   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>None of us should make an issue over the practice of the new way versus the old way, because these ways are not our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Surely there is nothing wrong with preaching the gospel by visiting and contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We do not necessarily need to go out to knock on people's doors to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Calling people on the phone, writing letters, sending booklets, and any other kind of contact with people is a kind of "knocking on doors."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to keep the oneness, we need to remain in our spirit so that we can be kept in fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then if there are problems, we can fellowship with those who are concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Based upon our fellowship with the Lord, with much prayer, we can get everything solved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should fellowship by seeking the Lord's solution with an open spirit, a pure heart, a lowly mind, and a meek attitude Eph 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Also, we should fellowship according to the teaching of the Scriptures properly interpreted, not understood by taking them out of context.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some may justify what they are doing by claiming that it is according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, it is according to the Scriptures by their wrong interpretation, by their twisting, and by their taking certain verses out of context.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our fellowship to solve any problem should be without self-interest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The entire pursuit should be for the Lord's glory and for the benefit of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To solve any problem in fellowship, no parties or divisions should be formed for backing in partiality, threatening, and/or challenging others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we would practice all these items, we surely can have every problem solved in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the best remedy to heal any disease of division.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Dealing with Divisive Members</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There may be some divisive members among us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul referred to these ones in Romans 16:17, which says, "Now I exhort you, brothers, to mark those who make divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some make division purposely.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to turn away from these division-makers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Titus 3:10 says that we must reject the factious, sectarian, members.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some members are very factious, very sectarian, very divisive, and their purpose in contacting others is to cause division.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are some like this today who have the intention of remaining among us to spread their poison.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No doubt, they are division-makers, and they are factious, sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since they are division-makers, we have to turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since they are still factious after being admonished again and again, we have to reject them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is according to the practice of the quarantining of the lepers in typology Lev 13:45-46; Num 12:10-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Moses' sister, Miriam, rebelled, God punished her with leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then she was quarantined.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be quarantined is to be put aside for the profit of the whole congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is because certain diseases are very contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a person is sick with a highly contagious disease, he is quarantined, separated even from his family members, until he is healed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is for the protection of the entire family.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Scriptures charge us in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Anyone who is spiritually sick of the disease of division, having become a divisive person, must be quarantined.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Division is very contagious, so the church has to learn to quarantine the divisive ones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the apostle's teaching, we must either turn ourselves away from them or reject them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This protects the entire church so that the church can remain in a safeguarded situation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I hope that the Holy Spirit will continue to speak to us through this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we will spend the time to pray over this fellowship, we will see more light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the local churches need to be kept in the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The seven lampstands in Revelation, typifying the seven local churches, are all identical 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They are all one in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ so that the Lord will have a way to accomplish His divine purpose according to His divine economy.</S>
