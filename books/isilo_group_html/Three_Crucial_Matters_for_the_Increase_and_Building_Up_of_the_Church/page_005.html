<p>We cannot deny that out of thousands of Christians the Lord has blessed us with a thorough knowledge of salvation and a clear understanding of the truth. People praise us because our exposition of the Bible has influenced Christians in the Far East for the past forty years. This means that Christianity in the Far East openly admits that we have influenced their knowledge and exposition of the Bible. We have received the Lord&rsquo;s particular blessing. We love the Lord, and we know the truth, but we must not stop here. We should spread the gospel to every part of Taiwan, and we should release the truth.</p>
<p>In the past Western missionaries came from Europe and America to preach the gospel in the provinces of interior China. Even though the economy in Taiwan is developed, education is available, and transportation is convenient, we still have not spread the gospel to every part of this island. We have wasted the Lord&rsquo;s grace, especially during the past twenty years when very few full-timers were produced. If we had produced two full-timers every year for twenty years, we would have forty full-timers. There are approximately twenty thousand saints in Taiwan, but we have produced an insignificant number of full-timers. In addition, an insufficient number of people go out to preach the gospel. We are indebted to the Lord.</p>
<p>There are more than six hundred churches around the globe, and three hundred of them were raised up in the last twenty-three years, after I went to America. The Lord is spreading in the West, but His spread in Taiwan is very weak. The world today has become smaller; hence, if the Lord is unable to spread in Taiwan, eventually the churches in America will be affected. This is the reason I felt to return to Taiwan in order to change things at the &ldquo;roots.&rdquo; We must wake up. If we continue to ignore the Lord&rsquo;s leading and teaching, sooner or later we will force Him to raise up another group of people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE BEING FULL TIME<br />
FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Many among us came from mainland China and have experienced the sweetness and the bitterness of human life. I was born into a poor family, and over the past eighty years I have seen everything there is in human life. According to my experience of human life, last year I wrote a hymn in Chinese that says, &ldquo;The human life without Christ / Is all vain and all empty; / A meaningless human life / Without hope and without goal&rdquo; (Appendix #4, stanza 4). Stanza 5 shows the change that occurs in a person&rsquo;s human life when he has Christ: &ldquo;When we receive Christ as life, / In our spirit we&rsquo;re reborn; / We live by Him every moment, / And our life is turned to song.&rdquo; As believers who thank the Lord for His salvation and want to live by Him, we should not think that we must drop our jobs in order to serve Him full time. The sisters who are at home raising their children and caring for their husbands can be full-timers. A brother making money at a job can also be full time for the Lord. Everything depends on our heart. If our heart is toward the Lord, we are full-timers.</p>
<p>It is difficult to set a standard for human life. No matter how many items of clothing a person has, he has only one body, and no matter how much he eats, he has only one stomach. All the good food in the world cannot fit in his stomach. Therefore, we should not consider how much money we can make in order to raise our standard of living. Extravagant living causes us to be overweight. This is a slow kind of suicide. If our house is too large, we are unable to clean it by ourselves, and we need someone to help us. It is better to have a smaller house that we can clean by ourselves. There are presently more than twenty thousand brothers and sisters in Taiwan. If every household slightly decreases its living expenditures by one dollar a day, on the average every brother and sister would save three hundred sixty dollars a year. In one year we would save a total of $7.2 million. This money could be used for the spread of the church.</p>
<p>The saints may not know the great financial need that there is overseas. During the last three months we received a letter in America from a brother who is a pastor in Guatemala. In the letter he said that he became clear about the truth by reading our publications. He is planning to hold trainings in seventeen places this year to train approximately eight hundred to one thousand pastors, and he asked us to send brothers to help with the trainings. Two co-workers went there and telephoned us to say that the situation is very good. The work in Guatemala is proceeding in different provinces, and they desperately need books in Spanish. We sent them video players and videotapes of the ministry because we do not have many books in Spanish. The two brothers who went spent one week in Guatemala and then went to Colombia and Costa Rica.</p>
<p>America is not the only continent with this situation. Europe has a similar situation. The recovery has spread to Finland, which can be called the neighbor of the Soviet Union. There is also a great need in Africa. A few days ago the Living Stream Ministry office called me to say that they sent a container of books to Accra, the capital of Ghana in Africa. They sent one thousand copies of the New Testament Recovery Version in English, worth approximately fifty thousand to sixty thousand dollars. Most of these books were sent free of charge.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Crucial Matters for the Increase and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
