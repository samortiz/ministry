<h2 class="head1">THE HISTORY OF THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>One and a half years ago the Lord granted us a new direction in His leading as a means to turn ourselves fully away from the way of traditional Christianity. This is a fact that we all acknowledge. Christianity has made the Lord&rsquo;s church altogether an organization. An organization derives its existence from big meetings with one man speaking and everyone else listening. Such big meetings kill the spiritual life of the believers as well as the function of the members of the Body of Christ. We have seen this clearly from the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Regrettably, in our practice we have been groping for the past fifty to sixty years. As early as 1934, Brother Nee pointed out that the kind of Sunday morning &ldquo;worship service&rdquo; where one person speaks and everyone else listens should be dropped. To him that was &ldquo;the custom of the nations.&rdquo; After fifty to sixty years of searching and groping, we still did not find the way to have the proper practice.</p>
<p>After many frustrations, losses, and setbacks, the Lord has finally brought us to our present way of practice. Thank the Lord. Concerning this way, I still need to fellowship a few points. First, this does not mean that after we have the small group meetings and the home meetings, we can forget about the big meetings. I have said from the very beginning that these two kinds of meetings are like the two wings of an airplane; we cannot have one without the other. The two must go hand in hand. I believe when we put these words into practice, we will see that while we still have the big meetings, our way of carrying them out is entirely different from the way of the denominations.</p>
<p>During the past fifty or sixty years, we have been experimenting with the proper way, but we were not that accurate in our search. As a result, more or less we were still under the old habit of meeting. Now that we are suddenly changing everything to a new way, many of the brothers and sisters may feel uncomfortable about the change. They may not be accustomed to the new practice. Some have said that this new practice is something borrowed from the West and that it will not work in the Far East. Other co-workers have said that the new practice is suitable only for Taipei; it will not work in other places. No matter what is said, I believe one day we will see that this way works even in the farthest corner of the earth, unless, of course, one chooses not to take this way; in such a case, it will certainly not work. It is altogether not too much for me to say this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE PULSE IN THE PRACTICE<br />
OF THE NEW WAY&mdash;THE HOME</h2>
<p>The crucial thing concerning the new way is to have the Lord&rsquo;s salvation realized in a practical way by every saint. We know that the only way anything can be sustained in human society is for it to be carried out in the homes. The home is the place where everything related to human existence is sustained. If we have only individuals in a society without the existence of the homes, nothing related to our human living will last; society will be short of the vessel needed to hold it together. The home is the basic unit of society; it is the foundation of a nation. According to God&rsquo;s Word, the church of God is first the house, household, or home of God (1 Tim. 3:15). After that it is the kingdom of God (Rom. 14:17). It is difficult for God&rsquo;s kingdom to exist without the existence of the homes. Without the home as a basis, it is difficult for individuals to exist, and it is difficult for a nation or kingdom to be established.</p>
<p>Christianity has fallen prey to the wiles of Satan; it has completely overlooked the homes. In Christianity only the big meetings are cared for without any thought of the home meetings. A person in Christianity finds no vessel to hold his experience together. There is no vessel to uphold the testimony and no vessel to keep and maintain the truth. Consider Romans 16. Without a doubt, during the time of the apostles, the church was built up in the believers&rsquo; homes. We know that the book of Romans is a book dealing specifically with the spiritual life in Christ and the spiritual living in the church. At the end of this book, one entire chapter is devoted to Paul&rsquo;s greeting of the saints. From his greetings, we can see that quite a number of homes were opened to the church. This shows that the church life at the time of the apostles had a very strong home atmosphere. Under Satan&rsquo;s influence, Christianity has completely annihilated this spiritual atmosphere of the homes.</p>
<p>This is the reason that we must endeavor with all the energy, strength, and time that the Lord has given us to recover the proper atmosphere of the homes. The first thing we must do is to make every saint&rsquo;s home a place for meeting. At the present moment, many saints are burdened to open up their homes. This is a great step forward, yet we cannot be satisfied with this initial step. We must not only open up the homes of those who are burdened, but we must also bring the meetings to the homes of those who are not burdened. We hope that every home can be opened to become a place for meeting. Each opened home means one more place for meeting. The smallest places of meeting in a church are the homes of every brother and sister in that church.</p>
