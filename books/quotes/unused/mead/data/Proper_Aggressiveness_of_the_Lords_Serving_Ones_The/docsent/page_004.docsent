   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Love</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We also need to be a pattern in love.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The object of a person s love usually is an indication of whether or not he is childish.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A valuable ring is always displayed in a beautiful box.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a child sees the box, he may be attracted to the box and want the box instead of the ring.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This shows that he is childish in his love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to mature in our love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our love toward others should express maturity, not frivolity or childishness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to learn in these things, we should not read 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, we should read them carefully and enter into each verse as if these Epistles were written to us personally.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Purity</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even though Timothy was a young man, Paul charged him not to let others despise his youth in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Purity refers to being pure, without mixture, in motive and action.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A person who is learning to serve the Lord should pray, Lord, cause me not to give others any ground to say that I am childish, naive, and without learning in my conduct, actions, and words.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This will take us a long time to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Fanning into Flame the Gift of God</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let no one despise your youth may also be applied to fanning into flame the gift of God, which is in us 2 Tim 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the gift in us can be quickly fanned into flame but can only be sustained for five minutes, we are childish.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are also childish if we remain cold for half a year.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to exercise so that our coldness lasts no longer than two minutes, but our being on fire lasts for twenty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some believers may say that this is extreme, but I do not think so.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we can continue to be on fire for ten or twenty years without getting cold, we are not childish; we have some maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are saints in the church who are old yet still childish.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They may be in their seventies, but they are still like a child.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are on fire today and cold tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are old children.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such believers can serve the Lord, but the effect of their service will not have a lasting impact.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we would like to have a lasting impact in our service, we must be experienced persons, not childish persons who fluctuate between hot and cold.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the Charges Being Linked</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>to Letting No One Despise Your Youth</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the charges in 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus can be linked to the statement, Let no one despise your youth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul charged Timothy to exhort an elderly man as a father and elderly women as mothers 1 Tim 5:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we speak at length in a meeting, without discerning our audience or considering our age, we are childish.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I once said that when a brother is appointed to be an elder, his wife might feel that she is the first lady.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A young co-worker took these words and spoke in a meeting, saying, Once a person becomes an elder, his wife immediately becomes the first lady.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He then asked an elder whether his wife felt like she was a first lady.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The way this young co-worker applied what I said indicated his lack of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is all right for me as an elderly brother to speak such words, but it is not right for a young person to speak such things when he has no experience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the most he could say, Brother Lee said that everyone likes to be an elder and that after some brothers become elders, their wives regard themselves as first ladies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the most he should say.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Saying anything further than this reveals his childishness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The young co-worker who spoke in this way left others with such a deep impression of his immaturity that it has not been forgotten even after many years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When Timothy received Paul s Epistles, he might not have been more than thirty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even though he was young, Paul charged him to lay before the brothers what he had been taught 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul also charged Timothy to appoint elders and to deal with accusations against the elders 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These are serious matters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not taking into account our age or the age of the ones whom we are speaking to will cause others to despise our youth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are older than those whom we are speaking to, our age gives us more ground to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, if we are younger than those whom we are speaking to, we must remember this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we pay attention to our age as well as the age of others, our speaking will be appropriate and no one will despise our youth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>CONCERNING THE CHARACTER OF</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE LORD S SERVING ONES</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In summary, the three T books strongly emphasize the matter of character.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These three books are involved with the character of a young person who serves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul admonished Timothy to practice the things that Paul had entrusted to him 1 Tim 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Being diligent is a matter related to character.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul likened Timothy to a solider and to an athlete in a race 2 Tim 2:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whether a person is a soldier or an athlete contending in the games, he must be trained in character.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Paul used a soldier and an athlete as analogies to indicate that the Lord s serving ones must have proper character.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Furthermore, Paul said to avoid vain babblings, which is related to character 1 Tim 6:20; 2 Tim 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A person with poor character likes vain talk; once he starts a phone conversation, he cannot put the phone down.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, by observing a person when he makes a phone call, we can gain an understanding of his character.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Chinese term for character is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is composed of two words: xing and ge.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Xing refers to something inherent, and ge refers to something that is manifested; these two aspects form our character.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>That which is inward is innate, and that which is outward is cultivated.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In 1953 while I was holding a training in Taiwan, I spoke of thirty items of character to the young trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The thirty items include: genuine, exact, strict, diligent, broad, fine, stable, patient, deep, pure, just, calm, single, corporate, open, affectionate, ardent, accommodating, strong, pliant, submissive, suffering, lowly, poor, steadfast, enduring, bearing, clear, magnanimous, and grave see Character, published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I hope that especially the young saints will get into every character item.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>CULTIVATING A PROPER CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If a Chinese child is raised by Americans and grows up in an American society, he will acquire an American character.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Similarly, if an American child is raised by Chinese, he will have a Chinese character.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This shows that character involves cultivation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>According to my estimation, a person s character is determined thirty percent by nature and seventy percent by nurture.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whether or not we can do things appropriately and successfully depends entirely upon our character.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Our ability is secondary; our character is the primary factor.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May we all pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>On the one hand, we should not let anyone despise our youth; on the other hand, we must cultivate a proper character.</S>
