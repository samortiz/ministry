We join these two lessons together because they are closely related in our spiritual experience. Many times our spirit is not upright or correct because we have not received the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the discipline of the Holy Spirit usually reveals the condition of our spirit. Moreover, it is only when we have dealt adequately with our spirit that we can accept from deep within the dealing of the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head1>I. SCRIPTURAL BASIS</h2><p>Psalm 51:10, &#8220;Renew a right spirit within me.&#8221; A right spirit is not what we originally have, but is usually the result of God&#8217;s visiting and dealing with us.<p>Second Timothy 1:7, &#8220;God hath given us...a spirit of power, and of love, and of a sound mind&#8221; (KJV). This kind of spirit, which is powerful, loving, and having a sound mind, is given by God.<p>Galatians 6:1, &#8220;In a spirit of gentleness.&#8221; The spirit of gentleness which can restore those overtaken by a fault and which is possessed by the spiritual man must be the result of man having been dealt with by God.<p>First Peter 3:4, &#8220;The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit&#8221; (KJV). This kind of spirit is not only meek, but also quiet, and is therefore a most valuable ornament in the sight of God. This must also be the result of man having been dealt with by God.<p>Proverbs 16:19, &#8220;To be of a lowly spirit.&#8221; A lowly spirit, a spirit which is not proud, is obtained through having been afflicted and dealt with.<p>Matthew 5:3 &#8220;Poor in spirit.&#8221; This means that there is neither self-satisfaction nor self-righteousness in the spirit. This kind of spirit is obtained by having passed through severe smiting and discipline.<p>Second Corinthians 7:1, &#8220;Let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of...spirit.&#8221; This verse speaks of dealing with the spirit and removing all defilement therein that we may have a clean spirit.<h2 class=head1>II. THE DEFINITION OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>If we desire to deal with the spirit, we must first be clear what the spirit is. Man is of three parts: body, soul, and spirit. The innermost and deepest as well as the loftiest part is the spirit. Furthermore, we must especially point out that the spirit is the most genuine part of man. We may say that the spirit is the genuineness of man, the genuine man.<p>The spirit is deeper than the heart. Hence, the spirit is more genuine than the heart. Our living and acting must be according to our spirit that we may be genuine. Only when we speak from our spirit are we speaking in genuineness. Only when we deal with others in our spirit are we dealing with them in genuineness. Even our spiritual activities, such as praying, fellowshipping, and preaching must all be done in our spirit to be genuine. Any activity without the exercise of our spirit is outward, shallow, and also false. Any activity not originating from the deepest part is not genuine. It is not an intentional pretension, but the use of a wrong organ. Therefore we must learn to exercise our spirit and be a genuine person in the spirit.<p>Generally, a man is most genuine when he loses his temper, for at that time his spirit is released. When a man is not angry, he always follows a certain set of rules or etiquette outwardly, his real situation being hidden within. But when he becomes extremely mad, to the point that he can neither bear nor hide his anger any more, he explodes regardless of everything. What he feels inwardly, he speaks forth outwardly; how angry he feels within, he expresses without; his outward manner depicts his real condition within. At this time his spirit, that is his genuineness, comes forth. Therefore, one who is refined in appearance and who seldom loses his temper is usually a false man, while one who often loses his temper is genuine. His genuineness lies in the fact that his spirit is being released. In conclusion, the deepest and most genuine part of man is the spirit, and the spirit is the genuineness of man.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_112.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_114.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Experience of Life &nbsp; pg 113</div><br></body></html>
