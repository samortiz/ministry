	 <h2 class="head4">c. In the Holy Land There Being a Habitation<br />
of Shepherds Making Their Flock Lie Down,<br />
and the Flock Again Passing<br />
under the Hand of the One Who Counts Them</h2>
<p>God will also multiply the number of the flock of Israel. Verses 12 and 13 say, &ldquo;Again there will be in this place which is a waste, without man and without beast, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds making their flock lie down. In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the Negev and in the land of Benjamin and all around Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah, the flock will again pass under the hand of the one who counts them, says Jehovah.&rdquo; The Lord will multiply His flock to the extent that they will be uncountable (v. 22). This will be the situation of Israel at the time of the restoration.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Jehovah Not Breaking His Covenant with David<br />
or with the Levites Nor Rejecting Them</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. Jehovah Establishing the Good Word<br />
Which He Has Spoken concerning the House of Israel and concerning the House of Judah</h2>
<p>Jehovah will establish the good word which He has spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah (v. 14). He will cause to shoot forth a Shoot (Christ) of righteousness unto David, who will execute justice and righteousness in the land (v. 15). Verse 16 says, &ldquo;In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely; and this is the name by which she will be called: Jehovah our righteousness.&rdquo; In 23:6 Christ is called Jehovah our righteousness, but in 33:16 the city of Jerusalem is called by this name. The fact that both Christ and Jerusalem are called by the same name seems to indicate that in the restoration Christ and the city of Jerusalem will be one, just as Christ and the church are one today.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Jehovah Never Breaking His Covenant<br />
with David His Servant</h2>
<p>As no one can break Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant with respect to the day or His covenant with respect to the night so that day and night are not at their appointed time, so His covenant with David His servant can never be broken; he will always have a son to reign on his throne. Likewise, His covenant can never be broken with the Levitical priests as His ministers (vv. 17-21).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Jehovah Multiplying the Seed of David His Servant and the Levites His Ministers</h2>
<p>As the host of heaven cannot be numbered and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so Jehovah will multiply the seed of David His servant and the Levites His ministers (v. 22).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Ezekiel&rsquo;s Prophecy<br />
concerning the Restoration of Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Promise of Restoring Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. God Setting Up David as a Shepherd over Them</h2>
<p>Concerning the restoration of Israel, Ezekiel prophesied that Jehovah will set up a shepherd to take care of them and to shepherd them. This shepherd is Christ as typified by David. Christ, the real David, will take care of and shepherd Israel at the time of the restoration so that they are filled and satisfied. Christ will also be the Prince to govern them so that they are subject to His kingship (Ezek. 34:23-24).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. God Making a Covenant of Peace with Them</h2>
<p>God also promised Israel that He would make a covenant with them (v. 25). This covenant is an everlasting covenant (37:26). Since God will make a covenant with them, He will banish evil beasts from the land (34:25); that is, the evil persons who disturb God&rsquo;s people will cease. God also promised to break all their yokes and deliver them from the hand of those who enslaved them (v. 27). They will no longer be prey to the nations; rather, they will dwell securely, and no one will make them afraid (v. 28).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Making Israel a Blessing</h2>
<p>God further promised that He will make Israel and the places around His hill a blessing, and that He will cause showers to come down in their season; there will be showers of blessing (v. 26). The trees of the field will yield their fruit, and the earth will yield its increase (v. 27). God will raise up for them a planting place of renown, and the fruit will be for the enjoyment of His people. Thus, Israel will no longer be consumed with famine (v. 29).</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. God Being the God of Israel,<br />
and Israel Being His People</h2>
<p>Verses 30 and 31 conclude, &ldquo;Thus they will know that I, Jehovah their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are My people, declares the Lord Jehovah. And you are My flock, the flock of My pasture; you are men, and I am your God, declares the Lord Jehovah.&rdquo; In that day Israel will have God&rsquo;s presence, God will be among them, and they will be before God. This is the genuine restoration.</p>
