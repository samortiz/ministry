[1]  CHAPTER ONE A BLESSED HUMAN LIFE Scripture Reading: Heb 11:24-26; Phil 3:7-8, 12-14
[2]  Nevertheless, may the Lord have mercy on us that the young people can see what is truly a blessed human life.
[3]  In this world there is not one designer who designs things without a purpose.
[4]  In the same way, in the creation of man God also had an intention, a motive, and a purpose.
[5]  In other words, human existence came out of God s creation and also lies in God s creation, and it is entirely for the purpose of God s creation.
[6]  When God created man, He created only a framework ; man did not have God s divine life within him to live out the reality of love, light, holiness, and righteousness.
[7]  From our experience we can truly testify that a blessed human life is a human life with Christ.
[8]  When we have Christ, we are blessed; when we have Christ, we are joyful.
[9]  From April of 1925 when I was saved until today, for sixty-two years I have never regretted my believing in Jesus.
[10]  Although sometimes I do feel that believing in Jesus is quite troublesome, since the Lord says no to many things that I feel are all right for me to do, I have never regretted that I believe in Him.
[11]  The afternoon I was saved, when I was walking back home, I looked up to the heavens and said, O God, even if You give me the whole universe, the whole world, I do not want them.
[12]  I made up my mind that even if I had to live on tree roots and drink from mountain brooks, I would preach Jesus for my entire life.
[13]  What they said seemed quite logical, but I was very clear within that it was the Lord who wanted me to drop my job, and if I did not follow the Lord in this way, I was finished.
[14]  CHAPTER TWO KNOWING THE MYSTERY OF THE UNIVERSE AND
[15]  BUILDING UP THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 2:2b; Eph 3:4; John 1:1, 4; 14:9-11, 16-17; 4:24; 6:63; 15:1-5, 16; 21:15-17; Rom 12:1 OUTLINE The mystery of God Col 2:2b.
[16]  The mystery of God is Christ Col 2:2 , and the mystery of Christ is the church.
[17]  Reading from Ephesians 3:3 through 4 and onward, we can see that the mystery of Christ is the church.
[18]  Only in the creation of man did God make him in His image and according to His likeness v. 26 . Therefore, when we look at a mirror and see our face, we are reminded that we all look like God.
[19]  In the so-called religious world, there is a teaching that claims that God is not a person.
[20]  They believe that God is merely a concept in the human mind, which serves as an object for worship.
[21]  The Bible shows us that the God in whom we believe is a person, and as a person He is quite marvelous.
[22]  In John 14:10, the Lord says, I am in the Father and the Father is in Me. In verses 16 and 17, He says, I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality.
[23]  Among human beings, if there were not a Bible, then the entire mankind would fall into darkness, not knowing it is God who created the heavens and the earth, not knowing the stories of the universe, and not knowing the meaning of human life, that is, what a man should be or how a man should behave.
[24]  When the Lord Jesus was tempted by the devil, the devil asked Him to turn stones into loaves of bread, but the Lord Jesus answered him, Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God Matt 4:4 .
[25]  I started reading the Bible when I first was saved, and I knew there is a prophecy in the Bible that says God would care for Israel, even sending the hornets to help them Deut 7:20; Josh 24:12 .
[26]  Christ with the church is God s organism that operates and works on the earth for the expression of God as the eternal life.
[27]  Dear young friends and brothers and sisters, may the Lord be with you.
[28]  I am over eighty years old, and since my youth I have known God and the Bible.
[29]  I have studied the Bible in detail with a pure heart for more than sixty years, and the more I read, the more I believe that there is a God in the universe.
[30]  If, in the universe, there were not a God who is the sovereign Lord and the almighty Creator, it would not have been possible for the Bible to be written.
[31]  I would advise you to study hard and endeavor to learn some languages, because one day you all will go to different parts of the world for God to bear witness, to preach the gospel, and to lead people to know God.
[32]  CHAPTER FOUR THE LORD S WORK OF RECOVERY IN THIS AGE THE LORD DESIRING TO HAVE
[33]  According to His economy, God created man, accomplished redemption, and produced the church.
[34]  His desire, however, is that out of those whom He created and redeemed He would gain a group of people who truly live for Him on the earth.
[35]  Yet two thousand years after God accomplished redemption and produced the church, He has yet to gain this group of people that He longs for.
[36]  Although God in His grace left them a seed Rom 9:29 and also allowed the nation of Israel to be restored in 1948, today in our generation, before our eyes, the nation of Israel is in a condition far away from God, not knowing God at all.
[37]  According to our study of biblical prophecies and the world situation, we truly feel that today we are in the last age.
[38]  In Matthew 24 the Lord says that when you see the branch of the fig tree becoming tender and putting forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near v. 32 . The summer is the day of the Lord s coming, and the branch s becoming tender and putting forth its leaves is the restoration of the nation of Israel, which will be the time of the Lord s second coming.
[39]  THE REASON FOR THE WHOLE EARTH S BEING OPENED TO THE LORD S RECOVERY
[40]  The Lord s recovery does not merely belong to us who are only a small number, but the Lord s recovery belongs to all of God s children.
[41]  However, if we take the way of the Lord, even if the Lord delays His return and we fall asleep, when we meet the Lord we will have boldness because we are not empty-handed; we bring with us those whom we have led to salvation.
[42]  We all hope that our human life is a blessed human life, and we all wish to enjoy blessing and happiness.
[43]  The Lord Jesus is the embodiment of God, and He is also the expression of God.
[44]  When we have the Lord Jesus, we have the source of blessing, and when we have the source of blessing, we have a blessed living.
[45]  Through the recovery of the truth, the Lord raised up many churches in all parts of the world.
[46]  In 1949 in the Lord s recovery there were less than a hundred churches overseas, most of them being in Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia.
[47]  Back then we did not know how the Lord s recovery would spread out, because we were born in China and grew up in China, and the vast land of China was more than enough for us to do the Lord s work.
[48]  OF THE LORD S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:9-10; 2:19-20; 5:23-24; Matt 24:14; Acts 1:8-11; 2 Tim 4:7-8; Rev 22:17, 20; 14:1, 4b GOD REVEALING VISIONS TO MAN THROUGH DREAMS
[49]  In the Bible, dreams are very close to the visions given to man by God.
[50]  I was saved in April of 1925, and from then on I loved the Lord and desired earnestly to know the Bible.
[51]  I rarely have dreams when I sleep, but I had a dream one night.
[52]  In the dream I held a cane in my hand, walking peacefully until I came to a place with a steep, crooked downward slope with four steps.
[53]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE TREASURE OF THE UNIVERSE THE WONDERFUL COMPOSITION OF THE EARTH
[54]  As saved ones, we have truly been blessed with God s special grace, so we should go and preach the gospel everywhere.
[55]  I remember that every time the school took us on a field trip, whenever we passed by a temple a classmate would bring up questions concerning God, and I would argue with him, telling him that all those idols are false and that only the God we have in Christianity is real.
[56]  Still, walking on the road one day I spontaneously told God, O God, some day I will carry a Bible bag and preach the gospel in all the villages and small towns.
[57]  Regardless of how long we have been in the church life, I believe that we all have the same feeling that we are growing, God s golden nature is also growing within us, and that there is transformation within us.
[58]  OF THE NEW TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:6, 8; Col 1:27-29; Eph 3:8-10; 4:11-13; 2 Cor 4:1-2, 5
[59]  The ministry of the New Testament serving ones ministers is to announce Christ and to dispense and minister Christ with His riches to people to produce the local churches for the building up of the universal Body of Christ as the expression of the Triune God.
[60]  Recently, after several trainings the Lord has truly graced us in every way, and He truly has spoken to us, clearly revealing to us the new way that He wants us to take.
[61]  The first aspect is that God in His grace, through His redemption, and by His Spirit has raised up a group of people who love Him, who are willing to forsake everything for Him, and who set apart their time to serve Him.
[62]  Ephesians 3:8 through 10 clearly shows us that we who are called by God, who bear God s commission, and who do the work of Christ, on the one hand, have to supply people with the unsearchable riches of Christ, and on the other hand, we have to enlighten all that they may see the mystery, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.
[63]  We do not go out to preach a religion, nor do we go to preach any philosophy or doctrine.
[64]  We preach Jesus Christ, the living God and Savior.
[65]  Wherever a person is, if he is willing to open himself and call on the Lord s name, the Lord as the Spirit will enter into him like fresh air, causing him to receive Christ Himself.
[66]  This is the work we do when we go out to visit people ministering Christ to people and releasing the truth that they may be enlightened and be able to see the mystery which has been hidden in God throughout the ages.
[67]  It is with such a Lord that we go out to preach the gospel, and we preach not only the truth of the gospel, but all the more we preach this living Christ as the center of the gospel.
[68]  May the Lord be with you all, that regardless of which country or place you return to, you will have Christ accompanying you, and you will also have the truth of God filling you within, so that wherever you are, what is expressed in your living and your conduct is not any sinful, corrupted thing, nor yourself, but the living Christ, the shining Christ.
