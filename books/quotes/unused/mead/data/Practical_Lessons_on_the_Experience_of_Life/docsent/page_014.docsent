   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>By Praying for Them</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to help someone in this way, we must pray for him to find one way or another to bring him through the crisis of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By Fellowshipping with Them Giving a Testimony of Consecration</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then after we have a certain amount of prayer, we should fellowship with that person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we need the proper techniques.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of course, the way we take depends on the Lord's leading at the time, but our fellowship will usually be in one of several ways.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One way is to give him a testimony of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may give our own testimony, but to present someone else's testimony can also be effective.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Having a Fresh Sense of the Lord's Loveliness</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A second way is to help him to realize the Lord's love and how lovable He is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not easy to do.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many ministers realize that the most difficult message to give is one on the loveliness of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To speak of the Lord being faithful, great, or marvelous is easy, but some brothers may not be able to speak for five minutes on the loveliness of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To say something about the loveliness of the Lord requires that we have the fresh sense of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Someone may have love for a brother, for example, but after working with him for a year he no longer has a fresh sense of love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even a husband and wife can lose the fresh sense of love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not have a fresh sense, it is hard to speak about love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may talk about love, but we may not have the power of inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The most effective way to help people to consecrate is to help them to realize the loveliness of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have heard the testimony of a certain co-working sister many times.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every time she speaks of the Lord's loveliness, she speaks with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With her there is always the freshness of the sense of His loveliness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have never heard her testimony when I did not see many people weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She has caused thousands of people to consecrate themselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Using the Proper Verses of the Scriptures</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The third way to fellowship with someone is to use the proper verses of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One of the best passages is 2 Corinthians 5:14 and 15, which say, "For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Another good passage is 1 Corinthians 6:19 and 20, which says, "Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For you have been bought with a price.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So then glorify God in your body."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we have seen, Romans 12:1 also speaks of presenting our bodies.</S>
