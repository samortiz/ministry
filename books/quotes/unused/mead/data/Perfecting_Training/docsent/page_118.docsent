   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GROANING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we have to ask: Whose mind is this?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is difficult to say, because now the Spirit is mingled with your spirit, and the Spirit here is interceding within you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In our groaning, there is the groaning of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit groans in our groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even we can say that it is the Spirit s groaning groaned by us, uttered by us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So it is actually our groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same principle, it is the Spirit s mind, but now the Spirit s mind is one with our mind, because our mind is set on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Doctrine cannot help you much to understand these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only by experience can you understand these matters because they are too subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Anything related to life, even the physical life, is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes we have the burden to pray, yet we don t know what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At such a time we may groan, O Lord, O Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is our groaning because it is uttered by us, yet that groan begins with the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It begins in our spirit and comes out of the depth of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That was not merely a sound of groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Within the groaning there was a kind of mind because there was a kind of thought or kind of meaning in it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means the mind is involved, but what kind of mind or whose mind is that?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is the Spirit s mind, but it is not merely the Spirit s mind, but the Spirit s mind mingled with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our mind is set on the spirit, making our mind itself one with the Spirit s mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only the Lord knows what kind of mind this is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible is really a book of puzzles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, in verse 27, it says that He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whose heart is mentioned here?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Surely this is not the heart of the Spirit; this must be our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God searches our heart, yet He knows what is the mind of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This proves to us that the Spirit here is not the independent mind of the Spirit; it is the mind of the Spirit mingled with our mind and becoming a part of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is our heart and the Spirit s mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God searching our heart knows the mind of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Isn t this wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This tells us one thing: our mind is one with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit s mind is one with our mind, and our mingled mind even has become a part of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible s revelation gives us a clear view of such a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our mind could be set on the spirit making our mind one with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>So the Spirit s mind is one with our mind, and this mingled heart, this mingled mind, becomes a part of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we groan, our groaning is not a kind of religious prayer, but an aspiration from the depths of our being where the mingling of divinity with humanity is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are experiencing such an operation within us, how could the law of the Spirit of life not function?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Surely the law of the Spirit of life would spontaneously function within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This operation fulfills the requirement of the law of the Spirit of life to work by principle, freeing us from the law of sin and death.</S>
