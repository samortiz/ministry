All the time you have to treasure Him. Whenever you think about Him, mention Him, or call on Him, you have a sweet sense within you. This inner sweetness makes us "crazy" with Him. Regardless of whether you are young or old, if you have never been crazy with Jesus, you are not that qualified to be a good Christian. The best qualification for you to be a Christian is to be crazy with Jesus. Some in the older generation may say that this is good only for the young ones. But we older ones also need to be crazy. I hope that the church meetings will be carried away by the shouting and praising of the older generation. We all should declare, "Hallelujah! Amen! Jesus is Lord! Praise the Lord! Christ is Victor!" This kind of praising should be a part of our living. We are not actors and actresses. We have to live this way. We have to be crazy with Jesus in our daily life. If you have no human being to speak to about Jesus, you can speak to your dog. You can say, "Little dog, I am much better than you. I have a spirit that you don't have. I am the container of Jesus and Jesus is within me." I am not joking. We are too religious. If we Christians would be so crazy with Jesus, many people would be brought to the Lord. When we are crazy with Jesus, we are being filled up with Jesus.</P><P>When I was young, I was taught how to be holy. After reading some books on how to be holy, I tried to be holy. I was told that in order to be holy I had to be slow in doing things. I did my best to try to be slow, but I was a failure. Later I read some more spiritual books which told me that two thousand years ago I was crucified with Christ on the cross, resurrected, and seated in the third heaven with Him. Then I was told that I have to believe what the holy Word says. It says that I have been crucified, so I have to believe that I have been crucified. It says that I have been raised up and have been seated in the third heaven with Christ, so I have to believe this. But this did not work for me. I tried all kinds of practices taught by Christianity. Eventually, I found out that the Christian life is not a matter of being taught or a matter of certain practices. It is a matter of being filled with the Lord Jesus.</P><P>If you are crazy with Jesus in your daily life, you will really be in the third heaven. If you are crazy in your home with Jesus, you will find that you are really resurrected. To be crazy means to be filled up with Jesus. The last time the Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem while He was on this earth, the people around Him were crazy. They spread their garments on the street. Luke 19:37 says, "All the multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice." Some of the Pharisees, the "reasonable" ones, the "logical" ones, the "uncrazy" ones, came to Jesus and told Him to rebuke His disciples (v. 39). Jesus said, "If these shall be silent, the stones will cry out" (v. 40). Matthew 21 tells us that when the children were crying out and praising the Lord, the chief priests and scribes were indignant. Then Jesus said to them, "Have you never read, `Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings You have perfected praise'?" (vv. 15-16). We are the containers of Christ. We have to be crazy to praise Him because He is the hope of glory and the heavenly treasure as our content. He is worthy to be praised.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
