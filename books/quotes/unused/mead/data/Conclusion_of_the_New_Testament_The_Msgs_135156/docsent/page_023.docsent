   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Experiencing and Enjoying Christ as the Son in His Grace</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the New Testament, grace is what Christ is to us for our enjoyment John 1:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Grace is actually Christ the Son dispensed into our being for our enjoyment in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, grace is not mainly the work the Lord Jesus does for us; grace is the Triune God in the Son dispensed into us and experienced as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In brief, grace is Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 experienced and enjoyed by us through the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John 1:17 says that grace came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In our experience we realize that this grace is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Christ is enjoyed by us in the divine dispensing, that is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the grace of Christ: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The love of God the Father is the source, the fount, and the grace of Christ is the flow, the expression, of the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the love of God is the source, the grace of Christ is the flow, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the transmission of the flow with the source.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Grace is actually the Triune God embodied in Christ and transmitted into our being through the Spirit for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This grace issues out from the Father's love and is transmitted into us by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Corinthians 13:14 is our basis for saying that the believers may experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The dispensing of the Father is in love, and the dispensing of the Son is in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Grace issues from, comes out of, the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The divine love as the source is with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When this love comes with the Son, it becomes grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the reason John 1:17 tells us clearly that grace came with Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Grace, however, is not separate from love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, love and grace are one reality in two stages, or in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With the Father we experience and enjoy the divine love, and with the Son we experience and enjoy the divine grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing, we experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>1 As Their Portion</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the believers experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in His grace, they enjoy Him as their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Colossians 1:12 Paul speaks of Christ as "the portion of the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Greek word rendered "portion" here may also be translated "lot."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul used this term with the Old Testament record of the allotting of the good land to the children of Israel as the background.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Each of the twelve tribes received an allotment of the good land, which is an all-inclusive type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today the believers have Christ as their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As our portion, our lot, Christ is everything to us for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 1 Corinthians 1:2 is the expression "our Lord Jesus Christ theirs and ours."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ as the all-inclusive One belongs to all the believers, for He is the portion given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have been called by the faithful God into the fellowship of this Christ who is ours 1 Cor 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fact that Christ is ours means that He is our portion.</S>
