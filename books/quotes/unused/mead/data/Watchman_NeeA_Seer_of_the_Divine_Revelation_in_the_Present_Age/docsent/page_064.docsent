   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brother Nee gave the following answer:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the matter of healing, we must pay attention to three things: 1 Do not tempt God, 2 Do not accept the symptom, and 3 Believe that the grace is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Timothy had a chronic stomach problem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul advised him to no longer drink water.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In those days the Jews had water ponds beneath their houses to store rain water or water diverted from another source.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Bacteria grew in the water and made it unsanitary.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So Paul advised Timothy to use a little wine 1 Tim 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Wine has a warming effect and helps the blood circulation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul had the gift of healing, and he healed many sick ones, but he did not heal Timothy's sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Timothy himself was also gifted, yet he could not get his own stomach problem healed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God did not give a word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Timothy could not say, "It doesn't matter whether I drink water or wine."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That would be tempting God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He should not drink the water out of a clay pond.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To trust God and to tempt God may appear the same outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The difference is in whether you have God's word or not.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From all appearance, to rise up and walk with God's word is the same as to rise up and walk without God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But to rise and walk without God's word is to tempt God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If I walk on the premise that God can heal me, I am tempting God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if I have God's word, I do not need to worry about the law of sanitation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If I do not have God's word, I should not disobey the natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Look at the man with the withered hand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because the Lord had spoken a word to him, he did not wait until the symptom changed to believe that he was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He could ignore the symptom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord told him to stretch forth his hand, and he simply stretched forth his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord's word is dependable; the symptom is not.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The paralytic did not wait until he was stronger before picking up his bed and walking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord told him to pick up his bed and walk; so he picked it up and walked.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you have the Lord's word, you do not need to check your pulse or see if your fever is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If one does not have God's word, he needs to abide by the law of sanitation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if one has God's word, he can afford to be an extremist, fearing nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Watchman Nee then gave this testimony of how he was healed:</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I was sick.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then one day God sent His word to heal me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I only knew that I must take care of God's word and not my symptom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If God says I am healed, then His word has stopped the illness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you continue to look at your sickness, God's word loses its effectiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I was neither delighted if my fever went down nor nervous if it went up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>My eyes were not on my temperature but on God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whether the temperature was high or low, whether the blood count was more or less, these were not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only the Lord is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Learn to laugh at the temperature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It doesn't matter whether it is high or low.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Learn to trust in God's word and not in the symptom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only God's word is real; the symptom is false.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When God says it is over, it is over.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you vomited blood, God must be testing your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Learn to trust in God's word and not in the symptom, and the symptom will change.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At first, I could not believe that I was healed either, because I did not have God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But one day God's word came, yet my symptom was still very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But I rose up and said, "Lord, rebuke the symptom if it is false."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One or two hours later the illness was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I had a lung problem, a kidney problem, a liver problem, and a heart problem.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In 1923 I had peritonitis.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I lay in bed for over a month.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Breathing was painful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>My fever was high and I was in much suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Brother Miao asked some saints to come and pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When he prayed I felt nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, when a certain sister, Miss Barber, prayed, "Lord, no one in the grave can praise Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If our brother dies, he will not be able to praise Thee," my heart was relieved, even though my fever was still high and I was still in acute pain.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the day dawned, I arose and walked to Lo-Hsing Pagoda to edit an issue of The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you do not have God's word, you must take care of your body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But if you have God's word, you should ignore the symptom.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Treat the symptom as a temptation and a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do not stay with the symptom; stay away from it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some illnesses are healed immediately; others are not.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once when sick, I asked the Lord to heal me.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord said, "The healing will not take place quickly, but My grace is sufficient for you."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then the Lord showed me something.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A boat sailing in the middle of a stream was facing a big rock and could not get through.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord asked me, "Shall I remove the rock so you can get through, or shall I raise the water level so that you can go over it?"</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>At that moment I was clear concerning the Lord's will, and I said, "Lord, I do not ask to have the problem removed; I ask for an increase of Your grace."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There is no illness in the world that a Christian cannot overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you have the Lord's word, do not care for the symptom.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Believe that God is faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Be strengthened by contacting God's word, not by seeking removal of the symptom.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Neither need you fear that the symptom will be an obstacle.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Although the rock is not removed, the water level will be increased, not just some but greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In summary, these three things should be noted: 1 If you act without God's word, you tempt God; 2 If you have God's word, do not look at the symptom; 3 If God's word does not heal you immediately, then His grace will be sufficient for you.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He never intended that we be sick and lack sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Paul had an infirmity, yet he worked more than anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Illness never stops the work.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Learn to commit yourself to the true and faithful Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>A month before attending the Kuling training, I vomited a mouthful of blood and stayed in a Shanghai hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When the vomiting stopped, I went to Kuling.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>That was why I asked the question concerning the recurrence of a symptom after being healed.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>After receiving Brother Nee's help and guidance, the Lord showed me that in this universe only two things are real: God and His word.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Everything else is false.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Since I had God's word, I was healed, and since I was healed, there was no need to care for the symptom.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Since God's word had come, any symptom was a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I thank God that from June 1948 until this very day in 1991, for forty-three years, I have not vomited blood again, not even a trace.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The symptom has completely fled.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Praise the Lord!</S>
