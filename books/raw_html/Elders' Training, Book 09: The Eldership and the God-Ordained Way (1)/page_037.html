<P>Even with three brothers taking the lead in a certain locality there might be some troubles. How can these troubles be resolved? The only way is to have open, frank fellowship in love without fear. I do not feel that anyone is doing anything against me, and I am not against anyone, so we can have open, frank fellowship in love. Even though I was so busy in Taipei, I believe that if some of the brothers had come to me to let me know about some of their problems, I might have rendered some help to the situation. This may have required only two or three minutes. If you come to me, you should come without fear. I am not a tiger. I am just your brother. Some may feel that they are afraid of disturbing me and taking away my time. But when the troubles come as a result of not having the proper fellowship, my time is consumed with them. To deal with the troubles takes at least tenfold more of my time than if you would come to me. Your coming to me would save trouble, and to save trouble is to save time. When troubles like this arise, I receive many letters and phone calls. All the questions are concerning the past or the future. This is why I want to stress that the Christian life is not in yesterday or in tomorrow. The past is over, and we do not know what will happen in the future. The Christian life is today.</P><P>We should be frank and open, but we may feel in wisdom that we should not touch certain matters. If I need to say something, I say it openly to the person whom it concerns. If I realize that more troubles will result from my touching a certain matter, then I exercise my wisdom not to touch it. If I have the real concern, I will pray concerning it. I would not even tell my wife. I have always kept this principle. I exercised myself in this way with Brother Nee. I was with him for eighteen years. Everyone who knows about our relationship can testify that we did not have the slightest problem. Because I practiced this principle, I have avoided becoming involved in troubles throughout the years.</P><P>I hope that all of us would practice this principle. If we have a real concern about a certain matter involving a certain person, we should firstly pray. Then we may have some frank, open fellowship in love. If we realize that the by-product, the result, of our touching this matter will not be profitable, then we should exercise our wisdom not to touch it. We can leave this matter to the sovereignty of the Lord. If we have a burden, we can simply pray. Then we will never create any problems or any different speaking in the churches. I may have the best heart for the Lord's recovery, but I may come with the best heart to a brother and say something that can still be misunderstood by him. We all have to learn from now on to say things carefully and to do things carefully in every way.</P>
