<h2 class="head3">1. Christ Being the Mighty Deliverer</h2>
<p>Christ is the Mighty Deliverer as typified by Moses. When God&rsquo;s people fell into Egypt, they needed a salvation, and for this salvation, they needed a mighty deliverer. Without a mighty deliverer, God&rsquo;s people could not be delivered. Moses was truly a mighty deliverer. Even though Pharaoh had exceedingly great power, he could not prevail against Moses. This typifies Christ as the Mighty Deliverer in God&rsquo;s salvation, releasing God&rsquo;s people from the authority of the devil.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Christ Being the Passover Lamb</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus became the Passover lamb to deliver us from God&rsquo;s judgment so that God&rsquo;s judgment might pass over us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Christ Being the Lamb, the Unleavened Bread, and the Bitter Herbs Enjoyed by God&rsquo;s People</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is not merely the Passover lamb for us outwardly so that we could be spared from the judgment of God; He also enters into us to be our supply.</p>
 <h2 class="head3">4. Christ&rsquo;s Death Being the Separation<br />
between God&rsquo;s People and the World</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s death is the separation between God&rsquo;s people and the world as typified by the Red Sea. The Red Sea typifies the death of the Lord Jesus. Just as the blood of the lamb typifies the death of the Lord Jesus, the Red Sea also typifies the death of the Lord Jesus. In the shedding of the blood of the lamb, God&rsquo;s wrath passed over His people. By crossing the Red Sea, God&rsquo;s people came out of Egypt and severed their relationship with the world. The death of the Red Sea typifies an aspect of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; death on the cross.</p>
<p>In Exodus God&rsquo;s people were fully delivered. They had a mighty delivering one, the blood of the lamb was applied upon them, the flesh of the lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs were taken into them, and the death of the Red Sea separated them from the world. They were delivered from the judgment of God, the usurpation of the world, and the bondage of Satan, and they also had an inward supply of life. At this point they were saved.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. In the Journey of God&rsquo;s People</h2>
<p>After being saved, the people of God went on a journey. The Lord Jesus has an absolute position in this journey.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Christ Turning Bitter Water Sweet</h2>
<p>After God&rsquo;s people were saved, they journeyed forward, yet no part of their journey was without hardship; everything was a trial. However, the Lord Jesus who died on a wooden cross, on a tree, is able to turn our bitter water and bitter situations sweet, like at Marah.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Christ Being the Daily Manna in Our Journey</h2>
<p>The daily supply in our journey is the Lord Jesus; He is our daily manna.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Christ Being the Spiritual Rock<br />
That Follows God&rsquo;s People</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is also our spiritual Rock in our journey, constantly flowing out as living water to supply us and quench our thirst.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Christ Being the One Who Prays for God&rsquo;s People<br />
</em><em>and the One Who Fights for Them</h2>
<p>In our journey of following God, the Lord Jesus is the Intercessor and the Fighter for God&rsquo;s people. In Exodus 17, as Moses was praying on the hill, Joshua was fighting in the plains. In this way they defeated Amalek, the enemy of God&rsquo;s people. This tells us that as we follow God in our journey forward, the Lord Jesus is our Intercessor on the one hand, and on the other hand He is our Fighter, who overcomes the enemies for us, especially overcoming our flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Christ Being the Healing of God&rsquo;s People</h2>
<p>In our journey of following God, we God&rsquo;s people sin against God so frequently that we often bring ourselves into a death situation; therefore, we need a healing of deliverance. In Numbers 21, the children of Israel committed a sin worthy of death, but God caused them to receive healing and spared them from death through the bronze serpent lifted up on a pole. The bronze serpent on the pole is a type of the Lord Jesus hanging on the cross.</p>
<p>Putting the above five points together, we see that as we follow God on our journey after being saved, all of our needs are taken care of by the Lord Jesus. As we go through trials and bitter sufferings, He causes us to sense His sweetness. In our need for daily supply, He is our manna. In our need for living water, He is our spiritual Rock. As we encounter enemies, He prays and fights for us. When we sin against God, committing a sin worthy of death, He becomes our healing. All these provisions enable us to go on in our wilderness journey.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
