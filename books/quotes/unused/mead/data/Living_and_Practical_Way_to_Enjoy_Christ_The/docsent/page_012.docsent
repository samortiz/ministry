   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR CALLING ON HIS NAME Scripture Reading: Rom 8:9-10, 16; 10:4-13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Romans is a sketch of the Christian life and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Also, God's full salvation is made very clear in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Yet something in this book which is extremely vital has been greatly neglected by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter we want to see what this vital thing is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE CONTENT, THE VESSELS, AND THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>FOR THE VESSELS TO TAKE IN THE CONTENT</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have seen that Romans 9 tells us that we are vessels to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we need to see something from chapters eight and ten of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 8 deals mainly with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 9 says that we have the Spirit of God dwelling in us, and this Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then verse 10 says that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This shows that the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ are synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This wonderful Spirit today is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 16 shows that this wonderful Spirit is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This verse says that the Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit, not with our mind or with our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So in this one simple verse there are these two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The wonderful Spirit with a capital S bears witness with our spirit with a small s. The Divine Spirit witnesses with our human spirit, and these two spirits mingle together as one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ezekiel 36 reveals that the Spirit of God is in our spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 3:6 tells us the Spirit begets the spirit "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then John 4:24 tells us that God is Spirit, and we worship Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our spirit worships God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Also, Romans 8:16 tells us that the Holy Spirit, the Divine Spirit, is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The wonderful Spirit today is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That means Christ is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the revelation in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Following this Romans 9 tells us that we are vessels containing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is the wonderful Spirit, and we are the vessels to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But how can we take Christ into us?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The way is in chapter ten.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In chapter eight we see Christ as the wonderful Spirit; in chapter nine we are the vessels to contain Christ; in chapter ten there is the way to take Christ in. In other words, in chapter eight is the content; in chapter nine are the vessels, the containers; in chapter ten is the way for the containers to take in the content.</S>
