   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LAWS UPON OUR HEARTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Testament law, written upon our hearts, liberates us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death" Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are not under the law of bondage but the law of liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How does this law liberate us?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose you loved to go to the movies.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes you would even lie to your mother, telling her you were going to the library when actually you were sneaking off to the movies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Upon your return home, if she asked you what you had been studying in the library, you would invent a little story for her.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your love for the movies caused you to tell two lies, lies that one day will be judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This may have happened many times.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It indicates that you were under the bondage of movies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How does this law of liberty operate to set you free?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before you were saved, you may have felt proud of yourself for getting away with such deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But once you are saved, your feelings are different.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There will be something within bothering you; you will feel disturbed both for going to the movies and also for deceiving your mother.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if you do not heed your new inner feelings, this law is patient.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Time after time you will feel troubled when you go to the movies or lie to your mother.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually you will be subdued by this bothering element within you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The law within thus becomes the law of liberty, freeing you from the bondage of movies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes we testify to others that we have had peace since we became a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, instead of having peace, many times we are bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This bothering One is persistent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He may keep after us for several years until He finally subdues us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot persuade Him to look at things our way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sooner or later, in His patient, gentle way, He will win.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I know many of you have been influenced to go to movies or to drink, under the guise of being liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As your testimonies have shown, you may have seemed outwardly liberated, but within there was a protest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such a feeling shows the functioning of the law written upon your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No matter how much you say you are liberated from all bondage, you cannot be liberated from the inner law written upon your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever you do something against God and this living law within, you will have the sense that you are not right.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is only by regarding this sense that you are brought into liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A STRICTER LAW</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before we were saved, we were lawless.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But after we are saved, God's law is written on our hearts and we are "not without law to God, but under the law to Christ" 1 Cor 9:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The new law in the New Testament is called the law of liberty or the law of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This law is stricter than Moses'.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It binds us even in minor points.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It requires not only telling the truth but also being accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It will condemn us for feeling proud even when no one can see any evidence of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This new law has far more commandments than ten.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us mention just a few.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Repent!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Be baptized!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Pray unceasingly!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rejoice!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Be burning in spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Love one another!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Be transformed by the renewing of the mind!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Flee youthful lusts!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you will turn the pages of your New Testament, you will find commandment after commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are told to "be careful anxious for nothing" Phil 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How hard it is not to worry!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is especially true of parents in their concern for their children.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I recall how my mother worried about her second daughter, my sister, who was teaching in another province, some eight hundred miles away.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One morning my mother was nearly weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When I asked her what was the matter, she reproached me for not caring for my sister and pointed out that we had not heard from her for four weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The previous night she had dreamed that my sister was very ill.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Though I tried to encourage her to eat breakfast and not pay any attention to a dream, she kept reproving me that I didn't care about my sister.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The more I tried to set her mind at rest, the more annoyed she became with me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Finally she said, "What makes you so dull?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Why don't you go out and send a telegram for me?"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Of course, I hurried to do her bidding.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The return telegram came later that day, saying all was well.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You can see how prone we are to worry.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But the Bible says, "Be anxious for nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>LIBERATED BY BEING UNDER LAW</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christians are the most lawful people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In eating, drinking, wearing apparel, and lodging we are lawful.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In everything we are under the commandments of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The more we keep the new law, the law of liberty, the more we shall be truly liberated, not unto lawlessness, but from the bondage of doing sinful things.</S>
