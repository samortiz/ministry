[2]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE ONE GOD'S DISPENSATION VERSUS DIFFERING TEACHINGS Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:1-17
[3]  With this message we begin a series of Life-study Messages on 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon.
[4]  C. Titus to Maintain the Order of the Church
[5]  The purpose of the book of Titus is to maintain the order of the church.
[6]  The unveiling of God's dispensation concerning the church in 1 Timothy, the inoculation against the decline of the church in 2 Timothy, and the maintaining of the order of the church in Titus are three aspects of one purpose: that is, to preserve the church as the proper expression of the Triune God, as symbolized by the golden lampstands in the ultimate portion of the divine revelation Rev 1:12, 20 .
[7]  D. Philemon an Illustration of the Believers' Equal Status in the New Man
[8]  Philemon does not seem to be related to 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus.
[9]  If we look into the depths of these books and realize that they speak respectively of God's dispensation concerning the church, inoculation against the decline of the church, and the maintenance of the order of the church, we shall realize that Philemon should be put together with them.
[10]  God's economy is to dispense Himself in Christ through the Spirit into His chosen people so that they may have the divine life and nature to be Christ's Body, the new man, the church, to express God in the universe.
[11]  Paul opens 1 Timothy with the words, "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, according to the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope."
[12]  Christ Jesus is not only God's Anointed Christ to be our Savior Jesus that we may be saved to gain the eternal life of God, but also our hope to bring us into the full blessing and enjoyment of this eternal life.
[13]  It was according to the command not only of our Savior God, but also of the One Who has saved us with eternal life and will bring us into the glory of this life, that Paul became an apostle.
[14]  His command is of the eternal life and is to be fulfilled by the eternal life, in contrast to the command of the law-giving God, which was of letters and which was to be fulfilled by human effort, without the supply of eternal life.
[15]  In verse 2 Paul continues his word of introduction: "To Timothy, genuine child in faith: grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
[16]  In verse 4 Paul continues, "Nor to occupy themselves with myths and unending genealogies, which give occasion for questionings rather than God's dispensation which is in faith."
[17]  This is God's household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people, that He may have a house, a household, to express Himself, which household is the church, the Body of Christ 1 Tim 3:15 .
[18]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE TWO FAITH AND A GOOD CONSCIENCE NEEDED FOR THE KEEPING OF THE FAITH Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:18-20
[19]  In the foregoing message we saw from 1:1-17 that God's dispensation is versus differing teachings.
[20]  In answering this question we must observe the principle that in understanding a sentence, a phrase, or even a word of the Bible, we need to consider the context, not only of the paragraph in which the verse is found, but sometimes of the entire book or even of the whole Bible.
[21]  Paul charged Timothy to war the good warfare in the prophecies.
[22]  In verse 19 Paul continues, "Holding faith and a good conscience, which some thrusting away have become shipwrecked regarding the faith."
[23]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE THREE PRAYER TO CARRY OUT GOD'S DESIRE FOR MAN'S SALVATION Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:1-7 A PROPER PRAYER LIFE FOR A PROPER CHURCH LIFE
[24]  In the first chapter of 1 Timothy Paul lays a good foundation to speak of the church life in a positive way.
[25]  If we would have a proper church life, we must first have a prayer life.
[26]  After pointing out that we should pray on behalf of all men, Paul goes on to say that we should pray "on behalf of kings and all who are in high position, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity."
[27]  A tranquil and quiet life is one that is peaceable, still, and without disturbance, not only outwardly in circumstances, but also inwardly in our heart and spirit, that we may have an enjoyable church life in godliness and gravity.
[28]  A herald is a proclaimer of the gospel of Christ, an official reporter of God's New Testament economy; an apostle is one sent by God with a divine commission to set up churches for God, an ambassador from God to the world for the carrying out of His purpose; and a teacher is a tutor who defines, explains, and teaches the contents of God's eternal purpose and His New Testament economy.
[29]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE FOUR THE NORMAL LIFE OF THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:8-15
[30]  After Paul charges Timothy to take the lead to have a prayerful life, he goes on to speak of this matter.
[31]  In verse 8 Paul also urges the brothers to pray "without wrath and reasoning."
[32]  In verse 15 Paul concludes, "But she shall be saved through childbearing, if they remain in faith and love and holiness with sobriety."
[33]  In the first two chapters of 1 Timothy Paul gives practical instructions to have a proper local church: 1 terminate the distraction of differing teachings 1:3-11 ; 2 emphasize God's dispensation, making it the central line and goal of the Christian life 1:4-6 ; 3 preach Christ to save sinners 1:12-17 ; 4 war a good warfare for God's New Testament economy by holding faith and a good conscience 1:18-19 ; 5 deal with the heretical teachers and the opposers of the apostle 1:20 ; 6 let the leading ones take the lead to have a prayer life, interceding for all men that Christ's redemption may be testified in due time 2:1-7 ; 7 let the brothers follow the pattern of prayer, praying all the time 2:8 ; and 8 let the sisters adorn themselves in proper deportment and subject themselves to the brothers, remaining in quietness, faith, love, and holiness with sobriety.
[34]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE FIVE OVERSEERS AND DEACONS FOR THE CHURCH'S ADMINISTRATION Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:1-13
[35]  In 3:1-13 Paul speaks of overseers and deacons for the church's administration.
[36]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE SIX THE FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:14-16
[37]  First Timothy 3:14-16 is the most crucial portion in the four books of 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon.
[38]  Paul has covered the matters of the differing teachings, the dispensation of God, the need for the leading ones to have a prayer life so that all the other brothers may follow, and the charge to the sisters to remain in faith, love, and holiness with sobriety.
[39]  Verse 15 continues, "But if I delay, that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth."
[40]  The words "know how one ought to conduct himself" indicate that in this book Paul gives instructions concerning how to take care of a local church.
[41]  The conjunction "and" in verse 16 indicates that Paul has not finished speaking about the church in verse 15.
[42]  According to the context, godliness in verse 16 refers not only to piety, but to the living of God in the church, that is, God as life lived out in the church.
[43]  The first part of verse 16 speaks of a matter the mystery of godliness.
[44]  Hence, we would expect Paul to use the relative pronoun "which" to refer to the mystery of godliness as a matter.
[45]  When a church is well taken care of according to the instructions given in the first two chapters, with the oversight of the elders and the service of the deacons fully established, as revealed in chapter three, the church will function as the house and household of the living God for His move on the earth and as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world.
[46]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE SEVEN THE PREDICTION OF THE DECLINE OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 4:1-5
[47]  In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul says definitely that concerning a particular matter he does not have a word from the Lord, but that he gives his opinion, his judgment, as one who has received the mercy of the Lord to be faithful v. 25 . But as we read this portion of the Bible today, we see that Paul's word is in fact the word of the Lord.
[48]  In verse 3 Paul speaks of "foods which God has created to be partaken of with thanksgiving."
[49]  As those who are saved by believing in the Lord Jesus for salvation and who know the content, the reality, of God's economy concerning Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ, we should be thankful for all the food we eat.
[50]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE EIGHT A GOOD MINISTER OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 4:6-16
[51]  In 4:6 Paul uses the expression "a good minister of Christ Jesus."
[52]  A minister of Christ is one who serves others with Christ, ministering Christ as Savior, life, life supply, and every positive thing.
[53]  In verse 6 Paul specifically speaks of "being nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching."
[54]  In verse 10 Paul goes on to say, "For to this end we labor and strive, because we have set our hope on the living God, Who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe."
[55]  In verse 12 Paul says to Timothy, "Let no one despise your youth, but be a pattern to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity."
[56]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE NINE DEALING WITH THE SAINTS OF DIFFERENT AGES Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 5:1-16 THE DIVINE STANDARD AND THE HUMAN LEVEL
[57]  At the end of chapter three Paul comes to the high point of God's economy.
[58]  In 5:1-16 we see in the second place that Paul instructed Timothy to exercise wisdom.
[59]  His word not to upbraid an elderly man, but to entreat him as a father is a word of wisdom.
[60]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE TEN DEALING WITH THE ELDERS Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 5:17-25
[61]  In 5:17-25 Paul instructs Timothy concerning how to deal with the elders.
[62]  If we read the New Testament carefully, we shall see that the elders are not appointed by anyone who is a dictator or who exercises autonomous authority.
[63]  As the saints in a particular locality meet together to worship God and to serve the Lord, it will be manifested that certain brothers have a greater degree of maturity than others.
[64]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE ELEVEN DEALING WITH SLAVES AND MONEY LOVERS Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 6:1-10
[65]  In 6:1-10 Paul deals with slaves and with money lovers.
[66]  In 6:1 and 2 Paul charges those who are slaves under the yoke to count their masters worthy of all honor so that "the name of God and the teaching be not blasphemed."
[67]  In verse 6 Paul says, "But godliness with contentment is great gain."
[68]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST TIMOTHY MESSAGE TWELVE A MAN OF GOD Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 6:11-21
[69]  In 1:4 we read of God's dispensation, and in 6:11 Paul uses the expression "man of God."
[70]  A man of God is one who partakes of God's life and nature John 1:13; 2 Pet 1:4 and thus becomes one with Him in His life and nature 1 Cor 6:17 and thereby expresses Him.
[71]  In verse 12 Paul also says, "Lay hold on the eternal life to which you were called and have confessed the good confession before many witnesses."
[72]  To fight the good fight of the faith in the Christian life, especially in the Christian ministry, we need to lay hold on this divine life and not trust in our human life.
[73]  To bring forth God's dispensation concerning the church in 1 Timothy, to confront the process of the church's decline in 2 Timothy, and to maintain good order in the church life in Titus, this life is a prerequisite.
[74]  We were born of the human natural life, but we were reborn of the divine eternal life when we were called by God in Christ.
[75]  In verse 13 Paul goes on to say, "I charge you before God, Who gives life to all things, and Christ Jesus, Who witnessed before Pontius Pilate the good confession."
[76]  Here Paul describes God as the One who gives life to all things.
[77]  Paul's concept in verse 13 is that God gives life and that when Christ was on earth, He lived the eternal life.
[78]  He charges Timothy before God because God gives life to all things, and he charges him before Christ Jesus because He lived the eternal life and confessed it before Pontius Pilate.
[79]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY MESSAGE ONE THE DIVINE PROVISIONS FOR THE INOCULATION AGAINST THE DECLINE OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 1:1-14
[80]  Second Timothy, the last Epistle written by Paul, opens with the words, "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, to Timothy, beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
[81]  Due to this, in the opening of this encouraging, strengthening, and establishing Epistle, he confirmed to Timothy that he was an apostle of Christ, not only through the will of God, but also according to the promise of life which is in Christ.
[82]  This implies that the churches may become degraded, and many of the saints may backslide in unfaithfulness, but the eternal life, the divine life, the uncreated life of God, promised by God in His holy writings and given to the apostle and all the believers, remains forever the same.
[83]  Because he himself was encouraged in the life of God and not disappointed by the situation, Paul wrote the Second Epistle to Timothy not only as an encouragement and strengthening to a younger co-worker, but also as an inoculation for the entire Body of Christ against the decline of the church.
[84]  In verse 1 Paul says that he was an apostle not only through the will of God, but also according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus.
[85]  Verse 5 says, "Having been reminded of the unfeigned faith in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded dwells also in you."
[86]  Therefore, to repeat, faith refers to the organic union between us and the Triune God in which we contact the living God through His Word and by His Spirit to receive His infusion.
[87]  In 1:9-10a Paul says, speaking of God, "Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, but now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus."
[88]  God has not only saved us to enjoy His blessing, but also called us with a holy calling, a calling for a particular cause, to fulfill His purpose.
[89]  The purpose here is God's plan according to His will to place us into Christ, making us one with Him to share His life and position that we may be His testimony.
[90]  In verse 9 Paul says that God's grace was given to us before times eternal; in verse 10 he says that this grace has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus.
[91]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY MESSAGE TWO THE BASIC FACTOR OF THE DECLINE FORSAKING THE APOSTLE AND HIS MINISTRY Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 1:15-18
[92]  In this message we shall consider 1:15-18, verses which show that the basic factor of the decline consists in forsaking the apostle and his ministry.
[93]  Based on his charge to Timothy in verses 1 through 7, Paul says in verse 8, "Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; but suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God."
[94]  In verse 9 Paul goes on to speak of God who "saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal."
[95]  In 1:15 Paul says, "This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes."
[96]  Even though these young people began to undermine the work in Taiwan, I simply waited and prayed.
[97]  At one point I told them frankly that I would follow the way of Christ and the church for eternity.
[98]  We have pointed out that the subject of 2 Timothy is inoculation against the decline of the church.
[99]  In verse 3 Paul continues, "Take your share in suffering evil as a good soldier of Christ Jesus."
[100]  After telling Timothy to consider what he says and that the Lord will give him understanding in all things v. 7 , Paul goes on to say, "Remember Jesus Christ, raised from among the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel." The word "raised" in verse 8 indicates Christ's victory over death by His divine life with its resurrection power.
[101]  Paul says that he suffered evil "unto bonds as a criminal," but that "the word of God is not bound" v. 9 . In spite of all the opposition by human efforts that were instigated by the enemy, Satan, the bonds of the apostle released the word of God, giving it free course and making it more prevailing.
[102]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY MESSAGE FOUR THE SPREAD OF THE DECLINE Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 2:16-26
[103]  Second Timothy 2:16 is a contrast to Paul's word in verse 15, where he says, "Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth."
[104]  Nevertheless, if we consider verse 19 according to the context of the chapter, we shall see that the foundation here does not refer to Christ as the foundation of the church, but refers to the church as the foundation, or base, of the truth.
[105]  In verse 20 Paul continues, "But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthen, and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor."
[106]  The house of God defined in 1 Timothy 3:15 and 16 is the genuine church in its divine nature and essential character as the foundation of the truth, whereas the great house here refers to the deteriorated church in its mixed character, as illustrated by the abnormally big tree in Matthew 13:31 and 32.
[107]  To call on the Lord out of a pure heart is to "name the name of the Lord" in our prayer and praise to Him.
[108]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY MESSAGE FIVE THE WORSENING OF THE DECLINE Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:1-13
[109]  After a word of introduction 1:1-2 , Paul speaks of the divine provisions for the inoculation: a pure conscience, unfeigned faith, the divine gift, a strong spirit, eternal grace, incorruptible life, the healthy word, and the indwelling Spirit 1:3-14 .
[110]  Toward the end of chapter two Paul declared that "the firm foundation of God stands" v. 19 , and that we should "flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart" v. 22 . Furthermore, if in meekness we correct those who oppose, "God may give them repentance unto the full knowledge of the truth, and they may return to soberness out of the snare of the Devil" vv.
[111]  In verse 2 Paul goes on to say, "For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy."
[112]  In verse 10 Paul reminds Timothy, "But you have closely followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, endurance."
[113]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY MESSAGE SIX THE ANTIDOTE OF THE INOCULATION Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:14-17
[114]  As we shall see, this antidote is the divine word of the Old Testament and the New Testament, the God-breathed Scripture which is profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness and which completes the man of God and fully equips him for every good work.
[115]  The Greek words rendered, "All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable," may also be translated "Every Scripture God-breathed is also profitable."
[116]  They point out that the holy Scripture is for teaching, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness and that it enables the man of God to be equipped, completed, and perfected.
[117]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY MESSAGE SEVEN THE INCENTIVE TO THE INOCULATOR Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 4:1-8
[118]  In 4:1 Paul says to Timothy, "I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, Who is about to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom."
[119]  Verses 3 and 4 say, "For the time will come when they will not tolerate healthy teaching, but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers tickling the ear, and they will turn away their ear from the truth, and will be turned aside to fables."
[120]  When we teach that Christ is the God-man, the One who is the embodiment of God as His expression, some accuse us of blasphemy or heresy.
[121]  Some have even gone so far as to twist our words concerning Christ as the God-man and, in print, to falsely accuse us of teaching that Christ was neither quite God nor quite man.
[122]  To keep the faith is to keep the entire New Testament economy of God the faith concerning Christ as the embodiment of God and the mystery of God and the church as the Body of Christ and the mystery of Christ.
[123]  In this message we shall consider from 4:9-22 the issue of the decline of the church.
[124]  I treasure verses 9 through 12 because they reveal that the relationship among Paul and his co-workers was divinely arranged; it was not based on human organization.
[125]  Paul did not curse Alexander, but he did utter a word of righteousness, saying that the Lord would repay him according to his works.
[126]  After greeting Prisca and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus v. 19 , Paul says, "Erastus remained in Corinth, but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick." Miletus is a city in Asia Minor near Ephesus Acts 20:15, 17 . Why did the apostle leave such an intimate one in sickness without exercising healing prayer for him? Why did he not also execute his healing gift Acts 19:11-12 to cure Timothy of his stomach illness rather than instruct him to take the natural way for healing 1 Tim 5:23 ? The answer to both questions is that both Paul and his co-workers were under the discipline of the inner life in this time of suffering rather than under the power of the outward gift.
[127]  In the decline of the church and in suffering for the church, the gift of power is not as much needed as the grace in life.
[128]  LIFE-STUDY OF TITUS MESSAGE ONE ESTABLISHING THE AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Titus 1:1-9
[129]  It is helpful to know the sequence in which the four books of 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon were written.
[130]  In 1:1 Paul indicates that the truth is according to godliness.
[131]  The truth, the reality, of God's eternal economy is according to godliness, which is God manifested in man.
[132]  In verse 2 Paul goes on to say, "In the hope of eternal life, which God, Who cannot lie, promised before times eternal."
[133]  Paul was an apostle not only according to the faith and the knowledge of the truth, but also in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised in eternity.
[134]  Paul assumed his apostleship and accomplished his apostolic ministry, not based upon the benefit of the present life, nor on the condition of the privilege of the law, but based upon the condition of this hope, indicating that for his apostleship he relied upon and trusted in the divine life with all its hope, which God promised in eternity and which was brought to us through the gospel 2 Tim 1:10 .
[135]  The words "each city," compared with "in every church" in Acts 14:23, indicate not only that the jurisdiction of a local church is that of the city in which it is located, but also that in one city there should be only one church.
[136]  In verses 6 through 9 Paul lists many of the qualifications of the elders: unreprovable, the husband of one wife, having believing children, not accused of dissipation, not unruly, being the overseer as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not an excessive drinker, not a striker, not seeking gain by base means, hospitable, a lover of good, one with a sober mind, righteous, holy, and self-controlled.
[137]  In verse 1 Paul says that he is an apostle of Jesus Christ "according to the faith of God's chosen ones, and the full knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness."
[138]  Here we see that Paul's apostleship was according to the faith of God's chosen ones and according to the full knowledge of the truth, and that this truth is according to godliness.
[139]  When we go on to verse 3, we see that God not only promised eternal life, but "in its own times has manifested His word in the proclamation" with which Paul was entrusted.
[140]  In the former verse Paul says, "But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me."
[141]  Therefore, in 1:1 Paul says that he became an apostle not only according to the command of God and not only according to the life of God, but also according to the faith of God's chosen ones, the faith which brought him into an organic union with God.
[142]  In Acts 13 Paul and Barnabas turned to the Gentiles after the Jews rejected the gospel.
[143]  Verse 46 says, "It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles" lit.
[144]  LIFE-STUDY OF TITUS MESSAGE TWO DEALING WITH THE INFLUENCE OF JUDAISM AND GNOSTICISM Scripture Reading: Titus 1:10-16
[145]  In 1:9 Paul does not say "sound teaching" or even "pure teaching"; he speaks of "healthy teaching."
[146]  The crucial point of the healthy teaching of the apostolic ministry concerns the Triune God processed to dispense Himself as the all-inclusive Spirit into His chosen ones so that they may be brought into an organic union to receive the divine transfusion and thereby become sons of God and members of Christ.
[147]  LIFE-STUDY OF TITUS MESSAGE THREE BRINGING THE SAINTS OF DIFFERENT AGES INTO AN ORDERLY LIFE Scripture Reading: Titus 2:1-8
[148]  In verse 1 Paul says, "But as for you, speak the things which are fitting to healthy teaching."
[149]  In verses 3 and 4 Paul speaks concerning aged women: "Aged women likewise are to be in demeanor as befits the sacred, not slanderers, nor enslaved by much wine, teachers of what is good, that they may train the young women to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children."
[150]  LIFE-STUDY OF TITUS MESSAGE FOUR CHARGING SLAVES TO BEHAVE WELL IN THE SOCIAL SYSTEM OF SLAVERY Scripture Reading: Titus 2:9-15
[151]  In the book of Titus Paul gives instructions concerning the church life, the family life, the behavior of slaves in the social system of slavery, and the saints' relationship with the government.
[152]  If we would have a church life which is healthy and in good order, there must be in the church the proper administration and healthy teaching according to the ministry of the apostles.
[153]  In verses 9 and 10 Paul says, "Slaves are to be subject to their own masters in all things, to be well pleasing, not contradicting, not pilfering, but showing all good faith that they may adorn the teachings of our Savior God in all things."
[154]  The eternal grace of God was also destined to redeem us back to God, to impart His life to us, and to bring us into an organic union with Him for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.
[155]  In verse 13 Paul continues, "Awaiting the blessed hope, even the appearing of the glory of the great God and our Savior, Christ Jesus."
[156]  According to verse 13, we are awaiting the blessed hope, which is the appearing of Christ in His glory.
[157]  The appearing of Christ will bring us into full sonship, that is, the redemption of our body, that we may enjoy the freedom of the glory of the children of God for which we have been saved Rom 8:21-25 .
[158]  In verse 13 Paul speaks of the glory of the great God; that is the glory of the Father Matt 16:27 which has been given to the Son John 17:24 and into which we, as the many sons of God, will be brought Heb 2:10 .
[159]  Unto this glory God by His wisdom has ordained us before the ages 1 Cor 2:7 , and into this eternal glory the God of all grace has called us and saved us 1 Pet 5:10; 2 Tim 2:10 .
[160]  Our Lord is not only our Savior, but also God, and not merely God, but the great God, the God who is great in nature, in glory, in authority, in power, in deed, in love, in grace, and in every divine attribute.
[161]  LIFE-STUDY OF TITUS MESSAGE FIVE CHARGING THE SAINTS TO KEEP A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOVERNMENT Scripture Reading: Titus 3:1-8
[162]  When Paul was writing the Epistle of Titus, there were certain basic concepts within him.
[163]  Hence, in this chapter he takes care of the proper order in the church and speaks of establishing the eldership for the administration of a local church, of the termination of the various isms, and of holding to the healthy teaching of the apostles.
[164]  To care for the church life, the family life, the social system, and the government, we need a specific supply.
[165]  The supply for the church life consists of the faith of God's chosen ones, the full knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, and the hope of eternal life 1:1-2 .
[166]  This supply is the grace of God which has appeared, bringing salvation to all men and training us to live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age as we await the blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of the great God and our Savior, Christ Jesus 2:11-13 .
[167]  According to verse 5, God's salvation is also through a certain action: the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.
[168]  The Holy Spirit, Who is the Triune God reaching man, has not only been given to us, but poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior, to bring all the divine riches in Christ to us, including the eternal life of God and His divine nature, for our eternal portion.
[169]  LIFE-STUDY OF TITUS MESSAGE SIX DEALING WITH A FACTIOUS ONE Scripture Reading: Titus 3:9-15
[170]  Before we consider 3:9-15, we need a further word on verses 4 through 7.
[171]  In verse 7 Paul says, "That, having been justified by the grace of that One, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life."
[172]  In 3:9 Paul goes on to say, "But avoid foolish questionings and genealogies and strifes and contentions about the law, for they are unprofitable and vain."
[173]  The positive things stressed in verses 4 through 8 should be affirmed strongly and consistently, positive things including our Savior God, Jesus Christ our Savior, the Holy Spirit, God's kindness, love, mercy, grace, and eternal life, with His acts of justifying, saving, washing, regenerating, and renewing.
[174]  These are the Triune God with His attributes and virtues, plus His divine actions in His eternal salvation: they are things of life, which belong to the tree of life Gen 2:9 and produce heirs to inherit all that He is for them.
[175]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILEMON MESSAGE ONE A SLAVE REBORN TO BE A BROTHER Scripture Reading: Philem.
[176]  In verse 7 Paul says, "For I had much joy and encouragement over your love, because the inward parts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother."
[177]  The word "for" introduces the reason the apostle prays for Philemon's faith to operate in the saints v. 6 . It is because his love has refreshed the inward parts of the saints and has hence rendered the apostle much joy and encouragement.
[178]  Verses 8 and 9 continue, "Wherefore, having much boldness in Christ to charge you what is fitting, because of love I rather entreat, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus."
[179]  According to Paul's word in verse 16, Onesimus was above a slave, or more than a slave.
[180]  There are a number of intimate terms in this Epistle: a beloved brother, the sister v. 2 , the beloved and our fellow-worker v. 1 , our fellow-soldier v. 2 , my fellow-workers v. 24 , my fellow-prisoner v. 23 , and a partner v. 17 . These terms indicate the intimate sentiment in the apostle concerning his relationship with the fellow members in the new man.
[181]  LIFE-STUDY OF PHILEMON MESSAGE TWO A BROTHER RECOMMENDED FOR THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Philem.
[182]  One of his co-prisoners, Onesimus, was brought to the Lord and begotten by Paul in the Spirit to become not only a believer in Christ and a child of God, but also a dear child to Paul himself.
[183]  Concerning Onesimus Paul says, "No longer as a slave, but above a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, and how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord."
[184]  But as we examine the situation portrayed in this book, we see that Paul was recommending a brother not to a local church in the city where he was at the time, but to a local church in a remote city.
[185]  In verse 17 Paul says to Philemon regarding Onesimus, "If then you hold me as a partner, receive him as myself."
[186]  In verses 18 and 19 Paul continues, "And if he has wronged you in anything or owes anything, charge that to my account; I Paul have written with my own hand, I will repay; not to say to you that you owe me even your own self besides."
