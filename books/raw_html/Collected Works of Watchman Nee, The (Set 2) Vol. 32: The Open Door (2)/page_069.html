<h2 class="head2">A Letter from Miss Elizabeth Fischbacher</h2><p>Brother Luan:</p><p>I was greatly comforted to receive your letter today. I am now quite free and am quite happy to write several messages for you. As I settle down to write, I may be able to give you a brief outline of all these messages. Please allow me to first sincerely thank you for your letter and tell you how my heart is encouraged whenever I receive news from you and the dear brothers and sisters in China. Thank the Lord that He has given all the glory to the name of His Son! This is true even in this age of tribulation and confusion. Since Brother Nee arrived in England, the Lord has given me many opportunities to meet with him and to find out the many things that are happening in China. God has blessed many souls in this country through our brother, among whom I am one. I praise God for the help Brother Nee has rendered us.</p><p>Since my departure from your country two years ago, the Lord has shown me many things concerning spiritual pressure and conflict. Through these experiences, the Lord has been leading me to know Him in a deeper way and has been revealing His great and eternal purpose in a clearer way. He has given me much light for my pathway. I believe that His will is to lead me back to China in the near future. It may be at the end of this year. I hope to go to Norway in three to four weeks, and from there to Denmark and Sweden. I should be back by the first of November. Unless the Lord gives me clear guidance, I will not return to England before November, because He has assigned many things for me to do in the Scandinavian Peninsula. After November I intend to stay in England for a few weeks and then go to China with Miss Deck. We cannot be sure about the future, but if we take our steps according to the Lord's will, He will reveal His will to us in a clear way. How my heart rejoices at the thought that I will see you soon and will be discussing the things related to the increase of the kingdom of heaven in China.</p><p>Miss Deck is now in London. She hopes to go to Scandinavia with me. Miss X is working with the Lord, and the Lord has blessed her testimony in Denmark. In October there will be conferences in Denmark, and some have invited me to go as a speaker. I put much emphasis on prayer and believe that God will do a new thing for His own church in this country. Please join me in prayer for this so that I can accomplish all of His will during my stay in Norway and Sweden and then return to China. May the Lord accomplish everything according to His own will. Please give my warm regards to Mrs. Luan and your daughter and to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Elizabeth Fischbacher, September 1, 1938</p><h2 class="head2">Footsteps of Brothers Hu and Hsu,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>From the upper course of the Nu River around Dah-Dah in Gung-Shan County, Brother Hu and I descended to Gu-Dah around Shang-Pa County. We spent over a month passing through eight places. All eight places were areas where Brother Hu once labored. We had to go through on foot. In each place we stayed for a minimum of two or three days and a maximum of seven or eight days. There are about two thousand baptized nominal Christians in this area. However, we met only a few hundred of them, and most of them are not genuinely regenerated. A few of them are saved, but unclear about the truth of salvation. These people have given up demon worship and have demonstrated faith in prayer for healing. Yet there is an element of superstition in them. This is not a judgment upon them, because they have never heard the clear gospel or other truths. During a month's work, thirty to forty people raised their hands at various times to confess that they believed and had received eternal life. Their hearts are sincere and simple. When they say that they want to believe, it means that they genuinely believe. At the beginning some did not understand. But thank the Lord, He opened their eyes, and they began to rejoice greatly. One elderly man in Gu-Dah jumped up when he understood the redemption of the cross, the effectiveness of the blood, the grace of forgiveness, and the truth of eternal life and shouted, "I've got it!" The Lord's joy filled Him. Those who have been enlightened by the truth wish that we could be with them all the time. They told us that they never heard such a gospel before and implored us to speak more of God's truth to them. Thank the Lord that the door of the work has opened. May the Lord greatly bless His own work. We are but unprofitable and empty vessels.</p><p>Since the door of the work is open before Brother Hu and I (there are other places which do not have any believers, but which have requested that we come and preach, sell books, and teach the truth), we feel that we need to prepare the necessary provisions for the work. Before I set out on my journey, I will send my wife to K'un-ming and shop for necessary supplies for the evangelistic work. I will return by February of the next Chinese New Year. If any co-workers wish to join me, they should come as quickly as possible. If the Lord permits, we will pass Nu River, Gung-Shan, and Gao-Li into En-Mei, Kai-Jiang, and Pien-Ma and work there. I have heard that this region is more desolate and that the people are wilder. Please pray so that I do not waste my time or occupy my place in vain. May the Lord gain what He wants to gain in me, and may He enable me to take up the cross to follow Him. Amen. I will not elaborate. Peace be to you. Greetings to Brother Yu Cheng-hwa and all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, K'un-ming, December 21</p><p>(Last November, while I was in K'un-ming, Brother Hsu was there with his family. The few co-workers had one or two meetings together, in which we asked Brother Hsu to report a little about the work in the remote border regions. I asked of the need there and what he would need to bring with him when he goes. He said they first need literature, Bibles, Questions and Answers on the Truth (published by the China Inland Mission), and Hymns in the Li-Suh language. They can purchase only the four Gospels and Acts in the Li-Suh language from the Bible Society. The other books of the Bible have not been published yet. There is no place to purchase hymnbooks and Questions and Answers, etc. If they want them, we will have to print them ourselves. The Lord willing, Brother Hsu is willing to translate Bible Studies for Beginners into the Li-Suh language. This will help them learn to read (they have no language of their own) as well as make them clear concerning the basic truth. We will try our best to buy some hymnbooks, which will be usable temporarily. Before Bible Studies for Beginners is translated, the four Gospels and Acts can be used.</p><p>Second, he needs a sturdy accordion for use in the evangelization work. Pioneering evangelism is very difficult; there is no suitable place to gather people to listen to the word. But the Yee tribes love music. Hence, an accordion is a must.</p><p>Third, there is the need for lamps and oil. It is hard to get these things now. Oil is expensive and difficult to transport. We intend to send homemade candles in its place. The work there is conducted mostly in the evenings.</p><p>Fourth, there is the need for some kind of medicine. The Yee tribes have many kinds of diseases and infirmities, such as malaria, common colds, eye diseases, parasites, boils, epidemics, cholera, etc. We will furnish them with some common medicines to meet the immediate needs. We are not trusting in medicine for their healing, but this is a means for us to draw near to them and to provide them an opportunity to hear the gospel.</p><p>Fifth, we will purchase a tent which holds three to four people for use in their traveling. This will alleviate some of the suffering of camping in the rain in the mountains.</p><p>Sixth, they need one or two mules for carrying luggage; the men can walk&mdash;Editor's note.)</p>
