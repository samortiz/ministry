As Power in Ascension</H2><P>The right thigh was assigned to the priest as a heave offering. The right thigh is the strength for movement, signifying Christ as power in ascension (vv. 32-34). At the Lord's table meeting, we enjoy Christ before God the Father as power in ascension.</P><P>Thus, we see three kinds of supply with the peace offering: one is the bread and the flesh of the offering, the other is the breast, and the third one is the thigh. One signifies the life supply; the other, love in resurrection; and the other, power in ascension. When Christ ascended to the third heavens, He poured out the Spirit of power. The Spirit of life was given on the day of resurrection, but the Spirit of power was poured out after His ascension. Love is a matter of life, so it is in resurrection, and power is in ascension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. In Cleanness</H2><P>The peace offering in Leviticus had to be presented to God in cleanness (vv. 17-21). This signifies that we enjoy the life supply, love in resurrection, and power in ascension in cleanness. We must be clean. If someone ate the peace offering when he was unclean, he would be cut off from the people. This means that if we are not in cleanness at the Lord's table to present Christ to God the Father, we will be cut off. To be cut off means to lose the fellowship of God's people.</P><P>We need to spend some time on this point concerning presenting Christ to God the Father as the peace offering. The peace offering is a wonderful type of Christ being offered to God. We need to see that this peace offering had an enjoyment of three aspects. First, the peace offering was God's food, so it was for the enjoyment of God. Second, the peace offering was also for the enjoyment of the offering priest, the one who presented the offering. Third, the congregation enjoyed their portion of the peace offering under the condition of cleanness. This is all fulfilled in the Lord's table meeting.</P><P>In the Lord's table meeting, after the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the cup, on the one hand, Christ takes the lead to sing hymns of praise to God the Father and we follow Him to do this. On the other hand, at the same time, we offer Him as the peace offering to God the Father for God's satisfaction and we enjoy Him as our life supply, as love in resurrection, and as power in ascension. Furthermore, we enjoy Him with one another in cleanness. This is the fulfillment of the presentation of the peace offering in the reality of the New Testament.</P><P>Actually, the section in the Lord's table of worshipping the Father is a section to praise the Father and enjoy His Son with Him. Much of the time our worship to the Father at the Lord's table meeting is inadequate. We need to practice presenting Christ as the peace offering to enjoy Him as our life supply, as our love in resurrection, and as our power in ascension with one another in cleanness.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
