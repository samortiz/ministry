<p>God originally created man according to His image (Gen. 1:26-27); thus, man&rsquo;s life and nature were pure and good. However, his life and nature became defiled, evil, and old because of the corruption of sin (Eph. 4:22). Hence, when the Bible speaks of the old man, it is referring to our sin-corrupted life and nature. After the fall, our life and nature belong to sin, incline to sin, and cooperate easily with our &ldquo;body of sin&rdquo; (Rom. 6:6), in which sin dwells. Thus, they are old in God&rsquo;s eyes. Our life and nature&mdash;the old man&mdash;are directed by sin and use our body of sin to commit sins. Therefore, sin lords it over us by directing our old man&mdash;our old life and nature&mdash;to use our body of sin to enslave us to sin. Our old man must be dealt with in order for us to be freed from the bondage of sin.</p>
<p>Romans 6:6 says, &ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s way of salvation is to crucify our old man on the cross of Christ. Once the old man is crucified, the body of sin is annulled so that we no longer need to serve sin as slaves but instead can be freed from the bondage of sin. Thus, the cross of Christ has terminated the old man&mdash;the old corrupted life and nature within us&mdash;which causes us to sin. When the cross of Christ is received, the old man, with his old life and nature, is put to death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cross Terminating the &ldquo;I&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; The &ldquo;I&rdquo; in this verse refers to our whole being. Everything of our person is included in this &ldquo;I,&rdquo; whether good or bad. This &ldquo;I&rdquo; was terminated by the cross of Christ. Not only were Satan and his angels, sin and the world, and our flesh and the old man terminated by the cross, even our person, our &ldquo;I,&rdquo; was terminated by the cross.</p>
<p>Most of us think that our flesh is evil and should be crucified and that our old man is corrupt and should be terminated by the cross, but we do not necessarily think that our person, our &ldquo;I,&rdquo; is bad or displeasing to God. Consequently, we focus on improving ourselves rather than on being terminated. This was the view of the Galatians, and this is the view of many of us who do not know God&rsquo;s salvation or ourselves. We think that we can please God, and we even believe that God wants us to please Him in ourselves. Little do we know that our whole being has been defiled and corrupted by sin, that nothing in our being pleases God, and that nothing from our being is acceptable to God. God does not expect us to do anything for Him; neither does He require anything of us. God has no desire that we would improve ourselves through our own efforts. His forethought was focused on our complete termination through the cross of Christ. In the eyes of God we have been crucified with Christ; our being was terminated on the cross (6:14; Rom. 6:6).</p>
<p>Many in Christianity today consider the cross to be a matter of suffering and believe that its purpose is to make people suffer; hence, they regard the significance of the cross merely to be suffering. This view comes from man&rsquo;s traditional or natural concept. Many who are saved hold this view before they even read the Bible or hear a spiritual truth. As soon as the cross is mentioned, many brothers and sisters think that it involves a heavy burden of suffering. However, this view is wrong, and it hinders us from properly understanding the significance of the cross. Many are veiled by this view and do not have light concerning the cross of Christ. We must remove this concept of suffering completely in order to properly understand the significance of the cross.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the main significance of the cross is not suffering but death. The ancient Roman Empire used the cross not merely as a cruel punishment but as a capital punishment, not merely to inflict suffering but to put to death. The punishment of the cross did have an element of suffering, but its ultimate purpose was to put a person to death. In the Bible the cross is spoken of in relation to putting people into death, not in relation to merely suffering. A person who is crucified dies. The cross is a mark of death, not merely a sign of suffering. Whenever the cross is mentioned, we should think of death rather than suffering. The effect of the cross on man is death. When the Jews rejected the Lord Jesus, they cried out, &ldquo;Take Him away! Take Him away! Crucify Him!&rdquo; (John 19:15). To be taken away is to be terminated. Whoever is crucified is terminated. Hence, the significance of the cross is related to being put to death.</p>
<p>The teachings of many religions in the world, especially Hinduism and Buddhism, are centered on suffering, and their practice is nothing more than the acceptance and endurance of suffering, including penance and austerity. Even Catholicism brought in this mixture of pagan things. The proper and pure Christian faith does not involve the acceptance and endurance of suffering, but it does involve the experience of Christ&rsquo;s death. Suffering is not the way of salvation given by God; instead, it is a method of cultivation originating from man. God&rsquo;s way of salvation involves only death; it does not involve man&rsquo;s suffering. God&rsquo;s way of salvation involves man&rsquo;s termination through the death of Christ on the cross. According to the revelation in the Bible, Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross is God&rsquo;s great salvation to man; death, like life, is an important item revealed in the Bible.</p>
<p>Many Christians regard sickness, hardship, unemployment, or poverty as a &ldquo;cross&rdquo; to bear. Many also regard a wife, husband, children, parents, servants, employees, or anything unsatisfactory as a &ldquo;cross&rdquo; to bear. If we have a realization that difficult persons, matters, and things are used by the Holy Spirit to bring us into the experience of the death of the cross so that an element in us would be put to death, it is not wrong to associate these things with the cross. However, if we associate these difficult things with the cross only because of the sufferings and heavy burdens inflicted by them, then this is not a correct understanding of the cross. God allows us to encounter unsatisfactory matters and difficult persons so that we would experience the termination of the cross in a certain aspect of our being, not for the sake of afflicting us in a certain matter or trying us on a certain point. God has terminated us through the death of Christ on the cross, but now the Spirit must bring us into the experience of the termination of His death through the people and things that we encounter.</p>
<p>God has ordained for us to die, and in God&rsquo;s valuation of us, we are worthy only of death. What He did on the cross in reality, He wants to do in us practically. The cross terminated our whole being, but through our experience of the cross, God looks forward to our saying, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). We have been terminated; hence, we should no longer live.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> </body></html>
