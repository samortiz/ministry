According to the biblical revelation, the seven churches, on the positive side, are the same, because the churches signified by the golden lampstands are exactly the same in essence, appearance, and expression. The lampstands are identical as the multiplied embodiment of the processed Triune God. Hence, in a positive sense, all the local churches should be identical.<p>In the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the churches are different only in a negative sense, that is, in negative things. The particular characteristic of the church in Ephesus was the loss of the first love (2:4), whereas worldliness was the particular characteristic of the church in Pergamos (2:13). The specific, particular characteristics of the apostate church in Thyatira were Jezebel, idol worship, fornication, and adultery (2:20-22). The characteristic of the church in Sardis was deadness (3:1), and the characteristic of the church in Laodicea was lukewarmness (3:16). From this we see that the churches are different from one another in negative things. However, the lampstands in Revelation 1, among whom Christ as the Son of Man is walking, are identical. In the positive sense as the testimony of Jesus, the lampstands should not be different. Jesus does not have different testimonies. He has only one testimony-the testimony of the Triune God. Thus, all the local churches as the embodiment of Christ and the reproduction of the Spirit should be exactly the same.<h2 class=head4>c. To Be Consummated in the New Jerusalem</h2><p>The churches as golden lampstands will be consummated in the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem, the holy city, is the aggregate of all the lampstands. If we consider the facts that the New Jerusalem is a golden city (Rev. 21:18b), that it has one street which reaches all twelve gates (Rev. 21:21; 22:2), that the wall of the city is one hundred forty-four cubits high (21:17), and that the city itself is twelve thousand stadia high (21:16), we shall realize that the city proper must be a mountain. On top of this mountain is a throne, from which the street spirals down to the bottom to reach the twelve gates. On top of this golden mountain is the throne as the center. On the throne is Christ as the Lamb with God in Him (22:1). This Lamb is the lamp with God in Him as the light (21:23; 22:5).<p>This golden mountain is a stand, and upon this stand is a lamp. Therefore, this golden mountain-the New Jerusalem-is a golden lampstand. As a golden lampstand, it has Christ as the lamp with God in Him as the light shining out for eternity. Thus, the New Jerusalem, the aggregate of all the lampstands, the totality of today&#8217;s lampstands, is a consummate, universal golden lampstand to shine forth God&#8217;s glory in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.<h2 class=head5>(1) Being a Golden City</h2><p>Revelation 21:18b says, &#8220;The city was pure gold, like pure glass.&#8221; Since gold signifies the divine nature, the nature of God, the city being pure is altogether of the divine nature. The &#8220;pure gold, like pure glass&#8221; signifies that the whole city is transparent and not in the least opaque. The New Jerusalem is a mountain of gold. As a golden mountain, the New Jerusalem is the ultimate, unique, and eternal golden lampstand, absolutely composed of God&#8217;s nature. If we see the vision of the New Jerusalem built with the nature of God, we shall renounce everything that does not belong to God&#8217;s nature and reject anything that does not match it.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> </body></html>
