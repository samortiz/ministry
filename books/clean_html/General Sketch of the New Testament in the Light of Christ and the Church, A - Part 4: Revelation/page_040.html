<h2 class="head3">The Foundations of the Wall<br />
Being Different in Color and Brightness</h2>
<p>In the city proper there is only one kind of gold, but in the foundations of the wall there are twelve kinds of precious stones. The experiences of Christ within each of us are different. The divine nature is common to us all, but the expression of the divine nature through us is different. Peter, John, and Paul each had their own spiritual characteristics and were different in color and in brightness. Therefore, we should not try to make others uniform with us. We should not try to convince others to be the same as we are. Rather, we need to appreciate their color and thank the Lord for their brightness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Built Vertically in the Proper Order</h2>
<p>The different precious stones are built up together as the foundations of the wall in a particular way. Are the twelve foundations twelve blocks built horizontally or twelve layers built up vertically? A vertical layering gives a better arrangement of the colors of the twelve stones. In addition, a horizontal building has no order, but a vertical arrangement keeps a proper order. Anything built vertically is strong. Our physical body, for example, is living and strong when it is vertical, but a horizontal body is dead, or at least sleeping. It is difficult to keep a dead or sleeping person vertical; only a strong, living person stays vertical. The Body of Christ is vertical in three dimensions. This maintains a proper order. We must always keep our position in the right order, appreciate and respect others&rsquo; experiences, and try our best to coordinate and fit in with others. This is the Lord&rsquo;s way to build up His church.</p>
<p>We should not have any kind of organization, but we do need an order in the Body. A sister may desire to bear responsibility like a brother, and a brother may desire to be free from responsibility like a sister. We may compare this to the eyes, nose, and teeth on a face all wanting to line up horizontally. What kind of a face would that be? There would be no beauty or proper function in such a face. According to the human thought, the lips are lower than the nose, and the nose is lower than the eyes. However, it is not a matter of being lower or higher; it is a matter of proper position and function. We need to learn to keep a vertical order. There is no organization in a living organism, but there is a living order. When all the members of the church are fitly framed, everyone keeping a right position in order, there is real beauty, strength, and function. Beauty, strength, and function come from the proper order.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Having the Enlarged Appearance of God<br />
Based on His Faithfulness</h2>
<p>According to its colors, the foundations of the wall of the city have the appearance of a rainbow. In 4:3 God, who has the appearance of jasper, is sitting on the throne surrounded by a rainbow, while in chapter twenty-one there is a city with the appearance of jasper surrounded by the foundations of the wall in the colors of a rainbow. The rainbow is a sign of God&rsquo;s covenant, reminding us that God will keep His covenant. This city is built upon an unshakable foundation. It is built upon God&rsquo;s unchangeable covenant, His unchangeable faithfulness. Its foundation is as sure as God&rsquo;s faithfulness.</p>
<p>In chapter four there is the appearance of jasper surrounded by a rainbow, and in chapter twenty-one there is also the appearance of jasper surrounded by a rainbow, but it is now enlarged. Earlier, only God Himself had the appearance of jasper, but now God with a Body has this appearance. God&rsquo;s appearance and testimony have been enlarged, but His faithfulness remains the same.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Entering into the City<br />
by the Death and Resurrection of Christ</h2>
<p>Verse 21 says, &ldquo;And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.&rdquo; Every gate was a pearl of great size. The materials of the New Jerusalem are gold, precious stones, and pearls. These three kinds of materials are also found in Genesis 2:11-12. As we have seen, gold signifies God&rsquo;s divine nature. In addition, precious stones signify the inner work of life by the Holy Spirit. Pearls are produced by an oyster in the waters of death. When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand and the grain remains in the wound, the oyster secretes its life-juice around it and makes it into a precious pearl. This depicts the death and resurrection of Christ. Christ as the living One came into the death waters and was wounded by us. As we remain in His wound, the secretion of His resurrection life transforms us. Originally, we were only small grains of sand, but now we are regenerated and are being transformed into precious pearls.</p>
<p>The three materials of the city signify the threefold work of the Triune God. Gold signifies God the Father as the nature of the city. Pearl signifies God the Son who died and resurrected, by whose death and resurrection we have been regenerated. Precious stones signify the work of the inner life by the Holy Spirit by which we are being transformed into something precious.</p>
<p>The entrance into the city is the gates of pearl. We enter into the spiritual things, into the kingdom of God, by regeneration. Through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection we have been regenerated, affording us an entrance into God, into the spiritual things, and into God&rsquo;s kingdom. Moreover, through our experience of the death and resurrection of Christ we have an entrance and opening for the increase of the church. The more we experience His death and resurrection, the more we will be broken to produce an opening for the increase.</p>
