   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ lived a life manifesting God the Father and making Him known John 14:9 .</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He did not do His own work or accomplish His own intention but did the Father's will.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord today needs a number of blossoming Christians, those who know Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>HIS CRUCIFIXION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second category of Christ's work is His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In man's eyes, to die is not a work; but concerning Christ, His dying was a great work, a great accomplishment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While He was on the cross He was working, and when He entered Hades He was also working.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although it was unseen to human eyes, Satan with all the evil spirits knew that while Christ was dying on the cross, He was truly doing a great work.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now let us consider all the accomplishments of Christ's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To Take Away Sin</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first accomplishment of Christ's crucifixion was that He took away sin by being killed as the Lamb of God John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John 1:29 says, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you realize how heavy is the load of the sin of the world?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The load of sin is like a great mountain, but Christ's death as the Lamb of God removed this mountain of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was a great work accomplished by Christ in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word sin in John 1:29 denotes the aggregate, the totality, of sin and of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Bible sin in the singular denotes our inward sinful nature 2 Cor 5:21; Heb 9:26 , whereas sins in the plural number denotes our outward sinful deeds 1 Pet 3:18; 1 Cor 15:3; Heb 9:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Within man there is a sinful nature called sin, and outwardly there are many sinful activities called sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The word sin in John 1:29 denotes the aggregate, the totality, of sin within and sins without.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This totality of sin is a great load.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet Christ took the load away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He removed this high mountain by being the Lamb of God dying on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was killed on the cross as the Lamb of God to be the greatest offering, the sin offering for sin and the trespass offering for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As the Lamb of God He was killed as the sin offering and as the trespass offering to remove the totality of sin and of sins from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since Christ has done such a marvelous work, we must announce such a glad tiding, that sin has been removed.</S>
