   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BASIS AND ATTITUDE OF THE OVERCOMERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Revelation 3:21 the Lord Jesus said, "He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The reason the man-child can be upon the throne is because he has overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we will see how they overcome and what is their attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Revelation 12:11 says, "And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"They overcame him."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Him" refers to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They overcame Satan by rendering him unable to do any of his work upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They overcame him 1 because of the blood of the Lamb, 2 because of the word of their testimony, and 3 because they had an attitude of not loving their soul-life even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Blood of the Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, "they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Victory in spiritual warfare is based upon the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The blood is not only for forgiveness and salvation, it is also the basis by which we overcome Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some people may think that the blood is not of much value to those who have grown in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They suppose that some may grow to the extent that they go beyond the need of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must emphatically say that there is no such thing!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No person can grow to the extent that he surpasses the need for the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's Word says, "They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The major activity of Satan against Christians is to accuse them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Is Satan a murderer?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is he a liar and a tempter?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Is he one who attacks us?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His chief work is to accuse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Revelation 12:10 says, "The accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We see here that Satan accuses the brothers day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only is he the accuser before God, but he is also the accuser in our conscience, and his accusations can cause us to become weak and completely powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He likes to accuse people to such an extent that they consider themselves useless and thus lose all their ground for fighting with him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are not saying that there is no need for us to deal with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must have a keen sense toward sin, but we should not accept the accusations of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once a child of God accepts Satan's accusations, he will feel that he is wrong all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When he rises early in the morning, he will feel that he is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When he kneels down to pray, he will feel that he is wrong and does not even believe that God will answer his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When he wants to speak a word in the meeting, he will feel that it is no use, because he is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When he wants to give an offering to the Lord, he wonders why he should offer anything, because God would surely not accept an offering from such a person as he.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The main concern of Christians like this is not how glorious and victorious the Lord Jesus is, but how evil and worthless they are.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From morning to evening they are consumed with the thought of their own worthlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whether they are working, resting, walking, reading the Scriptures, or praying, a single moment does not pass without their consideration of how worthless they are.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the accusation of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If Satan can keep them in such a condition, he was won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>People in this state are powerless before Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we accept these accusations, we can never be an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Often when we are engrossed with the thought of our own evil, it is easy for us to mistakenly consider this as Christian humility, not realizing that we are suffering the harmful effect of Satan's accusations.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we sin, we must confess and deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But we must learn another lesson; we must learn to not look upon ourselves, but only gaze upon the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Being conscious of our self every day from morning until evening is a sickly condition.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the result of accepting the accusations of Satan.</S>
