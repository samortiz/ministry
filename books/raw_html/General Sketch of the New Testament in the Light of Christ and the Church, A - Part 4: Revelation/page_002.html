 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">AN INTRODUCTION<br />
TO THE BOOK OF REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 1:1-2, 9; 19:10; 1:12, 20; 21:23; 22:1; 1:14-15</h1>
<p>The book of Revelation may be compared to a jigsaw puzzle which is difficult to put together. In order to assemble this puzzle, we need to become familiar with every part of it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A BOOK OF CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>In order to see the subject of Revelation, we must first realize that this book is the conclusion of all the foregoing books of the Scriptures. First, it is the conclusion of the books written by the apostle John. John wrote his Gospels, his three Epistles, and the concluding book of Revelation. Therefore, in order to know the subject of Revelation, we must be very familiar with the Gospel of John. This may be compared to learning arithmetic; in order to understand subtraction, we must first understand addition. In the same way, we have to understand the Gospel of John before we come to the last book of the same writer. Nearly all the things found in the Gospel of John are consummated in Revelation. Not only so, almost all of the items mentioned in the twenty-one chapters of John&rsquo;s Gospel are found in the New Jerusalem at the end of Revelation. Therefore, if we do not know the Gospel of John, we cannot know what the New Jerusalem is.</p>
<p>Revelation is also the conclusion of the entire New Testament. In order to understand this book, therefore, we must understand the foregoing twenty-six books. If we do not understand the first twenty-six books, we are not qualified to understand Revelation. To know what the book of Matthew deals with helps in part to understand Revelation. Then to know what Mark deals with is a further help to understand Revelation, and so on with Luke and all the following books.</p>
<p>Third, Revelation is the conclusion of all the sixty-six books of the Scriptures. Therefore, in order to understand this book, we have to know all the books written by John, all the books of the New Testament, and all the books of the entire Scriptures. Nearly every crucial term, clause, and phrase in Revelation is taken from either the Old Testament or the other New Testament books. We must become familiar with all the terms, the phraseology, the terminology, and the titles in the entire Scriptures. If we have an adequate knowledge of all the Scriptures, we will be qualified to understand Revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS OUR LIFE<br />
AND THE CHURCH AS HIS EXPRESSION</h2>
<p>In order to know the subject of this book, we must understand what the subject of the entire Scriptures is. The subject of the entire Scriptures is Christ as our life and the church as His expression or, stated more briefly, Christ and the church (Eph. 5:32). As we have seen, the entire New Testament presents a picture of a universal man, having Christ as the Head and the church as the Body. Since the New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old Testament, the entire Scriptures are also a picture of this universal man. Christ is the very life and content of this universal man, and the church is the very expression and manifestation. Revelation as the conclusion of the entire Scriptures has the same subject. It reveals to us that Christ is the center, the reality, the centrality, and the universality. He is the life and the content of the new man, and the church is His expression and manifestation.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this book there are seven lampstands (1:12, 20). The seven lampstands symbolize seven local churches. Each local church is a lampstand to hold a lamp and shine forth the light. Chapter twenty-one tells us that God is the light and Christ is the lamp (v. 23). At the beginning there are the local churches as the lampstands in each locality to hold Christ as the lamp with God as the light. Then at the end of this book there is the ultimate, universal, great lampstand, which is the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is a city, and the city proper, which is a mountain, is of pure gold (21:2, 16, 18). At the top of this golden mountain there is the throne of God and of the Lamb (22:1). The One on the throne is Christ as the lamp and God as the light within the lamp. Therefore, the entire city proper is a golden lampstand.</p>
<p>If we carefully read chapter twenty-one and the first part of twenty-two, we will realize that the New Jerusalem is a mountain, at the center and top of which is the throne of God and Christ. The Lamb is the lamp, and within Him is God as the light. This indicates that the entire city of New Jerusalem is a golden lampstand holding Christ as the lamp with God as the light to shine forth. At the beginning of Revelation there are local churches as the golden lampstands, and at the end of the book there is the universal, unique lampstand. This shows us that Christ is the very center, the very reality, the life, and the content of the church, which is a composition of the redeemed ones of God as the expression of Christ.</p>
