<h2 class="head1">THE WHOLE BODY COORDINATING TOGETHER<br />TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2><p>Today the Lord's way is for the whole church to coordinate together to preach the gospel. God does not want to take the way of individuals; He wants the corporate service of the whole church. When I was young I had many dreams and ambitions. I wanted to be a famous person of some sort. After I was saved, I saw that Paul was ambitious to please the Lord (2 Cor. 5:9). I also wanted to please the Lord by becoming an evangelist or a revivalist. Eventually, I saw that the Lord's desire in this end time is that we be coordinated together. His desire is for the whole church to rise up to preach the gospel together. In the past perhaps we had the ambition to be an evangelist, but the Lord's intention is not for us to be zealous for the gospel by ourselves; His intention is for the whole church to rise up to preach the gospel together. Today the Lord wants the church to preach the gospel. If the church preaches the gospel, the gospel will spread throughout Hong Kong. If we offer up everything, it will not be hard to save everyone. Therefore, we have to hand over our all and put everything under His direction through the church. Whatever our position may be, our goal is for the "enterprise" to prosper, not for us to become rich individually. This is the responsibility of everyone. The whole Body has to rise up to bear the testimony of the gospel, to do the work of preaching. It is most unfortunate today that some people want to be independent servants; they want to take the individual way. Let me repeat that the service the Lord wants is church service. The evangelism the Lord wants is church evangelism. This is the reason we have to work in coordination and in one accord. Hong Kong is a highly developed commercial city. It is hard to spread the gospel in such a place, but if we offer up ourselves to the Lord together, it will be easy to spread the gospel throughout this city. I admit that Hong Kong is a loose place, a difficult place, but when the church rises up to preach the gospel, anyone can be saved easily. Who can withstand the preaching of the whole church? It is hard for individuals to preach the gospel alone. It is much easier for the whole church to rise up to preach. I hope that no one will misunderstand this, and I hope that no one will take his own way.</p><p>We expect that everyone will hand himself over. We hope that not only our money, our occupation, and our future but our very person will be consecrated. Our primary occupation is the gospel; everything else is secondary. For two thousand years, the Lord has never changed His standard concerning His followers. He has never broadened the way of the gospel; He has never allowed anyone to have his own freedom to come and go. It is fallen Christian preachers who have changed the standard of the Lord. The Lord never said that a man can spend six days to love mammon and make money and then come to a worship service on Sunday. Today the church has to be recovered to its first state. We must not only offer up our money in a passive way; we must live for the gospel and the Lord in an active way. The requirement of the gospel is high. The Lord has given us everything, and today His demand is for our everything. He has shed His blood and given His life for the gospel. If we only take the passive way, it will be hard for us to follow His footsteps. We have to break through in the positive direction. This is the way to go on. If we have any reservation or passivity in us, we will not be able to go on. May the Lord be merciful to us.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYER</h2><p>Brother Weigh: Lord, we confess that we have been loose in Your service for many years. We have not been absolute. May Your great love grant us mercy and grace. Lord, You have sacrificed Your life and blood to accomplish salvation. Today we cannot be so light and easy with the gospel. May You gain our very person and possessions. Do not let any one of us go. May none of us be a spectator, a bystander, or an observer. May all of us here bear the responsibility of not allowing ourselves to be loose. May we all follow Your footsteps in an aggressive way. Gain us completely and have a free way among us. Amen.</p>
