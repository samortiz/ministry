   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INCARNATION BEING THE DISPENSING OF GOD HIMSELF INTO HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ's being the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David strongly implies the dispensing of God Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The seed of the woman Gen 3:15 refers to the incarnation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Isaiah 7:14 confirms the promise in Genesis 3:15, and the birth of Christ in Matthew 1:22-23 and 25 was the fulfillment of Isaiah 7:14.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Incarnation was the dispensing of God Himself into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The incarnation was God being born into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When Mary's husband Joseph purposed to put Mary away secretly, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and told him not to be afraid to take Mary as his wife, "for that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit" Matt 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit of God, who is God reaching man, had come into Mary's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the process of incarnation, God was begotten in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, a child was born who was called the Mighty God Isa 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because He was the very God, His name was also called Emmanuel God with us Matt 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through incarnation God entered into humanity, and this entering of God into humanity was His dispensing of Himself into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The dispensing of God into man is greater than the creation of the heavens and the earth, because incarnation makes God one with man and makes man one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His creation God created many things, and before His incarnation, throughout the Old Testament, He performed a number of miracles and works of power, such as the parting of the Red Sea Exo 14:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But there is no comparison between these miracles and incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Incarnation was the bringing of God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Regeneration is as great an event as incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With the Lord Jesus, God's entering into man was incarnation, but with us, God's entering into man is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through regeneration we are the same as Christ; we even are little "Christs."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>D. L. Moody once said that regeneration is the greatest miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we repented and believed, we received the Lord Jesus, and as we prayed, God entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The New Testament tells us clearly that, first, God is within us Eph 4:6 ; second, Christ is within us Rom 8:10; 2 Cor 13:5 ; and third, the Spirit is within us Rom 8:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, Philippians 2:13 tells us that God is operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every day God operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's operation within us is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>CHRIST AS THE THREEFOLD DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ as the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David is a threefold seed and also a threefold dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God promised that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the first aspect of God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's promise to Abraham that his seed would be the blessing to all the nations was the second aspect of His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This blessing to all the nations is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The seed of Abraham is Christ as the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This last Adam, the God-man, eventually became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A man who was the seed of Abraham became a Spirit, even a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 1:14 reveals that the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then, according to 1 Corinthians 15:45, Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first time the word became is used concerning Christ is when He became a man to bring divinity into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The second time is when Christ as the last Adam became a Spirit in order to give life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to impart God into man, the man Jesus had to die and be resurrected so that He could become a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How marvelous this is!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ as the seed of David was begotten through His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God and God's sure mercies shown to David Acts 13:33-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the third aspect of His dispensing.</S>
