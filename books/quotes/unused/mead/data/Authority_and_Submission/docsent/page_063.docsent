   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN THE NEED OF A DEPUTY AUTHORITY TO SANCTIFY HIMSELF Scripture Reading: John 17:19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that spiritual authority depends on spiritual attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No authority is appointed by men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not even appointed by God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Please remember that authority is based on attainment on the one hand and on humility and obedience before God on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today we will say something more about the need for a deputy authority to set himself apart from others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although our Lord was sent from God and had uninterrupted fellowship with God, He said, "For their sake I sanctify Myself" John 17:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A deputy authority must therefore sanctify himself for others' sake.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE LORD'S SANCTIFICATION OF HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What does it mean that the Lord sanctified Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It means that the Lord refrained from doing many things, which were legitimate for Him to do, for the sake of the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He could have done and said many things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He could have adopted many attitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He could have worn many different kinds of clothing and eaten many different kinds of food.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For the sake of the disciples, however, He refrained from them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus is the Son of God; He does not know sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While He was on the earth, He had much more liberty than we have, and He could have done many more things than we.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are many things which we cannot do because we are the wrong person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are many words we cannot speak because we are unclean persons.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But such a problem did not exist with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are impatient; therefore, we need to learn to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the Lord was never impatient; therefore, He did not need to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are many restrictions which did not have to apply to Him, because He had no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without the unclean ones being around Him, the Lord Jesus as a man could have had so much more liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even when He was angry, His anger was holy and without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet He said that He sanctified Himself for the disciples' sake.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was willing to take many restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord was not only holy before God; He was holy in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As far as His own character is concerned, He is without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But while He moved among His disciples, He needed to sanctify Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For us to become holy we need to refrain from many things, but the Lord is holy in His very nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why He can do so many more things than we can.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It would be very wrong for anyone to say that he is good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But it is perfectly all right for the Lord to say that He is good.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He can say many things that we cannot say, because there is no taint of sin in Him whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He has more freedom than we have.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yet He willingly subjected Himself to restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord is not only holy in Himself, He condescended to our holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our holiness necessitates our setting ourselves apart from others and refraining from doing many things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In addition to His own holiness, the Lord took our holiness upon Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why He sanctified Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord willingly accepted restriction for our sake.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Man speaks and judges by his own sinful standard.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the Lord had acted and spoken according to His own standard of holiness, man would have criticized Him according to his own sinful thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why He willingly placed Himself under restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We refrain from doing many things because of our sins, but the Lord refrained from doing many things and placed Himself under restrictions because of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We do not do things because we should not do them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord could have done them, yet He did not.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He refrained from many things which He otherwise could have done for the sake of maintaining God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He wanted to set Himself apart from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is what it meant for the Lord to sanctify Himself.</S>
