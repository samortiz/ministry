It is the world’s most widely read book and has been translated into more languages than any other book.<br><br>The Bible is appreciated by millions of people for its accurate historical record, its wisdom concerning man’s relationship with God and his relationship with his fellow man, and its teachings concerning ethics and morality. However, the central revelation of the Bible is life. The Bible is a book of life, and this life is a living person, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. The Bible reveals that God desires to give eternal life to all men. This eternal life that God desires to give us is the very life of the eternal God. Since God is embodied in Jesus Christ, the life of God also is in Christ. The Bible reveals that the way for men to obtain this wonderful life is to receive Christ by believing into Him.<br><br>Among the four Gospels at the beginning of the New Testament, the Gospel of John is unique. It is the Gospel of life. The purpose of this Gospel is to show us that Jesus Christ as the eternal, divine life can meet every need of man. Man’s basic need is not any material thing, nor is it to improve himself through moral teachings or religious practices. Man’s basic need is to be born of God and thereby to obtain the life of God and become a son of God. According to the Gospel of John, the divine life of God regenerates us, satisfies us, heals us, enlivens us, feeds us, quenches our thirst, delivers us from the bondage of sin, opens our eyes and gives us spiritual sight, and raises us from death. Whatever our condition or situation, the life of God in Christ can meet our every need.<br><br>Our prayer is that by reading this new translation of the Gospel of John, and the two articles that follow this Gospel, you will see the very Christ revealed in this Gospel and will believe in Him and receive Him as your Redeemer, your Savior, and your life. We also pray that, after receiving Christ, you will continue to grow in the divine life by daily eating Christ as your spiritual food, drinking Christ as your spiritual drink, and breathing Christ as your spiritual breath.</p></td></tr></table></div>
