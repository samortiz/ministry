        <h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF MAN&rsquo;S FIRST FALL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Soul Being Corrupted</h2>
<p>The first result of man&rsquo;s first fall is that the soul was corrupted. Even before man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man&rsquo;s soul accepted Satan&rsquo;s words. Satan&rsquo;s words represent Satan himself. When Eve accepted Satan&rsquo;s words by exercising her soul, every part of her soul was exercised, including her mind, emotion, and will. This means that she accepted Satan&rsquo;s words and proposals into every part of her soul. Even though the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil had not yet entered into her body, Satan&rsquo;s words, which were Satan himself, had already entered into every part of her soul. Every part of her soul was corrupted and defiled.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s mind was originally pure, and man&rsquo;s will and emotion were pure as well. At that time every part of man&rsquo;s soul was undefiled, unpolluted, and without mixture. Man was simple and pure in his thoughts, emotions, and determinations. However, when Eve accepted Satan&rsquo;s words and opinions, Satan himself entered into man&rsquo;s soul. Thus, man&rsquo;s mind, emotion, and will were no longer simple but complicated. Furthermore, man&rsquo;s soul was no longer pure; it was polluted and corrupted. The corruption of the soul was the first result of man&rsquo;s fall. Whenever man falls and sins, the soul is the first part that is corrupted.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Body Being Transmuted</h2>
<p>The second result of the first fall is that man&rsquo;s body was transmuted. Once man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the element of that tree entered into his body. Man&rsquo;s body was originally created by God, and it was pure. After man ate of the fruit of that tree, his body was transmuted. To eat is to take something into the body. For man to take in the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil means that he took it into his body. Thus, man&rsquo;s body now has the element of Satan in it, which has resulted in its transmutation. Man&rsquo;s body has been transmuted because sin, which is the life of Satan, is in it.</p>
<p>In man&rsquo;s body there is also lust, which is like an addiction. Drinking results in addiction. Smoking results in addiction. Going to the theater and playing mah-jongg are also addictions. As lust, the Bible calls these addictions, which dwell in man&rsquo;s body, sin (Rom. 7:17). Such lust, such sin, dwells in man&rsquo;s body and enslaves man to do many evil things against his desire. I have seen many opium smokers who were miserable beyond description. They knew that they should not smoke opium, and often they determined to never smoke again. Yet their addiction could quickly take over to the point that they were unable to withstand it, and they had no control over themselves. Even though they knew they might die, they could not stop smoking opium. This shows that sin, lust, is in man&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>This sin, this lust, entered into man&rsquo;s body when he ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Once the element of this tree entered into man&rsquo;s body, his body was changed, transmuted, into the flesh. The body is positive, but the flesh is negative (3:20; 6:19; 7:18, 25). The body is God-created; the flesh is a transmutation of the body.</p>
<p>Once man fell in this way, his body became the flesh. Every kind of corruption is hidden in our body. Therefore, Romans 7:23 says that the law of sin, the power that causes man to sin naturally, is in our members. There is a law of sin in the members of man&rsquo;s body because the element of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil entered into man to corrupt and transmute his body. This is the second result.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Being Deadened</h2>
<p>The third result of man&rsquo;s first fall is that the spirit was deadened. The first significance of the spirit being deadened is that it cannot contact God. The spirit was originally an organ for contacting God. Now that the spirit has been defiled and deadened, it cannot contact God. This does not mean that the spirit is gone. The spirit still exists, but it is unable to contact God. For example, man&rsquo;s eyes are able to contact colors, but if an eye is blind, it is dead. Once an eye is dead, it is insulated from colors and unable to contact colors. The spirit is for contacting God. Once the spirit is dead, it is unable to contact God. This is the first significance of a deadened spirit.</p>
<p>The second significance of the spirit being deadened is a loss of function. Once an eye is dead, it is not only cut off from the object of its contact, but because it is blind, it also loses its function. Man&rsquo;s spirit was originally capable of contacting God, worshipping God, having fellowship with God, understanding God&rsquo;s will, and knowing God. When the spirit was deadened, it was cut off from God and lost its function.</p>
<p>In order to know of something&rsquo;s existence, we must have an organ to substantiate it. For example, would a hymnal with a green cover or would a blackboard exist to us if we were blind? We would not sense their existence, because the function of our eyes to substantiate colors has been lost. Although others can see colors, we could not. However, this does not mean that there is no such thing as color; rather, it only means that we cannot substantiate colors, because we have lost the function of our substantiating organ. It is the same with sound. If a person is deaf, he cannot substantiate sound and thus senses no sound. Similarly, if a person loses the function of his nose and tongue, he will not sense the flavor of his food. This does not mean that there is no such thing as flavor but that his substantiating faculties have lost their function. Many people say that there is no God, but this does not mean that there is really no God. It only means that their God-substantiating spiritual sense has been lost because their spirit is deadened. God exists, but they have no sense of Him, just as we will not have a sense of flavor, sound, or color if our faculties lose their function. It is not that these things do not exist but that our ability to substantiate them has been lost.</p>
<p>God is invisible and intangible. God can be contacted only in the spirit. The Bible says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit&rdquo; (John 4:24). Man&rsquo;s spirit is dedicated to contacting God, but because man became corrupt, his spirit was insulated and cut off from God. Once it was cut off, its function stopped, and it was deadened.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
