   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>First John 3:10 says, "In this the children of God...are manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, neither he who does not love his brother."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He who does not practice righteousness outwardly is not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the same way, he who does not have an inward love for his brother is not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He who does not love his brother is not of God, because this love and this feeling are not in him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this the children of God are manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 14 says, "He who does not love abides in death."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This love does not refer to ordinary love but to the love with which one loves his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a person does not have such a love for the brothers within him, the Bible says that he "abides in death."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can understand why a person has no feeling or attraction for other believers before he believes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But it would be very strange if, after believing, he still has no feeling or attraction toward other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His faith may not be that genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"He who does not love abides in death."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Formerly, such a person was dead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am afraid that he is still dead because faith is based on love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether or not a person's faith is genuine depends on whether there is love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who believe in God have a love for the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If love is absent, it proves that the person still abides in death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 15 says, "Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot imagine that any person would still murder after becoming a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible tells us that to hate one's brother is to murder.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A person who has eternal life should never hate his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hating the brothers proves that there is no love in him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It means that eternal life is not in him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's children can be in many different conditions, but they can never hate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If there is a brother who is offensive in certain ways, we may not like him in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If there is a brother who has committed a sin worthy of excommunication, we may deal with the matter with indignation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there is a brother who has done something extremely evil, we may ask him to come to us and rebuke him severely before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But we can never hate our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a brother hates another brother, eternal life is not in him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every child of God has a life rich enough to love all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As long as a person belongs to the Lord, he deserves a believer's love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our love for any one brother should be the same as our love for all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The brotherly love that is applied toward one brother should be equally applicable to all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This kind of love for the brothers makes no distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As long as one is a brother, he deserves this love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If anyone hates a brother, it proves that he does not have eternal life in him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He does not have to hate all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As long as he hates one brother, it is enough to prove that he does not have brotherly love in him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The brotherly love that we are speaking about is a love that loves all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a very sobering thought.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a believer does not love his brother but hates him instead, or if he threatens or attacks his brother, we can say only, "May God be merciful to him!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here is a person who thinks that he is a believer and yet he is not saved at all!"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As long as he hates a brother, it proves that he is not of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a serious matter!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Under normal circumstances, if a brother has done things which irritate you, you can exhort him and rebuke him, but you cannot hate him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If he has done something which provokes you, you may be angry with him and rebuke him severely.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But there cannot be any hatred in you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even if you "tell it to the church," according to Matthew 18, your intention should still be to gain him and restore him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you have no intention of restoring him and if your goal is only to attack him and tear him down, it proves that you are less than a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The brother spoken of in Matthew 18 told the church because he wanted to gain his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The whole issue is whether your goal is to tear down your brother or to gain him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is quite a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must not take it lightly!</S>
