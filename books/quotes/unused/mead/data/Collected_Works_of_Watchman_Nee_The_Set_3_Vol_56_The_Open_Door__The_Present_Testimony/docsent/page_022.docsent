   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The county seat of Changching is about seventy miles from Tsinan, and there are fifteen brothers and sisters who were baptized in Tsinan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because transportation is inconvenient, we cannot often go to the meetings in Tsinan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, we have been meeting three times a week in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are two prayer meetings and one fellowship meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every Lord's Day some of the brothers go to Tsinan for the Lord's table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When there are conferences or some workers come to Tsinan, many of the brothers and sisters go there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We hope you will pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The brothers and sisters all touched the way, and some of their difficulties were resolved.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our hall was too small, and the Lord has prepared a large building that can seat eight hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have begun to fix it up, and we will move in when it is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The old address will still be a district meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please pray for the way ahead of us.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The last message was on "The Spirit of Goodness."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We saw how shallow we were, and were happy that through this message God had removed an abominable reef from the church's future.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are in an extremely remote place, and we have very little fellowship with the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is even rarer for God's servants to come here.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, these meetings were food to the hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They took care of our need and provided fellowship between younger brothers and elder brothers.</S>
