   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REVEALING THE DEPTHS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit reveals the depths of God to the believers 1 Cor 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every bit of the depths of God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is so deep, and the contents, the very constituents, of our messages are concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1 Corinthians 1, Paul taught that Christ is God's power and God's wisdom v. 24 . Christ is wisdom to us from God as our righteousness, as our sanctification, and as our redemption v. 30 . These aspects of Christ are the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the Spirit reveals the depths of God, Christ, to us, we are renewed, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only the Spirit can reveal the depths of God to us.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>APPLYING THE DEATH OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>TO THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit applies the death of Christ to the believers Rom 8:13b .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was a young Christian, I heard that according to the Bible, I had been crucified with Christ Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But I wondered how I could have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Spacewise He was in Palestine, and timewise He died nearly two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I could not figure out how I could have been crucified with Him at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later I realized that when Christ was crucified, according to God's economy we were included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is an accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I still did not know, however, how to experience the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I was told that I had to reckon myself as having been crucified with Christ according to Paul's word in Romans 6:11, but reckoning did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more I reckoned myself as having died with Christ, the more I seemed to be alive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, Brother Watchman Nee came to the conclusion that the very death revealed in Romans 6 can be applied only by the Spirit in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Romans 8:13b says, "If by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means the Spirit applies Christ's death to the practices of our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit indwelling us works to apply the death of Christ as the killing element to kill all the practices of our troublesome body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Reckoning does not work, but the application of the Spirit works.</S>
