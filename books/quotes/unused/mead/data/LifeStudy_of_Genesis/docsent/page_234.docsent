   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>5 Man's Fall to the Uttermost</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the fourth fall man fell to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He simply could not fall any further.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He had reached the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This ultimate fall eventually caused God to forsake the Adamic race.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God decided to give up the created race.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It had become hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It had reached the point where not even God could do anything with it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although God forsook the created race, He did not give up His purpose for man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the one hand, He gave up the Adamic race, but on the other hand, He called a man out of that fallen race to have a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The name of that called one was Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the Bible, Abraham became the head of a new race.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Adam was the head of the created race, and Abraham was the head of the called race.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the following messages we shall have much to say about the calling of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord has a way to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Regardless of the instigation of Satan and the rebellion of man, God is still God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God seemed to say, "All right, I will let go of the Adamic race."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But, under His sovereignty, He selected one to be the head of a new race.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This selection, this choice, was made before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God planned it this way and worked it according to schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God has a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In His schedule, He dropped the Adamic race and called out Abraham to be the head of a new race.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Process a. Conspiring to Rebel against God</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let us now consider the process, the procedure, of this rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this rebellion there was a conspiracy 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Under the instigation of Satan, man came together to conspire to rebel against God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The rebellion against God instigated by Satan always begins with a conspiracy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Throughout the generations, many times such a conspiracy against God has happened among the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first one was at Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That was the beginning of mankind's rebellion against God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Under Satan's instigation, man decided collectively to give up God and to rebel against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Making Bricks with the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>by Human Labor</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What did the people do in their conspiracy to rebel against God?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They made bricks and burned them thoroughly v. 3 . Apparently, this is a simple story, and even little children are familiar with it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the deeper significance of this matter is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the whole revelation of the Bible, God's building has never been with any kind of bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's building is with stones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, the New Jerusalem will be built with precious stones Rev 21:18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Stones are different from bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Stones are God-made; bricks are man-made.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Precious stones are not only God-made but also God-transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Bricks are made by man with the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At Babel, man burned the earth, the mud, into bricks to build a city and a tower.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Pharaoh also built his treasure cities out of bricks Exo 1:11, 14a .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now we need to allegorize this portion of the holy Word in order to see what this story signifies.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to the biblical record, the earth is for growing life 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Growing life requires certain elements.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The earth has all the elements necessary for producing life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even we grow physically with the elements found in the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The meat, vegetables, and cereal we eat all come from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All of the nourishing and growing elements in these foodstuffs come out of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, the earth contains the elements needed to grow life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What does it mean to make bricks?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is, for the sake of man's building, to kill, to burn, every bit of the element in the earth that grows life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you have the insight, you will realize that today every society, every human culture, is burning the earth into bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The schools, for instance, kill the element that grows life, burning it in order to make bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In figure, the earth signifies humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The rebellion instigated by Satan kills the element within man that grows life by burning it out and it misuses man to build something against God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This happened at Babel and, in the same principle, it has happened throughout human history.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To make bricks requires human labor, even a great deal of labor.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Since man has denied God, man has to labor so that he might build up something.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All of human history is a record of man's building by human labor with the misused earth mankind .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This was the way that Babel was built with the misused earth plus human labor.</S>
