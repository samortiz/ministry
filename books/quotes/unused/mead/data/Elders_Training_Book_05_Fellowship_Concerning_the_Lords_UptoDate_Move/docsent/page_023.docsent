   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEVELOPING THE SKILL TO BECOME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A third big Protestant denomination today is the Church of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today it is bigger than either the Presbyterian or the Episcopalian denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thirty years ago an American missionary of the Church of Christ who went to Taiwan told me that there were about one million in that denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Within thirty years their numbers have at least tripled.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Church of Christ s teachings concerning the church are very similar to ours.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, we cannot go along with their teaching of baptismal regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although this is a matter merely of doctrinal debate, their insistence on receiving only those who are baptized by them is serious and very sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, they have become powerful and are very dogmatic in their teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The members of the Church of Christ are trained with their teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They surely know their points of doctrine and their teachings are very logical.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, those teachings have caught the higher class people because logical people like to know doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only doctrines can convince logical people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Pentecostals who go to the campus today get little fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No scientific student of today would listen to these Pentecostal things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, if you go there with the higher gospel, you will catch many.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Church of Christ members were trained by their church to be their representatives.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once as I was speaking in Texas on the Spirit a woman from the Church of Christ stood up to question me concerning water baptism and to educate me with her Church of Christ doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a shame that we have been here for twenty-three years and have given so many messages, but there are so few representatives of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even the elders may have difficulty in speaking concerning the divine Trinity, a major point of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some of you have received all the messages and have attended the trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, the trainings may have been like a cloud through which you passed for ten days, receiving little of a permanent deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Afterwards you may have bought the messages, but perhaps you have never read them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They may simply be on your shelves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How many of the elders could give a message on the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man from Romans 8?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Could you debate with others concerning this?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have many treasures but few salesmen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the campuses the Church of Christ is prevailing, not in holding meetings, but in catching four or five and forming a small group to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our weapons are the best, but our skill is not up to the standard of our weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, we do not have the proper strategy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to change our strategy to fight the battle, and learn the top skills to use our top weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you dear saints would be faithful to the Lord s up-to-date move by developing the skill to use the top weapons, the Word revealed to us, and by taking the top strategy, within a quarter century we will gain all of America.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only will you go out to speak, but you will produce many speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I hope that the gospel team would produce many new teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who are converted will be the same as you are after two years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They will speak the high word, the high gospel, the high truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This will be warmly welcomed by the highly educated people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The truths taught by you will remain solidly as a rock for the seeking Christians to work on, to live on, and to stand upon.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Acts the Spirit was working, but the Spirit worked only through the word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The word is the wire of the divine electricity, and the Spirit is the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, the word is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The disciples preached the word, they spoke the word, they did everything with the word and eventually Acts says that the word grew and multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I hope that after twenty years all the deep truths which are covered in our printed pages will grow and multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why I feel very sorrowful that some of you would pick up something else besides the rich word to bring into the Lord s recovery as a part of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a real distraction and a frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I would beg all the leading ones to get themselves into these deeper truths.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By this you will become teachers and will be able to teach every saint in your locality to speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Forget about being a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Forget about maintaining a little empire for your leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Just do one thing get yourselves into the deeper truths.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then you must teach, in the big meetings and in the small meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Help all the saints to experience the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is what the Lord is depending upon today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Without this, the Lord could not have the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Be fully assured that if we would do this, the Holy Spirit would surely agree.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He would honor this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you would like to receive more of the Spirit, do this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You do not need to fast, to pray for the baptism of the Spirit, or to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Forget about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Simply go out to speak the high word from the Bible, and the Spirit will honor your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Eventually the word spoken by you will become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You will get the Spirit and others will get Him too.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I know what I am speaking about.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the real power.</S>
