   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>BEING A RECOVERY OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the previous chapter we saw the actual condition among Christians in relation to the pursuit of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will continue to speak concerning the truth in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord s recovery is a recovery of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We were founded on the truth, and for the past sixty years we have continued our existence by the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the situation in the Far East and in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By the Lord s grace we can say that on all five continents the Lord s recovery is strong and rich in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord s recovery is full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever I open the Bible and begin to write, light comes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some may say that the books of the Bible are sufficiently explained in the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, what I wrote is but a small portion; I wrote according to the actual need of the saints and according to their ability to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord continues to give us light, and I worship Him for this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a great thing for the Lord s word to come to us and for His light to shine on us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By the Lord s mercy we have been able to convey His revelation in spoken and printed words.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our position, authority, and power lie entirely in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the truth were taken away from the Lord s recovery, there would be nothing left.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not have organization or methods, and we cannot rely on organization or methods.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The truth is the solid rock on which we stand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul says, The house of God...is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is the pillar and base of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a pillar and base are not upholding something, they are not functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What the church upholds is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>LEARNING THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>AND TEACHING THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We were founded on the truth, we began our work with the truth, and we exist by the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The truth is our stand, our position, our authority, and our power.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, all the brothers and sisters respect, treasure, and appreciate the truth, but on the other hand, we must confess that not many in the Lord s recovery actually pay the price to enter into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Toward the end of last year, as I considered the situation in the Far East and in the West, I realized that there was a crisis among us: The co-workers did not pay sufficient attention to the truth; they did not enter into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result, they were unconsciously manifesting signs of deviation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the reason that I called an urgent meeting in February of this year for all the elders and co-workers in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even though I was busy with many matters, I set aside two weeks to meet with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>During that time I followed the Lord s leading and released a strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The brothers admitted that those messages saved us from an impending crisis.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We addressed being constituted with the truth, the need for the truth, and how to focus on the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the messages are printed in the books of the Elders Training for the brothers and sisters to read and learn.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>See Elders Training, Books 1 4.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Concerning the burden to enter into the truth, I said that even though we appreciate and respect the truth, the saints and even the elders lack the practical application of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can be compared to students who study and pass examinations but who do not know how to teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is one thing to learn mathematics and pass a test, but it is another to teach mathematics.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord s recovery needs those who are able to teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is according to the Bible, which says that we should come to the full knowledge of the truth and that we should teach others the truth 1 Tim 2:4; 2 Tim 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When Paul wrote the Epistles to Timothy, he paid much attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul said that the elders who take the lead well should be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching 1 Tim 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Being an elder is more than being a shepherd who cares for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to Ephesians 4:11, shepherds are teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord gave four categories of gifted persons to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He gave apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Based on the grammatical structure of verse 11, shepherds and teachers refers to the same group of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we want to be shepherds, we need to learn to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we do not know how to teach, how can we shepherd others?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, shepherds need to be able to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is regrettable that we are satisfied if the elders in the churches are only able to manage business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The elders surely need to know how to manage business affairs; otherwise, the church will be chaotic.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, the church does not have only business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The business affairs in the church are for God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They are for accomplishing God s eternal purpose and fulfilling His heart s desire, which is Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This cannot be accomplished merely by managing business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It requires the elders who take the lead to teach the saints the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Bible does not emphasize spiritual education in schools; it emphasizes the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This refers mainly to the education rendered by mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We always refer to the elders as fathers, but they should be mothers, not fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The strength of a family depends thirty percent on the father and seventy percent on the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If a mother is weak, the family will be weak even if the father is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A strong mother does not only have a strong will; she also has strong character, integrity, and morality.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>She should also be strong in knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>She should be able to teach her children at home, whether the subject is mathematics, geography, or natural sciences.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In this modern age a good mother must receive higher education; otherwise, her children will not receive help with their homework.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must be mothers who lovingly and patiently care for our children.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We change their diapers, feed them, cook for them, wash their clothes, and teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>These preparations are for them to become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Whether a person becomes useful depends on the education that he receives.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A person s education should be comprehensive.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A mother cannot say that she cannot teach Chinese because she is an expert in mathematics.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>A competent mother should be able to teach mathematics, geography, English, Chinese literature, and even how to use the computer.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Then her children will be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This also applies to education in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Establishing a seminary to train students is not God s way.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The prophets in the Old Testament may have had disciples, but in the New Testament the apostles did not have disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In the New Testament the church is a restaurant, a hospital, and a home that is filled with teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Hence, the primary function of the elders is to teach the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The atmosphere among us needs to change.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The elders in the churches need to enter into the truth and be good mothers who teach the saints in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Then every church will be a scholarly family, and the brothers and sisters will spontaneously pursue the truth and progress in the truth.</S>
