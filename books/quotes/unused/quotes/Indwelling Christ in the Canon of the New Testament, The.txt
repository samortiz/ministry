These messages on the indwelling Christ were given by Brother Witness Lee during an informal training in Los Angeles, California in 1974
The Scriptures not only tell us who God is and what kind of God He is, but also who man is and from what source he came
Once the electricity comes, all the light fixtures become one with the electricity, and the electricity becomes their unity
Outwardly, they are many individual lights, but inwardly there is only one electricity, through which they become one unity
The deepest aspect of God's relation with us is that He comes into us to be our content in order that we might become His expression
God is working Himself into us to be one with us that He might be our content, and that we might be His expression
On the day of Pentecost He collected together all the Jewish members of His Body and put them into Himself who is the Spirit
We were all terminated on the cross before we were born, and we were all baptized into one Body before we were born
At the ascension, God gave Christ four main things: His people, His life, His Spirit, and all the functions of the Spirit
On the day of Pentecost and at the house of Cornelius Christ put all of God's chosen people into Himself to make them His members
All the other steps which we have mentioned incarnation crucifixion resurrection ascension and baptism were accomplished once and for all
Altogether we can see seven steps: incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, baptism, indwelling, and the advent
At this time, from within and without, we will all be absolutely the same as He is , we will be fully one with Him
Satan's thought was to put Him to death, but Satan did not realize that by the cross all the negative things in the universe were terminated
It was accomplished once and for all on the day of Pentecost for the Jews and at the house of Cornelius for the Gentiles
We would suggest that you obtain a copy of the booklet, The Baptism in the Holy Spirit from the Living Stream Ministry
Christ comes into our spirit, and by His indwelling He is working every day to saturate every part of our being with Himself
It is indeed sad that today the most strategic matters of Christian experience are fully missed by most Christians
When Moses prayed for them, God told him to raise up a brass serpent, and whoever looked at the brass serpent would be healed
After Satan came into man and made man the flesh, God came into this flesh and used it as an instrument to destroy Satan
Now we can realize that our Christ is not only God who became flesh, but also flesh who became the life-giving Spirit
Many Christians have the God-Redeemer Christ, but they do not realize the God-Redeemer-Life-giving Spirit Christ
Our Christ became flesh to become our Redeemer, and then He was made the life-giving Spirit to impart His life into us
There are many things which have never been discovered, but gradually, in these past years, the Lord has been unveiling some of them to us
Teaching is always in the mind, but we must learn to care for the experience of the indwelling Christ in our spirit
There was the incarnation, the crucifixion, the resurrection, the ascension, the baptism, the indwelling, and the advent
On the day of Pentecost and at the house of Cornelius, He came as the Baptizer to put all His people into Himself
Matthew twenty-eight makes it so clear and definite: 'Baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit'
He became the life-giving Spirit, who is the all-inclusive realization, reality, and embodiment of the Triune God
He told them Go ye therefore and disciple all nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
He was now the ultimate, all-inclusive, realization, reality, and embodiment of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
After speaking of putting people into the Triune God, the Lord told His disciples that He would be with them unto the completion of the age
To baptize people into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit means to put them into the Triune God
Vincent, this is to put them into the sum total of the divine being, and this is a kind of spiritual and mystical union
Matthew ends with Jesus as the life-giving Spirit, embodying the Triune God, putting all of God's chosen people into Himself
It is being put into Jesus as the life-giving Spirit, embodying the Triune God, that we may enjoy His indwelling presence in the church life
1 Corinthians 12:13a says that we have been baptized into one Body: 'For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body'
From these verses we can see that we are baptized into the Triune God, baptized into Christ, and baptized into one Body
To be baptized into the Triune God is simply to be put into Christ, and to be put into Christ is to be put into His Body
We have been baptized into the Triune God, we have been baptized into Christ, and both Jews and Gentiles have been baptized into one Body
For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ'
To be put into the Triune God simply means to be put into Christ Himself, and to be put into Christ Himself is to be put into the one Body
Whenever the church baptizes new believers, we must have the faith and realization that Jesus is baptizing with us
He is the Baptizer, and as the life-giving Spirit, He embodies the very Triune God, into whom they are baptized
We are happy to hear that we were baptized into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the one Body, but we must realize what baptism means
Many people think that to be put into Christ means to be put into the heavens, but it really means to be put into a tomb
They simply cannot understand that baptism means to be put into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the one Body
All my history, my natural life, my self, my nature, and my whole being is now terminated in Christ and is buried
On the one hand He is the Baptizer and on the other hand He is the available Spirit making it possible for Him to put people into Himself
We see that John fourteen speaks of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-just as Matthew twenty-eight
Both of these books tell us that He was the Triune God, whether He was God in eternity past, or a child born of a virgin
In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink
For this reason 1 Corinthians 12:13 tells us that we have all been baptized in one Spirit, and we have been made to drink of one Spirit
Chapter twelve tells us to drink of one Spirit, and chapter fifteen tells us that the Lord became the life-giving Spirit
They even speak about 1 Corinthians 12:13, but they never mention the last part of the verse concerning drinking
We may believe that He became man to die on the cross as our Redeemer, and yet we may still fight with our wife
He is our God, our Creator, our Redeemer, our Savior, our Father, our Lord, our Master, and eventually our life-giving Spirit
Regardless of whether we are saved or not, God's intention is still the same, that is, to work Himself into us as our life
Some words are right, but they have been spoiled by Christianity, which has entirely missed the proper meaning of the proper words
We are all familiar with Matthew and John, but not many Christians have gotten into the heart of these two books in reality
If we will just exercise our heart and our mouth and say, 'Lord Jesus,' immediately we are in Him and He is in us
To do things for the Lord requires no denial of the self, but to live by the Lord requires putting the self aside
Matthew tells us to baptize into the name of the Triune God, and the Lord Jesus is with us all the days until the completion of the age
Many times a day, hour after hour, we must come back to this one point that we are in Him, and He is living within us
On one hand, we must be in the Triune God, and on the other hand, we need to have the life-giving Spirit living within us
At this time, the Holy Spirit is the full realization of the Triune God, the real embodiment of the Triune God
In other words, the indwelling of Jesus was their daily living; so in such a condition they were full of the Holy Spirit
But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption'
As long as we open ourselves and confess all our sins so that there is no offense in our conscience, we can be full of the Spirit
We only need to open ourselves to Him and make a thorough confession of anything that is sinful or condemned in His eyes
You have some sinful things in your life, yet you would not confess unto Him and apply His precious blood to cleanse you
By reading the book of Acts carefully, we see that the early disciples did not have much knowledge or preaching
In Matthew we are told that the disciples of Jesus are baptized into the Triune God, and John tells us that Jesus will be living within them
When we are reaching others, what we need, strictly speaking, is not power, but the outflowing of the indwelling Christ
But he being full of the Holy Spirit looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God
All the time we must learn to release Him by opening ourselves and making a thorough and absolute confession of all our sins
It was not something done by themselves or according to their understanding, but something done by the indwelling Jesus
They were one with the Triune God, and this Triune God in Acts 16 is called both the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus
If we open our heart and make a thorough confession of all our sins under the cleansing of the blood, we will be full of the Spirit
We must realize that we have been put into the Triune God, and we have the Triune God continually living within us
We see a group of people in whom Christ was living daily and through whom Christ was poured out as the gospel preaching
The Gospels show us how Christ became a man that we could be put into Him, and how He became the Spirit so that He could come into us
It is a record of a corporate people who have been put into the Triune God, and who have the Triune God living within them
The four Gospels and the Acts give us the vision, and the Epistles tell us how to experience the indwelling Christ
The beginning of the book speaks of justification by faith, but at the end, the book reaches the final goal of the Body of Christ
Romans starts with justification by faith and ends with the Body of Christ, but the central section speaks of the indwelling of Christ
The goal is the Body of Christ, and the way from justification by faith to the Body of Christ is the indwelling of Christ
We are daily saved from our bad temper, our shortcomings, our dissatisfactions with our husband or wife, and so many other things
We were first buried into Him and then we were resurrected with Him to walk in newness of life as He lives within us
Rejoicing is a law that belongs to the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of life is nothing less than Christ as the life-giving Spirit
Regardless of how many times the Devil casts us into a defiled situation, the law of holiness spontaneously keeps us from being unholy
There is no condemnation in Christ for the law of the Spirit of life has set us free from the law of sin and death
We are not like-minded according to the objective Christ in the heavens, but according to the subjective Christ who lives in us
With insight and inner vision, we can see that all these books consistently deal with the matter of the indwelling Christ
Of course, Romans does not cover the gifts, marriage, or many of the other things that are covered in 1 Corinthians
We have all been baptized into the Triune God who is realized in the Spirit , and now this Triune God lives in us to be our everything!
Christ is our inheritance and our spiritual portion, and we have been called into the participation in this Person
But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption'
God has put us into Christ and now this Christ has been made our power our wisdom our righteousness our sanctification and our redemption
He can only be everything to us by His indwelling, and we can only realize His indwelling by our drinking of Him
Jesus as the life-giving Spirit indwells our spirit, and we must all learn to drink of Him again, and again, and again
To be baptized into one Spirit is revealed in Matthew, and to drink of one Spirit is basically revealed in John
We all have been put into this wonderful water, and we all have been positioned to daily take this water into us
It is by this daily drinking that He is made everything to us, and we learn to take Him as our person and live by Him
Paul did not write any autobiography, yet 2 Corinthians may be considered as a kind of autobiography written by Paul himself
Then he says that this kind of pressure was given so that he would not live by man's wisdom, but by the grace of God
We should never think that it is because we are so evil that God must give us so many troubles, tribulations and trials
If anyone gets into trouble or loses his health, immediately his friends begin to think that he is sinful in some matter
We could never say that because we learned to breathe well yesterday, that today we have graduated from breathing
God's creation is to create us in such a way, but in His salvation, He Himself comes into us to be our life and our person
Paul said, 'But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead'
He ordered it just to press us that we should not trust in ourselves, but in the living God who raises the dead
If we all have a daily experience of the indwelling Christ, it will enrich the church life and strengthen the church's testimony
In a sense, the Christian life is a life of enjoyment, but in another sense the Christian life is a life of suffering
He did not begin this book by telling us how the Lord was so merciful to him and how everything was smooth and comfortable
While he is testifying of the kind of life he has in Christ, spontaneously he reveals some things about Christ to us
Paul tells us that we do not need anything of the letter, which means the knowledge of the doctrine of the Scriptures
He is liberating us from the letter of the law from the letter of the doctrines teachings and knowledge and from regulations rituals etc
His holy, divine, spiritual, eternal, and heavenly element has not only been added into our being, but it is saturating what we are
His indwelling implies the life giving, the liberating, and the transformation, and it also implies a kind of killing of whatever we are
Regardless of whether we feel we are in the third heavens or in the deep hell, Jesus is still moving within us
Many times Christ has been wrought into our being through the losing of our temper more than through other things
As we are loving the Lord Jesus in our up and down situation, He is working within us as the life-giving Spirit
In Greek, the word for 'face' is the same word used for 'person' in 2 Corinthians 2:10, which means the index around the eyes
It is only when we are living in His presence, looking at the index of His being, that we will sense that He is such a treasure to us
Now thanks be unto God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savor of his knowledge by us in every place
In the ancient times, while such a procession and celebration were going on, certain ones would scatter incense before the procession
We should be the ones attached to the Triune God, within whom Jesus is working all the time, transforming us into His image
We can see that all these items are completely different from the teachings and doctrines which we received in a traditional way
The indwelling Christ will do all these things, making these items so real, so living, and so practical in our daily life
The Lord's recovery today is not just to recover the oneness and the church's testimony, but to recover the real content of the church life
Paul covers all of these precious items in his autobiography because merely in teaching no one can utter such things
Finally he says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
We have seen that in the book of 2 Corinthians, Paul gives us a record of his life, showing us how he experienced the indwelling Christ
After this, in the book of Galatians, he still is speaking about the indwelling Christ, but with a specific aspect
We all must realize that religion is mostly composed of four things: teachings or doctrines, regulations, traditions, and ordinances
There are some similar aspects in the books of Romans and Galatians, but Romans does not mention the law as much as Galatians
Paul shows us in Galatians that if we use the law in a wrong way, it becomes an entanglement to us in enjoying Christ
As such, he opposed Christ and persecuted the church, while at the same time he kept all the traditions of his forefathers
Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of God and our Father'
Paul opens Galatians by saying that Christ gave Himself for our sins in order to deliver us from this present evil age
In a general sense, all Christians usually consider that Christ gave Himself for our sins to deliver us from hell
Many Bible translators translate the Greek word for age into world, because an age is a part or period of the whole world
Most Christians do not know what Paul meant when he said that Christ gave Himself for our sins to deliver us from this present evil age
Also at the time when Paul wrote this letter to the Galatian churches the saints in those churches had become ensnared in a kind of religion
If we would be a person like Paul, living by Christ and taking Him as our person, we must be aware of religion
He was the foremost in such a religion, keeping the law, keeping his forefathers' tradition, and observing all the ordinances
If we would realize the real experience and enjoyment of the indwelling Christ, we must beware of anything religious
Paul was so zealous for his religion, but on the way to Damascus a voice came from the heavens and smote him to the earth
In ancient times among the Jews, the parents sent their children to the teachers with a servant as a conductor
By the time that Paul gets to chapter five, he tells us that if we are still religious, Christ will profit us nothing
Electricity may be installed in a building, but if we don't apply the switch, we are insulated and cut off from the flow of electricity
When we speak of His work on the cross His accomplishment of redemption His resurrection and our being baptized into Him we speak of Christ
That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith'
Our marriage, our family, our degree, our wealth, our fame, our health, and many other things could never be a real blessing to us
We have mentioned before how God had to be processed in order to dispense Himself into us as our enjoyment and experience
Christ is the very God within the process, and the Spirit is the very God who has been processed to become our experience
In eternity past, He was merely God, but when He came into the process, He became flesh who is Christ in the flesh
Today we not only have God and Christ, but also the all-inclusive Spirit, who is the processed God as our experience and realization
Regardless of how much is said in meetings, if nothing of the Spirit is ministered into people, the meetings are altogether vain
When we open ourselves and say 'Amen' to the Word, the Word which is outside of us gets into our spirit and becomes the Spirit
When we begin in the Spirit, it means that we are starting to walk in the spirit, we are beginning to live in the spirit
For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life eternal'
If we are daily sowing the Spirit as the seed, surely some day we will reap something of the Spirit as our harvest
By reading the book of Galatians properly, we see clearly that the proper Christian life is nothing but a daily walk in Christ
Hardly anyone has ever paid any attention to the last verse of Galatians: 'Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit'
We can have all the electrical wires installed into a building, yet if we don't have a switch, we cannot apply the electricity
Christ is the very God in process, and eventually the processed God is Christ as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit
The book of Galatians starts negatively with the evil age of religion, and it closes positively with the human spirit
We have been delivered out of religion, which was mostly in our mind, to the wonderful enjoyment of Christ in our spirit
If we understand this book according to the context, we see that the book itself defines this present evil age as religion
Since the foregoing verses speak about religion, it is clear by the context that the world in verse 14 is religion
Verse 15 continues, 'For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation'
By the context of these verses, it is clear that in the book of Galatians both the present evil age and the world mean religion
God's intention is to work Christ into us, but Satan's subtlety is to use religion to keep us away from Christ
Even the most moral, ethical, and religious things are evil in the eyes of God, because they sever us from the indwelling Christ
But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed'
Paul had nothing to do with this kind of preaching, because now he had Christ revealed in him, living in him, and being formed in him
If we stay in our mind, surely we will be religious, but when we turn to our spirit there is the rich enjoyment of Christ as grace
Have you ever read a book that says the key point in Ephesians is the indwelling Christ making His home in our heart?
Many Christians today talk about the Body of Christ, but we know that any body without the life of a person is a corpse
He must be making His home in our hearts; otherwise, the 'church' which is supposed to be the Body of Christ is only a corpse
It is wonderful that we can say that Christ is in us, but we may only have Christ at the center, in our spirit
Our inner man needs to be strengthened and made strong; then Christ will be able to make His home in our heart
For Christ to make His home in our heart means that He will saturate and permeate every part of our heart with Himself
According to God's economy, the Body of Christ must have a living person who is so real, practical, living, and available
It is not a matter of whether we are right or wrong; it is a matter of having Christ as a living person spreading into our whole being
Ephesians 4:30 says, 'And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption'
If we would prayread the Word in this way we would be so joyous and happy and we would be filled in our spirit with all the fullness of God
We will enjoy all of the unsearchable riches of Christ, which will produce the Body of Christ, the real church life
We must see that to realize the real church life, the real Body-life, we need the experience of Christ as the indwelling One
Ephesians 5 tells us that just as people nourish and cherish their bodies, so Christ nourishes and cherishes His church
If we don't have the experience of Christ nourishing and cherishing the Body, we cannot be built up with others
Sometimes we think that if the Lord would put us together with brother so-and-so, it would be easier to be built up
They know how to talk about the Spirit, but they don't know how to enjoy and partake of all the riches of Christ in their spirit
There has been a shortage of the real experience of the riches of Christ that bring forth the Body of Christ in a practical way
Some people tell me, when they read all the books we have put out in Chinese and in English, that all we talk about is Christ and the church
What the church needs is some leading ones who know how to enjoy Christ themselves and how to minister this Christ to others in a living way
Even if we had 100,000 people coming to our meetings, yet very few of them experienced the real enjoyment of Christ, it would mean nothing
You cannot say that one tree is too high, so you must cut it off; or another tree is too short, so you must pull it up
There is no other way to help the saints to be perfected, but by helping them to get the proper nourishment from the riches of Christ
If we know how to receive the nourishment of Christ, then He will take over our mind, saturate our emotion, and subdue our will
We must learn to enjoy the indwelling Christ by taking Him as our person, that He may grow within us to be our everything
We have seen in the past messages that by the time we come to Ephesians, the church has come into being through the indwelling of Christ
If we look into the content of all the books of the New Testament up to the end of Ephesians we can see that Paul has reached a consummation
We have chosen verses from each of the four chapters of this book, and all of these representative verses speak mostly of practice
Whenever we see how much Christ is to us and what the church life is, we can be assured that things will happen
Many saints, after seeing something of Christ and the church, can take the sufferings, but they cannot stand the good situations
From reading 2 Corinthians we can see that the Corinthians even thought Paul was cheating them in the matter of money
In one sense the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of God, but in another sense there is a great difference
After the incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Jesus Christ
There was also the element of the termination of the crucifixion, the germination of the resurrection, the ascension, and the exaltation
Such a bountiful supply could never be realized, experienced, and enjoyed, without the Spirit of Jesus Christ indwelling us
We must pray, and have others pray for us, that we will realize the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
After this, verse 13 of the same chapter says, 'For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure'
Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God'
If a brother becomes poor, we say that either he does not know how to manage himself, or he must be wrong with the Lord in some area
Whether it is sunny or cloudy whether the circumstances are good or bad we have a wonderful Person living within us bearing all our burdens
Whether we are rich or poor, high or low, we have learned the secret that Christ lives in us to be our person, bearing all of our burdens
Following this section, there is a supplementary group containing 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, and Hebrews
In these epistles we see how Christ must be wrought into us as our life; then we will learn to live by Him, taking Him as our person
And he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence
In Colossians we see One who contains all the fulness of the Godhead, and One who must have the preeminence in everything
He is the mystery of God, He holds all the fulness of God, He has the preeminence in everything, and He is our life
We agree that Christ will be all and in all in the future, but here it does not say that Christ will be all and in all
To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory'
