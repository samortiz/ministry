   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Needing the Supply</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>through the Ministry of the Word</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every believer loves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When his love for the Lord is stirred up, he will look forward to the next bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If he receives a taste and a supply, he will surely want to come again.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If every brother and sister were like the apostle Paul, there would be no need for us to stir up their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But many of the saints are new believers who truly need the help and the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If they come to the meeting time after time, but they do not know how to sing hymns and pray like others, they can only listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If they continually hear the same tunes, they will feel that the meeting is tasteless, long, and tedious.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes an entire meeting is like an elderly person going down the stairs; it causes people to break out in a cold sweat and nobody knows what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such meetings cannot uplift people s spirit or satisfy them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It cannot make them willing to pay the price to come to the meeting again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we cannot complain about any decrease in the attendance in meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who take the lead in the meetings, particularly those who minister the word, bear the main responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to minister the word in all the meetings to supply and give instruction to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, after the new believers in northern China received help in fundamental matters for five years, their prayer and praise in the bread-breaking meeting was able to render much help to other new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They praised the Lord for His sweetness and for the fruit of His labor, declaring that they were satisfied with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These saints prayed, Lord, You are so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From Your head to Your feet You are worthy to be anointed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lord, from Your birth to Your death You are worthy to be anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lord, You are satisfied when You see the fruit of Your labor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today we are sitting in Your presence, and we are satisfied when we look upon You.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many people became open when they heard such prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In some prayers there is a supply through the ministering of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Prayers that are full of light can render a supply to others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If our bread-breaking meeting does not supply people through the ministry of the word, it is very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>New believers will feel that the meeting is meaningless if they do not gain much nor hear any speaking with spiritual content.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not only stand on the proper ground but also be in a normal condition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To Serve in the Ministry of the Word</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Requiring One to Spend Time to Study</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who minister the word should spend time before the Lord daily, studying how to minister the word in the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our speaking in the bread-breaking meeting is not the same as speaking from the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It should not be educational in nature; rather, it should be with feeling, causing people to see the Lord s beauty, to appreciate and worship Him, and to be drawn to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our speaking should not cause them to forget the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the contrary, our speaking should cause them to see the Lord and enter into His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should speak concerning the Lord s work and person, His exaltation, His name, His glory, and His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We might even say something concerning His power, but this depends on how we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should always speak with feeling, touching on the fact that God s love is with power and that His power is manifested in His love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such speaking is very sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we merely say that the Lord s power is great, even greater than atomic energy, the brothers and sisters may forget His loveliness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason, we should consider the way we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may say, The Lord s power is in His love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some mothers love their children but do not have the power to properly care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But our Lord is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is power in His love, and His power is manifested through His love.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we speak in this way, the saints feel that the Lord is both lovely and powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They will be brought to the Lord and into the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moreover, this kind of speaking will not interrupt the spirit of worship in the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we speak, we should pay attention to the atmosphere in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes we should speak at the beginning of the meeting or when the bread and cup are being passed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is extraordinary and full of meaning when our words follow the bread as it is being passed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the brothers and sisters are passing the bread, we speak concerning the bread; after the bread has been passed around, we can speak concerning the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This will give the saints a sweet taste.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They will not feel that we are speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, they will sense an atmosphere that brings them before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They may have the sweet feeling that the Lord is shedding His blood in their presence and that the flow of His blood is for them to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The supply provided by such a speaking is full of taste.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This shows that speaking for the Lord requires a considerable amount of study.</S>
