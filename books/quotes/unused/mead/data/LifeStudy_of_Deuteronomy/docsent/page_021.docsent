   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WANDERING FROM KADESH-BARNEA</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO THE CROSSING OVER OF THE BROOK ZERED A. The Wandering of Thirty-eight Years</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Deuteronomy 2:1-23 speaks of the wandering from Kadesh-barnea to the crossing over of the brook Zered.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 14a says, "The time that we spent in going from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the brook Zered was thirty-eight years."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although Kadesh-barnea was the entry into the good land, God commanded the children of Israel to leave that place and to wander in the wilderness for thirty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. To Consume Man's Flesh and Unbelief</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>and to Manifest God's Mercy and Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The purpose of these years of wandering was to consume man's flesh and unbelief and to manifest God's mercy and blessing v. 7 . In ourselves we are nothing but flesh and unbelief, which causes us to depart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our flesh and unbelief need to be consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is easy to speak about this, but it takes many years to experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For the children of Israel, this took thirty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand, these were wasted years; on the other hand, these years were useful in consuming their flesh and unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In these years God's mercy and blessing were manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During the thirty-eight years of wandering in the wilderness, God was very exercised concerning His people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even though they were unbelieving, He extended His love to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How did God do this?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did it by showing mercy to them and by blessing them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the years of wandering, God had mercy on His people and blessed them, even though they were fleshly and full of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because we are so far away from God and because our situation is so poor, God's grace cannot reach us unless He first has mercy upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's mercy extends farther than His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may say that mercy is God's grace reaching farther than grace itself can reach.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In other words, when God's grace extends so far that it reaches us where we are, it becomes mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since His mercy has reached us and since we are now under His mercy, God can bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we realize how pitiful our situation is and how great is the distance between us and God, we will pray like this: "Lord, we need Your mercy because our situation is far away from Your grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thank You, Lord, that Your mercy can reach us where we are."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As those who are now under God's mercy, we should also pray for God's blessing, saying, "Lord, we do not trust in what we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Neither do we trust in our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our trust, Lord, is in Your blessing."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>C. To Consume All the Unbelieving Ones</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During the thirty-eight years of wandering, all the unbelieving ones were consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Concerning this, God was patient.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead of consuming the unbelieving ones all at once, He took thirty-eight years to consume them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>D. To Produce a New Generation</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>for the Fulfilling of God's Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Finally, these thirty-eight years were used by God to produce a new generation for the fulfilling of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, Moses might have been happy with this new generation; on the other hand, he might have been saddened by the loss of the first generation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God had changed the generation by the way of consuming the old generation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because Moses had witnessed the consuming of the first generation, he might have sighed deeply as he spoke the words recorded in chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With the exception of Caleb and Joshua, all the fathers had died, and only the sons remained.</S>
