   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPIRITUAL THINGS BEING NURTURED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When you receive your basic revelation for the first time, you realize that the Bible is living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, you may see that Christ is your holiness, with emphasis on the word is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is your holiness; it is not a matter of Christ making you holy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not Christ giving you His holiness but Christ becoming your holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Your eyes are opened to see that your holiness is not a work but Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Your holiness is a person, just as your righteousness is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your righteousness is not the sum of fifty or more things that you do.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has made Christ your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Your righteousness is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a basic revelation: Christ is your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is your holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Your righteousness is a person, and your holiness is also a person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a glorious vision.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After two months an occasion may arise for you to take up the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have to tell the brothers and sisters that Christ is your holiness, and you have to show them the difference between holiness as a thing and holiness as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, you must remember that you cannot count on the revelation you received two months ago.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You need to ask the Lord again, Lord, what should I say?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only after the Lord has shown you the need to speak such a word will you have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every time God wants you to speak such a word, He has to shine once again upon the revelation you received.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You have to see the same thing all over again, and you have to see it like you have never seen it before.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It has to become something new in you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You are enlightened within, and you see the meaning of Christ as your holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When this happens, you can go to the brothers and sisters and preach to them about Christ as holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is a revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A revelation is a seeing of what is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible is full of Christ, and revelation enables us to see all the things that are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is our holiness; this is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the first time we see it, it is new to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a man sees something by revelation, it is brand new; nothing in the world seems as new as it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It becomes vibrant with the power of life; it is fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Revelation is always new; it makes old things new.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We wish to point this out: Revelation not only makes the letters living, turning old things into new things and converting what is objective into something subjective; it actually makes the subjective things altogether new once more.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A basic revelation turns all the objective things in Christ into subjective things in man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before a man receives such a basic revelation, everything in Christ is objective to him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once he receives such a revelation, all the objective things become subjective to him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But this does not mean that once this word is opened up, the job is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It does not mean that this one opening will supply a man with what he needs for the rest of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even if we have received a revelation, we need a fresh revelation from God every time we minister the word and serve others with Christ so that the old things can once again be new.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must remember that spiritual things have to be nurtured in the environment of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God intends that all the things of Christ and concerning Christ be living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He intends that all these things be nurtured through revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His revelation can make the old things continually living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the things of Christ have to be kept alive continually by revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once revelation is removed, spiritual things no longer are living.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You may think that you saw something in the past and that this vision qualifies you to say something today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But you will find out that you cannot give anything to others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The same is true with preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is easy to remember that the Lord is the Savior and that your sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes you touch something when you preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At other times, the more you speak, the less boldness you have; you feel like a dried-up bottle of glue.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Clearly one speaking is with revelation, whereas the other is without revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only things that are kept in the realm of revelation are living, fresh, powerful, and full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must bear in mind that all spiritual things become dead the minute they are separated from revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today when we minister the word to men, we should not depend on our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not think that we are free to speak the same things again just because our past experiences and past speakings are still intact in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even though it worked for us the first time, it will not work for us this time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may speak the same thing again, but afterward, we feel that something is wrong, that what we said was not the right thing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We feel that we are, in fact, quite far from the thing that we were speaking about; we do not touch that thing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Revelation is distinctly different from teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Man always has a wrong concept that he wants to be a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must see that doctrine and teaching are useless by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should never think that the ability to speak is all that matters.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We may be able to speak, and others may appreciate our speaking, but we can be our own judge; within we know that something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should bear in mind that many people receive help ignorantly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should not congratulate ourselves just because others say that they have received help from us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some may say that they have received help, but in actuality they have not received anything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We know within whether our speaking was on the mark or off the mark, old or new, dead or living.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As we are speaking, if the Lord s revelation is with us and God s mercy is upon us, we will touch reality; there will not be a feeling of estrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We will be in touch, and the things we say will be living to us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As long as we have the assurance that the things in us are living, we are all right.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must forever remember that we need a fresh revelation from God every time we fulfill the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is what it means to have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>First Corinthians 14 covers the subject of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>All the prophets can prophesy and speak.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But if something is revealed to another sitting by, the first should be silent v. 30 . Suppose there are some prophets, and one of them has a word to say to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>While he is speaking, another also receives a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He may say, Brother, let me speak.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The one who is currently speaking should let him speak, because the one who has received the revelation is the freshest; he has the most life and power.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is why he should be allowed to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Although all are prophets, the one who has received the latest revelation is the living one.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is possible that on this particular day, no one else has that word; only this brother knows this word because he has the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Therefore, the rest should allow the one with revelation to stand up to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Our service in the ministry of the word is based on the revelations we continually receive.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we do not have continual revelations, we cannot serve properly as a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We should never presume that a message that once contained God s speaking will always contain His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We should never presume that a message that once brought about repentance will always bring about repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The same message delivered in the same manner does not guarantee the same result.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Only the same anointing will produce the same result.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Only the same revelation will produce the same light.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The same word may not produce the same light.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>How easy it is for a spiritual thing to become dead in us!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It can easily become as dead as stagnant water in us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The ability to deliver the same message that was delivered three years ago does not mean that we have the same light that we had three years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Today we need to have the same revelation we had three years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Only then can we preach the same message we preached three years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Ministry of the word does not depend on the words we have spoken in the past, but on the new revelation we have acquired in the present.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The biggest problem with the church today is that many people think that they have many messages to give.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>They think that if they repeat the same message again and again, they will have the same result again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>But this is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>It is a fundamental error to pay attention to doctrines rather than revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Even if a person spoke Paul s or John s very own messages, it would not work, to say nothing of repeating his own message.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Only the same revelation will produce the same result; the same words will not produce the same result.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Hence, the ministry of God s word is not a matter of word but of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We do not serve on the basis of word but on the basis of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We must remember that the ministry of God s word is the ministry of God s revealed word.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We must differentiate between doctrine and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>What God said yesterday and the day before is doctrine; what He says today is revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>What we remember is doctrine; what we see is revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We know that the ministry of the prophets involves things for today and the future; it does not involve things of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The ministry of the prophets unveils God s desire today and in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This is why the Bible calls such men seers or prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>A prophet is a seer; he is one who sees.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>In the Old Testament many prophets spoke prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>But some prophets did not really speak prophetically; rather, they proclaimed God s will for men in their times.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>When Nathan went to David, he foretold a little concerning the latter s wife and children.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>But Nathan primarily expressed God s thought; he was expressing God s heart concerning certain things that were happening then cf.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>2 Sam 12:7-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>In the Old Testament the highest expression of the ministry of God s word was the prophesying and preaching of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>If anyone wants to be a minister of God s word, if he wants to have the highest degree of ministry, he has to know what God wants today and what He wants for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>He must have God s present-day revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>He cannot remain in the old words or even words of the recent past.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Many people can only hold on to what they saw in past years or past days.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>They do not have the present-day revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>These ones cannot be ministers of the word.</S>
