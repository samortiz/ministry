Signifying Everything outside of God</h2>
<p>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil refers to everything outside of God. If we say that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is Satan, we are being too rigid. There are only two choices in the universe: God and everything outside of God. Everything outside of God includes many things. It includes not only your wife but also you. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil includes everything outside of God. The guiding principle is knowledge, good, and evil. Everything that is not God, that is outside of God, is indicated by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>Every person, thing, and matter in the universe should be for God. God created man for Himself, not for other things or other matters. Wives are not for their husbands, and husbands are not for their wives; children are not for their parents, and parents are not for their children. Husbands, wives, parents, and children are all for God. All people, things, and matters are for God. However, people can choose God, or they can choose persons, matters, and things that are outside of God. The tree of life signifies God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies everything that is outside of God. God is life; hence, the tree of life signifies God. Everything outside of God is either knowledge, good, or evil and thus is signified by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Everything is included in these two trees.</p>
<p>The Scriptures are God-breathed and are of God, but if they are not used properly with the Spirit of God, they will be dead letter, that is, related to death. Death belongs to Satan. The Bible came out of God, but in this Bible God said, &ldquo;The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:6). If our knowledge of the Bible is not in God, it is the letter, which can kill us. Some may think that going to a movie theater is of death, of Satan, but that going to a meeting in order to hear a message is of God. This is not necessarily the case. It is possible for a brother to touch death, not life, while listening to a message, praying, or even giving a message. Death is Satan. Some believers preach the gospel because of envy (Phil. 1:15), some brothers administrate the church out of themselves, and some believers work for the Lord by their flesh. These are all of death. There is nothing that cannot be used by Satan. Even the people, matters, and things in a small family can be the embodiment of Satan.</p>
<p>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies everything that is outside of God. On the surface it may not seem that people, matters, and things are Satan, but they can all be the embodiment of Satan and be unto Satan. Hence, they issue in death. In contrast, the tree of life signifies God Himself and is unto God. Since God is life, the tree of life issues in life.</p>
<p>We should not think that Satan is only behind the wrong things that we do but not behind the right things that we do. Whether something is right or wrong is not the point; it is whether or not it is in God. Some may say that it is wrong to watch movies but that it is right to preach the gospel and pray. However, just as Satan can hide behind the watching of movies, he can also hide behind the preaching of the gospel and prayer. Therefore, the question is not whether we are doing the right thing but whether what we are doing is in God or outside of God. If our preaching of the gospel and prayer are in God and of God, they will be life. If they are outside of God, they will be death.</p>
<p>We must see that only God is life and that everything outside of God is death, not life. If God&rsquo;s word is not received in God, it is not life. God&rsquo;s word is life and should give man life. But God&rsquo;s word must be received in God or else it will be death. Anything that we do outside of God or apart from God, no matter how good or how great it may be, is death.</p>
<p>In the center of the garden of Eden there were only two trees. The tree of life signifies God. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies everything that is outside of God; it has Satan as its source, and it issues in death. The name of the tree of life, its content, and its nature are simple, because the tree of life signifies God. God&rsquo;s nature is life, and He is life. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, however, is more complicated; it has knowledge, good, and evil, and it issues in death. In other words, Satan is hidden in all matters, things, and persons, that is, in every fallen thing in the universe. Therefore, the end of everything other than God is death. God put these two trees in front of man in order for man to choose whether he wanted God or something outside of God. No matter what man chooses, as long as it is not God Himself, it will eventually issue in death.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
