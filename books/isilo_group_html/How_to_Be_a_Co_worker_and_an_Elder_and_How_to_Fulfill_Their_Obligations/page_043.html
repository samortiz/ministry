Not Letting Christ Make His Home in Our Heart</H2><P>Furthermore, we need to beware of not letting Christ make His home in our heart by our inner man being strengthened by the Father according to His glory with power through His Spirit unto the fullness (expression) of the Triune God (Eph. 3:16-21). This item is very high. God the Father is strengthening our inner man, which is our spirit, according to His glory with power through His Spirit. When we are strengthened in this way, Christ can make His home in our heart, step by step, smoothly and without hindrance. If we want to let Christ make His home in our heart, we must give Him the room so that He may make home in our mind, emotion, and will. Thus, we become His dwelling place. We are fully occupied by and saturated with Him to become the fullness of the Triune God. Not only are we filled with God but also we become the very fullness of God. The fullness of God is the enlargement of God. In Genesis 1 God was merely God Himself without His fullness, but now He has gained many children. When these children are occupied by Him and let Him make home in every part of their being, they become Him to be His fullness. This fullness is the expression of God. When we meet together, we should express God. When people come to our homes, whatever they see should also be an expression of God.</P><P>We have clearly spoken and released many messages on letting Christ make His home in us. But when I observe the condition of the saints in the Lord's recovery, it really makes me sigh. On the one hand, I thank the Lord that He has spread His recovery to many places throughout the world; on the other hand, the true condition of the saints makes me sad because we lack the reality. Today God is confined by us and cannot make His home in us. He is with us in our spirit, but He is frustrated and imprisoned in our spirit, not being allowed to spread out to every part of our heart, including our mind, emotion, and will. We have Him in our spirit but not in our mind, emotion, or will. He is truly frustrated within us.</P><P>After Paul spoke concerning the transcending truths in Ephesians chapters one and two, in chapter three he bowed his knees in prayer to the Father that He would grant the saints in Ephesus to be strengthened that they might let Christ make His home in their hearts unto the fullness of God. Today we are short of this among us; this is what makes me sorrowful. On the one hand, I worship and thank the Lord that we love the Lord and know the Lord's way in His recovery. But we still need the Lord's mercy, because our practical living is far off from the things mentioned here.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>How to Be a Co-worker and an Elder and How to Fulfill Their Obligations &nbsp; pg 43</div><br></body></html>
