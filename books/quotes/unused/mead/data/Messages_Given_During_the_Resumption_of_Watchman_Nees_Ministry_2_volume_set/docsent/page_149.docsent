   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RELATIONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BETWEEN THE BODY AND THE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Tang asked: What is the relationship between the members and the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Where does the individual end and the Body begin?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Starting Point Being the Body</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Nee answered: It is difficult to answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Where does the individual end and the Body begin?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let me change your starting point a little.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to ask the Lord to give us the mercy to have a make-up lesson today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to see that God's children did not receive an individual life, but a corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God sees us as one Body, but we pay our attention to individual members.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose here is a stalk of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You may say that here are just grains of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, there is only one stalk of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Bread is made out of many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have a corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What you should ask is when does the Body end and the individual begin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When does the individual life emerge out of the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You should not ask when does the individual end and the Body begin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One does not put all the members together and form the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, it is in the Body that the many members are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Bible, there is no such thing as individuals receiving life; all the time it talks about the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We pay attention to the members, but God pays attention to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not think that by saying this, I am bringing you back to Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Catholic Church, there is only the catholicity; there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The reason for this is that it does not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Body life that we are speaking of does not start from the Catholic Church, but from the corporateness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since our salvation was not a strong one in that it did not originate in the Body, we have to go back to the starting point to make it up for our lesson today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Corinthians 12:12 says that the Body is one and has many members.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here it speaks of first the Body and then the members.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We proceed from the members to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But here it speaks of the Body first and then the members.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First there is the life of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we go home and live our individual lives.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These two things point out two different stances.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A different stance produces a different result.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I stand here, I can see a few stars.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But when I step to the other side, I cannot see them any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The place one stands is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The stance we need to take today is that of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What we have received is the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is only after I go home that I acquire personal inward knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brother Tang's question points out our problem in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We cannot say when the individual stops and the Body begins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the next generation studies history, they will say that Brother Tang is surely a man of 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today, with the individual there is no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only with the Body is there the way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Having Fellowship in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to know that the life we have is corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today, man thinks that the life he received is individual, the experience he has is individual, and the conscience within him is individual.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But in the future, we will realize what is the conscience of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In twenty years, this matter will be as common as having a haircut.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a person comes up to any major decision, he has to learn to follow the Body and to fellowship with the brothers ahead of him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not think that it is a difficult thing to ask others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have to realize that it is more difficult to be asked of others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No one likes to mind others' business.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No one can have so much interest as to take upon himself everything concerning others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is troublesome, and it is too much responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, if we want to take the way of the Body, we have to fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What you eat and wear by yourself are things in the realm of Adam; they are personal matters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if you go beyond the normal limit, I will say, "This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You have taken all your monthly income to spend on eating.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You have indulged yourself in eating.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For this reason, I have to say something."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I have to deal with the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is a matter of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The way a sister dresses herself may have gone beyond a certain limit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At such times, someone can say, "We are not interfering with the way you dress, but this is something that is damaging the Lord's testimony."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is not being a busybody.</S>
