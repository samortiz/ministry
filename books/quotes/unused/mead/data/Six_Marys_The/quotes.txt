[1]  THE SIX MARYS Scripture Reading: Luke 1:35; Matt 26:6-8; John 19:25; 20:1, 16, 17; Luke 8:1-3; John 11:1, 5; Acts 1:13, 14; 12:12; Rom 16:1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 13; Phil 4:2-3a
[2]  By this we can see that whether or not God can have His way today in His purpose depends very much upon what the sisters will do.
[3]  The New Testament also shows us that among so many Marys, some stood by the cross watching and observing the Lord Jesus when He was being crucified.
[4]  All the sisters have to see such a portrait of the crucified Lord Jesus.
[5]  In the church we do not need the sisters to teach, but we do need the sisters to see the revelation and to discover some of the things related to the Lord's resurrection life.
[6]  By putting all these verses together we can see that there is no hint that a position was assigned to the sisters to take the lead, to do a great work, or to teach.
[7]  There was no such position assigned to the sisters.
[8]  Rather, the sisters should bring the Lord Jesus to people by the principle of incarnation, love Him, follow Him, minister to Him, experience His death, make Him so sweet and lovely to all the people, see His resurrected life, know the ascension, and then in the church always bear the burden of prayer and labor.
