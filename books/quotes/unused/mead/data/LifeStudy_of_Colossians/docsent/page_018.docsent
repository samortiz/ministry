   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT BEING THE GOOD LAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before Paul wrote Colossians, he wrote the Epistle to the Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Galatians 3:14 he says, That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some Christian teachers believe that the blessing of Abraham refers to justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the context, however, this blessing must refer to the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Genesis 12 the blessing God promised to give Abraham was the land.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Galatians 3:14 Paul links the blessing of Abraham to the promise of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that the promise of Abraham, the promise of the good land, is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the Spirit is the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Galatians 3:14 Paul speaks of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This should remind us of John 7:39.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse says, The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit in Galatians 3:14 and John 7:39 is the ultimate expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit is a unique term which denotes the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Father is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Son of God as the course was incarnated, lived on earth, was crucified, and on the third day was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection are all aspects of a process.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In resurrection, Christ, the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to John 1:14, the Word, who was God, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to 1 Corinthians 15:45, the last Adam, who is Christ, became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many Christian teachers argue that the life-giving Spirit in this verse is not the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To believe this is to believe that there are two Spirits who can give life, the Holy Spirit and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The life-giving Spirit is no doubt the very Holy Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This Spirit is nothing less than the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the good land is an all-inclusive type of Christ, and as Christ has become the Spirit, so the Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit as the processed God, is eventually the good land to us, the New Testament believers, as a fulfillment of God s promise to Abraham that all the nations of the earth would be blessed in him Gen 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to Galatians 3:14, the promise is the promise of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But Galatians 3:16 says that the promises were made to Abraham s seed, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is difficult to reconcile these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the one hand, the Spirit is the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the other hand, this promise, this Spirit, was given to Christ as the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although this is difficult to explain doctrinally, it is rather easy to understand according to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received Him as the seed, as life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, this seed is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, the reality of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that the very Christ whom we received as the seed is the Spirit typified by the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ came into us as the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But as we live by Him, He becomes the land which is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>DELIVERED OUT OF</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE AUTHORITY OF DARKNESS AND</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>TRANSFERRED INTO THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Just as the good land was the portion of the children of Israel, so Christ today is the portion of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have pointed out that as Paul was composing 1:12 he had in mind the type of the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1:13 he goes on to say, Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This verse reminds us of the way the children of Israel were delivered out of Egypt and transferred into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, Paul s concept in 1:13 is the same as that revealed in the exodus from Egypt and in the entering into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In ancient times, God delivered His people out of Egypt and brought them into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God the Father has done the same thing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has delivered us out of the authority of darkness, typified by Pharaoh and Egypt, and has transferred us into the all-inclusive Christ, typified by the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Just as the children of Israel were transferred out of Egypt into a land flowing with milk and honey, a land where there was no tyranny, so we have been transferred into a marvelous realm, called the kingdom of the Son of the Father s love.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, to be qualified for a share of the portion of the saints is actually to enter into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul s composition of 1:12 and 13 is thus according to the picture in the Old Testament.</S>
