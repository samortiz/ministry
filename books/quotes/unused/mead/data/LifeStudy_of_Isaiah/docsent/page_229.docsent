   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HIS COMMISSION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the all-inclusive Christ's commission as the Servant of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. To Raise Up the Tribes of Jacob</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ's commission is first to raise up the tribes of Jacob Isa 49:6a .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the time of the prophets, all the tribes were put down.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They were down, but Christ received the commission from God to raise them up.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We were in the same situation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before we were saved, we were put down.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We were very low, but Christ came to raise us up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. To Bring Jacob Back to Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So That Israel Would Be Gathered to Him</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ also was commissioned to bring Jacob back to Jehovah so that Israel would be gathered to Him 49:5b; 6a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jacob is a negative title, and Israel is a positive title referring to the same person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jacob was a supplanter, but Israel is the one who was transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Genesis 32 records that one night Jacob wrestled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jacob would not let Him go until God blessed him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God touched his thigh and changed his name to Israel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>24-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Israel means a prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God was telling Jacob that he was to be a transformed prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, Christ raised up Jacob and brought Jacob back to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way Jacob could become Israel so that Israel could be gathered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In a similar way, God raised us up and brought us to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we have been brought to God, we become believers, saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ raises up sinners, brings them to God, and these sinners brought to God become saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isaiah 49:6 says that these two items Christ raising up the tribes of Jacob and bringing Israel back to God are too small a thing; the greater things are to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What are the greater things?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These greater things are all the things related to Christ becoming a covenant of the people of Israel.</S>
