   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR THE PRODUCING OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: John 4:32, 34; 5:19, 30; 7:18; 15:5; 6:38-57; 14:19-20; 17:21-23</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew and John are different in many aspects, but as we have seen in the last message, they are also very much alike.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One reveals that Jesus is the king, and the other shows us that Jesus is the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both of them, however, tell us that this wonderful person is going to be with us and within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether He is this kind of person or that kind of person, His purpose is the same to be with us and within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this message we need to see another point which is covered by both of these books.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the matter of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are sixty-six books in the Bible, but none are so clear on the Triune God as Matthew and John.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the last chapter of Matthew it is revealed that the Triune God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the Hebrew text, we see that in Genesis 1:1, the word God as the subject of the sentence is in plural number.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the word created as the predicate of the sentence is in the singular.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The subject is plural, but the predicate is singular.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the first verse of the Bible the Triune God is revealed in a secret way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not so clear unless you know the numbers of the Hebrew language.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then in Genesis 1:26, God uses the plural pronouns us and our to denote Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This really causes a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Is God singular or plural?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we say that God is singular, why does He use the plural pronoun for Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And if we say that God is plural, it is the greatest heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We know that we do not have three gods, but only one God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet how can we understand these verses?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is very difficult to understand this matter completely.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In a sense, the Triune God is one of the greatest mysteries in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From Genesis 1, we go on to Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the fall of man, God again uses the plural pronoun for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil Gen 3:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Genesis 11, men had become so rebellious against God that they built the tower of Babel and the city of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then God said: Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another s speech Gen 11:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Again we see that God uses the plural pronoun in referring to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>RELATED TO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When God uses the plural pronoun for Himself, it is always related to man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When God created man, He used the plural pronoun for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When God took care of fallen man, He used the plural pronoun again.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And when God came to deal with rebellious man, He used the plural pronoun.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that the Triune God is for God s dealing with man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Genesis 1, when God was creating all the other things, He never used the plural pronoun for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It seems that to all the other creatures, God was just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But whenever God is related to man, He is Triune.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is another occasion in the Old Testament when God uses the plural pronoun for Himself, and it is also related to man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is found in Isaiah 6:8.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Isaiah saw God on the throne, and then he heard God ask the question, Who will go for us ?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, we see that whether God created man, took care of fallen man, came to deal with rebellious man, or sent someone to proclaim something to man, He was Triune.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God s relationship to man was almost always related to His being Triune.</S>
