   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Anything That Quenches</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our Spiritual Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is difficult for us to point out the world item by item; the list is endless.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But we should grasp one basic principle: everything that quenches one's spiritual life in the Lord is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The world is anything that kills one's zeal for prayer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The world is anything that takes away one's interest in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The world is anything that frustrates one from testifying before men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The world is anything that hinders one from coming to the Lord, anything that results in confession.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The world is an atmosphere that chokes and dries a person up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is anything that discourages a man's heart from loving and yearning for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we see a broad principle anything that quenches our spiritual condition before the Lord is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must reject all of it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some people say, "This thing is not sinful at all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Can you say that it is worldly?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many things appear to be very good to our eyes, but they quench the fire within us after we touch them once or twice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our conscience becomes weak before God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After we become involved with these things, our Bible reading becomes tasteless.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may have the time, but we no longer have the heart for reading.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After we participate in such things, we feel empty inside and have nothing to testify before men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such things may not be a matter of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our question is whether or not these things are quenching our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everything that quenches our spiritual life is the world and must be rejected totally before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>D. Everything That Fails to Give Others</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>the Impression That We Are Christians</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to mention one more thing our relationship with other people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Any kind of social function, communication, or activity that causes us to hide our lamp under the bushel is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many social friendships, functions, and contacts with worldly people force us to put our lamp under the bushel; there is no way under those circumstances for us to stand up to declare that we are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When others engage in such conversation, you have to pretend to be courteous.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have to listen to them and laugh with them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You feel quenched within, but you have to put on a smiling face.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Inwardly you feel that this is the world, yet outwardly you have to go along with it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Inwardly you know this is sin, yet outwardly you cannot say that it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You should not remain in this kind of social environment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many of God's children are gradually sucked into the world through indiscriminate social activities and contacts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All new believers must know where they stand from the very beginning, and they must make a choice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are not trying purposely to be antisocial.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are not John the Baptist who did not eat or drink.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We follow our Lord who ate and drank.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when we contact people, we must maintain our stand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No one should be able to insult our Christian stand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They should respect our stand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I take a stand as a Christian, I must maintain my stand even if others criticize me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we really want to take the way of separation from the world, we must pay attention to our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must also show our Christian stand every time we are in the company of others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we cannot maintain our stand as Christians, it is better to turn away from where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Psalm 1:1 says that we should not "stand on the path of sinners,/Nor sit in the company of mockers."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we stand on the path of sinners, we will end up in their place sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we sit in the company of mockers, we will become mockers sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sin and mocking are contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must learn to flee these things as if we are fleeing from germs.</S>
