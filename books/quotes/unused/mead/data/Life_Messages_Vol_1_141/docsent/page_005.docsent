   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DIFFERENCES ACCORDING TO GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In a family there are the grandparents, the parents, and children of various ages.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to Ephesians 2:19, we are God's family.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In God's family, as in a human family, we are at different stages according to our growth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, there must be differences among us; yet we are all in the same family.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The little ones may cry or fight over their toys.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This fighting, however, is normal and even somewhat necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But as the children grow, they should no longer fight over toys.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the ages are included in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The older ones cannot exclude the young people, and the young people cannot exclude the very little ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we exclude any, we break the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In such a case, the oneness of the family is damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Ephesians 4 we can see this matter of differences.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not be concerned whether these differences are right or wrong; they are normal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although my wife and I are no longer young, we do not exclude any of our naughty grandchildren.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If they never visited our home, we would miss them very much.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the family life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the churches in the Lord's recovery need to be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The problem with today's Christians is that instead of a family, they have a class as in school.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In an elementary school, children are grouped according to age.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nearly every Christian group is a class.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But in the church we are not a class; we are a family.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The genuine oneness, the oneness of the Spirit, must come first.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to keep the oneness of the Spirit, we must have the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we are all in the process of growing in life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we continue in this process, there will be differences among us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not have the growth in life, we cannot keep the proper oneness, for the oneness of the Spirit is maintained by the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>LOWLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is in the growth in life that we have genuine lowliness Eph 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lowliness is not a human virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I was young, the pastor advised us to be lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the more he admonished us to be lowly, the higher we desired to be.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Lowliness comes from the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we would keep the oneness of the Spirit, we must have lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Never think highly of yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first requirement, the first prerequisite, of maintaining the genuine oneness is lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead of considering ourselves so highly, we need to say, "Lord, I would like to be lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I don't want to be high."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>MEEKNESS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The second requirement is meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Meekness means not to resist.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do not resist whatever happens to us, then we have meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>LONG-SUFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Along with lowliness and meekness, we need long-suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No place exhausts our endurance more than the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church exhausts everyone's endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you think that you are able to endure, the Lord will bring to you those who can exhaust you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all need to be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord's intention is to exhaust us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The elders may expect the brothers to be nice and lovable and the sisters to be quiet and agreeable.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the more you expect the brothers and sisters to be like this, the more naughty they will be.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The elders must be prepared to face the difficulties caused by naughty brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They will exhaust you to the uttermost and then, after exhausting you, will complain that you have no patience or sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, we need long-suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In addition to long-suffering, we must bear one another in love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead of vindicating ourselves or justifying ourselves, we need to bear everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not only bear a few according to our preference, but all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to bear them in our spirit to the throne of grace and pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is easy to talk about, but difficult to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For this we need the Lord's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Apart from His mercy, we cannot bear anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who have been elders for five years will agree with this, for they have suffered a great deal in the eldership, having been cut into pieces by the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But this is our destiny, our life, our way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If an elder tries to drop the eldership, he will be through with the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As we go on to the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, there will be differences among us according to the various stages of life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These differences are unavoidable, and we should not try to eliminate or reduce them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Rather, we need to allow the brothers and sisters to be what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the way to keep the oneness through lowliness, meekness, long-suffering, and bearing one another in love.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is no other way.</S>
