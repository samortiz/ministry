The Lord Having Made Man<br>Somewhat Lower Than the Angels</H2><P>The Lord has made man somewhat lower than the angels (Psa. 8:5a; Heb. 2:7a). This refers to Christ's incarnation (John 1:14). In His incarnation Christ was made somewhat lower than angels in the sense of being in the flesh. In the flesh Christ was lower than the angels.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. God Having Crowned Man (Christ)<br>with Glory and Honor</H2><P>God has crowned man (Christ) with glory and honor (Psa. 8:5b; Heb. 2:7b). This refers to Christ's resurrection in His glory. Through resurrection He entered into glory; He was glorified in His resurrection (John 7:39b; Luke 24:26). This also refers to Christ's ascension in His honor (Acts 2:33-36; 5:31a). Christ's resurrection is mainly in His glory, and His ascension is mainly in His honor. Glory refers to the condition. Honor refers to the position. Condition-wise, Christ is in glory. Position-wise, Christ is in honor. He has both glory in condition and honor in position.</P><P>This was through His all-inclusive death (Heb. 2:9). Without death He could have never entered into resurrection, and He could have never reached His ascension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. God Having Caused Man (Christ)<br>to Rule over the Works of God's Hands and Having Put All Things under His Feet</H2><P>God has caused man (Christ) to rule over the works of God's hands and has put all things under His feet: all sheep and oxen, the beasts of the field, the birds of heaven, the fish of the sea, and whatever passes through the paths of the seas (Psa. 8:6-8; Heb. 2:7b-8a). This word was fulfilled first in Adam (Gen. 1:26-28). But this word was broken by man's fall. Today nothing is subject to us. Even the mosquitoes still come to defeat us. Nothing today is under us because the order has been fully destroyed by man's fall. But there will be a time, the time of restoration, when everything will be in a good order. This word will be fulfilled in full in Christ in the millennium, the age of restoration (Rev. 20:4-6; Matt. 19:28). Isaiah 11:6-9 and 65:25 speak of the wonderful divine order in the time of restoration. This is because of Christ's redemption.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 41</div><br></body></html>
