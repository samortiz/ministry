In a sense, it is not very difficult to know the names of God, the titles of God. These titles are not only revealed but also printed in the Bible. But many Christians are ignorant concerning God's person. In the previous message, we pointed out that the entire Scripture is the revelation of God as the unique Deity, mainly in His divine titles and His divine person. By God's titles and His person we know that He is unique.</P><P>The first time the Bible mentions God is in Genesis 1:1, which says, "In the beginning God created...." The word for God here in Hebrew is Elohim. Elohim is a compound word, and it is a uni-plural noun. In Genesis 1:26 God speaks of Himself in the plural by saying, "Let us make man in our image." God said, "Let Us," not "Let Me." Us and our are plural. God is one and also plural.</P><P>The plurality of the word Elohim implies the Divine Trinity. Genesis 1:26a, 3:22a, and 11:7a all mention God, using the plural pronouns us and our. In Isaiah 6:8 God said, "Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?" I is singular, but us is plural, showing that God is uni-plural. In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father, "That they may be one, even as We are one" (vv. 22b, 11b). He also prayed, "That they also may be in Us" (v. 21). God the Father and God the Son are "Us"; They are plural, yet They are one.</P><P>In the past we wrote some helpful small booklets on the Divine Trinity which I would suggest for your reading. These are&#151;The Revelation of the Triune God according to the Pure Word of the Bible; What a Heresy: Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods!; and The Biblical Trinity. The truth in these booklets can be a great help to us in seeing the scriptural revelation of the Triune God. Now we want to see something concerning the person of God.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
