   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Son comes in the name of the Father, who comes?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Isaiah 9:6 says that a Son is given to us whose name is called the eternal Father.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may have been told in the past that when the Son came to be born as a man, He left the Father on the throne in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the Bible tells us that when the Son came, He came with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John 6:46 says, "Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from God, He has seen the Father."</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John 6:46; 7:29; and 16:27 tell us that when the Son came from the Father, He came with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Son came, He did not come alone; He did not leave the Father in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the day that Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper and Mary poured the precious ointment on Him Matt 26:6-7 , He was the Son with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God was embodied in Jesus because Jesus was the Son with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If He were merely the Son and left the Father in the heavens when He came, He would not be the embodiment of God.</S>
