   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>An Outlet for the Authority of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Recently, I saw what happened to a brother who had carried a very heavy object over a long distance several years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His hand felt somewhat sore then, but now it has become so disabled that it can hardly move.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The brother said, "My whole body belongs to me except this hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This member seems to belong to someone else, and it struggles with me."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have never heard anyone say this in such a way before.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am often sick.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through my sickness I found out that whenever the existence of a certain member is felt, that member must certainly have some kind of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the human body is in perfect condition, there is no consciousness that the body exists.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever we feel the lungs breathing, the lungs must be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever we feel the heart beating, the heart must be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From my birth to my teens, I was never conscious of my teeth, but the day I became conscious of my teeth, I was unable to sleep the whole night.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The body is very natural and spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Its harmony does not result in consciousness of any of its parts; rather, because of its harmony, it does not seem to feel its existence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today we may not feel like we have fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We would regard it as strange to be asked, "Do you feel that you have fingers?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if one of our fingers is broken, we will feel uncomfortable the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever we feel something, then something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever the body cannot use one of its members, the body is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order for the Holy Spirit to have complete authority in the church, the whole Body must move freely without any hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As soon as there is hindrance in a certain part, it means the Body is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When everyone is under the authority of the Holy Spirit, He can use everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then there is no hindrance in the Body, and everything moves smoothly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When authority operates smoothly, the Body is healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When everyone can be used by the Holy Spirit, then the Holy Spirit has authority and everything is very natural and spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The complete authority of the Holy Spirit is the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where this authority exists, there is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A group today may have some brothers and sisters who are under the authority of the Holy Spirit and others who are not under the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Immediately, we can see that there is no ground of the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The ground of the church is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever the Holy Spirit is offended, the ground of the church is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The unanimous decision of all the brothers and sisters does not make up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not a matter of sixteen hundred people raising their hands to pass a resolution, and then there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not a matter of these sixteen hundred people, but a matter of whether or not the authority of the Holy Spirit has been executed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the authority of the Holy Spirit is absent, there is no church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only when everyone submits to the authority of the Holy Spirit does the church have its ground.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The body is that which we can freely use and move around in. It has no conflicts or difficulties at all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whatever we want to do, it does.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That which struggles with us is not the body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whether or not a local church can be manifested depends upon whether or not it can submit to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When this kind of submission is manifested, the church is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, if a brother likes to speak and make decisions by himself, the authority of the Holy Spirit is damaged, the Body of Christ is damaged, and the church is damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Consequently, there is no church in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A place with a signboard does not constitute a church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead, it is only as the brothers and sisters lay down their own thoughts and subject themselves to the authority of the Holy Spirit, allowing the authority of the Holy Spirit to flow through them without any hindrance, that there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As those who serve God and bear responsibility in the work, we need to remember this one thing: After twenty, thirty, fifty, or even sixty years, when all our hair has become white, we will still be only a transmitter of authority, a channel or mouthpiece of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We still will not be the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever we become the authority, everything is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The brothers and sisters who are workers must thoroughly know what the authority of the Holy Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not think that today we can give some proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our proposals will not do.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord has never granted us the authority to make our own proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can only be a channel of authority, not authority itself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we live to be a hundred years old and have followed the Lord for those hundred years, we should not think that we can give some proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only as our spirit becomes more trained, as we learn something, as the sense of our spirit becomes keener, as we receive more light, and as we touch God's basic principles, thus becoming more familiar with the Word of God, is it easier for the authority of the Holy Spirit to come out through us.</S>
