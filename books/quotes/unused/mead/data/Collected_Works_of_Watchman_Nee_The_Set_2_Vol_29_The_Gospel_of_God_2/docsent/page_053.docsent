   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE HOW GOD DEALS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE BELIEVERS' SINS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>CLEANSING AND CONFESSION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After a man has believed in the Lord Jesus, all his past sins are forgiven by the redemptive work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But what should he do if he sins again after he has believed and is saved?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not right to sin, but sinning is a fact of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is a shame for a Christian to sin, but it is also an undeniable fact that Christians do sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We know that we should not fail and that we should not make mistakes, but we have to admit that we do have times of failure and we do make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What then will we do with these sins?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To put it more accurately, what will God do with these sins?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Earlier we mentioned temporary chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God warns us that if we become apostate, we will be punished in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if we want to deal with our sins and if we want to be cleansed of our sins, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How can our sins be washed away and forgiven?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although there are only three or four places in the whole Bible that mention this problem, they afford us clear light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to know how to deal with this problem, all we have to do is to read these few passages.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>ONE CLEANSING BY THE BLOOD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Tonight let us start from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We know that when the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He shed His blood to wash away all of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After He washed away our sins, He sat down at the right hand of God Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If, after we are saved and have been cleansed of our sins, we sin again and are defiled again, will the blood of the Lord Jesus wash away our sins again?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Man thinks that if he sins, the blood of the Lord Jesus will have to cleanse away his sins again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But there is no such truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The blood cleanses away our sins only once; it never cleanses twice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no such thing as a re-cleansing of man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The book of Hebrews shows us clearly that there is only one cleansing of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hebrews 10:1-14 says, "For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, not the image itself of the things, can never by the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, perfect those who draw near.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, because those worshipping, having once been purified, would have no longer had the consciousness of sins?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But in those sacrifices there is a bringing to mind of sins year by year.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, coming into the world, He says, Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me. In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You did not delight.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then I said, Behold, I have come in the roll of the book it is written concerning Me to do Your will, O God.'</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Saying above, Sacrifice and offerings and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You did not desire nor delight in' which are offered according to the law , He then has said, Behold, I have come to do Your will.'</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He takes away the first that He may establish the second, by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And every priest stands daily, ministering and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never remove sins; but this One, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down forever on the right hand of God, henceforth waiting until His enemies are made the footstool for His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We see that the Lord Jesus has offered Himself up once as a sin offering for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He has accomplished eternal redemption once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By His one work we are eternally perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 2 implies that those who have been purified no longer have the consciousness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, there is only one offering of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is no second offering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If someone rejects this sin offering, there will be no other sin offering for him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why verse 26 says that if we sin willfully, there is no more sacrifice for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The sins of a sinner are forgiven through the cross of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After a Christian is saved, even if he sins, the Lord Jesus cannot die for his sins again.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His one-time accomplishment has accomplished everything eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Him everything is included.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let us now read a few verses from chapter nine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verses 25, 26, and 28 say, "Nor in order that He might offer Himself often, just as the high priest enters into the Holy of Holies year by year by the blood of other creatures; since then He would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself...So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him, apart from sin, unto salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His coming the second time will have nothing to do with their sins; rather, it will be for their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verses 12 through 14 say, "Not through the blood of goats and calves but through His own blood, entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, obtaining an eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who are defiled sanctifies to the purity of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 9, speaking of the first tabernacle, says that it is "a figure for the present time."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to this tabernacle "both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are unable to perfect, according to conscience, him who worships."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By reading chapters nine and ten we see that those in the Old Testament differ from those in the New.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If I were in the Old Testament and committed a sin, I would have only one way to deal with my sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If I had enough money, I would buy a bull.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If I did not have that much money, I would buy a goat.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If I could not afford either, I would buy a turtledove.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then I would ask a priest to offer up the sacrifice for me to atone my sin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When I saw the bull or goat, I would be happy at heart, for I would know that the offering had served as a substitute for my punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because the blood of the bull or goat would be like my blood, God would forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I could go home happy and joyful at heart.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I would be the happiest person on earth, because my sins would have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I did not have my sins anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The darkness in my conscience would be removed, and I would suffer no more.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But after two days, I would begin to think, What if the sacrifice offered that day did not work?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What if the priest did not do the right thing the other day?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Because of these thoughts, I would begin to worry and suffer again.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Finally, I would decide to buy another bull or goat, take it to the priest, and tell him that the sin offering the other day was not done well, and ask him if he would perform the offering once more.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The priest then would slaughter the bull or goat and offer it once more to God, and assure me that the bull or goat had been offered up for my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When the conscience was troubled in the Old Testament, one could always bring another bull or goat to offer a sin offering through the priest.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is what Hebrews 9 shows us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It tells us that the blood of bulls and goats did not do a complete job.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Chapter ten says that if a complete job had been done, there would have no longer been consciousness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God reckoned that the work of bulls and goats was incomplete according to the conscience, because every time a person's conscience lost its peace, he felt that his sins had not yet been fully taken care of, and there was the need for further offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, the apostle shows us that a Christian does not have to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The propitiatory sacrifice that God has set up in the New Testament is not a bull or goat but His very own Son.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When His Son came to the earth, He said plainly that God did not desire nor delight in bulls and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Instead, God prepared a body for Him that He might die to accomplish the work of eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord has accomplished on the cross the sacrifice for eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Now we are able to obtain this eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He has offered up a sacrifice of eternal redemption, thus accomplishing an eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Because of this eternal redemption, we are eternally perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Because His eternal work has been accomplished once, we do not need to offer up sin offerings anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We cannot offer up a sin offering for the same sin any longer, for the Lord Jesus has accomplished all the work.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Son of God cannot be crucified for our sins again.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>One cannot trample underfoot the blood of God's Son and make it something common.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If something is one of a kind, it is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But if there are two of a kind, they are common.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>To treat the blood of the Son as common means to consider it the same as the blood of bulls and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But if you honor His blood and consider it as something unique, it will be precious to you.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Here is the sin offering which He has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>After the Lord has accomplished this work, God said that there cannot be any other work.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Son of God cannot die again.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>His work is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If you want it, you have to trust Him for it.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>You cannot add anything to it.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Either you depend on Him or you have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>After a man has been enlightened by the truth, there is no more sacrifice for sins for him.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>There is only one sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This is what we preach to others.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Those who come to worship through this one sacrifice will have their consciences cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>They will no longer have the consciousness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>All their sins are washed away, and there is no more consciousness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Furthermore, there is no need for another cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The Bible never teaches the doctrine of a second cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The blood of the Lord Jesus cannot cleanse us again.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Once we have been cleansed, we are cleansed forever.</S>
