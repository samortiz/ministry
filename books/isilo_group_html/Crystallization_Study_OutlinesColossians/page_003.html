<h1 class="title">The Kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s Love</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:13; Acts 26:18;<br />
John 3:3, 5; Luke 17:20-21; Mark 9:1-2</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The kingdom of God is the ruling, the reigning, of God with all its blessing and enjoyment&mdash;Mark 1:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The kingdom of God is God&rsquo;s reign in a general way from eternity past to eternity future and also God&rsquo;s reign in a particular way in the sense of life&mdash;Heb. 1:8; Psa. 145:13; Dan. 4:3; John 3:3, 5, 15.</li>
	<li>The kingdom of God is God Himself, and God Himself is life and everything as the content of the kingdom of God&mdash;Mark 1:15; cf. Eph. 4:18.</li>
	<li>The kingdom of God is the Savior, the Lord Jesus, as the seed of life sown into His believers and developing into a realm over which God can rule as His kingdom in His divine life&mdash;Luke 17:20-21; Mark 4:3, 26:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The entrance into the kingdom is regeneration, and the development of the kingdom is the believers&rsquo; growth in the divine life&mdash;John 3:5; 2 Pet. 1:3-11.</li>
		<li>The kingdom is the church life today, in which the faithful believers live&mdash;Rom. 14:17.</li>
		<li>The kingdom of God will develop into the coming kingdom as a reward to be inherited by the overcoming saints in the millennium&mdash;Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5; Rev. 20:4, 6.</li>
		<li>The kingdom will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God&rsquo;s eternal life, which His redeemed will enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity&mdash;21:1-4; 22:1-5, 14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The kingdom is the shining of the reality of the Lord Jesus; to be under His shining is to be in the kingdom&mdash;Mark 9:1-2.</li>
	<li>The kingdom of God as the reign of God is a realm not only of the divine dominion but also of the divine species, in which are all the divine things&mdash;John 3:3, 5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In John 3 the kingdom of God refers more to the species of God than to the reign of God.</li>
		<li>God became man to enter into the human species, and man becomes God in life and nature but not in the Godhead to enter into the divine species&mdash;1:12-14; Rom. 8:3; 1:3-4.</li>
		<li>To enter into the divine realm, the realm of the divine species, we need to be born of God to have the divine life and nature&mdash;John 1:12-13:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We were regenerated of God to be the species of God and enter into the kingdom of God&mdash;3:3, 5.</li>
			<li>Our second birth caused us to enter into the kingdom of God to become the species of God; now we are God-men in the divine species, that is, in the kingdom of God.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Father delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love&mdash;Col. 1:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The authority of darkness denotes the authority of Satan&mdash;Acts 26:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Darkness is Satan as death; thus, to be delivered out of the authority of darkness is to be delivered from the devil, who has the might of death&mdash;Heb. 2:14; John 17:15.</li>
		<li>We have been delivered from the devil, Satan, by the death of Christ and by the life of Christ in resurrection&mdash;Col. 1:13; 2:14-15; John 5:24.</li>
		<li>In Colossians the authority of darkness refers to the good aspects of culture and of our character, disposition, and natural being.</li>
		<li>Whenever we are in the natural man or live in the self, we are under the control of the authority of darkness; the only thing we can do is go to the cross and allow the cross to deal with every aspect of the satanic authority of darkness&mdash;Matt. 16:24; Col. 3:5-9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The kingdom of the Son is the authority of Christ&mdash;Rev. 11:15; 12:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Son of God is the embodiment and expression of the divine life; hence, the kingdom of the Son is a realm of life&mdash;1 John 5:11-12; John 1:4.</li>
		<li>The kingdom into which we have been transferred is the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love; this realm of life is in love, not in fear&mdash;Col. 1:13.</li>
		<li>The kingdom in which we find ourselves today is a realm full of life, light, and love&mdash;1 Pet. 2:9.</li>
		<li>The Son of the Father is the expression of the Father as the source of life&mdash;John 1:18, 4; 1 John 1:2:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Son of the Father&rsquo;s love is the object of the Father&rsquo;s love to be the embodiment of life to us in the divine love with the authority in resurrection&mdash;Matt. 3:17.</li>
			<li>The Son, as the embodiment of the divine life, is the object of the Father&rsquo;s love&mdash;17:5:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) The divine life embodied in the Son is given to us in the divine love.</li>
				<li>2) The object of the divine love becomes to us the embodiment of life in the divine love with the authority in resurrection; this is the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>To be transferred into the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love is to be transferred into the Son, who is life to us&mdash;1 John 5:12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Son in resurrection is now the life-giving Spirit, and He rules us in His resurrection life with love&mdash;1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 6:4-5; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
			<li>When we live by the Son as our life in resurrection, we are living in His kingdom, enjoying Him in the Father&rsquo;s love; here we have the church life&mdash;Col. 3:4; John 6:57.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Although the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love comprises the present age, the coming age, and the eternal age, the emphasis in Colossians 1:13 is on the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love in this age, the age of the church:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Because the Father delights in His Son, the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love is a pleasant thing, a matter of delight&mdash;Matt. 3:17; 17:5.</li>
			<li>The church life today is the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love, which is as delightful to God the Father as the Son of God is.</li>
			<li>God the Father loves the delightful part of the kingdom just as much as He loves His delightful Son.</li>
			</ol></li>
