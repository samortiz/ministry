   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God is light, and when we are in Him, we are in light.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As those in the light we become children of light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 15 tells us to walk not as unwise but as wise.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Foolishness is a kind of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we walk foolishly, we are walking in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we walk wisely, we are walking in light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The children of light should walk, not as unwise but as wise, redeeming the time because the days are evil v. 16 . To redeem the time is to live in the church by Christ, to live Christ in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not live the church life, we will waste our time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before we came to the church life, we wasted many years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To live outside the church life is to waste our time by living in vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may consider that you do not have the time to pray for half an hour, but if a telephone call comes, you may talk for forty minutes in the vanity of your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why would you not spend this time to pray for a certain brother who has been backsliding for years and never comes to the meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To pray for such a brother is to redeem your time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To talk on the telephone in the vanity of the mind is to waste your time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Time flies; it never waits for you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have to redeem it by behaving wisely.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To avoid unnecessary talk on the telephone is to redeem the time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Shopping may also be a waste of time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To live Christ for the church life is the unique way to redeem the time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 17 says, "Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reason we might be foolish to waste our time by unnecessary shopping is that we do not know the will of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The will of the Lord is that we should visit the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why would we not use Saturday morning, afternoon, or evening to go to visit sinners?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One brother among us told us about the practice of his grandfather, who was a baker in Germany working twelve hours a day starting from four in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At four in the afternoon his grandfather would return home, wash and dress up, and go to visit people concerning Christ nearly every day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Wasn't that wise?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Wasn't that the will of God?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we separated half of every Saturday to the Lord, forgetting about shopping, and went out to visit sinners, we could bring at least two or three to the Lord each year.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before going out, we should pray desperately, "Lord, I believe that in this city there are some dear ones chosen by You before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet they still have not been called by You because there has been no one to sound Your call to them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lord, send me to speak the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Lord, be with me."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If some of the saints did this, there would be an increase in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the past years, the poverty in fruitbearing has been among us in many places.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After studying this matter for more than three years, I discovered that the best way to gain people is to go to them, to visit them by knocking on their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This practice has stirred up opposition in some places.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This must be the attack of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do you not believe that the Lord's will is for us to go out?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus charged us to go preach the gospel Matt 10:6-7; 28:19; Mark 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He set up the pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He did not stay in the heavens, calling people to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He came down to man and even became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He lowered Himself in position and status to go to Samaria to meet a sinful woman John 4:1-42 and to go to Jericho to meet the sinner Zaccheus Luke 19:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was always visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Peter, Andrew, James, and John were also caught by the Lord's coming to visit them.</S>
