<h2 class=head1>VI. THE BLOOD OF THE SIN OFFERING</h2><p>The blood of the sin offering has four different kinds of effects.<h2 class=head2>A. Some of the Blood Brought into the Tent of Meeting and Sprinkled Seven Times toward the Veil of the Holy of Holies</h2><p>Some of the blood of the sin offering was brought into the tent of meeting and sprinkled seven times toward the veil of the Holy of Holies (Lev. 4:5-6, 16-17). This signifies that the blood of Christ has been brought into the Holy of Holies in the heavens for our redemption (Heb. 9:12). Christ’s blood covers our situation with God in the Holy of Holies.<h2 class=head2>B. Some of the Blood Put upon the Horns of the Incense Altar</h2><p>Some of the blood was put upon the horns of the incense altar (Lev. 4:7a, 18a). This signifies that the redemption of Christ’s blood is effective for us to contact God in prayer (Heb. 10:19). This is why we need to pray through the blood, contacting God in our prayer through the blood.<h2 class=head2>C. Some of the Blood Put upon the Horns of the Altar of Burnt Offering</h2><p>Some of the blood was put upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering (Lev. 4:25a, 30, 34a). This signifies that the blood of Christ is effective for our redemption. The blood of Christ as the sin offering brings us into the presence of God, that is, into the Holy of Holies; it gives us the position and right to contact God in prayer; and it is effective for our redemption.<h2 class=head2>D. All the Rest of the Blood Poured Out at the Base of the Altar of Burnt Offering</h2><p>All the rest of the blood was poured out at the base of the altar of burnt offering (4:7b, 18b, 25b, 30b, 34b). This signifies the blood of Christ at the standing of the cross for the peace in our conscience that we are redeemed and accepted by God.
