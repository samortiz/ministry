        <h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE IN SONG OF SONGS<br />
PROGRESSING FROM FEELING TO REVELATION</h2>
<p>We need to consider the vision in Song of Songs. The experience in Song of Songs is progressive. The experiences of the maiden, who represents the Lord&rsquo;s seeker, go higher and deeper step by step. Not only so, she grows step by step. In the beginning her beloved praises her as a mare among Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariots (1:9). This means that even though she was swift to pursue her beloved, she used her natural strength. This strength must be dealt with. For this reason, her beloved says, &ldquo;We will make you plaits of gold / With studs of silver&rdquo; (v. 11). Studs of silver signify the killing work of the cross, and plaits of gold signify the constituting work of the Holy Spirit. The killing work of the cross and the constituting work of the Holy Spirit gradually transform us from being natural to being spiritual.</p>
<p>In verse 15 the maiden is praised: &ldquo;Your eyes are like doves.&rdquo; This signifies being single in her desire for her beloved. In chapter 2 she is like a lily (v. 2), and in chapter 3 she is like pillars of smoke (v. 6). These indicate that she is gradually ascending. She is also praised as a palanquin for Solomon (v. 9). In chapter 6 she is &ldquo;as terrible as an army with banners,&rdquo; which means that she is strong and victorious (v. 4). She is also &ldquo;as beautiful as the moon&rdquo; and &ldquo;as clear as the sun,&rdquo; which means that she is bright, solid, and transcendent, living in a heavenly realm (v. 10). The maiden has risen to this heavenly realm from Egypt (1:9). Not only so, she is also as beautiful as Tirzah and as lovely as Jerusalem, which indicates that she has grown into a built-up city (3:4). This is the process of her growth.</p>
<p>Her experience and knowledge of her beloved are also progressive. Chapter 1 begins with her saying that his love is better than wine (v. 2). In verse 12 she is at the table with her beloved. Because she has his presence and enjoys his abundance, she says, &ldquo;My beloved is to me a bundle of myrrh,&rdquo; indicating that he is fragrant within her (v. 13). She also says, &ldquo;My beloved is to me a cluster of henna flowers,&rdquo; indicating that he is her beauty (v. 14). In chapter 2 she enters deeper into her beloved&rsquo;s presence and enjoys him in his banqueting house (v. 4). She compares him to an apple tree: &ldquo;In his shade I delighted and sat down, / And his fruit was sweet to my taste&rdquo; (v. 3). Here she fully enjoys his sweetness. In the beginning her feeling of love toward her beloved is not solid or concrete. When she compares him to myrrh and henna flowers, her feeling is a little more solid and a little more concrete. Later, when she says that he is like an apple tree under which she can sit down and enjoy the sweetness of its fruit, she has been perfected by her beloved.</p>
<p>In the beginning of her seeking, the maiden asks, &ldquo;Tell me... Where do you pasture your flock? / Where do you make it lie down at noon?&rdquo; (1:7). In chapter 2 she not only finds her beloved; she is under his shade, his covering, and enjoys his presence (vv. 3-6). How satisfied and restful she is! Up until this point, her words issue from the experience of her enjoyment, and her knowledge is mainly based on what she has enjoyed.</p>
<p>In the second stage of her experience, her knowledge of her beloved changes. In verses 8 and 9 the maiden says, &ldquo;Now he comes, / Leaping upon the mountains, / Skipping upon the hills. / My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart.&rdquo; This is a special vision. Formerly, she said that her beloved was like myrrh, henna flowers, and an apple tree. These are an expression of her feelings in her enjoyment; they are not a revelation or a vision. Now her beloved comes to give her a vision. Hence, it is no longer a matter of enjoyment but of power and vitality. We need to see that the Lord is full of resurrection power and that He comes leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills like a young hart full of vigor and vitality. No mountain or hill can hold Him back. At this stage a seeker&rsquo;s knowledge of the Lord has progressed from enjoyment to seeing and from feeling to revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FURTHER REVELATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Lord&rsquo;s Resurrection</h2>
<p>The saints in the church life do not have sufficient light and revelation concerning the Lord. They know the Lord mainly according to the feelings realized in their experiences. Such knowledge reaches its fullness in experiencing the Lord as an apple tree. Many saints say, &ldquo;O Lord, Your love is better than wine. Draw me, and I will run after You. I want to be satisfied and have Your presence.&rdquo; They have indeed enjoyed the Lord&rsquo;s presence and tasted His sweetness. They can also say from their experience that the Lord is like myrrh within and henna flowers without. Some can also testify that they have enjoyed the Lord&rsquo;s sweetness, received His protection, and tasted the rich fruit in His shade. Many saints can give such a testimony. However, very few have received a revelation, a vision, of the Lord coming like a young hart full of vigor, leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills.</p>
<p>The Lord wants to give us a new vision. He wants us not only to experience His sweetness and enjoy His riches; He wants us to see His resurrection, to see that He is the hind of the dawn. He bore our sins on the cross, was forsaken by God, and entered into resurrection to be the hind of the dawn (Psa. 22 title). The Lord is calling us to see that He, as the hind of the dawn, is full of vigor and vitality and is coming to us. He is leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills. In Song of Songs the beloved says to the maiden, &ldquo;Rise up...and come away; / For now the winter is past; / The rain is over and gone. / Flowers appear on the earth; / The time of singing has come, / And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land&rdquo; (2:10-12). This indicates that the Lord is leading us to see the vision of resurrection and is bringing us out of our personal spiritual experience and enjoyment so that we may go forward with Him in resurrection. This is the Lord&rsquo;s call to us today.</p>

	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
