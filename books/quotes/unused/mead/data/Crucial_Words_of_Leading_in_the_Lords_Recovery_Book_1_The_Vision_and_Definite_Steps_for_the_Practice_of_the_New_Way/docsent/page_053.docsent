   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LABORING FAITHFULLY AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DISPENSING FOOD AT THE PROPER TIME</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning the home meetings, we must pay attention to three things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, all the elders, co-workers, and full-timers should learn to minister God s word to the home meetings at every opportune time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, do not try to preach; that will only lead to failure.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not try to be big.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If there are only three people in a home meeting, do not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even if there are only two people or even one person we should still not be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Always minister a little of God s word and render others some timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is what the Lord meant when He spoke of dispensing food at the proper time Matt 24:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, we need to prepare ourselves ahead of time for the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not prepare a long message.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, look to the Lord and seek Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should be prepared to speak only the few words that we have enjoyed that day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some people will not be saved even if we deliver two or three long messages to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Other people are saved when we speak to them only for five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not go into a long discourse in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather speak with wisdom by addressing the peoples need.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can cover some of the New Believers Lessons if we have a newly saved person, but with the unbelievers we should speak something about the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Third, even after we have prepared something, we should not take up all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, allow the brothers and sisters to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should supplement their speaking only when they run out of things to say.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will give them the opportunity to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BELIEVING IN THE LORD S TIMING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must believe that every home meeting will survive.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order for that to happen, we must endeavor with our all, but for what should we endeavor?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should endeavor to give injections, to fight the adverse environment, and to supply nutrition, which is the Lord s word, in order for the saints to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must believe that not only every word in the Bible is God s word but that all the truths we have released according to the Bible are also the Lord s present speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as it is the Lord s word, His Spirit will bear witness to it with His work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord s Spirit delights in working upon and strengthening His own word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The minute we speak the Lord s word, His Spirit will follow such a word with His work, and there will surely be the result.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe the words that I have spoken are from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I believe the Spirit will also follow such words and work within us in a silent way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This work is of life, and this life is something that human language cannot describe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is something that human feeling cannot fathom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When a seed falls into the ground, after a period of time it brings forth flowers, yet we cannot explain how the seed has grown and blossomed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The same can be said about our home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should speak something in every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even if there is only one person, we should still speak something.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may think that we are speaking in vain, but we do not realize that we are actually sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have not spoken in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the long run we will see the result, and the result will be rewarding.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we speak to one person, we may not realize that in five years our word will produce results in that person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He may perfect another one, who may turn out to be a great vessel of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can never anticipate such things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet such things do happen all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>LEARNING TO SPEAK BY SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this reason, we cannot look merely at the present condition.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to believe that our work is a work of life; it has eternal value.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What we speak is the truth of the Bible, and life will follow this truth and work on man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must learn to speak in an organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not preach in a dead way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose we need to visit a sick and elderly sister or a busy and heavy-laden brother.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we ramble on mechanically about the organic functioning of the believers the minute we meet him, we may not be able to impart anything to him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Such speaking is neither organic nor effective.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if we take care of people s situation by seizing the opportunity, we will meet the needs of all kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For example, we can say to a sister who is lying on a sick bed, Sister, 1 Peter 2:24 says that the Lord Jesus bore up our sins in His body on the tree, and by His bruise we are healed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Simply call on His name and He will deliver you from your sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We may not have the absolute assurance that she will be healed, but we should believe that she will be comforted by the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After this we can lead her to pray, Lord, I commit my sickness to You.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You know my pains.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we seize the opportunity in this way, there will be a perfecting work in her.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We can then turn around and speak a little to her family.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not give a message on the organic functioning of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Instead, seize the opportunity to say a suitable word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We all must learn this.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Concerning the truth, we must be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We cannot discount anything with regard to God s truth, and we cannot discredit God s word, but in our practice we need to be flexible and skillful.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Take baptism as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Strictly speaking, as soon as a man is saved, he should be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, we cannot say under what condition a man is qualified to be baptized, nor can we say with surety what way we should baptize people.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To do this will not help a person to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When John the Baptist baptized men, he did not baptize in a certain prescribed way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He lived in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When men went to him to be baptized, they did not need to change their clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They did not need to be in a prearranged place.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As long as there was water, he baptized them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Regarding the truth we must be absolute, but in practice, we must learn to work as the opportunity arises.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>A PRACTICE FOR THE INCREASE AND SPREAD</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Once the small groups are divided into the homes, the opportunity for everyone to speak greatly increases.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>No longer is it like the big meetings, where one s mouth is sealed the minute he walks into the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Such big meetings are actually mouth-sealing meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Once the saints arrive at the big meeting, their mouths are sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The elders in particular have taken the lead to shut up their mouths and have allowed the co-workers to set up their little platforms and erect their stages to deliver their wonderful, savory, and well-rehearsed messages.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In the long run, however, such meetings deprive the saints of their organic ability to function.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is a great loss to the Lord s recovery!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Let me say a frank word: We have been doing this in Taiwan for more than twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Every meeting was impressive, but what is the result?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Where is the increase today?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>How many saints are functioning?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We are not here to do the work of gardening; we are here to raise orchards.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We are not for appearance; we are for fruit, for the increase, and for the spread.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In order to achieve this goal, we need to do the following two things: First, we should not lose heart, not be discouraged, and not give up.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Rather, we should be strong, be persistent, and have a will that does not settle for anything less than the determined goal.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Second, we should learn to dispense food at the proper time, apply the Lord s word suitably at the right time, and make the home meeting a meeting where everyone speaks.</S>
