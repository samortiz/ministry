   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. God Having Spoken to Us in the Son</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament Christ as the Word of God was incarnated to be a man John 1:14 to express God, that is, to speak God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hence, Hebrews 1:2 says that at the last of these days God has spoken to us in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God speaks in both the prophethood and the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The sonship in God's New Testament economy is not only individual but also corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God does not have only one son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did have one Son, the Only Begotten, before the incarnation, but after resurrection, God has many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Only Begotten became the firstborn Son of God, and in the same delivery in resurrection, we all were born, regenerated, to be sons of God Rom 8:29; 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our big Brother is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are His followers, His members, His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's having many sons means that there should be "many speakings."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A son of God should speak for God everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When there are no people around, we can speak to the creation see Mark 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can say, even to the animals, "My God is my Father, and my big Brother is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He speaks for God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am His brother, and I do the same thing."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John 15 reveals that Christ is the vine tree and that we are His branches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The branches of the vine tree bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today our gospel preaching should be our fruit bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not try to gain a big crowd in our labor in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That is the way of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A big gospel campaign may attract many people, but eventually most of these people are not cared for and become lost.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That kind of preaching is like bringing the water out of the well and pouring it on the earth in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, we need to be a fruit bearing branch in the way of bearing fruit one by one through the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God created only one man, but today on the whole earth there are billions of men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This happened by the way of human birth, in a one-by-one way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the way to preach the gospel according to the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christianity dropped God's way and took the way of a big speaker attracting large crowds.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The issue of such work is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As the sons of God, we all need to be those who speak forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to speak to people in a new way with a new language.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may say, "Good morning, sir.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am a son of God, and I would like to speak to you about my God, who is my Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John 1:12 says that as many as receive Christ, God will give them the authority to become the children of God."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the right way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although the one to whom you are speaking may be too busy to talk at that time, you can make an appointment with him for a later time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the sons in the divine sonship should speak Christ, and Christ speaks for God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the New Testament God speaks in Christ as His firstborn Son Rom 8:29 , indicating that all the brothers of His firstborn Son as His many sons have to be the word of God speaking for God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are not only the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, etc. Eph 4:11 , but, even more, they are the sons of God, who are the members of His firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are much higher than the Old Testament prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today we New Testament believers are God's sons and His prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First Corinthians 14:1 says, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 31 says, "For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As long as you are a son of God, you are also a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a son you should speak, and as a prophet you should prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You can all prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to be prophets to our relatives, colleagues, and classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should prophesy every day and be bubbling over with Christ all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead of talking to people about the political situation, we should speak something mystical to them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we speak to someone, perhaps he will say that we are a mental case.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But we can tell him, "I'm not a mental case; I'm a case of the son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must learn to be "crazy" to speak for the Lord in this way.</S>
