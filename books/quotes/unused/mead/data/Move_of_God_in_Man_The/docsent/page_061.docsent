   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's move in man is to make man God in His life and nature but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is the unique God for people to worship in His Godhead, but we are made God only in life and in nature, not in the Godhead.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even though Peter was only a fisherman without any kind of scholastic attainment, he was able to write such a marvelous word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, however, the very God who was moving in Peter was the One who wrote this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, through God's move in us, we will participate in His eternal glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The eternal glory will not come to us by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The coming glory is being built up today by God's move in us.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The place where we should be is the divine glory, which is now being built up by God's perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Ephesians 4:6 shows us that even the Father is triune because He is in three directions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Over all refers to the Father, through all to the Son, and in all to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is for the constituting and building up of the Body of Christ with the Spirit as the essence of the Body, with the Son as the element of the Body, and with the Father as the source of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is all God's move in us.</S>
