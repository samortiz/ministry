   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Fellowship in the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Fellowship is not a communication of the mind with the mind or an exchange of opinions; it is the contact of spirit with spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When our spirit touches another brother's spirit, that contact of the spirit is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is only as we receive mercy from the Lord to break the outer shell and to tear down the outer man that our spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only then will we touch the spirits of the brothers and sisters, and only then will we understand the meaning of fellowship with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From that point forward we will understand what the Bible means when it speaks of the fellowship of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We will realize that fellowship is a matter conducted in the spirit; it is not a fellowship of opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When there is fellowship in the spirit, there is prayer in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many people pray with their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is hard for them to find like-minded companions, because they cannot find another mind to match their own even if they searched the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, fellowship is carried on in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everyone who is regenerated and who has the Holy Spirit within him can fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If God removes our barriers and our outer man is dismantled, our spirit will be open to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our spirit will be open to receive the spirits of all the brothers; it will touch and be touched by the spirits of all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will touch the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will be the Body of Christ; our spirits will be the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Psalm 42:7 says, "Deep calls unto deep."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The "deep" is indeed calling the "deep."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The "deep" within us is calling and yearning to touch the "deep" within others, and our "deep" is calling and yearning to touch the whole church's "deep."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the fellowship of deep with deep.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is the calling and responding between deep and deep.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If our outer man is broken and our inner man released, we will touch the spirit of the church, and we will be more useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>NO IMITATION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The breaking of the outer man that we refer to can only be done by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man cannot imitate this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No imitation will work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we say that a man must be meek, we are not telling everyone to try to be meek the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a person tries to do this, he eventually will find that even his manmade meekness needs to be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Manmade meekness is worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The only meekness that will work comes from the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our experience tells us that no achievement comes through us but through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only the Holy Spirit knows our need.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He orders experiences for us in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He does the breaking work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our responsibility is to ask for a little light from God so that we will know and acknowledge His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We want to be humbled under the mighty hand of God to confess that whatever He does is right.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not be a senseless mule.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, we should commit ourselves to His breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should accept His work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we hand ourselves over to His mighty hand, we will see that this work should have started five or ten years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But nothing has been accomplished during the past five or ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today we should commit ourselves into His hand and say, "Lord, I have been a blind man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I did not know where You were leading me from and where You were leading me to.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But now I know that You want to break me, and I offer myself to You."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Perhaps the fruitlessness of the past five or ten years will end today, and we can become fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord will demolish many things in us which we previously were not aware of.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once these things are demolished, we will no longer be proud, self-loving, or self-exalting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This demolition will free and liberate our spirit and make it useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we will be able to use our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here we have to raise two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First, we must know that the breaking of the outer man is a work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is no need for imitation by the self.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But if we know that an activity is of the flesh, should we try to stop it ourselves, or should we wait for the Holy Spirit to break it?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Should we wait for a great light to come and not try to put any restraint on it at all?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our answer to the above question is: We should cease all activities of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is different from pretension.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If I have the tendency to become proud, I should deny my pride.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, I should not pretend to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If I am about to lose my temper at someone, I should deny my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But I should not pretend to be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Ceasing doing something is a negative prevention, while pretending to act a certain way is a positive move.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Pride is something negative, and we should deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Humility is something positive, and we cannot imitate it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Suppose we are very stubborn with a harsh voice and an unbending attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to deny this harshness, but we should not pretend to be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to stop all activities and works of the flesh that we are aware of.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But we should not imitate any of the positive virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should offer ourselves to the Lord and say, "Lord, I will not try to imitate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I will look to You for Your work."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we do this, we will find God breaking us and building us up.</S>
