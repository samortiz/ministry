   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEACONS AND DEACONESSES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is also something concerning the deacons in these two books.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Timothy 3:8 says, "Deacons must similarly be grave, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not seeking gain by base means."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first virtue that the deacons should have is to be grave.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means to be weighty and not so light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all need to be grave in what we say and do.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There must be some weight in everything we express.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And we should not be double-tongued.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This really calls for the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then Paul mentions something about the wives or deaconesses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Women similarly must be grave, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things" 1 Tim 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only must the brothers who are the serving ones be grave, but also the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They must be weighty and not slanderers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To slander is to say something in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our mouths should not be shut in the meetings; neither should they be too open in our talking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are too free in our talking, spontaneously we may slander or speak lightly of others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus never slandered.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He never spoke anything lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do need the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not only must the deacons and the deaconesses have these virtues, but so must all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul says, "I will therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and reasoning" 1 Tim 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Wherever we have wrath or reasoning, we are finished as far as prayer is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we turn away from wrath and give up all our reasoning, then we are ready to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But we cannot do this by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need the Lord Jesus in our spirit to be our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we will have the proper church service.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This brings us to 1 Timothy 2:9-10.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These verses are for the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Similarly, that women adorn themselves in proper clothing with modesty and sobriety, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly clothing; but, what befits women professing godly reverence, by good works."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sisters must adorn themselves in proper clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Greek word for proper means that which is arranged in a befitting way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everything is very well arranged.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today we have two extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some women need two or three hours to dress that is one extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The other is that some do not care for their appearance at all.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They dress in a sloppy way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The proper humanity is lacking in both extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Neither way of dress is arranged in a suitable way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this reason Paul says that the women should adorn themselves in proper clothing with modesty.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The King James Version uses "shamefacedness" for "modesty."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It really means to have a sense of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sisters need to have such a sense.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The women in the world have no sense of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to God's creation and according to His natural law, women should have a sense of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God created them in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Satan's subtlety has encouraged women of today not to be shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The world says that it is a glory to be shameless.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But a young lady without modesty and a sense of shame has lost all safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A sense of shame is a kind of protection for the young ladies.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, Paul says that the sisters should adorn themselves with modesty or a sense of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The way some women dress today is certainly not of a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some young ladies wear their dresses too short, while others wear them too long.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I do not believe that either way manifests sobriety.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the sisters take the humanity of Jesus, this humanity will give them a sober understanding in the way they should wear their clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is not one verse telling us how long or how short our clothing should be, but there is this verse in 1 Timothy 2:9 telling the sisters to adorn themselves in proper clothing with modesty.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am not giving any regulations; I am just ministering something of the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we really mean business to take Jesus as our humanity, He will tell us how we should dress.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At this point I would like to mention another verse in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Deuteronomy 22:5 says, "The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Just last week while riding with a brother in his car, I was asked whether certain ones who were walking on the street were men or women.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I answered that I simply did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I could not tell the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is not a joke, this is a kind of abomination to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This kind of apparel leads to much fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I say again that I am not giving any regulations for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>My burden is to minister the real, genuine, proper humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I could never believe that the humanity of Jesus would allow any sister to adorn herself in a man's way, nor any brother to dress in a woman's way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord says in His Word that this is an abomination to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is not a small mistake or wrongdoing; it is an abomination to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are fighting for the kingdom, and if we lose the ground, how can we fight the battle?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The enemy will laugh at us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We will already be in his hands.</S>
