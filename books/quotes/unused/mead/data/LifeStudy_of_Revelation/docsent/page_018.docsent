   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SON</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After studying the book of Revelation again and again, I have discovered that it contains twenty-six items of what the Son is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since there are twenty-six letters in the alphabet, we may say that Christ is every letter from A to Z. He is useful for composing any word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do you want to compose the word light?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is l, i, g, h, and t.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Would you like to compose the word love?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is l, o, v, and e. With Christ we can compose any positive thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After we have the words, we have sentences, paragraphs, and chapters, and once we have the chapters, we have the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The entire Bible is composed with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us now briefly consider each of the twenty-six aspects of Christ found in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A. Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Son is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jesus is Jehovah the Savior, and Christ is the One anointed of God to carry out God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. The Faithful Witness</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Son is the faithful Witness 1:5; 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is God s Witness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although He is God, He is also the Witness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without Him, we cannot know, see, or gain God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is testified by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>C. The Firstborn of the Dead</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Son is the Firstborn of the dead 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the universe, God has two creations: the creation by His first work and the creation by His second work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all know God s first creation, but not many of us are familiar with His second creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s second work is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Firstly, God created all existing things; secondly, He resurrected some of these existing things and brought them into another sphere, another realm, which is the realm of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Are we in God s first creation or in His second creation?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While our body remains in God s first creation, our spirit is in His second creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our spirit has been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that it has been recreated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, it belongs to God s second creation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In both of God s creations, Christ is the first.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, and in Revelation 1:5 we are told that He is the Firstborn of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was the first to be resurrected from the dead, and we shall follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here the phrase the Firstborn of the dead indicates the creation of God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This signifies a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In God s first creation there was a beginning, and in God s second creation in resurrection there was another beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we were regenerated, we experienced a new beginning in God s second creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>D. The Ruler of the Kings of the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Son is the Ruler of the kings of the earth 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although the Communists are against Christ, they use His calendar without realizing that they are doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to history, the one whose calendar you use is the one to whom you are in subjection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If any used the calendar of a certain king, he would have to be under the rule of that king.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In like manner, the Communists are under Jesus Christ because they use His calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They call it the international calendar, but actually it is the calendar of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this way they unconsciously admit that He is their Ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the universe, there is one unique Ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All mankind today uses the calendar of Christ and is under His rule.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the people on earth are His people, and He is the Ruler of all nations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jesus might say to the Communists, You are opposing Me, but I will cause you to be My people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I will cause you to use My calendar, and you will have no choice about being under My rule.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am the unique Ruler of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>E. The Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Son is the Son of God 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As the Son of God, He is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is the true God with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>F. The Son of Man</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Son is also the Son of Man 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As the Son of Man, He is a genuine man with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is both the very God and the proper man.</S>
