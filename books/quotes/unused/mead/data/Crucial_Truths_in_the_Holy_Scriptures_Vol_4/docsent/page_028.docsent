   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everyone who believes into Him John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How can a person be in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a mysterious spiritual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A person enters into Christ by believing into Him, not by being physically born.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are not physically born into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We believe into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Greek preposition into in this verse is the same preposition that is used in Romans 6:3 and Galatians 3:27 in relation to baptism, but here it refers to believing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just as a person must be baptized into Christ, he also must believe into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are related to Christ by believing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We believe into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When a person believes into Christ, he enters into Christ and begins a relationship with Christ in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He has a spiritual union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is similar to a light bulb that is connected to an electrical power plant by electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is related to the electrical power plant because of the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once we believe in Christ, His Spirit enters us, joins us to Christ, and causes us to be one with Christ in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From the time of our believing, we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ Gal 3:27; see also Rom 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Both believing and baptism speak of our entrance into Christ, our putting on of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By believing, we enter into Christ in reality in spirit; by being baptized, our entrance into Christ becomes practical in a manifest way by our going into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we believe, we enter into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we confess, declare, and manifest this fact through baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through believing and being baptized, we are able to fully enter into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Being in Christ requires these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of Him you are in Christ Jesus 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We enter into Christ through believing and being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These are matters that involve our response; however, putting the Spirit of Christ and the life of Christ into us are matters that depend upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we receive Christ and enter into Him through believing and being baptized, God puts the Spirit of Christ and the life of Christ into our spirit, causing us to be joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not something that we can do ourselves; it is completely a matter of God s doing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, in reality it is of God that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God puts us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God puts the Spirit and the life of Christ into our spirit, causing us to be one with Christ in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is God s response to our believing and being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Believers Inheritance in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through the obedience of the One the many will be constituted righteous Rom 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Adam we have sin, but in Christ we have righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Adam gives us sin, but Christ gives us righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Just as Adam s disobedience resulted in the many being constituted sinners, Christ s obedience resulted in the many being constituted righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Just as we are not sinners because we have sinned, we are not righteous because we have done some righteous works.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Adam we are already sinful, and in Christ we are already righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because we are in Adam, we are sinners, and because we are in Christ, we are righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are sinners because we are in Adam, and we are righteous because we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Adam we inherit sin and are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Christ we inherit righteousness and are righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men Rom 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Just as the sin that we have in Adam causes us to be condemned in him, the righteousness that we have in Christ causes us to be justified in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Adam s one offense in the garden of Eden caused everyone in him to be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the same way, Christ s one righteous act at Golgotha caused everyone in Him to be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Just as we were condemned before God because of Adam s one offense, we are justified before God because of Christ s one righteous act.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We do not need to sin in order to be condemned by God; instead, because of Adam s one offense, we are condemned because we are in him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the same way, we do not need to do righteous acts in order to be justified by God; instead, because of Christ s one righteous act, we are justified because we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Just as our condemnation before God is unrelated to our sinful works, our justification before God is unrelated to any works of righteousness which we have done Titus 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Just as the sin and condemnation that we inherited in Adam bring in death, the righteousness and justification that we received in Christ bring in life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Just as we were condemned because of Adam s sin and inherited death, we were justified because of Christ s righteousness and inherited life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The death that we received because of Adam s sin is out of Satan, but the life that we received because of Christ s righteousness is out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Just as death entered into us because of Adam s sin and defiled our whole being our spirit, soul, and body the life of God entered into us because of Christ s righteousness to enliven our entire being our spirit, soul, and body by swallowing up every element of death in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Just as the death from Adam s sin deadened our spirit and then spread to our soul and body, the life of God from Christ s righteousness enlivens our spirit and then spreads to our soul and body.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This life enters our deadened spirit through the Holy Spirit because of Christ s righteousness and enlivens our deadened spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then this life spreads from our spirit to our soul, swallowing up death and the elements of death in our inward parts until life transfigures our body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even though our body has been attacked and damaged by death, the life of God will make our body the same as the resurrected body of our glorious Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The divine life causes every part of our being to be saturated with the life of God and to enter into God s life of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In summary, we obtain three items in Adam: sin, condemnation, and death; and we obtain three items in Christ: righteousness, justification, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The items that we inherited from Adam have been taken care of by the death and resurrection of Christ, which also gave us righteousness, justification, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christ s death dealt with our sin and condemnation in Adam, and Christ s resurrection dealt with the death that we received in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christ s death and resurrection dealt with our sin, condemnation, and death in Adam on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>On the positive side, Christ s death caused us to obtain righteousness and justification.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>His resurrection also caused us to obtain life on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Christ s death freed us from sin and condemnation in Adam and gave us righteousness and justification in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christ s resurrection freed us from death in Adam and gave us life in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Adam gave us sin and death; Christ died and rose to give us righteousness and life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Christ s death dealt with Adam s sin so that we could receive God s righteousness in Him, and Christ s resurrection dealt with Adam s death so that we could receive God s life in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Christ s death and resurrection solved the problems of sin and death and brought us righteousness and life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In Adam we have sin, condemnation, and death, and in Christ we have righteousness, justification, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As long as we are in Adam, we experience sin, condemnation, and death, and as long as we are in Christ, we experience righteousness, justification, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When we partake of Adam, we partake of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When we partake of Christ, we partake of righteousness and life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When we touch Adam, we touch sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When we touch Christ, we touch righteousness and life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we contact Adam, we encounter sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When we contact Christ, we encounter righteousness and life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we remain in Adam, we will surely taste sin and death, but if we abide in Christ, we will surely enjoy righteousness and life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>May God show us that sin and death are in Adam, whereas righteousness and life are in Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies Eph 1:3 .</S>
