<div class='line'><b>1</b> I have found life's Giver, and the Prince of Life;</div>
<div class='line'>He has quenched my thirst, and vanquished all my strife.</div>
<div class='line'>He, my living bread, became my daily meat;</div>
<div class='line'>Death has died in me, Life's triumph is complete.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> In the Church, what glory! Far horizons glow!</div>
<div class='line'>And His Name all radiant on each brow doth show.</div>
<div class='line'>Christ doth breathe upon her, He's her living Rock,</div>
<div class='line'>Shepherd of His sheep all gathered in one flock.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> There one holy flame doth burn within each breast;</div>
<div class='line'>By one blood redeemed, in Christ they find their rest.</div>
<div class='line'>All their thirst He quenches from one living stream;</div>
<div class='line'>They in adoration lowly worship Him.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> There as Bread of life faint souls He ever feeds;</div>
<div class='line'>There each hungry soul may take whate'er he needs.</div>
<div class='line'>Lovingly He draws each soul that truly lives,</div>
<div class='line'>And in bread and wine Himself to them He gives.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> Gone is all the earth-taint thru abounding grace;</div>
<div class='line'>Hear the song of triumph from the ransomed race.</div>
<div class='line'>All in glory shining, glory not their own,</div>
<div class='line'>Blended into oneness, they approach the throne.</div>
