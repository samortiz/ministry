   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LETTER FROM P'U MEN MA CHAN, P'ING YANG,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHEKIANG PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Greetings to our brother in the Lord, Mr. Witness:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am sorry that I have been too lazy to pick up a pen and write a letter of greeting since you left our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because I am not very learned, I am afraid to show you my letter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are face to face, however, before the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We miss you very much.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are sure that you also miss us and care for our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although the brothers here have been enlightened to obey the truth and have learned some about walking in the Lord's way, we are still ignorant in many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, we asked you to come and preach to us and to direct in everything because our spiritual wisdom is shallow and our life is immature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You did not reject us and still loved us in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You traveled a long distance over rugged mountain roads and came joyfully to teach us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We received much edification.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although the brothers in the denominations do not obey or walk the Lord's way with us, we thank the Lord much for one thing: God has blessed our meeting so that every day our number increases.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are two matters that we do not understand yet; therefore, we ask you to give us some guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A housewife is saved although her life is not strong , but her husband does not believe and he opposes strongly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He commits the sins of fornication, gambling, and idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes the husband gets very sick, and the wife invites the brothers into her home to pray for her husband although he does not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Can the brothers do this?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I read the book The Assembly Life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I did not understand many portions regarding the appointment of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the Bible, the elders are appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why does the apostle have to appoint them again?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The answer in the book is that this confirms the will of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Can we skip this step of confirmation?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the time of the apostles, is there the appointment of elders in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If there is, are not today's sectarian denominations a tradition that has been handed down?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If so, has it become corrupted?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Fan P'ei Chun already asked Mr. Nee the rest of the questions, so I will not repeat them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am sending this hastily composed letter in hope that you will answer it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you publish it in Collection of Newsletters, please correct my language and edit the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May you be blessed with peace in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Your little brothers,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fan Yun Shan, Wen Ching Yi</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Answering Letter</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To my two brothers in the Lord, Yun Shan and Ching Yi:</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I received your letter long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Please forgive me in the Lord for answering so slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first question you asked is not a matter of whether you can but whether you should.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you have the burden and feel you should pray for that sick man, then you can go.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With respect to the elders in the church, you are right that according to the Bible, elders are established by God and appointed by God through the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God does it because the eldership is an office, not a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is a matter of position, not of ability.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A gift or ability can manifest itself; it does not need to be appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, office or position is different; it needs to be appointed and announced to all.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The offices in the New Testament the elders are not the only ones who need to be appointed and announced.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The offices among the people of God in the Old Testament the kings needed to be appointed and announced.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Saul and David were both chosen by God, and both were appointed and announced by Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As long as it is a position or an office, it needs to be by appointment and announcement.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Without this, the authority of the office has no place to rest, and it will be difficult to avoid confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, God appoints and announces the ministers He has established through men His sent ones not only for the sake of establishing the authority of the office, but also for the sake of restricting man's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Unavoidably, some among God's people will act according to the flesh or not remain in their position.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The flesh of these ones has not been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the church, they like to be the head and control things that they should not and even cannot control.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those whose flesh has been dealt with, who are after God's heart, and who can be used by God are often very humble and hide behind others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If God did not use His sent ones who understand His will to appoint and announce those who are useful to Him, it would be difficult to avoid power struggles in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the Old Testament, God originally appointed Solomon to inherit David's kingship, but when David was close to death, Adonijah plotted to usurp the throne before David could appoint and announce Solomon, who was according to God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Later, David found out about this and appointed Solomon as the one whom God had established to inherit his kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this way, Adonijah's usurpation of the kingship disappeared 1 Kings 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If David had not pointed Solomon out to the people, there would have been confusion in Israel after David's death.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God's goal of governing the people through Solomon and building a temple for His name could not have been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>David's appointment expressed God's desire on the one hand and limited the activity of Adonjah's flesh on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the same way, the apostles' appointment of elders expresses God's will on the one hand and limits man's flesh on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, in the church we must appoint and announce the elders that God has established.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Since God left us a pattern for appointing elders, we should do it without having to ask for a reason.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>With any matter we should only ask, "Did God say this?"</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should not ask why God said this.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should only ask what God said, not the reason for what God said.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our greatest right before God is obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The patterns that God has left us are all necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is always good, necessary, and acceptable to God if we act according to "the pattern that was shown..in the mountain."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We do not need to worry about whether there is the appointment of elders after the apostles, or if the appointment of elders in today's sectarian denominations is a tradition with them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are not following the pattern of the church after the apostles' time, nor are we imitating the sectarian denominations of today.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should follow and imitate the church in the apostolic age only.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should follow only the principles given to us by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should imitate only the patterns they gave us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We can and should follow only the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We cannot follow anything apart from or after the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The pattern of the church given in the apostolic age for establishing elders is as follows: God first raises up people to be elders in a local church, then He appoints the ones He has raised up through the apostles so that they can be elders to govern that local church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today in the time of the desolation of the church, we know that there are no more apostles, but we have seen workers who fulfill a small portion of the work of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They preach the gospel in every place and establish assemblies.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We also confess that in the assemblies which stand on the ground of the church today, God will raise up men like elders who can govern the assemblies in the various places.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When men like elders are raised up in the local assemblies, the workers, who participate to a limited extent in the work of the apostles, should designate them among the brothers, according to the principle of the early apostles appointing elders.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The appointed ones should then bear the responsibility of the elders in that local assembly and govern that local assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is necessary, right, and according to the principle of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>May you have peace!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>February 19</S>
