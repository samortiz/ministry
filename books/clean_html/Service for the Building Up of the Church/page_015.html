<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
REQUIRING THE BELIEVERS<br />
TO BE JOINED TOGETHER AND KNIT TOGETHER</h2>
<p>The building up of the church requires the believers to be joined together and knit together. If the believers have not been joined or knit together, the church cannot be coordinated and built up. When a house is built, the wood boards must be joined together and framed together. All the parts of our human body also are joined together and knit together. Whenever, for example, a part of our body is dislocated or suffering from a sprain, we are uneasy, uncomfortable, and troubled. This is a very good illustration of the need for the church to be fitly joined together. If there are brothers and sisters who cannot be joined with others in the church, the church will be troubled.</p>
<p>We need to ask ourselves whether we serve alone or whether we are joined with the saints in our service. This is a great matter. Even if we are joined with other saints, we still need to ask whether we are fitly joined. All the members of our body must be fitly joined with one another; that is, every member must be joined with other members according to their position in the body. Our eyes are not joined to our feet, nor are our feet joined to our arms. Similarly, every brother or sister should be fitly joined for the building up of the church. We should know our position, and we should know the function of the brothers and sisters to whom we are joined. This knowing is not according to human organization but according to the sovereign arrangement of the Holy Spirit. We have been joined to the brothers and sisters in life; we cannot be separate from them, just as they cannot be separate from us. Being fitly joined enables the church to be built up in coordination.</p>
<p>Ephesians speaks not only of being joined together but also of being knit together. Once we are joined together with the brothers and sisters, we are spontaneously knit together with them. When the saints are knit together, no external problems or internal factors can separate us. If this is our condition, the church will have a strong and powerful testimony in its locality.</p>
<p>Our physical strength depends on the knitting together of our body. When we run, every part of our body is intensely exercised, but no matter how much we exercise, our arms or feet will not fall off. The various parts of our body are always joined together and knit together; this is also the situation when the church is being built up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INDIVIDUALISTIC ACTIONS NOT BEING<br />
IN THE CHURCH WHEN THE BELIEVERS<br />
ARE JOINED AND KNIT TOGETHER</h2>
<p>When the brothers and sisters are joined together and knit together, there are no individualistic actions in the church, and there is not even a sense that we are individuals. There is only a sense of oneness based on the saints being joined together and knit together. This is an issue of the church being built up. In order to partake of the service that builds up the church, we cannot act individualistically or be separated from the saints. If we are separated, our work will tear down rather than build up the church.</p>
<p>A genuine and proper work joins and knits the saints together. An isolated and solitary work creates problems because there can be no building up without joining. There can be no building up without joining and knitting; there can only be tearing down.</p>
<p>In our history in the church life, we have clearly seen a few saints who seem to love the Lord very much and who seem to be very spiritual. However, such ones often become separated from the church and isolated from the saints. In a way they seem quite spiritual, but they are problematic because their spirituality lacks the element of joining and knitting. The more spiritual they become, the more they are separated from the church and the saints. In such a condition, these saints cannot be joined with the other brothers and sisters; they are like oil in water.</p>
<p>When a drop of water falls into a bucket of water, it immediately blends with the water and becomes indistinguishable from the other water. However, when a drop of oil falls into the bucket, the drop of oil remains on the surface, apart from the water. No matter how much the water is stirred, the drop of oil remains unblended. The drop may break apart into many drops, but it remains &ldquo;alone&rdquo; and &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; in the water; it is never blended with the water. Some saints are always isolated from the brothers and sisters, they are never blended with others, and they are always separate and solitary. This is quite dangerous.</p>
<p>A brother once stood up and said to the saints, &ldquo;I do not want to meet here anymore. During the Lord&rsquo;s last days on the earth, He left Jerusalem to lodge in Bethany because Jerusalem completely rejected Him. The church here is like Jerusalem, where the Lord Jesus cannot dwell; therefore, I am leaving to go to Bethany.&rdquo; By &ldquo;Bethany&rdquo; he meant a group that he considered to be more spiritual. According to the Bible, the house in Bethany was associated with Lazarus, who died and rose, with Martha, who was drawn about with much serving, and with Mary, who sat quietly at the Lord Jesus&rsquo; feet. Everyone in the house of Bethany loved the Lord, and these brothers viewed themselves as a similar group that loved the Lord. They said, &ldquo;The brothers with us are like Lazarus, and the sisters are like Martha and Mary. Our small group in Bethany is in contrast to the meeting in Jerusalem.&rdquo; They believed that the Lord was not in the meeting in &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; but only in their small group in &ldquo;Bethany.&rdquo; Although this word sounds very spiritual and seems quite appealing, it is actually dangerous. Such a situation can easily result in the tearing down of the church rather than the building up of the church. In order for the church to be built up, the saints must be joined together and knit together. Building up does not involve tearing down. Everything that tears down is the result of individualistic actions.</p>
