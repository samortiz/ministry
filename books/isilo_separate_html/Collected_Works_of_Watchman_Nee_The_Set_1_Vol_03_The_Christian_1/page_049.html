Three is the number of God. It stands for the Triune God. Three is one plus one plus another one. When these three ones are added together, they make three. When they are multiplied together, they make one, in the same way that God is three yet one, one yet three. In geometry, two straight lines cannot form a shape. Therefore, as we have mentioned, two is not a complete number. At least three lines are needed to form a shape. Therefore, three is initial completeness, and it represents God. A complete man is composed of spirit, soul, and body. A complete family is composed of father, mother, and children. A complete faith is composed of knowledge, conduct, and experience.</P><P>Three is also the number of resurrection. The Lord Jesus resurrected on the third day. The dry land came out of water on the third day. Man's regeneration is through gospel preaching, which is not only with words but also in power and in the Holy Spirit. This is a triune work. Jonah came out from the belly of the fish on the third day. The restoration of the nation of Israel is also related to the number three (Hosea 6:1-2).</P><P>The number three is often related to God. For example, baptism is in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19). The apostle's blessing is also triune (2 Cor. 13:14). The Lord Jesus was tempted three times; He prayed three times in the garden of Gethsemane; Peter denied the Lord three times; the Lord asked Peter three times, "Do you love Me," and commanded him three times, "Feed My sheep." "There are three" (1 John 5:7-8) that bear witness for God's Son. The seraphim praise God three times saying, "Holy, holy, holy" (Isa. 6:3), and the four living creatures praise the Lord God three times saying, "Holy, holy, holy" (Rev. 4:8). The largest piece of furniture in the tabernacle was the altar, which had the capacity to hold all the vessels of the tabernacle. The altar represents the cross, satisfying God's righteousness. The altar is three cubits high, indicating that the righteousness of the cross has achieved God's standard. When God judged man's sin in Jesus Christ, there was darkness over the land for three hours. The Lord Jesus appears three times (Heb. 9:24-28): the first time He appeared for redemption (v. 26); the second time He appears at the right hand of God for intercession (v. 24); and the third time He will appear to His people who are waiting for Him for the redemption of their bodies (v. 28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Four</H2><P>Four is the number of the world. God divided the world into four nations: Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. The materials of the image (Dan. 2) which represent the earthly powers, are also of four kinds: gold, silver, brass, and iron. The earthly nations in God's eyes are like four great beasts (Dan. 7). Four as the number of the world is also evident by natural science. The earth has four seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The earth also has four directions: east, west, south, and north (Num. 2). The earth has four raw materials: soil, air, water, and fire. The earth has four winds (Rev. 7:1) and four quarters. The river going out of the garden of Eden, the paradise on earth, was parted into four heads (Gen. 2:10-14). There are four living creatures representing all the creatures on the earth (Rev. 4:6). The cherub is similar to the living creatures. Ezekiel saw that the cherub had four faces: lion, ox, man, and eagle, all of which are the creatures of the world. They also have four wings. Mankind is designated in four ways: peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues (Rev. 17:15). The hearts of men in the world are of four kinds as described in the Lord Jesus' parable of the sower. There are four kinds of soil; He said that the field is the world. The calamities that will judge and punish the world are divided into four types: wars, famines, pestilence, and earthquakes (Matt. 24:6-7). There are four Gospels that bear testimony for the Lord Jesus to the world, expressing the four aspects of the Lord Jesus. When mankind sinned to the uttermost, four soldiers divided the garments of the Lord Jesus (John 19:23). The altar built for those in the world is foursquare; it has four corners (Exo. 27:1). The fourth of the ten commandments refers to the earth (Exo. 21:8-11). The fourth clause of the Lord's prayer is concerned with the earth. What God created on the fourth day are the things of the world, the things "under the sun." The fourth book in the Bible, Numbers, is concerned with the experiences in the wilderness, which denotes the world. Four is derived from three, and three is the base of four. Three represents God. Therefore, four represents the creatures and how they depend on their Creator. Four is the first number that can be divided (four can be divided by two), thus it is a number of weakness. The creatures have nothing to boast of, for what they have is but weakness!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Five</H2><P>Five has several meanings. These several meanings are related to one another. Five is a number of incompleteness. It is also a number that indicates man's responsibility. There is responsibility because there is incompleteness. Five is four plus one. Four represents creatures in the world; one represents the only God. Five is the number of man before God. Based on this, five has two meanings: one is that God adds grace upon man; the other is that man bears responsibility before God. Man, having obtained God's grace, spontaneously ought to bear responsibility before God.</P><P>The imperfection of the number five can be seen from the following: the five fingers of man's hand and the five toes of man's foot only represent half of the hands and half of the feet. On the fifth day, God created the living creatures in the sea, but there was not yet life on the land. When the fifth seal is opened, how anxious the martyrs are, for they have not yet received the crown (Rev. 6:9-11). The wrath of the fifth bowl is poured on the seat of the beast, but the power of the beast has not yet been destroyed (Rev. 16:10-11). Of the virgins, five were wise and five were foolish (Matt. 25:2). Thus when the Lord Jesus Christ comes again, not all saved ones will be fully prepared. Five expresses man's receiving of grace and bearing of responsibility before God. The sanctification of Aaron and his sons (Lev. 8) and the cleansing of the leper (Lev. 14) both have very deep meaning. Blood is put on their right ear lobe, the thumb of their right hand, and the big toe of their right foot. These three, the ear, thumb, and toe, all relate to the number five. The ear is for one of the five senses, the thumb is one of the five fingers of the hand, and the big toe is one of the five toes of the foot. These three represent a complete man-he receives God's Word with his ears, does God's work with his hands, and walks in God's way with his feet. This shows that man is responsible before God. He has received grace and obtained the covering of the precious blood. After he is cleansed by the precious blood his whole being is responsible before God. He should walk worthy of the grace of His calling.</P><P>Four is basically very weak. Unless one is added to make it five, it cannot bear responsibility. This can be illustrated by a hand. Four fingers are nimble, but without the addition of the thumb the hand does not have enough strength to bear any responsibility. The Lord Jesus fed five thousand with five loaves (Matt. 14:17), a sign of the Lord's grace. David selected five smooth stones and gained the victory over Goliath (1 Sam. 17:40), another sign of man's responsibility. The fifth book of the Bible, Deuteronomy, tells how God bestowed grace and how man ought to be responsible. The fifth kingdom of the earth is the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ (Dan. 2:35, 44; Rev. 11:15). How great is the responsibility of those who desire to enter into the kingdom and rule with the Lord Jesus! Matthew 5-7 reveals the requirements. Deuteronomy, the fifth book of the Bible, tells us what one should do after entering the promised good land which typifies the kingdom of the Lord Jesus.</P><P>The Feast of Pentecost is the fiftieth day after the Passover. It typifies the descension of the Holy Spirit and the Jews and Gentiles receiving grace and being joined as the church. (Please read Leviticus 23:15-21-two loaves represent the church composed of the Jews and the Gentiles.) Man receives the Holy Spirit through grace. Those who offend Him will receive severe punishment! This speaks of responsibility. In Leviticus, the five offerings typify the Lord Jesus' unique sacrifice, but man here must also bear responsibility. There are five curtains in the tabernacle and there are five pillars. The number five is often used in the measurement of the tabernacle.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> </body></html>
