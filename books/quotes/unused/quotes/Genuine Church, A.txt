These items are very mysterious and full of spiritual implications and spiritual, hidden, mysterious, and divine secrets
If our speaking is centered on the condition of a church, we may spread rumors and give others an inaccurate impression of that church
According to the New Testament record, no other church's condition may have been as negative as that of the church in Corinth
Paul does not refer to the church in Corinth as a pitiful church with troublesome Jewish teachers and proud philosophical Greeks
The church is composed of the 'called saints' -the church of the saints, the sanctified ones, who have been called out of the satanic world
Verse 2e continues with the fifth qualification: 'With all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place'
Verse 4 says, 'I give thanks to God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus'
Paul's thanks to God in verse 4 was based upon the gift of grace which was given to the church in Christ Jesus
In the New Testament, the phrase 'in Christ' is mainly used related to the Triune God and the believers corporately
We have received grace as our base, and today we are standing upon grace, not upon our attributes, virtues, or excellencies
We are in the peace because we have enjoyed grace, and we have grace because we have received grace upon grace
In verse 8 Paul says, 'Who will also confirm you till the end, unreprovable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ'
After receiving grace as our base, we have to grow in grace so that we will be unreprovable in the day of Christ's coming
Verse 9 says, 'God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
Corinthians 15:45b says, 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,' and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, 'And the Lord is the Spirit'
Through the faithful Triune God, we were called into the fellowship, communion, enjoyment, and participation of Jesus Christ our Lord
It is also the composition of those who have been sanctified in Christ and the composition of the called saints
Such a church also is ready, qualified, and positioned to receive the dispensing of the divine grace with the divine peace
Paul's use of the preposition 'through' implies a process through which the Triune God passed in order to call us
Ephesians 1:3-6 is a portion of the Word on the Father's choosing and predestination, speaking forth God's eternal purpose
Verses 7-12 go on to speak of the Son's redemption, speaking forth the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose
Verses 13-14 speak concerning the Spirit's sealing and pledging, speaking forth the application of God's accomplished purpose
In total, verses 3-14 unveil the Father's choosing, the Son's redeeming, and the Spirit's sealing and pledging
We must go further, deeper, and higher to look at the church's intrinsic items-its nature, essence, element, standing, and ground
