   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The oneness that we possess in all the churches is not merely the oneness in the Lord's aspiration and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The oneness in John 17 may be likened to a promissory note.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We do not have merely a promissory note; we possess a real bank deposit, for the promised "cash" has actually been "deposited into the bank" and has become our possession.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may consider this possession as our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The oneness that we have is the accomplished oneness, the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all have the Spirit in our "bank account," that is, in our spirit Rom 8:9, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This Spirit who is in our spirit is the equivalent of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have the oneness as a deposit in our account, but we may not write "checks of oneness" because we may not remain in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, we may remain in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When a certain brother prays, we may be in our mind discerning whether that brother's prayer is genuine, or whether there is hidden intention in his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, we may not say "Amen" to his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In such a situation, there is no practice of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The one accord actually is the using of the oneness, which is the using of our possession.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all need to realize and to learn that not to be one with the saints, not to have one accord with others in the church, is serious.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that the oneness is not applied.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To keep the oneness, to apply the oneness, to use the oneness, to enjoy the oneness, to spend the oneness, we need to practice the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, we should practice the one accord not only among the saints in our particular locality; we must practice the one accord among all the churches universally.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the past two and a half years, the teaching of the absolute autonomy of the local churches was promoted among us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This teaching was based mainly on the book The Churches of God by G. H. Lang.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of teaching encourages and even promotes differences among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is serious to say that all the churches should be different.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are not for uniformity among the churches, but we are for oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Uniformity and oneness are not the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In a family there may be a grandfather and a grandmother who are over eighty years of age, a father and a mother who are about fifty years of age, and a number of children ranging from eighteen down to four years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They all are different in age, different in the degree of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In such a family it would be impossible to make all the members uniformly the same age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, although the members of a family can never be the same age, they can still be one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Likewise, in the church we do not practice uniformity because in the household of God, a large household, there are many degrees of maturity among the children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To eliminate the degrees of maturity would be absolutely wrong and would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, this does not mean that we do not need oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the practicality of the church life, as in the family life, there is the need of oneness; but in the degree of the growth in life, it is impossible to have uniformity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To make all the children the same in the growth in life is not to practice oneness; it is to practice uniformity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To have a clear vision of the proper one accord as the practice of the genuine oneness also is a part of the scriptural remedy for the intrinsic problem in the present rebellion among us.</S>
