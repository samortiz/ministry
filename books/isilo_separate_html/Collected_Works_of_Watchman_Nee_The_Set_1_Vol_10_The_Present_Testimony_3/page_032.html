Visions and Dreams</H2><P>Among all the churches today, many are seeking visions and dreams. Some have asked me if I believe in these things. My answer is that I am not opposed to the visions and dreams themselves; I myself also have experienced these before. Sometimes visions and dreams can be very helpful. However, my question is where do the visions and dreams come from? Are they from God or not? Many times when someone testifies in a meeting concerning a vision he has seen, many others begin to talk about their visions as well. In the end the whole meeting becomes occupied with visions and dreams. This is a fact, and I have seen many cases. This happens because, after hearing about the visions of others, some begin to pray and ask God for the same experience. If they do not have the same experience, they fast and pray for several nights continuously. Their bodies become weak and their minds become blank. They have no will to resist anything, and under these conditions they receive the so-called visions or dreams. It is true that they have received visions, but the question is how they received these visions and whether or not they have received something from God. This kind of pursuit with blank minds and passive wills is not according to the teaching of the Bible. It is simply a kind of self-hypnosis.</P><P>Some people are good at dreams and the interpretation of dreams. However, their interpretations are too ridiculous. I have a friend who is a doctor. After he believed in the Lord, he had a great many dreams. Every time I met him, he told me his dreams and his interpretations of them. He dreamt almost every night, sometimes even three or four dreams a night. What was the reason for such dreams? Do you think that God intended to give him all those dreams? I know that he daydreamed very much; perhaps this was the reason he dreamed so much at night. It was surprising that even though he was an intelligent doctor, his thoughts were so confused. In his mind he was drawing pictures day and night; he could not control his thoughts. What he daydreamed during the day, he dreamed during the night. I frankly advised him that if he did not reject his dreams, he would be deceived and not grow spiritually. Later he improved a little. This shows us that many dreams are not from God but are from men's malfunctioning minds and wandering thoughts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>7. Baptism of the Holy Spirit</H2><P>Another condition, which I call "electric shocks," claims to convey power to some people. It causes them to shake just as if they have been shocked by electricity. They feel a kind of burning within and make strange noises with their mouth. Their hands and feet make all kinds of strange gestures. This is what some call "the baptism of the Holy Spirit." I am not against all these. Yet remember that what can be done in the spirit can be done in the soul; but what comes from the soul has the goal to deceive. The soul deceives men by telling them that these things are from the spirit and from God. Therefore, we have to differentiate what is from the soul and what is from the spirit, so that we will not be deceived. These soulish practices are similar to the way men seek after visions. In order to have these experiences, people fast and pray all night. As a result, their bodies become weak, they lose all resistance in their will, and they receive the so-called baptism of the Holy Spirit which makes them shake and tremble.</P><P>Many people like to have happy or strangely exciting feelings. They pray earnestly by fasting or for the whole night, in hope of receiving the so-called baptism of the Holy Spirit. This is in reality a kind of self-hypnosis. They continue to practice these things until they sense some feelings within them. What is this? Is God really filling up their hearts? I cannot believe that they have received something that is true because they are not practicing according to the teaching of the Bible. We should, on the one hand, know God and how He thinks about these things, and we should, on the other hand, consider if these things are from God. Many believers think that everything is from God, and they accept it all. As a result, they are deceived. Other believers think that it is very difficult to distinguish what is from God and what is not. As a result, they reject everything. This is also wrong. We should differentiate what is from God and what is not. Anything that is from God, we will accept, and anything that is not from God, no matter how good, we should reject. We should remember that all of Satan's works are done through the power of man's soul, and we must avoid them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXAMINING THE SOURCE</H2><P>Some seek visions. Some say they have seen lights or a flame, while others say they have had dreams or have felt an electric shock. After they testify this way, others begin to have similar experiences. I am not against these things in themselves. I merely ask, Where do these things come from? Are they from the soul, or are they from the spirit? We ought to remember that everything that can be done in the spirit can also be done in the soul; the only difference between them is that the soulish things are a counterfeit of the spirit. If we do not trace the source of these things, we will be deceived. The most important thing is to not deny the existence of these things, but to ask if these things are from the soul or the spirit.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
