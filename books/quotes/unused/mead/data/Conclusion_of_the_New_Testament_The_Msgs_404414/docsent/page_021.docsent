   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The purposeful God has an economy, and in His economy He intends to have a universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word incorporation refers to persons indwelling one another, coinhering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God in His Divine Trinity is an incorporation by coinhering mutually and by working together as one; the three of the Trinity are an incorporation by what They are and by what They do John 14:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Triune God in eternity past held a council Acts 2:23 to make a decision that the second among Them had to become a man and pass through the processes of human living, death, and resurrection so that all the redeemed and regenerated believers of God would be incorporated into God s incorporation to be an enlarged, divine-human incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The processed and consummated Triune God and the redeemed and regenerated believers became an enlarged, universal, divine-human incorporation in the resurrection of Christ John 14:20 , consummating the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God Rev 21:2-3 .</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today our spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit is the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From this we can see that Christ as the hidden manna is in God the Father as the golden pot; that the Father is in Christ as the Ark with His two natures, divinity and humanity; and that this Christ as the indwelling Spirit lives in our regenerated spirit to be the reality of the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that the Son is in the Father, that the Father is in the Son, and that the Son as the Spirit is the reality of the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This implies and corresponds to the four in s in John 14:16-20.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the tabernacle of God, the New Jerusalem is the universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This universal incorporation is God s eternal goal.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The way to be incorporated into this unique incorporation is to enjoy Christ, to eat Him, and to partake of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we eat Him, we live by Him in this incorporation, which today is the corporate Body of Christ and which consummates the New Jerusalem.</S>
