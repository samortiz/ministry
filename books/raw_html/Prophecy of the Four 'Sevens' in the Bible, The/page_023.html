<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In Revelation 8:3, "Another Angel"<br>Referring to Christ,<br>and "Incense" Signifying Christ<br>with All His Merits, Which Christ Adds<br>to the Prayers of the Saints That the Saints' Prayers May Be Acceptable to God</H2><P>In Revelation 8:3, "another Angel" refers to Christ, and "incense" signifies Christ with all His merits, which Christ adds to the prayers of the saints that the saints' prayers may be acceptable to God. This prayer is recorded as an insertion. By the end of Revelation 6, the first six seals have been opened. Chapter seven is an insertion between the sixth and seventh seals. Then at the beginning of chapter eight is the opening of the seventh seal. Immediately following the opening of the seventh seal is another insertion in Revelation 8:3-5. In this insertion Christ as "another Angel" is offering the saints' prayers to God. In the book of Revelation, Christ is mentioned four times as "another Angel" (Rev. 7:2; 8:3; 10:1; 18:1). In chapters seven, eight, ten, and eighteen of Revelation, Christ comes in as God's Angel to serve and to take care of God's chosen people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In Revelation 8:5, to Cast the Fire to the Earth<br>Being to Execute God's Judgment upon the Earth</H2><P>Revelation 8:5 tells us that Christ as the Angel "took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar and cast it to the earth; and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake." To cast the fire to the earth is to execute God's judgment upon the earth; hence, the thunders, voices, lightnings, and an earthquake came as signs of God's judgment, and the seven angels, who had the seven trumpets, prepared themselves to trumpet (Rev. 8:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The First Four Trumpets&#151;<br>the Intensified Supernatural Calamities</H2><P>As we have pointed out, the sixth seal is the initiation of supernatural calamities executed on the earth and on the heavenly bodies. The first four trumpets of the seventh seal are the intensified supernatural calamities (Rev. 8:7-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The First Trumpet&#151;Judgment on the Earth</H2><P>The first trumpet is the judgment on the earth. Hail and fire mingled with blood were cast to the earth. Furthermore, the third part of the earth, the third part of the trees, and all green grass were burned up (Rev. 8:7). In Revelation all the verbs are used in the past tense because in the eyes of God all the things prophesied in this book have already taken place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Second Trumpet&#151;Judgment on the Sea</H2><P>After judging the earth, God will judge the sea. The second trumpet is God's judgment on the sea. A great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; the third part of the sea became blood, the third part of the creatures in the sea died, and the third part of the ships were destroyed (Rev. 8:8-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Third Trumpet&#151;Judgment on the Rivers</H2><P>The third trumpet is the judgment on the rivers. A great star called Wormwood, burning like a torch, fell out of heaven upon the third part of the rivers and upon the springs of waters; and the third part of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the waters that were made bitter (Rev. 8:10-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Fourth Trumpet&#151;Judgment<br>on the Sun, Moon, and Stars</H2><P>The fourth trumpet will be the judgment on the sun, moon, and stars. The third part of the sun, the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars were smitten, so that the third part of them might be darkened and the third part of the day and the night should not appear (Rev. 8:12).</P>
