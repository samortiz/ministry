   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOD-MAN, THE CROSS,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today we are blessed because we are in the age of the God-man, the cross, and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Between the God-man and the life-giving Spirit is the cross, the greatest matter in the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is the God-man and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is the centrality and universality of God's economy, and the cross is the centrality and universality of the way to accomplish God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The words centrality and universality were first used by T. Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He used these two terms in reference to the cross of Christ but not to Christ Himself.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today we have Christ as the God-man and the life-giving Spirit, and we also have the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE GERMINATION OF THE NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>ACHIEVED BY THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's intention in His economy is to make the new creation from His old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The way He does this is to work Himself into a part of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The part of the old creation into which God works Himself is His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not everyone born into Adam was chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were chosen Eph 1:4; 1 Pet 1:1-2 out of millions of human beings to become His new creation.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The life-giving Spirit in the resurrection of Christ was the germination of the new creation achieved by the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By working Himself as a new element into us, He made us His new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second Corinthians 5:17, the first mention of the new creation, says, "So that if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new."</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>BEING THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to work Himself into His creation, God had to go through a process.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before His incarnation, God was merely the Triune God in His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After going through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The life-giving Spirit has humanity as well as divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He also has the element of human living within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the elements of God's process have been compounded into the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This compound Spirit is typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Exodus 30 the anointing oil was a compound of five elements: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, cassia, and olive oil.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The hin of olive oil signifies the unique God as the base of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The four spices signify the humanity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Myrrh typifies the precious death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Cinnamon typifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Calamus signifies the precious resurrection of Christ, and cassia signifies the power of Christ's resurrection For further reading, see Life-study of Exodus, Messages 157 through 166, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>1679-1776.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These four spices were added into the olive oil signifying that the elements of Christ's humanity, death, and resurrection were added into the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, Christ as the last Adam, the God-man, became the life-giving Spirit with all the elements of His divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, when we say the life-giving Spirit, we must remember all the elements which have been compounded into this Spirit His divinity, humanity, human living, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The life-giving Spirit is such an all-inclusive person as the totality of the processed Triune God.</S>
