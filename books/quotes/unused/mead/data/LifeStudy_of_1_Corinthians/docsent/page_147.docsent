   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ENJOYMENT OF THE GOOD LAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With this understanding of idolatry as a background, we need to ask what Paul means by the expression the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our understanding of this may be too narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the Lord s table?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Chinese version of the Bible speaks of the Lord s feast.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to this translation, the table is a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, not even the word feast conveys the full significance of the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is included in the term the Lord s table is a matter of great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we shall see in the next message, the Lord s table is actually the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first section of chapter ten is a record that shows how the history of Israel is a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verses 1 through 11 Paul describes this type in its various aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then in verse 12 he says, So then, let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 13 he goes on to give a word of encouragement and comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we study this chapter carefully, we shall realize that there is a gap between verses 13 and 14.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the end of verse 12, Paul seems to make a sudden stop, and then he gives a word of encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The careful reader of this chapter, however, will realize that Paul has not yet finished describing how the history of Israel is a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, we have the definite impression that Paul has not finished this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps he did not have the time to go on in more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, he did have the burden to present the consummate thought regarding Israel as a type.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This consummate thought is the children of Israel entering into the enjoyment of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The enjoyment of the good land is the goal of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Would you he happy with a God who simply delivered His people out of Egypt, brought them into the wilderness, and then allowed them to fall in the wilderness?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I would not be happy with such a God, for this would not be a saving God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God had promised to bring His people out of the land of Egypt into a good land, a land flowing with milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This promise had been made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If God had not brought the people into this good land, He would not have fulfilled His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As far as the children of Israel were concerned, the enjoyment of the land flowing with milk and honey was the ultimate goal of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But as far as God was concerned, the ultimate goal was not reached just by the enjoyment of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There was still the need for the kingdom and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The children of Israel needed the enjoyment, but God needed a kingdom and a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because Paul wrote in a very economical way, he made a leap in his composition from the failure in the wilderness to the enjoyment of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we get into the depths of this chapter, we shall realize that this is Paul s concept.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Both idolatry and the Lord s table are much more inclusive in meaning than what is indicated by the letters in black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>BECOMING WHAT WE EAT</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Corinthians 10:12-22, we need to remember, is part of a long section which deals with the matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eating is related to enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever you eat something, you enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, what we eat becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the one hand, eating is for our enjoyment; on the other hand, we become what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These basic concepts should be applied in understanding this portion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To eat idol sacrifices actually means to enjoy idols and eventually to become one with idols.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the same principle, to partake of the Lord s table is to enjoy this table and to become one with it; that is, to enjoy the Lord and become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In these verses Paul first speaks of one kind of table and then, apparently making a leap, of another kind of table.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In verse 21 he clearly says, You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and of the table of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Actually, in this portion there are three tables: the altar v. 18 , the table of demons, and the table of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All these terms are inclusive, and we should not understand them in a narrow way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A RICH UNVEILING OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we read this Epistle, we realize that Paul was truly a marvelous writer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His aim, his purpose, in writing 1 Corinthians was to bring the distracted Corinthian believers back to Christ and back to the central focus of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we have seen, in dealing with divisions, Paul unveils a great deal concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In no other book is Christ unveiled in such a rich way as He is in the first four chapters of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even when Paul deals with a problem involving gross sin, the matter of incest, he reveals Christ in a marvelous way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, we have pointed out that in dealing with married life, Paul also covers important matters related to being one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But in chapters eight, nine, and ten, a section concerned with the eating of idol sacrifices, the revelation reaches the peak.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It comes to a consummate point.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Most readers of 1 Corinthians, including Bible teachers and theologians, have not touched the full significance of what Paul deals with in this section.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, it is crucial that we do not take these chapters for granted, but get into them in a thorough way in order to see the marvelous revelation presented here.</S>
