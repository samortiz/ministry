   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO FOUR MAIN PRINCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF NEW TESTAMENT SERVICE Scripture Reading: Matt 1:20b, 23; Gal 1:11-16; Phil 3:5-8; 2 Cor 3:5-6, 8</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What we have pointed out in the preceding chapter can be summarized as four main principles of New Testament service.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we mentioned, the first instance in the New Testament is the birth of Jesus Christ, showing us the principles of New Testament service.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For our service today we need to learn the principles rather than try to copy the ways recorded there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>ABSOLUTELY OUT OF RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first principle is that the New Testament service is absolutely out of religion with all its traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a main principle which we should not forget.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>New Testament service has nothing to do with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the birth of Jesus, nothing is related to religion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The words religion and tradition were used by the Apostle Paul in Galatians 1:13, KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was in the Jewish religion and had all the traditions of his forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When he was met by the Lord, however, he was delivered out of religion and was through with all the traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Jesus was conceived in Mary s womb, there was not one bit of religion or tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His birth was something which was absolutely new and completely different from the religious background.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Mary was greatly surprised when the archangel Gabriel came to her.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No one would expect such a thing to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was absolutely new new to religion, to culture, to nature, and even to the natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was something contrary to the natural law, but revealed by God and conceived of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The New Testament service is different from religion and tradition in every detail.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even the place where Jesus was brought up was not a great religious center like Jerusalem, but a despised region and a little town.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No part of the New Testament service was related to the law, the regulations or written code, but this service was absolutely something of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, it was begun not in a marvelous and great way, but in a small way, without any advertisement.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everything was small, humble, and low.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to appearances, it was not honorable for a virgin to be with child.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No one would boast of such a thing, but this is the New Testament way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Recovery of the Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today there is much religious service and work carried on in a way that is contrary to the principles of Christ s birth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the recovery of the church life, however, these principles must be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we go out to spread the church life in a way that is so marvelous, so noble, a way that causes us to be so boastful, such a way proves that we are wrong and that we are not in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The recovery of the church life in every aspect will be in principle the same as the birth of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In a sense, whenever we carry on the New Testament service, that is again the birth of Jesus, for the birth of Christ is simply to bring forth Christ to people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If some of us migrate to another city, there should be a birth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To migrate in order to spread the church life is to bring forth Christ to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This can only be carried out in a new way, not in an old way, not in a traditional, religious way with all its advertisement and propaganda.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should go out in a lowly, humble, and small way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may say that the New Testament service is something like the situation of a virgin with child.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes we would even feel ashamed to mention it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Of course, in the eyes of God it is glorious, but in a human sense, it is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When others ask what kind of a work we are doing and what church we go to, it may sometimes be difficult to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Apparently, it is not so glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That is the case of a virgin with child.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes we may want to tell others that the work we are doing is somewhat like a virgin with child, but the child we are going to deliver is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no glory or honor, but the enemy knows that it is a real glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man does not know, but the Devil knows, and, praise the Lord, we know also!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We know what we are doing.</S>
