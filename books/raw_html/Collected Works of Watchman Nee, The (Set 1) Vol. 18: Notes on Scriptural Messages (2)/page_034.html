<P>I once brought a problem to a Western missionary. I asked, "Does God demand more from the believers, or do the believers demand more from their fellow believers? My thought was that perhaps God demanded more. I considered that because we are so low and the Lord is so high, He would demand more. She replied, "No." I asked her for the reason, and she said, "What we can see are men's obvious failures; but what the Lord sees are men's hidden victories." Indeed, this word comes from deep experiences. What we see is a person's obvious failures—once, twice or even tens of times. But the Lord sees his hidden victories—once, twice or hundreds of times. Perhaps you were tempted five times and failed five times, while someone else was tempted three times but failed only once. Perhaps he has many hidden victories which you have not yet seen. You may have had ten battles and were defeated only once; he may have had hundreds of battles and been defeated only once. If we understand this, we cannot but consider others more excellent than ourselves.</P><P>Verse 4 says, "Not regarding each his own virtues, but each the virtues of others also." This is not an easy matter. Due to my bad health in recent years, I have often been unable to take care of the things of others. Oftentimes it seems that we cannot even take care of our own things. How can we then regard the virtues of others? Regarding the virtues of others requires a life of self-denial. Recently I met a lady missionary from the China Inland Mission. I asked if she had met Mr. Hudson Taylor and whether she had seen anything special about him. She said, "According to what I know, he has a special characteristic: whenever you visit him, it seems that he is not busy. He considers your matter to be the most important. Actually his day is filled with writing many letters and seeing many people. He cares for others as though he has no other cares." This is self-denial. Oh, if the Lord were as cold as we are, not caring for anyone, where would you or I be today? The Lord cared for the things of men. He died because of our sins. We must learn to be a person who cares for the things of others.</P><P>Verse 5 says, "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus." This verse is a conclusion of verses 1 through 4. If one seeks for encouragement in Christ, much more can be said. If we have the mind of Christ Jesus, everything will be fine with us, and we can do all things. Since some may ask, "what is the mind of Christ?", Paul gave his answer in verses 6 through 8.</P><P>Verses 6 through 7 say, "Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, But emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men." Christ was entitled to lawfully hold His existence in the form of God; He is worthy to hold this as His right. Therefore, He "did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped." He "emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men." What kind of mind is the mind of Christ? The mind of Christ involves Him giving up His legal right. Perhaps you wish that certain ones would treat you a certain way. But Christ did not even claim what He was entitled to. He did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped; rather, He emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave. This is the mind of Christ.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, I often feel that legal rights are not a good thing because we all think that we are entitled to certain legal rights. But our Lord said, "You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It is not so among you" (Matt. 20:25-26). The teaching of Matthew 5 through 7 can be summarized in two phrases: give up what you deserve and, instead, receive joyfully what you do not deserve. Others can demand an eye for any eye, a tooth for a tooth, but the Lord said to pray for those who persecute you. Lay aside what you deserve and receive what you do not deserve. On these hang all the Law and the Prophets (Matt. 22:40). Whether at home or abroad, no Christian should voice his right. If the Lord had said, "Can the Father send me?", the Father could not have sent Him. On the one hand, the Lord said, "I and my Father are one." At the same time, He also said, "My Father is greater than I." Is there a difference of great and small within the Triune God? No. The matter of greatness and smallness is not based on existence but on willingness. The Father sent the Son, the Son sent the Spirit; this is the humility within the Godhead.</P><P>The form of a slave indicates the lowliness of Christ; the likeness of men indicates the human limitations suffered by the Lord. The form of a slave is in apposition to the form of God as man is in apposition to God. God is unlimited. But man is limited by time and space; he is limited in his eating, drinking, and sleeping. The form of God is glorious whereas the form of a slave is lowly. The mind of Christ is in His being willing to humble and restrict Himself.</P><P>Verse 8 says, "And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross." Christ's obedience is to obey One who is equal to Him, not One who is greater than He. Christ's obedience is an obedience even unto death, and that the death of a cross.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, Christians should be more in oneness and love. The way of verses 6 through 8 is truly the way of the cross! If a brother has not yet learned to deny the self, is still unwilling to lay down his legal right, and who does not know how to humble himself among his peers, then he has never walked the way of the cross. There was a Western missionary who said, "A certain person always encourages others to walk the way of the cross, the narrow way of the cross. However, I see him as one who has never entered into this way." Indeed, if we have never denied ourselves, we have never taken the way of the cross. We often say that we want to choose the way of the cross but we do not realize that we need to deny ourselves in daily matters that is, to die. This is the way of the cross.</P><P>Once a sister met a doctor who was an active believer in the Brethren group. He was well-educated, knowledgeable about the Bible, and quite eloquent in his preaching. This sister said to him, "Sir, what you preach is not wrong; but the way you take is wrong." He argued that what he preached was the denial of the self and the bearing of the cross. The sister said, "That is right; but what I see is that you have never died." He humbly sought for her advice, and she spoke frankly to him according to the Bible. Later he wrote her a letter, saying, "After you left, I told God that I did not know what the cross was, or what the way of the cross was, or what it was to deny oneself? I told Him, `God, in the midst of all my ignorance, I consecrate myself to You. I pray that You will enable me to deny myself.' After this, difficulties came. My wife opposed me. When I could no longer bear it, a voice reminded me, `In these matters you should deny yourself and die.' Formerly I preached about the cross and the denial of the self. Yet I did not realize in what things I should die and how to die? Now I know that it is carried out in the practical matters. When I speak in his way, many people are provoked to oppose me. My medical practice has also been affected. Now I know that I must die among those who are with me."</P><P>Brothers and sisters, many people know the truth and the necessity of denying the self, but how does one die? One dies among those he is with, among the people he can see and touch. May God bless us so that we can think the same thing, have the same love, be joined in soul, and think the one thing, so that the Lord's joy may be full.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANNOUNCEMENT</H2><P>Due to the impossible postal route to the 3 Manchurian provinces, all the publications will be mailed to Darien.
