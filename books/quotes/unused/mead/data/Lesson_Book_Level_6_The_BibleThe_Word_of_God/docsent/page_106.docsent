   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>2 PETER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A. The writer s , the place, and the time: This book was written by Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to the Jewish believers in the dispersion in the Gentile world 1:1 footnote 3 . According to the degraded condition of the church in chapter 2, and the commending words spoken concerning the apostle Paul in 3:15-16, this book may have been written after the martyrdom of Paul, possibly around A.D. 69, before the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, and it must have been written shortly before Peter s martyrdom 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>B. The subject: the divine provision and the divine government.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, in this Epistle we also see God s provision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we may say that the subject of 2 Peter is the divine provision and the divine government.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God grants us His provision so that we may cooperate with His government.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, if we would carry out God s government, we need God s provision; that is, we need the divine supply.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 2 Peter the writer first presents the divine supply.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We see how God s power provides all the supply for our need.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the main significance of this book.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 13 we have the expectation of the new heavens and the new earth filled with God s righteousness; in 14 to 16, the preparation for the coming judgment; and in 17 and 18, the conclusion, where we are told to be on guard and grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord.</S>
