   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Under the greater ledge is the lesser ledge, which also has two edges of one cubit each, making it a total of sixteen cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sixteen is composed of two times eight meaning a witness in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is a living witness in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Base</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The base also has two edges measuring one cubit each making it a total of eighteen cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eighteen is composed of six times three, signifying man and the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because of the unique design of the altar, it is very solid and stable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is wider at the base than it is at the top.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This type of construction makes the altar very stable.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the top were wider than the bottom, it would not be stable.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But because the bottom is much wider than the top, it can stand solidly and nothing can shake it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, on every story, on every section, of the altar are the edges which are spreading out like two arms to hold something.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The borders on the edges also rise up to hold something.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is such a clear picture.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The altar is not only solid and stable, but it is also able to hold things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The death of Christ on the cross is not only stable and solid, but also able to hold things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is able to hold all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all need to pray-read these verses and to study the chart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What a wonderful, marvelous, all-inclusive death!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Horns</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At each of the four corners of the hearth of God, a horn points upward.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Bible, horns signify strength and power.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The horns on the altar, which are toward the four corners of the earth and are also upward, signify the power of the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Steps</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The steps up to the altar are toward the east.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The east indicates the glory of the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The cross always points toward God's glory and always leads us to God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Cubit of Measurement</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The cubit used by Ezekiel is not the common human cubit, but is a cubit plus a handbreadth 43:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is called a great cubit and is the divine measurement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not man's measurement, but God's measurement.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may feel that, according to your human measurement and standard, you are qualified; but according to the divine measurement, you still fall short.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The altar is not measured by the human cubit, but by the divine cubit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Never measure yourself by your human measurement.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Your human measurement may be of value to you, but it is of no value to God.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE ALTAR AND THE TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The last point is the relationship of the altar with the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only after passing through the altar, can we come to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that without the proper realization and experience of the cross of Christ, it will be difficult for us to have the reality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The temple signifies Christ in the church life, and it comes only after the experience of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we desire to have a proper church life, we need an adequate realization and experience of the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After we are thoroughly terminated on the cross, we will have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be in the outer court having the enjoyment of Christ is wonderful, but it is still far from the experience of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be even in the inner court where the ministry has begun is also wonderful, but it also is far from the experience of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must go on and on until we pass through the altar and come to the temple; there we will have the reality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order to have a rich and full church life, we must pass through the altar, through the cross of Christ.</S>
