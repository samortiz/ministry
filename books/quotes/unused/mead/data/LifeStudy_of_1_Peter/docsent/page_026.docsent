   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST WORKING IN THE PROPHETS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Peter may have been a fisherman, but he was also an excellent writer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He spent a great deal of time studying the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He found out into what the prophets had searched, and he had the boldness to say that while the prophets were searching, the Spirit of Christ was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we pointed out in the previous message, the constitution of the Spirit of Christ is dispensational.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that the Spirit of Christ was constituted dispensationally through and with Christ s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the function of this Spirit is eternal, because He is the eternal Spirit Heb 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Regarding the constitution of the Spirit of Christ, time is a factor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But regarding the function of the Spirit of Christ, time is not a factor.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit of God was sufficient and adequate for creation, but for the carrying out of God s full salvation and for the application of this salvation, there is the need of the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Old Testament prophets were searching into what manner of time Christ would come to suffer, the Spirit of Christ was working in them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that the Spirit of the Triune God the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit of Christ was operating in them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to function, there is no difference between the Spirit s work in the prophets and His work in the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was the same Spirit with the same function.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First and 2 Peter were written to Jewish believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Jews knew God, and they trusted in the sprinkling of animal blood.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although they knew God, they did not know Him as the Father of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, they knew the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah, but they did not know the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1:2 Peter purposely uses the expression sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ to differentiate this sprinkling from the sprinkling of animal blood in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, in 1:3 he speaks of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ to distinguish the God of the Christians from the God of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we see that he even used the term the Spirit of Christ instead of the Spirit of God in order to make yet another distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peter was seeking to convince the Jewish believers that even the Old Testament prophets were the same as New Testament Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit of Christ who is in New Testament Christians was also working in the Old Testament prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a rule, in the Old Testament times the Spirit was upon the saints, not in them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But here, based on the principle of the eternal function of the Spirit of Christ, is an exception: we are told that the Spirit of Christ was working in the Old Testament prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Peter says that the Spirit of Christ in them made the prophets clear concerning what manner of time Christ would suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is a shame that so many of the New Testament believers are not clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Probably only now do you understand what Peter means by what manner of time Christ would suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Peter s expression what manner of time implies a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It indicates to the Jewish believers that the manner of time of Christ s coming was a time of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is also the manner of time in which we live today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Peter s day not many Jews believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, those who believed suffered persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The unbelieving Jews challenged the Jewish believers, saying, Look, what a small number believe in your Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why are you so foolish as to believe in a Nazarene who was put on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The manner of time of Christ s coming surely was a manner of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not expect many Jews to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The manner of time of Christ s coming is unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that unbelief is a characteristic of the time of Christ s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Isaiah asked, Who has believed our report?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Peter certainly saw this unbelief in those of his day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Peter reported, but very few Jews responded.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That was the manner of time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many Christians today expect to have a great revival.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That, however, is against the principle that the manner of time of Christ s coming is characterized by unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Peter s composition may not be refined, but he was nevertheless a giant in spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He may not have had a thorough knowledge of the Greek language, but he surely knew spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In using his limited knowledge of the Greek language, Peter tried his best to put the aspects of his experience into words.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In particular, he put a lot in 1:11.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I would like to follow Peter in caring for spiritual experience and for the riches of Christ rather than for language.</S>
