   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God Creating Man with a Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Contact and Receive Him</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Furthermore, Genesis chapter two continues to show us that when God created man, He breathed into man s nostrils the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This breath of life became man s spirit v. 7; Job 32:8 . After reading this, many people do not understand why God created man with a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, little by little it has been uncovered to us through the books of the Bible that the human spirit is for contacting and containing God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, we all have a stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The stomach is a container to contain food.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man s body requires food for nourishment; however, for the food to be put into man, there needs to be a container.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, God created man with a stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The stomach holds the food that has been eaten, and then through a metabolic process the nutrients are transported through the blood to become the elements within man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus said that He is the bread of life and that he who eats Him shall live because of Him John 6:48, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Like the Jews in those days, many Christians are puzzled when they come to this portion of the Word, having no idea what the Lord meant.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I was newly saved and came to this portion of the Word, I also wondered, After we eat the Lord as the bread of life, where is He in our being?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, He could not be in our stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I asked different ones but was not able to get an explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some told me that the Lord s being the bread of life refers to the words written in the Bible and that to eat the Lord is to read and take in His written words.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, I tried my best to put the Lord s written words into my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I did not feel, however, that I had eaten of the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the contrary, the more I read, the more I became perplexed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Formerly I did not know what the Bible was all about.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After reading it with my mind, I gained knowledge but had no sense that I had received any supply within.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, after many years I still did not know the meaning of eating the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then one day I read where Paul tells Timothy, The Lord be with your spirit 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At first I did not understand what it was for the Lord to be with my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, I wondered how the Lord could be with my spirit since He is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second, I really did not understand what my spirit was.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I knew that in my body there was a stomach and intestines and that in my head there was a brain, but I did not know what my spirit was.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I really did not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Subsequently I read that the Lord had said, The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Again I did not understand how words could become spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then I read John chapter three where the Lord told Nicodemus, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nicodemus thought that to be born anew was to return to the mother s womb, so he said, How can a man be born when he is old?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He cannot enter a second time into his mother s womb and be born, can he?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord answered that to be born anew is to be born of water and of the Spirit because that which is born of the Spirit is spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more I read, the more I became puzzled.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Spirit entered into my spirit, I was regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then, where was my spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What was my spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After reading those verses, I was absolutely confused and without a clue as to what they referred to.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Mystery of the Divine Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After many years I gradually began to see the clear light and was able to thoroughly understand the revelation, realizing that God Himself is Spirit 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our God is triune; He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, the Father, Son, and Spirit are not three different Gods but one God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day this God became flesh and came to the earth as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was not just the Son who came, but the Son came with the Father and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, in incarnation, it was not just the Son who came, but the Father, Son, and Spirit all came together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Most Christians have the concept that when the Son came, He came alone, leaving the Father in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, the Gospel of John says clearly that the Son came with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>John tells us that while the Lord was on the earth for over thirty years, He was never lonely because the Father was always with Him 8:29; 16:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Not only so, John also says that the Son was in the Father and that the Father was in the Son 14:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Father s being with the Son is easy to understand and describe.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, when the Son went to Galilee, the Father went with Him; when the Son went to Jerusalem, the Father went with Him; and when the Son went to the cross, the Father was also there with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is very easy to describe.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, it is impossible to describe the Son s being in the Father and the Father s being in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The coinhering of the two is truly a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In John 14:8 Philip came forward and said, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The disciples had been with the Lord, beholding Him for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They had often heard Him speak about the Father yet had never seen Him reveal the Father to them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They thought that if the Lord would simply show them the Father, they would be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is similar to the way we believe into the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We also feel that if the Father were to come to us, we would definitely rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, the Lord was amazed by Philip s question, saying, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This statement indicates that the Son and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, when a person sees the Son, he sees the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Not only so, the Son is in the Father, and the Father is in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Following this, the Lord said, And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter v. 16 . Then He also said that the Comforter is the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father 15:26 . The word from in Greek has the sense of from with.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In other words, the Comforter does not come alone but comes with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Moreover, since the Father is in the Son, the Son also comes.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The result is that when the Spirit comes, the Father, Son, and Spirit all come.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Most Christians think that the Father is in the heavens and that when the Son resurrected and ascended, He also went to the heavens, sat down at the Father s right hand, and then sent the Spirit down upon the believers so that they could prophesy and speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, the Gospel of John clearly says that the Son is joined to the Father; that the Son sends the Spirit from the Father; that the Spirit does not come alone but comes from the Father and with the Father; and that since the Father is joined to the Son, the Spirit also comes with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When a sinner repents on earth and prays to the Lord, calling on His name, immediately the Spirit comes, bringing the Father with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is impossible to thoroughly explain such a mystery.</S>
