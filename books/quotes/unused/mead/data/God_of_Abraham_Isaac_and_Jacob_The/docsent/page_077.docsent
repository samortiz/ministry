   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE MATURITY OF JACOB Scripture Reading: Gen 37; 42 49</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Jacob was dealt with by God at Peniel, he began to recognize his own weakness and was gradually changed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He gradually saw the way he should take; he passed through Shechem to Bethel and finally dwelt in Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, this does not mean that Jacob needed no further dealings from God after Peniel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible shows us that after Peniel, he seemed to encounter even more dealings from God than before.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may say that Jacob was a suffering-ridden person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From Shechem to Bethel and from Bethel to Hebron, Jacob suffered many sorrows.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can take a look at the following examples.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Shechem Jacob met a very difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His daughter was defiled by Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the country.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jacob's sons then conspired to slay Shechem and all the males in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This matter greatly troubled Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us read Genesis 34:30: "And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jacob was very worried that Shechem's countrymen might rise up in revenge to destroy him and his entire house.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was the crisis that confronted Jacob in Shechem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In chapter thirty-five Jacob went to Bethel and encountered another incident.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Deborah Rebekah's nurse died" v. 8 . He could not see his mother, but if his mother's nurse was there, he would have been somewhat comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not expect that his mother's nurse would die also.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Scripture purposely records that "she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The meaning of Allon-bachuth in the original language is "the oak of weeping."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From this we have a glimpse of Jacob's sorrow and grief at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He journeyed from Bethel, and when he was close to Ephrath, he was met with an even more sorrowful event.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor...And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, for she died, that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The wife whom Jacob loved so much died on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The pillar that he set upon Rachel's grave told of his sad story.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Jacob was in Edar, he experienced another heartbreaking thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His son Reuben went to lay with Bilhah, Jacob's concubine v. 22 . This was another matter that caused Jacob to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After he passed through all these incidents, he arrived at Hebron where his father Isaac sojourned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here the Bible makes no mention of his mother Rebekah; perhaps his mother had already died.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was God's severe dealing with Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In his youth his mother had loved him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His mother had taught him how to steal the blessing that his brother Esau should have received.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But now the mother who had loved him so dearly was no longer around.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He truly experienced many sorrows.</S>
