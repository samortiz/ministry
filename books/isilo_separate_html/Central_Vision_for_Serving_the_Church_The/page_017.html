<h1 class="title">THE CENTRAL VISION FOR SERVING THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 1:19-21; 2:12-13, 16; 3:7-8, 12-15; 4:12-13</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING AND WALKING IN ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Triune God is the Spirit who lives in our spirit today, and we are one spirit with Him. Hence, we must live and walk by the Spirit in our spirit. Although this matter is quite mysterious, it is very simple; it is so simple that even an elementary-school student can understand it. Therefore, our problem is not related to hearing and understanding this matter but rather to not giving heed to this matter and practicing it. This is a thick veil to us.</p>
<p>We are veiled by thoughts of how to carry out the things that we have heard. I do not have a method of how to practice this, because the Bible does not give us methods. A baby knows how to cry and breathe as soon as he is born. A doctor, nurse, or mother does not need to present a method to the baby, saying, &ldquo;You have two lips, a throat, and lungs. You must learn to breathe and cry.&rdquo; As long as a baby is alive, he will breathe and cry; there is no need for instruction.</p>
<p>Since we have heard many messages concerning this mystery, we should simply live in the spirit. According to my observation, however, we are still living according to our natural habits. In our daily living we are not accustomed to living in the spirit, nor are we accustomed to living one with the Lord. The Lord is not merely outside of us in the heavens; He is in us so that we may live by Him. Since we confess that the Lord Jesus lives in us, we should not ignore Him in our daily living. Even when someone just visits us, we need to spend time with him and talk to him. Wives often seek a divorce because their husbands are away from home for long periods of time or because their husbands ignore them even when they are home. This is very hard on a wife. The best husband works eight hours a day to support his family and then immediately goes home to be with his wife. Such a husband lives by his wife. On the other hand, if a wife is not at home much of the time or ignores her husband, caring only for her life, the husband will have regrets. The best wife accompanies her husband and cares for his needs. When her husband is about to leave for work, for example, she prepares a lunch and walks with him to the door. She also greets him when he comes home. Such a couple will not have thoughts of divorce, because the husband and wife are one in their living and walk together.</p>
<p>We have given many messages on this mystery; we cannot say that we have not heard it or seen it. We have heard the messages, but we have not given heed to them. We are still focused on our own things. This is our condition. Many of the leading ones in the churches in the United States were seminary students, pastors, and preachers who came out of Christianity. They touched many denominations and sects before they began to meet with us. They did not turn easily, but once they turned, they turned absolutely. They dropped their old ways, abandoning them completely. Before taking this way, some had to confer with their family, but they did this according to the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Some had a wife who did not agree and who was reluctant to follow. Nevertheless, the brothers were peaceful within and determined to take this way. Now their wives know that this way is right, and they have inwardly turned in a full way. These couples no longer want anything from the past; they follow in an absolute way. When a message is released, they practice it immediately, and we quickly see fruit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR VEILS</h2>
<p>The situation in the Far East is not like this. We nod and take notes as we listen to the messages, but the messages do not remain in our being. Our prayers and meetings are old and routine because we have four thick veils that keep us from living by the Lord. The first veil is our disposition. Everyone has a particular disposition that causes many problems. The second veil is our culture. The Shanghainese and the Shandongnese each have their unique culture. The Chinese, Japanese, and Americans also have their particular culture. The third veil is the teaching that we received after our salvation. On the one hand, teachings help us, but on the other hand, teachings hurt us. For example, I studied English for almost sixty years, and my English teacher was a great help to me. Without his teaching, I would not know English. However, his Chinese accent has hurt my speaking. Even now, I speak with a similar accent. I have seventeen or eighteen grandchildren, and they all speak like native English speakers. My grandson can even correct my English. Similarly, it is very difficult for a person with the Foochow dialect to speak Mandarin. In regard to the teachings in Catholicism, we cannot say that they have not helped anyone, but this &ldquo;help&rdquo; has brought in much harm as well. This is true of the teachings in Protestantism and even of some of our former teachings. On the one hand, the teaching that we received after our salvation was positive, but we have also been hurt because we are unwilling to change and advance. The fourth veil is personal experience. If we do not pursue or love the Lord, we will not be veiled by our experience, because we will have no experience. However, as soon as we begin to love the Lord and pursue Him, our past experiences can become a present problem, even a veil. We all have these four veils; hence, it is difficult to receive the truth of this mystery.</p>
<p>Recently, when two brothers from a local church came to fellowship with me about their problems, I could tell from their conversation that they were not living in the spirit. One wanted to reason with me, and the other wanted to justify his actions. Those who live by the Lord do not reason or vindicate themselves; they simply live by the Lord. If we dwell on the past when we gather together, including on how we have been mistreated, we are not living in the spirit. We should live in the spirit. When we are in the spirit, we are the new man. The things of the past are the things of the old man, and there is no benefit from talking about them. We should not talk about things that occurred in the past. We should live by Christ, because the Lord is one with us. We can live and walk in Him. When we are about to speak, we should ask the Lord what He is speaking. If He has nothing to say, we should not speak. He is living in us today, and we can live one with Him.</p>
<p>When I fellowshipped with these two brothers, I knew that they had not received the content of the messages on living by Christ. One wanted to continue to reason, and the other wanted to justify himself. I said to the first brother, &ldquo;You may win the argument,&rdquo; and to the other I said, &ldquo;You may be justified.&rdquo; To both of them, however, I said, &ldquo;But even if all the angels in the universe were on your side and would vouch for you, it would mean nothing. Without the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, nothing that I say will matter, because you will still be in your reasonings and self-justification when you leave. You need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to see that you have not been living by Christ.&rdquo; I encouraged them to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I have been crucified and buried, and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. I do not want to consider things in the past in order to determine who is right or wrong. Whether or not others approve of me, I want only to live by You because You are in me. Thank You that there is no place for murmurings or reasonings because You are not murmuring and reasoning, and I am one with You.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not go dancing because it is wrong to go dancing but because I live by the Lord Jesus. He is not going, so neither am I. I do not lose my temper because it is wrong to lose one&rsquo;s temper but because I live by the Lord. He is my life, and I live by Him. I do not lose my temper because He does not lose His temper. Furthermore, I open my mouth in the meeting because the Lord Jesus is opening His mouth to pray and praise. Such a living is extremely simple. The Lord Jesus is not old or routine. We must drop our habits. Our disposition, culture, and past experiences have been buried; today the Lord Jesus is living in us. We live by Him and are one with Him. We do not need to consider whether we can overcome, whether we are right, or whether we can improve; none of this should be our concern. The Lord Jesus lives in us, and we live by Him. Furthermore, we do not need to focus on dealing with ourselves or on learning lessons related to being broken. We do not even need to understand what is of our spirit and what is of our soul. We do not need to worry about these things, we simply need to live by the Lord. Our problem is that we are carrying around too much &ldquo;baggage&rdquo; from the past, and the leading brothers are only looking for improved methods. We should forget about methods and simply live by the Lord.</p>
<p>I hope we will genuinely experience the Lord living in us. We should live by the Lord from the start of our day. We should do what the Lord is doing. When this is our focus, we can spontaneously pray and share in a meeting. We do not need to focus on whether we are loud or quiet. Such considerations are based on our natural man and our habits. Living in the spirit is very spontaneous. Actually, everything related to the human life is quite spontaneous, including breathing, drinking, and eating. We should not let our habits direct us. If we truly receive this word and live by it, we will have no desire to argue about anything, because Christ will be living in us.</p>
<p>We must live by the spirit. If a brother listens to a message but still goes home and argues with his wife, this is a proof that he did not hear the message. If he truly heard, he would not argue. However, it would not be he who is not arguing, it would be Christ, the One living in him, who is not arguing. Satan is very clever; he wants to keep us from living by Christ and instead living by ourselves. First John 5:21 speaks of guarding ourselves from idols. The word <em>idols</em> refers to everything that replaces the true God, including our disposition, culture, doctrines, and past experiences. Everything that replaces the Lord is an idol. The leading in the past few years in the churches has been on the line of living by Christ. The co-workers and responsible brothers may have seen a little, but they still want to try new tricks. Consequently, the churches have missed this leading on the central line.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
