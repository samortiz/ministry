Around A.D. 700, Christianity spread to China from Persia where it was called Nestorianism. Today there is still a Nestorian tablet with an inscription on it that contains the expression ching-feng, which literally means &#8220;pure wind,&#8221; referring to the Holy Spirit. The Persians knew that pneuma, the Greek word for spirit, could also be rendered as wind, so, due to their inadequate knowledge of the Chinese language, they translated it as such. John 3:8 says, &#8220;The wind blows where it wills,&#8221; showing that the Lord also referred to the Holy Spirit as &#8220;wind.&#8221; As a result, the Persians called the Holy Spirit the wind. Today people obtain the &#8220;extract&#8221; of different substances to use as medication or for nourishment. It is wonderful that in English, &#8220;extract&#8221; can also be called &#8220;spirit.&#8221; For example, in English, strong alcoholic liquor produced by distillation can be called &#8220;spirits.&#8221;<p>Our God is so great, so mysterious, so wonderful, and so &#8220;extractive,&#8221; so He had to use a word that is comprehensible to us. Thus, He says that He is Spirit (John 4:24). God as the Spirit today is not the same as the Spirit two thousand years ago. Two thousand years ago, God-who is Spirit-was not yet processed, but today after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, God as the Spirit has already passed through four major steps-incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. Two thousand years ago He had not entered into this process. He only objectively passed through creation. Then over nineteen hundred years ago He Himself became flesh, lived the human life, was crucified, and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). God became flesh, was born as a man, and walked on the earth. His name was Jesus; hence, Jesus was God. When He was put to death on the cross, He was still God. When He was buried and resurrected, He was still God. Today, such a One is the life-giving Spirit.<p>The Spirit is the &#8220;wind&#8221; in John 3, but in chapter twenty He is referred to as &#8220;breath&#8221; (v. 22). In the evening on the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, He breathed the Holy Spirit as the holy breath into the disciples. This is an exceedingly mysterious matter, which has been missed by Christianity. Christianity calls the Holy Spirit the &#8220;Holy Ghost,&#8221; considering Him something objective and vague rather than as a definite person. However, the Bible reveals to us that the Spirit is definite and substantial like &#8220;wind&#8221; and &#8220;breath.&#8221; This Spirit is the mysterious God.<p>This mysterious God has been consummated as the Spirit, and this Spirit is just His &#8220;extract.&#8221; Today physicians heal their patients by giving them medicines. Every pill is an &#8220;extract,&#8221; a substance obtained through a refining process. There may be seven or eight elements blended together in one pill: some for killing germs, some for nutrition, and some for strengthening the immune system. Similarly, the One who is mingled with our spirit is the &#8220;extract&#8221; of God, the &#8220;distillation&#8221; of God. This One includes everything, so He is called the all-inclusive Spirit. In this Spirit there is divinity, humanity, the experience of human living, the element of crucifixion, and also the element of resurrection. The subject of Romans 8:4, where it speaks of &#8220;the spirit,&#8221; is the all-inclusive Spirit coming to mingle with our spirit to be the mingled spirit. This is really a mystery.<p>What does it mean to be saved? To be saved means that a person repents, confesses his sins, and receives the Lord Jesus, with the result that the &#8220;extract&#8221; of God enters into him to regenerate him. Once he is regenerated, he has God&#8217;s life and God&#8217;s nature, as well as God&#8217;s element, that is, God Himself. This God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The entire God, the complete God, enters into man. Henceforth, man should live and walk according to this Spirit. This is why in the Epistles Paul said that we should live, walk, and have our being according to the Spirit. When we walk according to the Spirit, we are victorious, spiritual, and sanctified. When we walk according to the Spirit, we live Christ and express God. When we walk according to the Spirit, we have life, light, holiness, love, and righteousness. When we walk according to the Spirit, we have everything, that is, all positive things. All human virtues and divine characteristics are in this One and are this One. The Spirit is holiness, righteousness, love, life, and light. The Spirit is all-inclusive.<p>We may not have that many spiritual experiences because we may not have gotten saved very long ago, but I believe that we all have some experiences. Whenever we walk according to the Spirit, there is light within. Whenever we do not live according to the Spirit, especially when we lose our temper and are altogether not in our spirit, we are confused and even become &#8220;muddle-headed.&#8221; For example, when a couple is quarreling, both the husband and the wife may become so furious that they begin to throw dishes and hit their children, creating chaos. At this point they really are muddle-headed and totally in darkness. However, whenever we are according to the Spirit, everything is clear to us. Let us use another example: during our service coordination two people may have an argument. They argue about who is right and who is wrong, and the more they reason, the more they justify themselves. Even after the argument, they are still very angry, thinking that even if they are wrong, they should still be excused and forgiven. But when they calm down and turn to their spirit, each one of them will be clear that it is his own fault. This principle is the same concerning whether we should serve the Lord full-time or have a regular job. The more we analyze, the more confused we are. Once we are according to the Spirit, however, we are crystal clear within.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Economy of God and the Mystery of the Transmission of the Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 49</div><br></body></html>
