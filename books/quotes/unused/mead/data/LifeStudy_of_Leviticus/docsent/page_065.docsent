   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. LAYING HANDS ON THE HEAD OF THE OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The one who offered the peace offering was to lay his hand on the head of the offering 3:2, 8, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This signifies the union of the offerer with the offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead of the word "union," perhaps we should use the word "identification."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through the laying on of hands, the offerer is identified with the offering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning this, we should be careful about saying that Christ replaces us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our relationship with Christ is not a matter of replacement; it is a matter of identification.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is even more than union.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus the word union cannot fully convey the truth regarding our fellowship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our fellowship with Christ is a matter of identification, a matter of us becoming Him and of Him becoming us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We and Christ are one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We become Him and He becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should therefore change our concept concerning replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be replaced by Christ means that we are removed altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our relationship with Christ is a matter not of replacement but of being one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>SLAUGHTERED AT THE DOOR OF THE TENT OF MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The peace offering was slaughtered at the door of the tent of meeting vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2, 8, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This signifies that Christ was slain on the earth and before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today we may enjoy Christ here on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not wait to go to heaven to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Enjoy Christ on earth, right where you are today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is a proverb which says that distant water cannot quench our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If Christ were only in heaven, He would not have anything to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today we are enjoying Christ on earth, in the very place where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE BLOOD DASHED ON THE ALTAR ALL AROUND</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The blood of the peace offering was dashed on the altar all around vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2, 8, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that the blood is for peace in the offerer's conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This blood was not brought into the Holy of Holies to appease God; it was dashed around the altar where the offerer was standing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This shows us that the blood of the peace offering gives us peace and assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we see the blood of the peace offering, we have the assurance that our sins have been washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The blood of the offering was shed for our sake, and it is now before our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we can say, "Thank You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>My sins have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I know this because I see Your blood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The blood is the evidence that God has forgiven my sins."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>ALL THE FAT THAT COVERS THE INWARDS, THE TWO KIDNEYS AND THE FAT ON THEM, THE APPENDAGE ON THE LIVER, AND THE ENTIRE FAT TAIL TO BE BURNED ON THE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the fat that covered the inwards, the two kidneys and the fat on them, the appendage on the liver, and the entire fat tail were to be burned on the altar vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>3-5, 9-11, 14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This signifies that God should be the first enjoyer, enjoying the first, the best part, of the offering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The best part of the peace offering is God's portion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>AS FOOD OF THE OFFERING BY FIRE</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"The priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar; it is the food of the offering by fire for a satisfying fragrance" v. 16 . This signifies that the peace offering is a kind of burnt offering 1:9, 13, 17 as food to God for His satisfaction and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>X. THE BREAST AND THE RIGHT THIGH OF THE OFFERING FOR THE PRIESTS</S>
