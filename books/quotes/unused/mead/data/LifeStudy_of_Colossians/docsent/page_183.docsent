   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN HEAVEN OR ON EARTH?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to ask ourselves, then, whether we are in heaven or on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In answering this question we need to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The proper way to answer is to say that when we are in spirit we are also in heaven, but when we are not in spirit we are on earth and, experientially, even under the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to our experience, we know that in spirit we may be in heaven one minute and then, because we do not remain in our spirit, we may immediately plunge down to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, during your time with the Lord in the morning, you may be in the heavenlies, having prayed yourself into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But at the breakfast table your wife or husband may say something to bother you, and immediately you are drawn out of the spirit into the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No longer are you in heaven; you are now on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that only when we are in spirit are we in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever we are outside the spirit, we are earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 3:1 Paul charges us to seek the things which are above.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The way to seek these things is to turn to the spirit and call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our experience tells us clearly that we touch the heavens by turning to our spirit, for our spirit is the receiving end of the divine transmission, whereas the throne of God in heaven is the transmitting end. Thus, by turning to our spirit, we are lifted into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then in our experience we are in Christ, in the Father, and in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then in the spirit we are one in position with Christ, seeking the things which are above.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>ONE LIFE WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 3:3 and 4 Paul twice speaks of life, indicating thereby that we have one life with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 3 he says that our life has been hidden with Christ in God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 4 he goes on to speak of when Christ our life is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To understand what kind of life this is, we need to first read the verses, then check with our experience, and also compare these verses with others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to our experience and according to the Word, life here is Christ s life becoming our life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If it were merely Christ s life, it could not be called our life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The very fact that it is our life indicates that it refers to something which has become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the life here is not our natural life, the life inherited from Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such a life could never be that which is hidden with Christ in God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God would never allow the natural life inherited from Adam to be hidden in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The only life that can be hidden with Christ in God is the divine life, the very life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is this life which has become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul s use of the expression our life indicates that we and Christ, and also God Himself, have one life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not think that God has one life, that Christ has another life, and that we who believe in Christ have yet another life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, God, Christ, and the believers have one life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The life of God is the life of Christ, and the life of Christ has become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can declare that we have the very life Christ has, the life hidden within God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What a wonderful life this is!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is very easy for us to understand the matter of the Christian life in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We see a sister who is gentle, quiet, and kind, and we think that because she has such characteristics she is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Seeing a brother who is an eloquent and powerful speaker, we may take his power and eloquence as signs of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, in both cases what we see may be the natural life, not the life that Christ has, the life hidden with Christ in God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THREE CHARACTERISTICS OF CHRIST S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps you are wondering how to discern between the natural life and the life Christ has, the life hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, Christ s life is a crucified life; second, it is a resurrected life; and third, it is a life hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These three characteristics distinguish the life Christ has from our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A Crucified Life</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A certain sister may be nice, gentle, and kind; however, all this may be in the natural life, a life that has not been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is proved by the fact that when she is insulted or mistreated, she breaks down and cries.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Her tears indicate that she is living in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Her life is not a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He always lived a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although He was severely criticized and insulted, He did not weep for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead, He could say, Father, I thank You that this is according to Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His life was a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Referring to the example of the eloquent brother, we see that such a brother may also be in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He may exhibit his eloquence according to the natural life, a life that has not been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a person is truly one in life with Christ, his life will be a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The life we have received of the Lord Jesus is not a raw, unprocessed life; it is a crucified life, a life that has been processed and thoroughly dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we truly know this life, we shall not weep when we are insulted.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, we shall thank the Lord and even praise Him in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sometimes when we are in the flesh and others insult us, we may say Amen or Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, our Amen and Hallelujah! is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we are truly living a crucified life when others insult us, we shall not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who are on the cross say neither Amen nor Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They do not say anything at all.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The life we should live today should be such a crucified life.</S>
