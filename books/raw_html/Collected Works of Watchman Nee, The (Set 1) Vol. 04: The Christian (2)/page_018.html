<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Eleven</H2><P>Verse 11: "Saying, What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."</P><P>This was the word which the voice like a trumpet said to the apostle. Here John was charged to send letters to the seven churches in Asia. Some may ask: "Why was there no letter written to the Judean church in Jerusalem?" At this time (approximately A.D. 95 to 96) Jerusalem had already been destroyed. Perhaps the church there was also dispersed. This might have been one reason. However, why was it that only seven churches were addressed? Other than these seven churches, there were still in Asia the church in Colosse and other churches. Seven is the number for dispensational completion. God chose these seven churches as representatives of the church from the time of the apostles to the end of the age. Seven does not refer to the content of the church, for the church was far from perfection. Seven represents the entire church. There were only seven churches because when God tested the church, she also failed, as did the Jews. The church on earth is merely God's temporal plan. Usually, seven is divided into four and threeâ€”four coming first, and then three following. However, in these seven epistles three came first and four followed. In all seven epistles there were God's promises and callings. In the first three epistles, first there were the callings, then the promises. In the last four epistles the order is reversed. I believe there is the mind of God in such arrangement. This shows the degradation of the church: at the beginning there was still God's grace and glory, but in the end she is filled with earthly things.</P><P>These seven churches were actual churches in those days. If the Lord Jesus were to have come at that time, what was written in the seven epistles would have been fulfilled in those churches. However, the Lord delayed, and the Holy Spirit took these seven churches as representatives of all the churches since the time of the apostles. We should take note of one thing: the seven epistles in chapters two and three were sent by the Lord Himself through John to the seven churches. They were not made known to John by the "angel." The things made known through the angel were those that must swiftly take place within a short time. These seven epistles were not made known by the angel. Rather, they were sent directly by the Lord. Hence, they were not fulfilled immediately. The fulfillment of them requires some time. Therefore, these seven epistles represent things related to all the churches after the apostolic age. These churches rose up one after another throughout the generations. We should realize that the condition of these seven churches has a double significance. First, they depict the real condition of the various churches at the time. Second, they represent the condition of the outward church in the various ages. Because we are living at the end of the church age, we tend to emphasize the representation of the condition of the outward church throughout the ages and neglect the fact that they also depict the real condition of the churches at that time. It is this bias that blocks us from the understanding of the dispensational change God has regarding the church. If we want to understand the present position of the church, that is, the position since the completion of the book of Revelation, we have to pay attention to the real condition of the churches at that time.</P><P>These seven epistles, recorded in chapters two and three, are truly different from the other Epistles of the New Testament. They do not seem to have the closeness and intimacy that characterize the Lord's letters through Paul or John. In these seven epistles, the Lord Jesus was standing in the position of the judge, speaking words of judgment and doing a judging work. He was not the Savior and Head as described in the Epistles of Paul and John. Here He was the magistrate of the church, the judging One. If we see this, we will realize that between the churches represented in the book of Revelation and those represented in Paul's Epistles there was a change, a change in the plan of God's dispensation. It is because of the ignorance, or negligence, of this dispensational change in the church that many denominations proclaim themselves to be the unique church.</P><P>Let us now consider a little the history of the church in the Bible. At the beginning God gave His kingdom to the Jews, but the Jews rejected it again and again until they killed God's beloved Son (Matt. 21:38-39). Because of this, God took the kingdom away from them and gave it to the people that would bear fruit, the Gentiles. After Pentecost God raised up Paul to preach the kingdom of God to the Gentiles. The olive branches were broken off (Rom. 11) because of their unbelief. They were broken off for the purpose that we, the Gentiles, the wild olive branches, may be grafted in to partake of the root of the fatness of the olive tree. The Gentiles are able to stand because of their faith. Because God wanted to grace the Gentiles, He revealed to Paul the mystery "which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men." This mystery says "that in Christ Jesus the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the Body and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel" (Eph. 3:1-10). After this, however, the Gentiles, who made up the church, failed just as the Jews did. We can take a look at the testimony of the apostles.</P>
