<h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM SWATOW, KWANGTUNG PROVINCE</h2><p>To my elder brother Watchman:</p><p>After arriving in Swatow, I looked back on the past few days. There was a great struggle and wrestling in my heart. I am such a failure. I am so weak and faithless. I have told many people to trust in the Lord, but I myself did not! I am really abominable! After meeting and speaking with you twice, I will never forget the lessons I learned. When Brother Chung Chieh and I arrived in the port of Swatow, we did not do many things, but we first bowed down before the Lord with the brothers and sisters to learn to rely on the Lord. We were just as a serving maid relying on her mistress. May the Lord edify us through the work.</p><p>Brother Chung Chieh is really a dear brother. Before now I did not realize how dear he was. He has learned more before the Lord than I have. There are many areas in which I cannot catch up with him. He and I are more and more in one accord. The innocent spiritual condition of the brothers and sisters here makes me not want to go home. Peace! Brother Chung Chieh greets you.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Kuang Hsiung<br />November 20</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM HANGCHOW</h2><p>Greetings to Brother Watchman:</p><p>Brother Sun Shao Shan returned to Hangchow. He informed me that you wanted me to quickly prepare for the trip to the south and inquired about Brother Chen Fang's recent condition. I should have given you a timely answer, but there was nothing moving in me, and I had not yet prayed about the matter. In addition, I had a fever; therefore, I have delayed until now in replying to you.</p><p>I have already received an answer before God concerning the trip south: "Hear Him." But I do not think it will be easy for me to leave in the next few days because there will be a baptism meeting in Hangchow on the twenty-fifth. Therefore, the earliest I can come to you is after the twenty-sixth. What do you think?</p><p>Brother Chen Fang has completely left the denominations and found a house in Hu Shu new port. He is in the middle of preparing to move! The house has four big rooms. Brother Chen will live in one of them, Brother T'au Ch'un Yen will live in another, two brothers who are in business have rented another, and the assembly has rented the fourth. They are preparing to begin with a prayer meeting there. They will still crowd into Tung Chieh Road for the table meeting. If possible they will preach the gospel to outsiders from there every Lord's Day morning. But they must put everything in the Lord's hands.</p><p>We are very confident about Brother Chen's future because he is very clear that the way he is going is God's will. He is also clear that God the Father is leading him to come out and walk this way.</p><p>Brother Yu Hsiung Fei sent a letter from Chu Chi a few days ago and said that God has raised up two brothers who obey God in Chu Chi. They are now with him in one accord and have begun to meet to pray and wait for God's will through the prayer.</p><p>The elderly brother, T'ien P'ing Fang, sent a letter from Tientsin recently reminding us to remember the work in Manchuria.</p><p>Brothers Chin, Chen, and Ts'ai of P'ing Yang and Brother Hung Lu Ch'un of Tai Shun have sent letters saying that they were protected by the Lord; they have arrived home safely.</p><p>Sister Wang arrived safely on the express train in Hangchow last night. My fever has become better in the last few days. Chih Hsien and the brothers and sisters in the meeting are all healthy. Please don't worry about us! Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Philip Luan<br />November 21, 1934</p>
