Back to the Unique and Pure Ground of the Oneness of the Body of Christ with Its Truths concerning:</h2><h2 class=head4>a. The New Testament Faith and God&#8217;s Economy</h2><p>[In 1 Timothy 1:3 and 4 Paul says, &#8220;Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently, nor to occupy themselves with myths and unending genealogies, which give occasion for questionings rather than God&#8217;s dispensation which is in faith.&#8217;&#8217; The Greek words translated &#8220;God&#8217;s dispensation&#8217;&#8217; may also be rendered &#8220;God&#8217;s household economy&#8217;&#8217; (Eph. 1:10; 3:9). This is God&#8217;s household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people, that He may have a house, a household, to express Himself, which household is the church, the Body of Christ (1 Tim. 3:15). The apostle&#8217;s ministry was centered upon this economy of God (Col. 1:25; 1 Cor. 9:17), whereas the differing teachings of the dissenting ones were used by God&#8217;s enemy to distract His people from this.]<p>[In 1 Timothy 1:4 Paul tells us that God&#8217;s dispensation is in faith. The dispensing of the processed Triune God into us is altogether by faith. The dispensation of God is a matter in faith, that is, in the sphere and element of faith, in God through Christ. God&#8217;s economy to dispense Himself into His chosen people is not in the natural realm, nor in the realm of the law, but in the spiritual sphere of the new creation through regeneration by faith in Christ (Gal. 3:23-26). By faith we are born of God to be His sons, partaking of His life and nature to express Him. By faith we are put into Christ to become the members of His Body, sharing all that He is for His expression. This is God&#8217;s dispensation according to His New Testament economy, carried out in faith.] We need to be recovered back to this item.<h2 class=head4>b. The Person and Work of Christ</h2><p>[Concerning the person and work of Christ, we must preach that Christ is God incarnated to be a God-man, that He is both divine and human. We must also preach His redemptive death. In His redemptive work He died on the cross for our sins and for us sinners. Then He was resurrected so that He could impart Himself into us as the divine life. Therefore, the gospel we preach is that Christ, the God-man, died for our sins and was resurrected.] He is the complete God and the perfect and genuine man. He alone is qualified to be our Savior. The matter of His person and work is covered in the second year of summer school of the truth.<h2 class=head4>c. The Person and the Dispensing of the Triune God</h2><p>[The recovery of the church also requires that we be recovered to the truth concerning the person and the dispensing of the Triune God. This matter of God&#8217;s dispensing is something that is altogether missed by many Christians today. By the Lord&#8217;s mercy we have been enlightened to see that in the New Testament economy of God there is the divine, triune Person for the dispensing of Himself into His chosen people to be their life, life supply, and everything. Because this has been neglected by many today, we need to be recovered to the proper understanding and apprehension of the divine dispensing of the riches of the processed Triune God into our being.]<p>[God&#8217;s New Testament economy is His plan to dispense Himself into His chosen people in His trinity. This dispensing has three steps. First, it is of God the Father, who is the source, the origin. Second, this dispensing is through God the Son, who is the course. Third, God&#8217;s dispensing is in God the Spirit, who is the instrument and sphere. Through these steps of God the Father, through God the Son, and in God the Spirit the processed Triune God dispenses Himself into His chosen people.]<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 5: The Church-The Vision and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 60</div><br></body></html>
