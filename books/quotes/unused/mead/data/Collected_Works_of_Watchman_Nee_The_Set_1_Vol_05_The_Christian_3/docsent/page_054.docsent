   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"And he shall by no means go out anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although for Christ's sake we are standing outside the strong and orderly crowd today, in that day, we will forever be pillars in the temple of God and will go no more out.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although the world can chase us out of the synagogue of Satan, which can mean both physically as well as spiritually driven, in the future God will put us in His temple forever.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the pillars of the earthly temple of old were first stripped of their outward gold by the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They were then removed from their foundations and were then smashed to pieces and taken to Babylon 2 Kings 18:16; 25:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the Lord said that the pillars in the future temple will not suffer this anymore; they will remain there forever and will not go out anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's reward to us in the future has no revocation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our present sure work will gain us the future sure reward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we "hold fast," God will cause us to not "go out anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The nature of our reward in the future depends on the nature of our work today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How solemn this is!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"He shall by no means go out anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today one can go out again because there are many who will not "hold fast."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If believers would turn and would hold fast to the end, they will "by no means go out anymore"!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is worth noticing that here the Lord does not speak of the throne, but the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We would usually think that reward is related to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Indeed, this is what the next letter tells us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But why does the Lord speak of the temple here?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The throne is a symbol of power, but the temple symbolizes something else.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The temple is the place of worship; there God is exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Philadelphian believers seem to understand the matter of worship more than any others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, the Lord gives to them this special place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have seen that no other church desires the Lord's nature, person, and virtues as much as she does.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the prerequisite to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is what attracts our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Worship is not just a matter of thanking God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Cravings, love, exaltation, marveling, and enjoyment are all integral parts of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Worship is not just gratitude for the grace given by God; it is gratitude for the God who gives grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Worship is often related to God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Worship is not singing hymns, praying, or giving thanks, although these may be expressions of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Worship is an attitude of honest exaltation of God in spirit for His being God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the accomplishment of the Lord's blood and His leading in drawing us to God often initiate us to the way of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Quite often there are engravings on pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are for the commemoration of accomplishments and the spreading of fame.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this same reason Christ is engraving three names on the pillars of the temple of His God:</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>1 "The name of My God."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Lord Jesus came, He revealed to us the name of God: "the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since the saints have not rejected the Lord's name, He is now writing upon them the name of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The God whom they love and serve will forever become a mark on them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As the high priest of old bore the mark of "holiness to the Lord," in the future the overcoming saints will also bear a mark.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the future, the name of God will be upon the believers and will be manifested before everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although the Lord Jesus is speaking here to His own servants, He never forgets His own position as a Servant of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, He calls their God His God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is especially wonderful because He is speaking here in the qualification of the Son of David inheriting the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Antichrist will come in his own name and will blaspheme the true God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus, however, respectfully acknowledges the name of His Father and considers Himself as merely His servant.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Still, God appoints Him king.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>2 "The name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Portions like this should be interpreted literally.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In chapter twenty-one we shall see that in the future God will actually bring down a real New Jerusalem from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our city is like Christ, one that is hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the millennium, it will be manifested in full glory and beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The New Jerusalem is an actual city.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, it does not refer to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The overcomers will have the Lord writing the name of this famous city upon them; one will be able to read from these believers the glory and beauty of this city.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since they are sojourners and pilgrims on earth today, they will taste of the eternal home in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the proper resting place for the heart of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, the glorious practice in the future must first be manifested in the present shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is why the Bible says that we have come to the heavenly Jerusalem already Heb 12:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To have this, we must forever turn our back toward the corrupted Babylon and face Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>3 "My new name."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this book there are many new things: the New Jerusalem, the new heaven, and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Everything is made new.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord's new name is related to these new things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord's name here is new.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not just the former old name of Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He will receive a better title than "the Son of David."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the victorious cities in the old days, there were many memorial poles, which were actually pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On them were engraved the names of the victors.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Here we see that the name of the God who has sent the overcomers out to war, the name of the city for which they go to war, and the name of the Commander of their war are engraved on the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Here we also see the place the overcomers will be brought to in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>During the trial, the old Jerusalem will become the headquarters of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Its temple will be occupied by Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But the heavenly city and the temple will be beyond the touch of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>That will be the place where the overcomers will go.</S>
