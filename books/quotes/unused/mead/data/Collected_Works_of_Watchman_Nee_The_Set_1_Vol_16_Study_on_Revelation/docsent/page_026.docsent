   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 7:14a</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"And I said to him, My lord, you know.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And he said to me, These are those who come out of the great tribulation."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The "great tribulation" in 7:14 is not the three and a half years of great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reasons are as follows:</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1 The great tribulation, at the earliest, should begin with the trumpets of woes, and the first woe is declared at the fifth trumpet 8:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Strictly speaking, the great tribulation begins with the seventh trumpet 11:15-18 , but Revelation 7:9 implies a first rapture before the seventh seal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These have already come before the throne and have not passed through the tribulation of the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2 The great tribulation cannot begin before Satan is cast down to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verses 9 through 17 are before the opening of the seventh seal, while Satan's being cast down is after the sounding of the sixth trumpet 11:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before the context of the forty-two months 13:5 , the man-child has already been raptured to the throne 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although I dare not say the man-child includes all those in mentioned 7:9, I do say that it must be a majority of these people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>3 The conclusion of the great tribulation is at the pouring out of the seventh bowl, which immediately ushers in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At this time we do not see the heavenly temple, only the earthly temple as spoken of in Ezekiel the temple on earth in the kingdom age .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During the great tribulation there is no time for God's people to serve Him, but Revelation 7:15 clearly says that they serve God day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>4 In the great tribulation, there cannot be so many people receiving salvation, yet the "great multitude" in 7:9 has come out of the great tribulation according to 7:14.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This shows the great tribulation in 7:14 must be different from the great tribulation that comes after the fifth trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>5 Revelation 11:1 makes mention of those worshipping in the heavenly temple, yet except for those in Revelation 7:9, there are none who worship God in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At this time, the great tribulation spoken of in Revelation has not yet begun, yet these have passed through the great tribulation already.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no temple in the new heaven and new earth 21:22 , for God and the Lamb are the temple to the new city.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The center of the new city is God and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Revelation 3:12, following the words "temple of My God" is the expression "he shall by no means go out anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This no doubt refers to the time of the new heaven and the new earth when God and the Lamb will be the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>6 The Bible clearly says that there are Christians who need not pass through the tribulation Rev 3:10; Luke 21:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>7 If the people spoken of in Revelation 7:9 are those who pass through the great tribulation, then they must be those who die when the nations trample the holy temple.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But according to Revelation 11:2, the church should not be included there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How then could the people in 7:9 be those who come out of the three and a half years of great tribulation?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>8 The three and a half years of great tribulation are especially related to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Daniel 12:1 says, "And there will be a time of distress, such as never occurred since there came to be a nation until that time; and at that time your people, every one found written in the book, will be delivered."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This passage together with Matthew 24:16-18 describes the condition of the Jews in particular.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's main goal in having the great tribulation is to deal with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Jeremiah 30:7 the time of Jacob's trouble clearly refers to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The tribulation spoken of in Revelation in several passages points to the church e.g., 1:9; 2:9-10, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 16:33 also says that affliction is the portion of the church in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The time is long, and the suffering is hard.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That is why it is called "great."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But it is not the three and a half years of the "great tribulation."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The "great tribulation" in Revelation 2:22 is different from that in 7:14 in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is also different from the great tribulation of the three and a half years elsewhere mentioned in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Acts 14:22 the phrase "through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God" refers to the experiences of the ones who are entering into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Revelation 7:14b</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"And they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The word "robes" here is plural.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Robes, plural, signify righteousnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But here the righteousness is the righteousness of the saints themselves; it does not refer to the Lord Jesus Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Robe, singular, refers to the righteousness Isa 61:10 which is Christ Himself Jer 23:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ is our righteousness 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We put Him on to come before God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This righteousness does not need to be washed in the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have two robes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One robe, through which we come before God, was put on at salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The other robe is the righteousness of our own conduct; it is our victory through which we come before Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Revelation 3:18 the white garment the second one requires the paying of a price, but the redemption typified in the former case does not need to be purchased.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No Christian will be condemned by God to perdition John 5:24 , but neither will there be a single Christian who will not be judged before the judgment seat of Christ concerning his conduct 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Their robes were cleansed not because of the great tribulation, but because of the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They applied the blood of the Lamb to their robes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This shows that they were contaminated on earth; nevertheless, they practiced 1 John 1:9 all the time so that they were cleansed.</S>
