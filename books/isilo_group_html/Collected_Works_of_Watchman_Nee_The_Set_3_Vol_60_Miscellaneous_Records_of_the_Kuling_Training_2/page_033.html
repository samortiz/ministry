To an ordinary man, sinning is one thing and transgressing against God is another. But for a Christian, sinning and transgressing against God are the same thing. When we sin against a brother, we are transgressing against God. Unbelievers usually think that sinning has nothing to do with transgressing against God. The Bible shows us that David committed the sin of adultery and murder, but he realized that he had transgressed against God Himself. He considered himself not only to have sinned but to have transgressed against God (Psa. 51:4). If a man only has the sense of sin without a realization that he is transgressing against God, he is not qualified to be called a Christian. The Lord is above everything; every authority and human relationship is derived from Him. If I sin against another person, I am sinning against God. Suppose I have ten dogs and ten sheep, and the dogs bite the sheep and kill them. These dogs have not only sinned against the sheep but also against me. Those who do not know God only consider sin to be sin; they do not know that it is a transgression against God. Many Christians are only aware of sin; they are not aware of their transgression against God. These Christians have a problem with their salvation experience. The Chinese do not have much realization of this fact. For this reason, we have to ask God to do a deeper work. When a sinner has a deep consciousness of sin, he realizes that sin is not only sin but a transgression against God. In preaching the gospel, we have to bring the listeners to realize that they have not only sinned but that they also have transgressed against God through their sins. This is a crucial factor in our preaching.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning Offense against God Himself</h2><p>When a man sins, he has not only transgressed God's law but has offended God Himself. The last point tells us that in sinning a man transgresses against God's law and ordinance. Here we are saying that when a man sins, he offends God Himself; he has offended God's heart. The last point deals with transgression against the outward righteous law of God. This point deals with offense against the inward heart of God. Luke 15 says that the prodigal was sinning in a far country. When he came to himself, he did not just say that he had sinned. He wanted to turn back to his father and tell him that he had sinned against heaven as well as before him (v. 18). Sinning against him means offending his father and breaking his heart. He had rejected his father's love, protection, and tears. The previous point deals with transgression against God's law, administration, and ordination. This point deals with offenses against God Himself, His love, His protection, and His grace. The greatest sin is for man to turn away from God.</p><p>The story of the prodigal son is one of the best stories in the Bible. It has saved many people. The prodigal did not say how many sins he had committed. He only intended to tell his father that he had sinned before him. The prodigal did not become prodigal through his sins. The day that he left his father he became a prodigal son. "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son..." (John 3:16). It seems as if God loves the world more than He loves His only begotten Son. As far as love is concerned, God is the father of the whole world. It appears that God's relationship with the world exceeds His relationship with His own Son. Does not the world break the heavenly Father's heart when it sins? Some people think that God is reluctant to save men and wants sinners to die and perish. Such ones offend God's love; they commit the greatest of all sins. This is a misunderstanding of God's heart. There was once an old widow who was childless. She intended to give all her wealth to her nephew. The nephew did not know about this. He coveted her wealth and killed her. When he saw her will and discovered that all her possessions had been willed to him, he became very remorseful. He had not only committed murder but had murdered the one who loved him. This is the greatest of all sins. For a man to reject the Savior is the greatest sin in the eyes of God because this amounts to a denial of His love. God loves the world. This is the reason He gave His only begotten Son to us. If we do not accept Him, we  reject God's provision and love. This constitutes the greatest sin.</p><h2 class="head1">APPLICATION</h2><p>In preaching the gospel we just need to choose one of the ten preceding subjects. This will be sufficient to bring a sinner to the Lord and to get him saved. However, if we use any one of the first eight subjects, we have to supplement it with the ninth or tenth point. This will bring about a complete salvation. In other words, no matter which way a sinner takes, he has to see that he has transgressed against God's law and has offended God Himself. The Holy Spirit operates in some people immediately after they are touched and shows them that they have offended God. If the Holy Spirit has not yet done this work, we should speak to them until they have this realization. We should show them that they have offended God. Otherwise, sooner or later they will have problems with their own salvation.</p><p>The work of an evangelist is to create a sense of these ten needs in man and then to show him the way of salvation. If we learn our lessons well, we will bring many to salvation.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 60: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (2) &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
