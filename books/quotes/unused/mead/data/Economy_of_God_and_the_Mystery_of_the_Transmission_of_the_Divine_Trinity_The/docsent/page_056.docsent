   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Practice of Changing the System</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To fulfill such a plan, first we have to build up the home meetings, and second we have to teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As for the practical carrying out of the increase and propagation, we have to labor in the community.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The present situation of the city of Taipei with its community system is truly unprecedented.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Throughout several thousand years of the history of the Chinese nation, we have never had this kind of community.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is really "the community of the new age."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One community consists of a number of high-rise buildings, with around one to two hundred households in each building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When all these people gather together, the number could be said to be more than a town or a village.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is also extremely easy for us to enter in and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Moreover, according to our observation of the present situation, all the important and high-class citizens are concentrated in the big cities, especially in the communities.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So we absolutely should not overlook the propagation in the communities; rather, we must aggressively work on this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Move for Gospelizing Each Town and Village</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, like casting nets, we have to spread the gospel to every town and village.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At present there are three hundred eighteen towns in Taiwan, each of which must have a gospel station, that is, a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to ask the Lord to increase our burden for this matter and take this as the goal of our prayer, that there would be a local church in each of these three hundred eighteen towns.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Beginning in 1988 we will proceed with our move of propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the Lord would raise up one thousand full-timers, we would be able to evangelize all the towns within half a year.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The work for the evangelization of Taiwan will require three years of preparation 1984-87 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus far, it has already been going on for one and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The primary thing that we must do is to call out one thousand people and to train and equip them like soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After three years, in January 1988, when everyone is properly equipped, we will set out on a large scale.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe that such an amount of time should be adequate for preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The way of our propagation will be to divide the one thousand people into small teams.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Each team will consist of ten people, and there will be a total of one hundred teams.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the Lord blesses us financially, we will prepare gospel vans.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If our financial support is inadequate, we will at least prepare a few.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In places where the transportation is more convenient, we can do without one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the time comes, these one hundred teams will set out together to one hundred towns and preach the gospel for one month.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They will go out two by two to knock on doors and labor to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A month later two people will remain to take care of the new ones while the rest are re-divided to form new teams and go to other towns.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way, in the first month we will gain a hundred towns, in the second month eighty towns, in the third month sixty-four towns, in the fourth month fifty-one towns, and in the fifth month twenty-three towns.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The total will be three hundred eighteen towns.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the Lord gives us only seven hundred people, we will still do the same thing, but the time by which every town will be gospelized will be delayed until late October.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whether there will be one thousand people or seven hundred, by 1988 the three hundred eighteen towns in the whole island should all be gospelized.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, we will not only have churches in all the big cities, but we will also form these three hundred eighteen towns into a church network covering the whole island.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just as throwing a stone into the water creates ripples, at that time we will be able to use these three hundred eighteen towns as centers to reach the surrounding villages.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way we can spread the gospel to all the villages and reach the goal of gospelizing every village.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some of the full-timers who come back after the propagation will go and get jobs, while others may continue to serve full-time for the Lord's need.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All these people, plus the new incoming full-timers, will go to all the big cities to work in the communities, not for establishing churches but for building up some bases for small meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We hope that we will be able to labor to the extent that there will be a base for meetings in every high-rise building.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Practice for the Preparation</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some among us are practicing to deliver the gospel from house to house on every Wednesday and Friday.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we continue to practice this, at the time of propagation, everyone will be experienced, knowing how to knock on doors, how to contact people, and how to sow the gospel into man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At the same time, we will also produce some timely publications which we will be able to use readily during door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the propagation of the villages begins, I believe that we will be able to gain at least ten people a month, or maybe even ten a week.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is absolutely not a dream but something easily attainable.</S>
