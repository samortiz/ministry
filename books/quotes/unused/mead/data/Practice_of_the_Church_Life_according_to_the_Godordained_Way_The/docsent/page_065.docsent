   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE NEED FOR A PROPER BEGINNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus far we have been speaking concerning the new way, or the God-ordained way, for at least seven years, beginning from 1985.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every endeavor, if it is taken seriously, requires our proper practice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After a coach instructs his players, they eventually must practice what he has taught them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In my speaking concerning the God-ordained way, I have instructed you like a coach.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I did not have the way to practice with you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In November 1987 the church in Taipei, the largest church in the Lord's recovery, dropped the practice of one man speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They did not do this to carry out any proposal offered by me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The elders and the co-workers were under my instruction concerning the God-ordained way for thirty-seven months, beginning in October 1984.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In my teaching I stressed the need to stop the practice of one man speaking, and the elders and co-workers in Taipei responded by making a decision to terminate that practice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I was strong in my teaching concerning this matter, saying that to have one man speaking in the church meetings is devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Nee said that to practice one man speaking is to follow the customs of the nations 2 Kings 17:8, NASB; see Church Affairs, chapter four, published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The customs of the nations, that is, of the Gentiles, are all devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the context of 2 Kings 17:8, the term the customs of the nations refers to the worship of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verses 9-12 of that chapter say that the nations worshipped idols on every high hill and under every green tree.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Deuteronomy 12, before Israel entered the good land, Moses was charged by God to tell the children of Israel that when they entered the land, they were to tear down all the high places and were to worship only in the place chosen by God to put His name and His habitation there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, that one place became Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jerusalem was the place chosen by God, the place where God's name and habitation were 1 Kings 11:36; 2 Kings 23:27; 2 Chron 6:6a .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Throughout the centuries God has never allowed Israel to build the temple in any other place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If Israel could have two temples, that would mean division.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Division is related to the worship of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On this earth wherever idolatry exists, division also exists.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today Christians worship God in many different "temples," that is, in many divisions, according to their own tastes and according to their own choice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to Deuteronomy 12 this kind of practice is strictly forbidden by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The children of Israel had no choice; in order to worship God, they had to go to the place chosen by God, where God's name and habitation were.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This keeps the oneness of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, the practice of one man speaking is a condemned thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Church Affairs page 81 , Brother Nee said that this practice is difficult to overthrow, but he said that we all can "push against it day after day."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If everyone pushes, Brother Nee said that one day we will push this practice away.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although I was teaching these things to the church in Taipei, I did not propose to the brothers that they change their practice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, they came to me and spoke with me concerning dropping the practice of one man speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I told them that that was not the proper time to make such a change.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then I gave them an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose we are on the top floor of a five-story building, and we find out that we should instead be on the first floor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How shall we go from the fifth floor to the first floor?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we jump from the fifth floor, we will commit suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The proper way to go from the fifth floor to the first floor is to build a series of stairways.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, we should build a stairway from the fifth floor to the fourth floor.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we need to build another stairway from the fourth floor to the third floor, and then from the third floor to the second floor.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After reaching the second floor, we still should not jump down to the first floor.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must build another stairway from the second floor to the first floor.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After building these four stairways, we can proceed safely from the fifth floor to the ground floor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After thirty-seven months the necessary "stairways" had been built in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then in November 1987 the church in Taipei dropped the one-man-speaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, they arrived safely on the ground floor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>With regard to the God-ordained way, it seems that we all have come down safely from the top floor to the bottom floor.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No doubt all the faithful saints in the Lord's recovery have realized that the God-ordained way is the biblical way, and because they love the Lord, they all have the heart to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, I have been watching over the situation among the churches, but I have not yet seen an adequate beginning in the practice of the steps of the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To have an adequate beginning in anything requires time, energy, and the exercise of wisdom to study it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although we have begun somewhat to practice the God-ordained way, up to the present time we have not made sufficient progress.</S>
