   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e. Infused with the Riches of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In their experience, the psalmists were also infused with the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 52:8 says, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a tree absorbs riches from the soil, the psalmists absorbed the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They were like olive trees planted in the house of God, and they were being infused with God s riches so that they could grow spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Like olive trees, they grew with the riches that had been infused into them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Psalm 92:13 and 14 also reveal that the psalmists were infused with God s riches: Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be full of sap and green Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here we see four aspects of being infused with God s riches: planted in the house, flourishing, bringing forth fruit, and being full of sap and green.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What we have here is not teaching or theology, but the experience of the living God as the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The psalmists were not merely law-keepers; they were those who sought God and were infused with His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, they were planted, they flourished, they brought forth fruit, and they were full of sap and green.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through such an infusion from God, they spontaneously were strengthened to keep the law and to live out the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The experience of the psalmists was the same in principle as that revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the Gospel of John, when we abide in the Lord, He infuses us with His element, and we absorb the life juice of the vine into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we shall bring forth fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not a matter of keeping the law; it is a matter of living out the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Psalm 92:10 says, But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of a wild ox: I shall be mingled with fresh oil Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Old Testament oil is a type of the Triune God as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To be mingled with fresh oil is thus to be mingled with the fresh Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is not merely to learn the law or to strive to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is to seek God in order to be fully mingled with the fresh Spirit so that we spontaneously may live Him and have a daily walk that corresponds to what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To repeat, this is not to keep the law; it is to live out God and thereby to have a daily living that corresponds to God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead of trying to keep the law, we should live the law by being infused with God s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>f.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Enjoying the Riches of Life</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The psalmists also enjoyed the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Psalm 36:8 and 9 say, They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These verses sound very much like a portion from the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In principle, the psalmists enjoyed the Triune God the same as we do today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be satisfied with the fatness of God s house and to drink of the rivers of His pleasures are to enjoy the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To say that with Him is the fountain of life means that with Him is the source of life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once again we see that the psalmists were not trying to keep the requirements of the law, but were seeking after God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In their pursuit of God, they were infused with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Spontaneously they lived not only according to the law given by God, but also according to God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their living automatically corresponded to God s law, which was an expression of God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, they lived God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Their living was an expression of His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead of being those who endeavored to keep the law, they were those who lived the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We thank the Lord for showing us this important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>g. Supplied with God to Keep His Word</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, the psalmists were supplied with God to keep His word, the law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Psalm 119:57 says, Thou art my portion, O Lord: I have said that I would keep thy words.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the two points in this verse are put together, we see that the psalmists were supplied with God as their portion and were thereby enabled to keep His words.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The use of the word portion reminds us of Colossians 1:12, where Paul tells us that Christ is the portion of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because God was the portion of the psalmists, the psalmists could keep God s word, by which they meant the law.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to keep God s word, the word of the law, the psalmists took God as their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not think that in ourselves we are able to keep God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To keep the commandments of the law is a great matter, and we are not sufficient for this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we would keep the law, we need God to be our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only when we enjoy Him and are supplied with Him shall we be able to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Again we see that in principle the experience of the psalmists in the Old Testament was the same as our experience today.</S>
