   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Remember how Paul spoke to the Corinthians: "And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But neither yet now are you able" 1 Cor 3:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that they had wasted many days.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They had become aged children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Their ages had increased, yet they were still like children.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They should have grown, yet they had not grown at all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Oh, the lost years!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They should have become strong men, and they should have been able to run the course that lay ahead and eat solid food.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They had wasted many days, and still they remained fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In their daily walk, in their submission to the Lord and trust of the Lord, they should have had many experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They should have been able to guide others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, they still did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may have believed in the Lord for eight or ten years yet not progressed since the day we were born again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the apostle said that even after we have been born again, there are many days that cannot be counted, and it is possible that we can remain as infants.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Please remember the parable of the Lord concerning laboring in the vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord went out several times to hire laborers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What did He say?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"He went out...and saw others standing idle in the market place, and to those he said, You also go into the vineyard" Matt 20:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To be idle means to stand inactive, not doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord wants you to work!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even when He went out at the eleventh hour, which is four or five in the afternoon, He still saw people standing there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord said to them, "Why have you been standing here all the day idle?...You also go into the vineyard" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is the meaning of these words?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a parable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It says that for His work, God has set a boundary which is the vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Outside of this boundary is idleness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It does not matter what you are doing outside.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As long as you are outside, you are idle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You may have been the president of the government for many years, a professor for a long time, a good father for many years, or a good mother for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may have been an excellent pastor or a missionary all your life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may have spent your whole lifetime for the church and for spreading the gospel and heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may have even contributed greatly to the works of society; yet God says that you are idle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No matter how busy you are, if you are not living in the will of God, you are idle in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It does not matter how much you have sweated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may even claim that you have been busy working at home and do not have even one moment of free time, yet God says that you are an idle person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Are men really idle, having nothing to do?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No. There is not a person in this world who is not working.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everyone is extremely busy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some are busy with their daily necessities.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some who are rich and have abundance are busy with earthly pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some are busy making their living, and others are busy with pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no one who is not busy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even many Christians are working zealously for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What then does God mean by being idle?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It means to be outside the vineyard; anyone who is outside the vineyard is idle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Any works, activities, or labors that are outside of God's will are vanities.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You may be working very busily in spiritual matters, but God will speak to you quietly, "Why are you idle?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Any work outside of the vineyard is not mine."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, in God's eyes you are extremely idle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only those who are inside the vineyard belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The whole question rests on whether or not a work is from God and whether or not it is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The days spent outside the will of God are not counted.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As the Lord said to those people who came at five o'clock in the afternoon, "Why have you been standing here all the day idle?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Matt 20:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For some, their entire life and all their years have gone by, and nothing is counted.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"All the day" here means an entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Brothers and sisters, how about us?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It does not mean that we should all give up our jobs to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is not God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The most important thing is that every one of us, in whatever we do, should be fully clear that we are standing according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Let us do everything according to God's will and let the vineyard be our center.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There are different types of work in the vineyard; they are not all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some work involves digging the ground, other work involves sowing seeds, and other work involves repairing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whatever work you are doing, it is all right as long as you are working for His vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some work is very dirty, such as preparing the fertilizer.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some work is cleaner, such as picking the grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do not think that you have to be like certain ones in order to do God's work or that you have to do certain work in order for your labor to count.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Any time spent in the vineyard is countable.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You may have been saved for sixty years, fifty years, or for just three years or five years.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>How much time, energy, and money have you spent for the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Undoubtedly, you have to work.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But for whom are you working?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is all right for you to be involved in earthly matters as long as you are sure that you are in the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God does consider those who do not have a job and just engage themselves in gospel preaching as the workers of the vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Some may be doing "God's work," and yet it is not God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>On the contrary, God has to call them to work.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is all a question of your heart and the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, consecration is absolutely necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you are saved but have not consecrated yourself, the life you live is considered idle.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If you say that you have done nothing in saving souls, nor anything else for God since you were saved, your life must have been idle.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the true accounting.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The days that are lived for the self, that are lived in captivity or in sin, are not counted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>How many years can you live on this earth?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Seventy years?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Eighty years?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Not too many can live that long.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Have you ever seen a Christian who is one hundred years old?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Perhaps you have not.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you subtract the days before you were saved from your short life span, how many more days are left?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Brothers, how many more years will you live?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>There may be sixty more years until that day.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The Lord may say, "The days you have lived before me are less than ten years."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Perhaps fifty years from now the Lord will say, "You have lived only a few days before me.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The rest of the days have all been forgotten."</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Oh, may we number our days and use the rest of our days wisely!</S>
