<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>EXPERIENCING THE SPIRIT<br>IN SECOND CORINTHIANS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:6, 8, 17-18; 13:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b; John 6:63; 5:21</H1><P>We have pointed out that in 1 Corinthians there is mostly the doctrine concerning Christ, but in the second Epistle there is the experience and enjoyment of Christ. In the previous chapter, we began to speak about the aspects of the Spirit in 2 Corinthians. Whatever is spoken there concerning the Spirit is not in the way of doctrine but in the way of experience. It tells us something richer and finer than 1 Corinthians does.</P><P>In 1 Corinthians the Spirit is the revealing Spirit, the gift-dispensing Spirit, and the indwelling Spirit. But 2 Corinthians tells us first that the Spirit is the anointing Spirit (1:21). The anointing is richer and finer than the revealing. Suppose a mother just showed her daughter food and did not serve her the food. I prefer not the showing, the revealing, but the feeding. Whatever the Lord reveals, He anoints into us. The revealing is for seeing, and the anointing is for enjoying.</P><P>Today's Christians are so much for knowing, for seeing. They like to listen to messages from good speakers. Paul said that when the decline of the church worsens, people "will not tolerate the healthy teaching; but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers, having itching ears" (2 Tim. 4:3). Paul told the Corinthians that they might have ten thousand guides, or teachers, but not many fathers (1 Cor. 4:15). Teachers pass on knowledge; fathers impart life. What we need today is not teachers but fathers. Those with itching ears like to heap up teachers to themselves. They like only to know, to see.</P><P>But after the seeing in 1 Corinthians, we must come to the anointing in 2 Corinthians. The Spirit in 2 Corinthians is not the teaching Spirit but the anointing Spirit. The Holy Spirit anoints us with the divine essence, just like a painter paints a house with the essence of paint. The Spirit anoints us with the essence of God's nature, with the substance of what God is. The more He anoints us, the more of God we have.</P><P>We have also seen that the Spirit is the sealing Spirit (1:22). The anointing brings in the essence, and the sealing shapes what the anointing brings in into a definite form and image. When you mark a piece of paper with a seal, there is a definite form, an image, on that paper. The anointing Spirit brings in the riches of God's fullness. Then the sealing Spirit shapes them into a form which gives people an impression. When you are sealed by the Spirit, you have the image of God, the impression of God, and the likeness of God. The anointing Spirit brings in all the riches of the Godhead so that we have something substantial. Then the sealing Spirit follows to make this substance into a form so that we have the image, impression, and likeness of God.</P>
