   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>However, before the Lord's kingdom comes, the saints must first be raptured by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hence, the Lord says, "And to him I will give the morning star."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The meaning of the morning star is explained to us at the end of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the prophecies contained in this book are about to be fully expounded, He turns back to explain to us the meaning of the morning star.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"I Jesus have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright morning star" 22:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the way the book of Revelation, or the New Testament, concludes with a declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we read the declaration in the book of Malachi, the end of the Old Testament, we will be amazed how the Old Testament as well as the New join as one to testify for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The declaration in Revelation is concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The declaration in Malachi is also concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The book of Revelation says that He is the bright morning star.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Malachi says that He is the Sun of righteousness 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It seems as if the Old Testament speaks more perfectly than the New Testament speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The morning star comes first, then the sun comes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It seems to be more complete to receive the sun than to receive the morning star, for to have the day is better than to have the promise of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the significance here is not the day or the promise of the day but a question of sequence in time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus is the root of David.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that he will be the King of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the Sun typified in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the millennium, the Lord Jesus will reveal Himself as the Sun, but for His people, He will first be the bright morning star in the dark world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since this promise is so precious, when the true church hears this promise, it cannot refrain from its love, zeal, and desire in His return and from crying with the Holy Spirit, "Come!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>22:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the Sun of righteousness, the Lord Jesus will manifest Himself in the world with extraordinary power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, at the same time, He is the morning star, unveiling His heavenly beauty in the heart of His people to be their hope.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The appearance of the morning star is the proof of the imminent approaching of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who look up to Him in darkness will see Him and will be comforted by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The morning star is not the appearance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not the revelation of His glory before all men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That will be the work of the Sun. When He said that He is the morning star, it means that He is not seen by the sleeping church and the slumbering world, for they are all glorifying themselves in the world and have forgotten about the cross of Christ and that now is the time of night.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>An overcomer is one who is watchful in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He cannot sleep and slumber with the sinful world and the corrupted church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He looks to the Lord in the dark.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As such, the Lord gives to him a song in the night and a glimpse of the morning star.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What he cares for are the future events, because the morning star is already risen in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even if the church throughout the ages had been faithful, the world still would be in a dark night.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, now, on top of this, the church has become corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the sun goes up, it is time for men to go forth to work in diligence, but the morning star is shining for those who will not sleep with others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some will see the light only when the sun goes up, but how good it is that we can see the light of the morning star even before the sun comes up!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What this means is that we will enjoy Christ in the dark.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ did not say to us, "I am the morning star."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, He says, "And to him I will give the morning star."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means at least two things: 1 Christ reveals Himself especially to those who are looking for Him and becomes available to them for their present enjoyment, and 2 before He comes again with His saints and manifests Himself in the world as the Sun, He will first rapture the overcomers unto Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thyatira is at the darkest hour of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, it is at this darkest hour that the morning star is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, all those who desire the morning star should know that when circumstances are dark, the time for the appearance of the morning star is near.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, there is another significance to the morning star.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although the morning star shines from the heavens, it does not brighten the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is only shining and bright within its own sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the future Christ will bring day to the world, but to us, He is the morning star because we are heavenly people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He shines in the heavens, and only those who live in the heavens can see His brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although we will reign with Him over the whole earth, our home is not the earth but our Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That is our eternal habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This morning star is our habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since our life at present and our thoughts are all above, we can enjoy the full brightness of the morning star.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The farther we are from the earth and the closer we are to the realm of the morning star, the more we will receive the brightness of the morning star.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, this morning star is not only our habitation in which we can enjoy God's provision.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our greatest enjoyment is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"I Jesus...the bright morning star."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We will enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What a wonderful thought this is!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The morning star speaks of the fact that the Lord Jesus will appear to us in darkness and will receive us unto where He is.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The morning star speaks of our eternal home.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It also speaks of the fact that we will forever abide with the Lord and will enjoy and linger with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These three thoughts are linked together for us in John 14.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord Jesus said, "In My Father's house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord will come again and will prepare a place for us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He Himself will also abide with us forever.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The morning star speaks of the imminent coming of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Before the Lord Jesus sends the tribulations to judge the world, He will first receive us back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At that time we will reign with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At that time the staff will not be turned to a serpent; rather, in His hand, the staff will become a symbol of righteousness, and no opposer in the world will be able to withstand His power.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>At that time we will share with the Lord in His government.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What a blessing that will be!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, the Lord is speaking here of the future rapture and reigning of the saints so that their hearts will not take the present age as their goal, but will take the future glory as their focus.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Those who can be attracted by these things of the future will be overcomers in Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must know the Lord and the future things in this way in order that we will not be affected by the present apostasy and corruption around us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Naturally speaking, our hearts easily turn to vanity and hope for prominence in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If there is not the hope of the future, our hearts will not be preserved to relinquish the present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Actually, every sin in the present world and the church is also in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Indeed, if we do not judge before the Lord the root of evil hiding in our hearts, we cannot reject the fruit of corruption appearing in the present world and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>These sins are produced when man allows the flesh to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If Satan is to operate, he must have his sphere of operation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Because man is unwilling to remove everything of the flesh in himself, many failures result.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The most important thing for us to do now is to ask God to do a deeper work in us through the cross so that we can be single-heartedly attracted by the coming rapture and kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we want our hearts to be preserved and to be kept away from the multifarious perils in our environment, we must have this hope.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord is now presenting these two things before the weary saints so that they would lift up their heads, hope for the coming things, and overcome in a corrupting environment.</S>
