<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(10)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 2, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER Z. Z.</h2><p>(Missing)</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>I will speak one thing concerning you. Your emotion has made you an icy and passionless person. Your natural disposition has gone through such shock in the environment that it has become passionless and cold. You have brought this cold disposition into the work, and this has been the reason you have suffered in the work all these years. Your cold disposition has been molded by your environment and constituted into your daily living. What we encounter before we are saved becomes part of our constitution and growth. Moreover, this growth continues until we develop a character that is very different from our former state. You cannot coordinate with other co-workers in the work, and your attitude is uncooperative because your emotion and character have affected your spirit. Your spirit runs contrary to others' spirits; it does not go along with them. Because of your background, you have acquired a different character. This character spontaneously creates a problem in the ministry. It brings nothing but trouble to the church and to the work.</p><p>I believe the Lord's hand has been on you during the past years and has done some work. You have your own view concerning many things. When you are with the brothers and sisters, your indifferent character insists on what it sees and will not give in. This insistence becomes stronger and stronger. It is a good sign that God has been breaking your hard character throughout these years. This has not only exposed your weakness but has shown you that you have been responding to others according to your kind of weakness. This is the only way to break your hard disposition. It is not easy for God to use any one of us. I hope you will improve during this end time. I hope you will not delay His work or waste His effort on you.</p><p>You should not adopt a hardened stand. When I say this, I do not mean that you should give up being sober or serious. I am saying that the spirit of a minister of the word has to go along with the spirit of the meeting. He has to observe the flow of the meeting and go along with the flow. If he does this, he will have the blessing. In the meeting we should not bring up any spiritual matter in an independent spirit that runs contrary to the spirit of the meeting. In the meetings the brothers and sisters have their feelings, and we cannot offend their feelings. We cannot take care of just our own feelings while ignoring other peoples' feelings. There is, of course, a difference when it comes to preaching the gospel. We should not purposely try to impress others. But we should not purposely try to ignore them. We should not purposely try to render help to others. But we should not purposely try to refuse helping others. We should not purposely try to take care of others' feelings. But neither should we purposely try to ignore their feelings. When we speak, our spirit should have only one goal in mind&mdash;to edify others. If we want to be a minister of the word, we must exercise love. According to 1 Corinthians 13:4 this love is kind.</p><p>Our brother's present character is made up of three things: First, his natural disposition; second, the influence of the environment; and third, the coldness which is the result of a combination of his inherent disposition and his surrounding environment. Our brother indeed needs the Lord's mercy to grant him kindness and gentleness so that his present character will undergo a severe and unrelenting breaking. We should not do something that does not produce any result. In the same way we should not suffer without producing any result. Many sisters become sick or encounter trials. But the sickness and trials do not produce any result in them. This is a pity. God's work always produces results. Our brother does have the ministry of the word. Yet he has a problem with his character. May the Lord be gracious to him. Once a man is broken, he will have a tender spirit. A tender spirit is not the same as a weak spirit. Your character has been hardened by the environment, and this hardness has resulted in self-righteousness. This is the reason you cannot love the brothers and sisters. Your self-righteousness, in turn, has resulted in an independent spirit in the meeting. This is the reason your spirit cannot flow freely and richly. You need God's dealing to bring forth the fruit of the Spirit&mdash;a spirit of kindness and love, a spirit that can mingle with other spirits. This is the only way for your spirit to become rich, and this is the only way for you to gain others. If you can take care of these three things, you will be greatly used in the ministry of the word.</p>
