   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ in Us Being the Overcoming Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By 1935 I had been saved for ten years and was serving the Lord full time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From 1933 to 1935 I spent much time working with Brother Nee in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During this time we fought the spiritual battle together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1935 I returned to Chefoo to spend the summer, and Brother Nee also went to Chefoo for some rest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our original intention was to rest that summer, but we eventually held a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother Nee was burdened to speak concerning Christ in us as the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When he spoke, many people s minds were opened, and a revival was brought in.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Nee had intended to stay in Chefoo that summer and then travel to Europe via Manchuria and Siberia.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, because his speaking about the overcoming life brought in a revival, he cancelled his trip to Europe and returned to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This brought the revival to Shanghai and then from Shanghai it spread to Amoy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In addition, from that time onward he began to gradually spread the work of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, I left my hometown, Chefoo, and went to begin the work in Tientsin and Beijing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, it was only when I was in Brother Nee s conference in Chefoo that my mind was opened to understand the matter of Christ in us as life, but even that understanding was not thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By the summer of 1939 Brother Nee had given many messages concerning Christ as life when he visited Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These messages were recorded and edited by a British brother and published as The Normal Christian Life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Brother Nee returned from Europe, he called a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At that time I and three to four young brothers were working in the places near the Tsingtao-Tsinan Railway in Shantung Province.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I received Brother Nee s telegram asking me to attend his conference in Shanghai, I immediately went to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was greatly helped in that conference.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Four Stages of Experiencing Christ as Life</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although Christians say Christ is life, few Christians can say Christ our life as Paul did in Colossians 3:4.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are even fewer Christians who go further and touch the secret of Christ as life, and still fewer live by taking Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Among those in Christianity, there are false Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not need to speak about these people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are others who are seeking and who know that Christ is their life, but they may not necessarily touch the secret of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Still others have touched the secret of Christ as life, but they have not entered into the stage of daily taking Christ as life and living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Finally, some live by daily taking Christ as life just as Paul, who said, To me, to live is Christ Phil 1:21 , and I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1949, when we were working in Taiwan, we composed a short hymn for baptism: Already dead!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And buried too!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>/ With the old man I am through!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>/... No longer I!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No longer I!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>/ Christ in me I ll testify!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hymns, #938 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On one occasion we baptized over seven hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We baptized people on Saturday night and continued baptizing on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On those two days we sang this hymn with every person we baptized; we sang this hymn over seven hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, according to my observation, the people who were baptized were not through after their baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although the hymn says, I am through!...Christ in me I ll testify, none of them could say, I am through, nor could they say, No longer I!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ in me I ll testify!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, their condition was the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, on the one hand, I am glad to see so many young people attending this conference and to know that two to three hundred of the young people have been saved for less than half a year.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the other hand, I am concerned that these young people might not live a life that testifies that it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.</S>
