INCARNATION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. To Bring God into Man<br>by Having God Incarnated to Be<br>a Man in the Flesh</H2><P>God's incarnation (John 1:14) was clearly promised and prophesied in the Old Testament, but regretfully, most of the Jews never saw it. In Genesis 3:15 God promised the fallen Adam that a seed of the woman would come to bruise the head of the evil serpent, who seduced Adam to fall. No doubt, Adam by that time hated that serpent. So God told him that one day a seed of the woman would come to bruise that serpent's head. We know this seed of the woman is Christ. One day He was born of a virgin. He destroyed Satan. He bruised the head of Satan.</P><P>In Genesis 22:18 God promised Abraham that his seed would be the blessing to all the nations on earth. Abraham's seed is Christ (Gal. 3:16). In 2 Samuel 7:12-14 God promised David that his seed, a human being, would be the Son of God to build God's temple and to sit on the throne in God's kingdom. This seed is also Christ.</P><P>Thus, we see three seeds&#151;the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David. The seed of the woman would bruise the head of Satan, the seed of Abraham would become a blessing to all the nations on the earth, and the seed of David would be the Son of God to build up the temple and to rule in God's kingdom.</P><P>Isaiah prophesies that a virgin would be with child and bear a son. Isaiah 7:14 says that this virgin's child would be called Emmanuel, God with us. Isaiah 9:6 says that unto us a child is born and a son is given, yet His name shall be called the Mighty God, the Eternal Father. Micah 5:2 prophesies that a ruler would come forth from Bethlehem whose goings forth are from of old, from the days of eternity.</P><P>These are the prophecies concerning Christ. In total, all these promises and prophecies indicated that one day God would come to be a man, to bring Himself into man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Mingle Divinity with Humanity</H2><P>God's becoming a man means that God mingles divinity with humanity, making God and man, divinity and humanity, one entity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Be Born of the Divine Spirit<br>and of a Human Virgin</H2><P>Christ was conceived of the divine Spirit and was born of a human virgin (Matt. 1:20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. To Produce a God-man</H2><P>The birth of Christ produced a God-man&#151;Emmanuel (Matt. 1:23)&#151;as the prototype for the mass reproduction of many God-men. God became Jesus. That means God became a God-man. This God-man is a prototype to reproduce millions of God-men. If you realize that you are a God-man, you will conduct yourself in your daily life in a way of dignity. When you go shopping to buy food or in anything you do in your practical affairs, you should consider yourself a God-man. Then your attitude and the way that you talk will be full of dignity. Even a mayor of a small city does things with his dignity. Today you are a God-man, who should live a life fully dignified, with the highest standard of human virtues expressing the most excellent divine attributes.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practical Way to Live a Life According to the High Peak of the Divine Revelation in the Holy Scriptures &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
