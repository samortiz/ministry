	 <h2 class="head1">THE COOPERATION OF THE FULL-TIMERS</h2>
<p>We have brothers and sisters in almost every community in Taipei. The most effective way is for the full-time trainees to coordinate with these brothers and sisters and go with them to knock on doors and visit people. We need to receive a burden to pray for this. There are many communities in Taipei that are equivalent to a village. It is worthwhile for us to labor in these communities. If one thousand full-time brothers and sisters coordinate with the saints living in the communities, the result will be glorious. This requires our prayer, and it requires all the brothers and sisters to pick up the burden and to spend their money and energy on this. The saints can go out in the gospel, and they can also support the full-time brothers and sisters so that the full-time serving ones can offer all their time.</p>
<p>The church is like an army fighting for the kingdom of God on the earth; therefore, we must give our all&mdash;our strength, time, and money&mdash;for God&rsquo;s interest on the earth. This does not mean that we should not take care of our practical needs. Rather, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake we should live a normal life and take care of the education of our children. If the Lord gives us any surplus, we should refuse to spend it on ourselves. We should give the surplus to the Lord. If we are willing to do this, it will be very easy to gospelize Taiwan. This will bring a great blessing to our society and to our country.</p>
<p>Idols are prevalent in Taiwan, and crime has increased. These conditions indicate that there is a desperate need for the gospel. We must spread the preaching of the gospel because we live in this age and we have received a burden from the Lord to spread His recovery. The last chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, which is a book on the gospel of the kingdom, speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s ultimate commission. In this chapter the Lord charges us to go and disciple all the nations because He has received all authority in heaven and on earth (28:18-19). We need to go so that the Gentiles can become not only believers but also the Lord&rsquo;s disciples, that is, those who spread the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom. We must go and baptize people into the Triune God. This is the commission that the Lord gave us, and we must receive it.</p>
<p>We are now in the Lord&rsquo;s particular move in Taiwan. He has opened a wide door for the spread of the churches. We have a good environment, so we should give ourselves and take advantage of this opportunity. We need to be mobilized and give ourselves to the Lord. We should give Him our heart, strength, money, family, and children. If we do this, we will see a glorious situation in the gospelization of Taiwan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING<br />
A LARGE MEETING HALL</h2>
<p>We have been progressing positively with respect to acquiring a large meeting hall in Linkou. The land we purchased is on a hillside, and the government has many regulations concerning the development of hillside property. These regulations do not depend on whether the property is forestland or farmland. Therefore, we must go through the proper procedures and apply for a permit to develop the land.</p>
<p>Some saints asked why we need a large meeting hall when we are promoting the burden for the small groups and home meetings. The principle in the Bible shows that we need both the big meetings and the small meetings. These meetings can be compared to the two wings of a bird or an airplane. The big meetings are one wing, and the small meetings are the other wing. Based on the experience we gained this year, we know that even though there are many activities in the small meetings, we still need the strengthening from the big meetings. For this reason, we need a large meeting hall so that the saints from localities such as Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung can gather together.</p>
<p>Even though there are small group meetings all over the city of Taipei, we still need a big meeting for everyone to attend at least once a month and a larger meeting every six months. In the future we hope to have two thousand five hundred full-time brothers and sisters being trained each term. The place where they can meet and have training classes is a problem. Presently we are unable to receive the saints from overseas into the training, because of the limitations in our capacity. If we have a place with a dormitory and a dining hall, we can accept the saints from abroad to the training. This would save both time and effort.</p>
<p>Taipei is a large city in the Far East. It is a highly industrialized and commercial city, and the number of people living in the communities is steadily increasing. This makes Taipei a large fishing pond; it is one of the best places for preaching the gospel. Therefore, we need to pay attention to the development of our work and labor in one accord for the building of the big meeting hall. At the same time we should pay attention to the spread of the work. We should seriously consider these things before the Lord, and we should look to Him that the work in these two areas would proceed simultaneously. We should not stop the work in the communities in order to focus on the development of the large meeting hall. If we do this, we will suffer loss. We must work toward the building of the large meeting hall at Linkou and, at the same time, put our strength, time, and money into developing the work in the communities.</p>
