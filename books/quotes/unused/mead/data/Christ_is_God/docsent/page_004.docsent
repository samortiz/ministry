   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST'S WORDS TESTIFYING THAT HE IS GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>More amazing than the miracles Christ performed are the words that He spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He spoke with authority and life Matt 7:28-29; John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many great world leaders have left words of wisdom to posterity, but no one in history has ever affected as many lives as Christ has with His words.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His words give life to millions and have caused countless numbers of people to die and be martyred for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Napoleon was able to persuade his soldiers to die for his cause when he was alive, but when he died, his cause died with him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, two thousand years after Christ's death, men and women all over the world are still willing to live and die for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His words are quoted in books, libraries, congress halls, and schools all over the world.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the most amazing part of His teaching was not the wise and moral teachings that He spoke, but His extraordinary claims about Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said, "I am the way and the reality and the life" John 14:6 .</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In fact, we can say that the main part of His teaching is just concerning Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Most religious leaders teach men doctrines, but the doctrines have nothing to do with the teachers themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, Buddhism teaches concerning reincarnation, but reincarnation has nothing to do with the founder of Buddhism himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But Christ's teaching has everything to do with the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we take Christ away, there is no more doctrine to the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Christian faith is centered on what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The person of Christ is the doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without Him, there is no doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Gandhi could not say that he was the light of the world, nor could Aristotle say that he was the way and the reality and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The greatest philosophers of the world can at most say that they point others to the way; they can never say that they are the way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But Christ said that He is the way and the reality and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One French philosopher once said that if the record of the Gospels were a forgery, the one who forged the records would be qualified to be Christ Himself.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ's life on earth was a sinless life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once a woman caught in adultery was brought before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Jewish law at that time required that everyone caught in the act of adultery was to be stoned to death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The people around Him tried to put Him to the test.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He told the crowd that whoever had no sin should cast the first stone at the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At such a word, all the people left one after another, beginning with the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the end, only Jesus remained John 8:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was able to challenge the others because He Himself is sinless.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Among those who were with Him while He was on earth were His mother and brothers in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>None of them challenged His claim to sinlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This proves that He is God, for only God can be without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible says that when He lived on earth, He was like us in every way, yet without sin Heb 4:15 .</S>
