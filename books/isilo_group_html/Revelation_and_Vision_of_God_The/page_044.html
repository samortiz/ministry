In Paul&#8217;s Epistles</h2><p>The divine revelation concerning the Triune God desiring to work Himself into man extends throughout the entire New Testament. From Matthew to Revelation, every book was written according to this principle. The four Gospels were written according to the principle of the Triune God&#8217;s working Himself into man. Acts also shows us this principle, and none of the Epistles is an exception to this rule. Let us take Romans as an example. Romans 1 speaks of the gospel of God, which is a gospel of the forgiveness of sins, a gospel of justification by faith. Then Romans 8 speaks about God coming into us. Verses 9 and 10 say that the Spirit of God dwells in us, that we have the Spirit of Christ in us as the indwelling Spirit, and that Christ is in us. Here we see God, Christ the Son, and the Spirit; we see the Triune God. This is different from the Old Testament. In the Old Testament the Triune God was outside of man; by Romans 8, the three of the Triune God are all in man. This is also different from Matthew 1. When Matthew 1 speaks of God&#8217;s entering into man, it is individual; by Romans 8, God&#8217;s entering into man is corporate. This can be proven by Romans 8:29 where it says that Christ is the Firstborn among many brothers. The many brothers are we who have God in us.<p>If we continue reading, we come to 1 and 2 Corinthians. At the conclusion of 2 Corinthians Paul blesses the believers with the blessed Triune God: &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all&#8221; (13:14). The Triune God is with us and in us.<p>Then in Ephesians, the first chapter begins with God the Father&#8217;s selection and predestination (vv. 3-6), God the Son&#8217;s redemption (vv. 7-12), and God the Spirit&#8217;s sealing and pledging (vv. 13-14). The result is that, by His transmission to the church, the Triune God enters into us to produce the Body, which is the fullness of the One who fills all in all (vv. 22-23). This is God&#8217;s economy. This means that God&#8217;s economy is to dispense the Triune God into man to produce a result, which is the church as His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. In Ephesians 3 Paul says that he bowed his knees unto the Father and asked that He would grant us to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith (vv. 14-17). The result is that we are filled unto all the fullness of God (vv. 18-19). This is the dispensing of the Triune God into our entire being, resulting in our becoming the fullness, the expression, of God. What is spoken of in all the Epistles ultimately is related to this matter.<h2 class=head3>5. In John&#8217;s Revelation</h2><p>Finally, in Revelation, at the very beginning it says, &#8220;Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ&#8221; (1:4-5). This indicates that the processed Triune God, including all that the eternal Father is, all that the sevenfold intensified Spirit does, and all that the anointed Son has obtained and attained, has been dispensed into the believers with the result that the golden lampstands are produced to be His corporate testimony (vv. 9, 11, 20). At the end of Revelation, in chapter twenty-two, again we see &#8220;a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street&#8221; (v. 1). Here we have God, the Lamb (the Son), and the Spirit (signified by the river of water of life). This depicts how the Triune God dispenses Himself into His redeemed under His headship. Then in verse 17, the Spirit and the bride say, &#8220;Come!&#8221; This means that the Spirit and the bride, having become one, speak as one. The Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, who has worked Himself into us and constituted us into a corporate bride. In other words, the Triune God is the Husband, and we who have been filled and transformed by Him become His bride to be one with Him. This is the most important matter, and the central matter as well, revealed to us in the entire Bible.<h2 class=head2>D. Experiencing the Dispensing of the Triune God in Our Practical Living to Manifest the Reality of the Church</h2><p>I repeat, my burden is not merely to show you the crucial points; it is not enough just to do that. You must have the realization and the experience. But how do we have the realization and the experience? It is not at all difficult. Many Christians feel it is hard because they have been influenced by wrong teachings. When the teaching is wrong, it is very difficult to have the realization and experience. If we have the proper knowledge of the truth that the Triune God is in us and is united and mingled with us, then it is very easy to experience this truth.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Revelation and Vision of God &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
