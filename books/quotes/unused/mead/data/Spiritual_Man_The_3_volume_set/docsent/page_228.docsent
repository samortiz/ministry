   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This natural desire causes a believer to become ambitious.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ambition is inspired by the natural desire.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The ambition to spread self-fame, to become one who is above all men, or to be honored by people are all from the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The desire to be successful, fruitful, and spiritually powerful and useful in spiritual work is often derived solely from the desire to glorify oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In our spiritual life, the pursuit of growth, depth, and nobler experiences is often for our happiness and others' appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we traced the life and work of the believer to their source, we would find a strange fact: a great part is actually for self!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The believer's desire for self is the source of everything in his life and work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A believer must know that if his life and work are motivated by his ambition, even though everything he does may appear to be good, well-spoken of, and outwardly effective, it is just wood, hay, and stubble in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This kind of walk and labor does not have any spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Any thought for the self is enough to corrupt any activity, and God is not pleased with such thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God views the believer's lust for spiritual fame equally as filthy as his lust for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the believer walks according to his natural desire, then he will regard his self highly in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, God loathes this "self"!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Natural desire is equally active in other aspects of a believer's living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The soulish life causes him to hunger after worldly conversations and communications.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It impels him to watch what he should not watch and read what he should not read.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not to say that he does these things all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, occasionally he does what he knows he should not do because of a strong urge from within.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The soulish life can even be seen in his attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many believers have such an experience to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The function of his soul can also be seen in the way the believer walks and is even more evident in the way he talks and does things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everyone who walks faithfully by the spirit knows these are small things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet if the believer is urged by his emotional desire in these things, it is impossible for him to walk by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The believer must know that in spiritual matters, nothing is too small to hinder his progress.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A believer is inquisitive when he is urged by his natural desire.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more spiritual a believer becomes, the more ordinary he is, because he is united with God in His arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only emotional believers have a kind of chivalrous nature and take risky actions to satisfy their own hearts and create a great sensation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When urged by such inquisitiveness, many aspects of their behavior are very immature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They would not care for their maturity but pretend to be clever instead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When they look back, they regret; but at the time, they feel glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This inquisitive emotion urges man, and if the believers follow it, they lose their normalcy and go beyond what is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fondness for pleasure is also a great expression ofemotional believers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The emotion cannot bear allowing believers to live completely for God; it absolutely opposes the life that is constantly for God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Though believers may accept the demand of the Lord's cross and put to death the emotion so that they may live for the Lord, the emotion still asks that a small area be reserved for its activities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why many believers cannot live for the Lord completely.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no need to speak of much, just a day's living; no need to mention other things, just the warfare of prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How many believers can engage in warfare by prayer that is completely for the Lord for one whole day, without saving some time for their own pleasure?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To have pleasure is to reserve some ground for our own emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How difficult it is for us to live in the spirit through the day!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We always keep some time for ourselves to talk with others because this is soothing to our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we are shut in by God, seeing neither men nor sky, and are required to live in the spirit to work for Him before the throne, we know whether our emotion has been completely put to death or not.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We also know how much our emotion demands from us and how much we live by the emotion.</S>
