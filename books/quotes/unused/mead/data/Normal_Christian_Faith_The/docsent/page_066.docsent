   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to realize that Christ is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He bore our sins as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God looked at Christ as a man and included all of us in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When God judged Christ, He judged us also.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, God has judged us in Christ and also forgiven us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This forgiveness is perfectly just.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second Corinthians 5:14 says, "Because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The "One" here refers to Christ, and the "all" refers to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Christ died, we all died with Him because we were all included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is said that all Chinese came from the one man Hwang-ti.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If in the very beginning, somebody had killed Hwang-ti, he would have killed the whole Chinese race.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the same way, we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Christ passed through the judgment, we passed through the same.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His death became our termination.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 21: "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The One "who did not know sin" is again Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was made to be sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What does it mean to be "made sin"?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It means that when Christ was hung on the cross, God regarded Him as the sin of you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He looked at Christ as sin representing the whole human race.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Christ died, sin was all-inclusively terminated and removed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now all of us who are in Him have our sins terminated; we become the righteousness of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>IT IS THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD TO FORGIVE US</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why does it say "become the righteousness of God," rather than "become righteous"?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is the difference between the two?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To become righteous implies that we have done a good work, whereas to be made the righteousness of God declares that God Himself is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is a big difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God did not forgive our sins in an unrighteous way; He forgave in a very righteous way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has punished Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result of this punishment, He can forgive us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God has not glossed over us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God is not an evasive God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When He grants forgiveness, He does so in a just manner.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once I was going to Chiu-kang on a boat with a friend.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A Moslem was reading on the deck of the same boat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After beginning a conversation with him, I told him that I would like to know if his scripture mentioned any way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He said, "All that one needs to do is repent of one's past evil deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The sin will then be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why is there the need for salvation?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I replied that if God forgives in this way, He Himself sins in His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was very surprised at what I said.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It seemed that he had never heard such a thing before.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I asked, "Do you think that it is righteous for a man to be forgiven of his sins once he repents of them?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, when a criminal is brought before a judge, is it right for the judge to release him merely on the basis of his repentance?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After thinking for a while, he admitted that this was not just.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Unfortunately, I had no time to explain to him the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The salvation of God is based on the judgment of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We receive our forgiveness in the Son.</S>
