Chapters ten and eleven were published in The God-ordained Way and the Eldership and were given on January 3-4, 1991
Lord, we thank You for Your anointing, the holy ointment, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, which is always anointing us
Lord, we thank You that in Your sovereignty we are here and are gathered here into Your dear and precious name
We do not agree that Your time would be wasted, so we pray that every minute will be under a proper and thorough fellowship with You
After only three days they had their first occasion of turmoil, in Taberah, where the children of Israel were murmuring evil
Later, Miriam and Aaron, Moses' elder sister and brother, rebelled by speaking against Moses because he had married a Cushite woman
Because of their rebellion, Miriam became leprous and had to be quarantined for seven days so that this leprosy would not spread
In chapter sixteen, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram rose up with two hundred fifty leaders of the assembly to oppose Moses
Following this threefold punishment, God commanded each tribe to bring a rod, and He commanded Moses to lay them before the testimony
Although it is understandable why Moses became angry his word and attitude toward the children of Israel issuing from his anger offended God
By the time of Numbers 26, God had gained a new people, a people who had been purged by God's judgments through His divine dealings
According to our point of view, turmoil is not very good, but according to our real situation, turmoil is needed
In verse 30 he said that men would rise up from among them to speak perverted things to draw away the disciples after themselves
The article goes on to indicate that the meeting on Ball Road in Anaheim is no longer a local church, because it has lost its ground
Many words that have come out of those who are participating in this rebellion should be considered as 'perverted things'
If we are considering ourselves all the time in this way, we are unable to take care of problems in the Lord's recovery
When we have a pure, genuine, and sincere concern for the Lord's recovery, we are qualified to take care of the problems
The proper way to take care of the problems in the Lord's recovery is through the proper and common fellowship of the Body
The proper and common fellowship of the Body is without any private circle, without any party spirit, and without any hidden secrecies
In Acts 15 a proper, open conference with the leading ones took place in Jerusalem to consider the matter of circumcision and the faith
It was a big problem among the churches at Paul's time, but the brothers did nothing secretly, and they did not form parties
Paul and Barnabas went up to Jerusalem in order to have a proper fellowship with the elders and the other apostles
To do something behind a person's back or in a small group by way of conspiracy is absolutely devilish and very evil
As children of the light , we should keep everything in the light, not doing anything in darkness or in secrecy
To avoid twisting the Scriptures, we must be very objective in our realization of any portion of the holy Word
To avoid the mixing in of any human ideas, we must reject our natural thoughts, our natural learning, and our natural doings
To avoid having any element of tradition, we need to be under the light of the pure revelation of the holy Word
We should work for the Lord within His measure , but we should not consider what the Lord has measured to us as our particular territory
In the past there was the hidden factor of working in a way of not having one's work mingled with others' work
The effect of Peter's work was realized in Corinth , and Paul did go to Jerusalem to fellowship with the apostles and elders there
If you are ambitious and have the capacity, your capacity may neutralize your ambition, and there may be no problem
If all the ambitious brothers had the capacity, their capacity could swallow up the ugliness of their ambition
If they have ambition without the capacity for their ambition, their ambition with their incapacity causes them to become dropouts
At the beginning of the journey, Barnabas was always mentioned first ; then Paul's name began to be mentioned first
The other writers did not use this term or the term economy because they did not have as great a capacity as Paul
After the problem of circumcision was solved and they returned from Jerusalem to Antioch, they wanted to make another journey
Paul would not agree to bring Mark along, because Mark had left Barnabas and Paul in a negative way on their first ministry journey
Barnabas should have submitted to Paul's way of not taking John Mark in order to allow Mark to learn the lesson
Paul had a greater capacity than Barnabas, and because of this he eventually was the one to take the lead in the ministry
The list included seven names, with a question mark beside one of the names, and it did not include the name of the one who gave the list
Later, still another word came out saying that there are only twelve apostles the eleven, who were selected by the Lord Jesus, and Paul
According to the Bible, when Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost , he stood up with the eleven, which included Matthias
Another great divisive factor in the past has been the negligence regarding the keeping of the one accord in the Lord's recovery
In the elders' training in February 1986, my burden was to ask the elders to take care of the one accord in the Lord's recovery
In the past three years of rebellion, a few brothers condemned that letter and even said that a part of that letter is heretical
The present turmoil among us is not a matter of right or wrong, but an issue and a full manifestation of this negligence
In the same way, in our situation there has been a certain amount of accumulation of unpleasant things over a number of years
In principle, turmoil and problems among the Lord's people come from two sources, a human source and a satanic source
In spite of the turmoil, by the mercy and grace of the Lord, most of the churches around the globe are still going on positively
The reports of their present situation, given by their elders who were present in the elders' meetings, are quite encouraging
These reports are printed separately as a book entitled The Present Situation of the Churches in the Recovery throughout the World
What is He carrying on today on this earth to complete His work for His eternal economy that is to build up the organic Body of His Christ
To offer up spiritual sacrifices to God is to bring the saved sinners as sacrifices for us to offer to our God
The priests in the Old Testament offered types of Christ Himself, but today we offer saved sinners as parts of the Body of Christ
We need to encourage all the saints to feed the new believers, the Lord's lambs, by having meetings in their homes
The last crucial matter that the Lord is recovering today is the prophesying by all the saints, mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14
Brother Watchman Nee saw this matter more than fifty years ago, and he spoke of this in his book The Normal Christian Church Life
In verse 3 of that chapter we are told that to prophesy is to speak to men building up and encouragement and consolation
1)To build up the organic Body of Christ as the organism of the processed and dispensing God in His divine Trinity for His full expression
2)To prepare the bride as the counterpart of the Bridegroom for the eternal marriage of the redeeming God with His redeemed
The direction of the Lord's move today is, third, to bring in the kingdom of God as the spreading of the divine life, which is Christ
You have given us the Father's name, the Father's life, and the Father's glory, and You have given us the sanctifying holy word
Oh, what a wonder and what a blessing that the Father loves You, and You love us, and now in turn we love You!
Lord Jesus, thank You that there is such a divine love, a mutual love, from the Father to You, from You to us, and now from us to You
Thank You, Lord, for the divine name, for the divine life, for the divine word, for the divine glory, and even for the divine love
The Father has given us to You, and You have given to us the Father's name, the Father's word, and even the Father's glory
We enjoy Your essence, we enjoy Your element, we enjoy Your presence, and we even enjoy Your countenance; we see You face to face
We need to stand on this promise and believe that our God, the God of peace, will surely crush Satan under our feet
According to my observation, the problem among us came in because of the shortage of the proper understanding of the genuine oneness
By considering the problems in the early church, we can find some examples that will help us to find a remedy for our present situation
The genuine oneness of the Body is nothing less than the Triune God, who is not only triune but also processed and consummated
At that time this oneness was not yet a reality however a model of this oneness the oneness among the Three of the divine Trinity was there
To be in the Father's name is to be in the Father's person, for in the New Testament, the name always denotes the person
Since we have the Father's life, we also have the Father's nature, for the nature always goes along with the life
The oneness of all the believers in Christ is in the Triune God through sanctification by the reality of the word
To be in the Triune God as our oneness, we need to be sanctified, that is, we need to be separated from being mixed with the world
We must be separated from being mixed with the world, so that we can be holy unto the Triune God to have a pure mingling with Him
The first aspect concerns the source and the element of the oneness, and the second concerns the standing of the oneness
After many years of studying the New Testament, we have found out that God's glory is His divine life with His divine nature to express Him
If we did not have the Father's life with the Father's nature, it would be impossible for us to express the Father
The Father gave this glory to the Son that the Son may have the Father's life with the Father's nature to express the Father
The oneness of all the believers in the divine glory is the oneness in the expressed sonship with the Father's life and nature
We must not act or do anything to express ourself rather we must do things in the Fathers life with the Fathers nature to express the Father
Such an expression is a mingling of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected God with all His redeemed in their humanity
The model for the genuine oneness was there at the time of the Lord's prayer, but the actual oneness had not yet come
In the second kind of oneness, the oneness of the Spirit, we have only the actuality of the oneness; we do not yet have the practicality
On the day of Pentecost, the Triune God mingled Himself with His redeemed people, and this mingling became the actuality of the oneness
The Body as the object is mingled with the divine Trinity as the elements to be the factors of the oneness of the Spirit
Faith is the means for the Body to be joined to Christ the Head and baptism is the means for the Body to be separated from Adam the old head
The genuine oneness is the Spirit, the Son, and the Father mingled with the Body through baptism and faith, with a hope of something to come
The one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one God, one faith, one baptism, and one hope make the Body one in every aspect as its attributes
When we experience this oneness, the actuality becomes our practicality; the actual oneness becomes our practical oneness
We keep the oneness by practicing the oneness, first diligently, then with all lowliness, all meekness, and all longsuffering
In this way we practice the possessed oneness and thus keep it to have a walk that is worthy of the calling with which God has called us
The faith mentioned in Ephesians 4:13 is the objective faith, denoting all the things in which we believe for our salvation
Some so-called Christians say that they believe that Christ is the Savior, but they do not believe that Christ is God
The believers in Christ need to go on until they all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God
In a similar way, we need to grow in the divine life until we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness, the Body, of Christ
The winds of teaching may have the appearance of truth, but in such teaching the truth may be applied for the purpose of causing division
In 1 Corinthians 1:12, some of the Corinthian believers said, 'I am of Paul,' some said, 'I am of Apollos,' and some said, 'I am of Cephas'
We all must be of Christ, but to say that we are of Christ so as to designate ourselves as different from other believers is divisive
It is not a matter of whether a certain kind of speaking is right or wrong; it is a matter of whether or not it is divisive
The oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God fulfills the aspiration and prayer of the Lord in John 17
In the second kind of oneness, the oneness of the Spirit, that aspiration and prayer was accomplished but was not yet fulfilled
Strictly speaking, the genuine oneness is not of the church but of the Body; it is the Body's own organic oneness
In Ephesians 4:4, after telling us to keep the oneness of the Spirit, Paul did not say, 'One church and one Spirit
If in a prayer meeting we each pray in our own way, without any accord among us, how could we say that we are practicing the oneness?
As a test of whether we are practicing the oneness or not, we may check to see whether there is one accord in our prayer meeting
Such a shaking and nodding of our head is strong evidence that we do no practice oneness, because we do not have the one accord
The one accord is the practice, the application, of the oneness, and the oneness is the basis on which we practice the one accord
If we each have our own opinion, our own intention, and our own goal, there will be no base on which we can pray in one accord
A little more than fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, the oneness in the Lord's aspiration was accomplished
If you never write checks, it will seem as if you do not have a checking account at all, or that your account has a zero balance
Your writing of checks is the practice of your realization that there is one billion dollars in your checking account
We have the oneness as a deposit in our account, but we may not write 'checks of oneness' because we may not remain in the spirit
We all need to realize and to learn that not to be one with the saints, not to have one accord with others in the church, is serious
To keep the oneness to apply the oneness to use the oneness to enjoy the oneness to spend the oneness we need to practice the one accord
During the past two and a half years, the teaching of the absolute autonomy of the local churches was promoted among us
To make all the children the same in the growth in life is not to practice oneness; it is to practice uniformity
When we practice the proper one accord, we must realize the attributes of the church as the unique Body of Christ
According to Ephesians 4:4-6, there is one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one God, one faith, one baptism, and one hope
In Matthew 18:19, before the Lord prayed for the oneness in John 17, He trained His disciples to practice the one accord
We may be bodily sitting together in the same room, but if we are not one in our spirit, it is certain that we will not be one in our soul
To make circumcision a requirement for salvation in the New Testament jeopardizes the redemptive work of Christ
The seven lampstands were identical to the point that if they were placed side-by-side before our eyes, we could not discern which is which
Today a certain kind of teaching is being promulgated among the churches encouraging the churches to be different from one another
These epistles were addressed by the Lord to the seven particular churches separately but they were sent not as seven books but as one book
In 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul said that he urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently
To teach differently is to teach things different from what the apostles teach that is to teach things other than Gods New Testament economy
The one solution made at Jerusalem for the problem of circumcision became a decree for all the churches, both Jewish and Gentile, to keep
The one solution regarding the problem of circumcision was good for all the churches, making all the churches the same
In 1 Thessalonians 2:14 Paul wrote, 'For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus'
The one epistle of 1 Corinthians was written to the saints in Corinth, with all the Lord's callers in every place
Today there are those who are promoting differences among the churches, but the Bible indicates that the churches should imitate one another
They should imitate what is better in any church, that they may have some improvement and some advancement in the interest of the Lord
In 1 Corinthians 1:11-13, saying 'I am of Christ' was condemned, just as saying 'I am of Paul,' 'I am of Apollos,' or 'I am of Cephas'
In Philippians 1:15 and 17, the Apostle Paul condemned those who preached Christ because of envy and strife, out of rivalry
Any difference among the saints or among the churches in the degree of maturity in life is normal and is needed according to God's economy
Any differences among the saints or among the churches that are intentional are abnormal and are condemned by the Scripture
Many things may be mistakes and may cause us trouble, yet we should not be bothered by them; they are tolerable and can be taken care of
On the other hand, by all these examples we can find a few things that the Spirit would not tolerate; they are intolerable
Concerning these things, there is the need to exercise to quarantine those who are responsible for the contagious situations
At that time Brother Nee's ministry was the highest in the entire world, but the situation was not very encouraging
In less than six years, from 1949 to 1954, our number increased from fewer than five hundred to about fifty thousand
The first test of the oneness of the Body and of the one accord in the church was the test of the problem of language
Even in the glorious condition of the church after the day of Pentecost, murmurings arose over the matter of eating
Such a big problem must be solved in this way: by the presenting of facts that are fully according to the New Testament teaching, the truth
The contention among Paul and Barnabas, with no way to revolve it, resulted in a separation between the two co-workers
Such a thing as is described in Romans 16:17-18 has never taken place in the recovery in as serious a way as today
In Acts 20 Paul did not tell the believers to turn away from such persons, but in Romans 16, Paul did say that we should turn away from them
In dealing with this case, the apostle as a begetting father admonished the Corinthians as his beloved children
The apostle told them that he would come to them with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness, depending on their preference
The removal of the sinful brother in 1 Corinthians 5 was like the putting of a leper outside the camp in the Old Testament
To excommunicate someone is to give him up; but to remove a person is to quarantine him with the hope that he would become sound
Once a sinning brother has repented, the church should immediately forgive him and show its confirmed love to him
In Corinth, brother went to law with brother, and that before unbelievers, to be judged before the unrighteous, and not before the saints
Paul made a defense for himself with the signs of his apostleship, and he took a strong stand concerning all his rights as an apostle
Our being approved indicates that we are experienced and thus, that it is not easy for us to participate in any kind of party
Paul did not say that they would take revenge on persons, but that they would punish the disobedience of the disobedient ones
Taking this as a base Paul said ironically that since they bore well with those heretical preachers they should bear well with his boasting
Later, however, Peter still recommended Paul and confirmed his teachings as having the same standing as the rest of the Scriptures
Paul was faithful to the truth of the gospel and honest toward Peter for his correction, and Peter was humble in bearing Paul's rebuking
In his old age, Peter wrote a letter in which he recommended Paul highly and confirmed the standing of his writings among the Scriptures
The apostle instructed the believers, saying that the spiritual ones should restore such a one in a spirit of meekness
In carrying out such a restoration, we must do it in fear and with consideration, not in a light and careless way
Paul considered those Judaic preachers dogs, evil workers, and the concision, and warned the saints in Philippi to beware of them as such
On the one hand, Paul rejoiced over their preaching, and on the other hand, he considered them dogs, evil workers, and the concision
We should not condemn the preaching because of the evil preacher, nor should we accept the evil preacher because of his good preaching
The apostle warned the believers not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed and not to be deceived in any way
The apostle urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently
The apostle also gave the correcting word according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, with which he was entrusted
To take care of such a case, we should not merely correct, but should supply the proper teachings to replace the wrong teachings
The Apostle Paul was altogether not affected; rather, he encouraged Timothy to be empowered in the grace of the Lord
We should refuse such a one after a first and second admonition, knowing that such a one has been perverted and sins, being self-condemned
When a believer is divisive, factious, sectarian, he becomes contagious; therefore, we need to refuse him, that is, to quarantine him
Because they are willfully ignorant, the truth in the word of God spoken by the prophets in the Scriptures is covered from their sight
Peter reminded the believers to remember the word of God spoken by the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament apostles
The spirit in this case is not out of God but is of the antichrist; it is not the Spirit of truth but the spirit of deception
There is the need of our boldness and frankness to keep the divine truth concerning Christ's divine person in His divinity and humanity
If the Apostle John would have come to the church, he would have brought Diotrephes' works to the remembrance of the believers
The apostle did not indicate that Diotrephes' sin was intolerable to the extent that he needed to be quarantined
We should follow the positive example of the church in Ephesus by trying these false apostles and finding them to be false
The removing of the lampstand implies the losing of the power to shine in the darkness and to testify for the Lord
The church in Pergamos became worldly and was even settled in the world, where Satan's dwelling and throne are
These three always go together, one along with another, damaging the people of God in their carrying out of God's economy
They constituted a hierarchy that was versus the building up of the Body of Christ, like the hierarchy in Catholicism and Protestantism
Every item of the positive things inherited and received by the present Protestant churches remains in a dying situation
To take care of these cases would force us to be enriched in the vigorous divine life and to be empowered in the powerful Holy Spirit
Even we would reject such a church in the practice of the church life, not to mention that the Lord would vomit it out
The above items, XLI to LI, are all the negative items in which the seven local churches in Asia were different from one another
The seven churches as the seven golden lampstands were all identical in the positive things concerning the testimony of Christ
Divisions damage the Body of Christ, and heresies insult the person of Christ and also damage the work of Christ
Divisions are related negatively to the Body of Christ, and heresies are related negatively to Christ in His person and His work
Even with those involved in the three intolerable sins, we must be careful to deal with them in our spirit by the Spirit
There has been a change of emphasis to the building up of the work or the ministry more than the local churches
We have received our ministry from the Lord with a definite commission, that is, to build up the churches as the organic Body of Christ
In the Apostle Paul's ministry, such a coordination and oneness were rendered to him by the churches and the saints
The church in Philippi with all the saints there, and the church in Corinth and the churches in Galatia with the saints, all did this
To carry out the New Testament economy of God, the ministry, the churches, and the saints all must be one with one another
There has been a great effort and promotion to unite the saints and the churches around a certain leader and organization'
At the end of that training, the brothers wrote a letter which, with perhaps two or three exceptions, we all signed
There is no precedent of that in the Word; furthermore, there is no scriptural basis for the contents of such a letter
Those things are not according to the teaching of the Word, and we regret very much that we subscribed to them
At any rate, to be one is better than to be divided, than not to be one; to be in one accord is better than to be in confusion, in discord
In the Lord's recovery there is no such practice of a 'centralization of the churches' and a 'centralization of the work'
Is there among us such 'a pervasive control exercised over the church,' that is, a control that pervades all the churches?
Not only John, but all the elders of all the churches who have listened to my tapes are in a position to know this pervasive control
John went further to say that this outside influence 'has made it very difficult to go on by getting our leading directly from the Lord'
The New Testament teaches us to be subject not only to the Lord but also to one another in the fear of the Lord
It is hardly possible for us to receive a leading directly from the Lord without taking care of the ones with whom we work and serve
On the other hand, when we take care of the co-working ones' realization, we should also seek the Lord's leading directly
Church history reveals that in the history of one denomination after another, not all started as a denomination
The intention of John and of those who are for him in trying to put my ministry aside is the real issue and factor of the division among us
John said that 'our going on or our relationship with the saints and with the church is made to depend on our relationship to him '
The taking of the ground of oneness should not be condemned as 'an improper attitude and application of the truth'
We say that we're speaking only of the system, not of the people, but our attitude has definitely spilled over to the people
Whether in a local church or among all the churches, we should be Body-conscious, taking care not only of the Head but also of His Body
We should seek to obey the Head with a relationship to the Body, and we should also seek to obey the Body with a relationship to the Head
To take care of obeying both the Lord and the elders or the apostles at the same time is not an easy thing for us
We may unconsciously feel that the teaching concerning the obeying of God's deputy authority is overly stressed or even unscriptural
In Numbers 6:6-7, the Nazarites were charged not to be contaminated by any kind of death, even by the death of their blood relatives
In some cases to avoid the contagion of death we need to overcome our personal affection especially for those with whom we are wellaquainted
We need to remember that whatever we do and whatever we say will be judged by the Lord's coming back at His judgment seat
Even the Apostle Paul was greatly criticized; hence, we should not be disappointed if we are criticized, defamed, and slandered
Among these items, the recovery of the proper ground of the church touches a major practical problem that we are facing today
In the past three years we have been facing a real problem among us, a problem that may be termed a rebellion, a turmoil, or a division
We have been enlightened to see that Christ has a Body and that we are members of His Body, that is, members of Christ Himself
In this Spirit there is divinity, that is, God's divine nature, and there is humanity, that is, man's human nature
There is also Christ's person, Christ's wonderful, all-inclusive death, and Christ's empowering resurrection with His ascension
Individually, we are members of the Body of Christ, and all the local churches are parts of this one unique Body of Christ
Since the Body of Christ is uniquely one universally, the fellowship of the Body of Christ also is uniquely one universally
The fellowship of the Body of Christ is the fellowship of the apostles the divine fellowship between all the believers and the Triune God
1 John 1:3 tells us that the fellowship of the apostles is not merely with us, the believers, but also with the Father and the Son
The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the Body of Christ, the divine fellowship between all the believers and the Triune God
By the Lord's mercy, today in the Lord's recovery we are under the apostles' teaching and in the apostles' fellowship
We need to see and have the boldness to say that we are in the fellowship of the recovery which is the recovered apostles' fellowship
When we see something going on in the recovery which is not so good, we need to have this kind of fellowship and a proper attitude
We have seen that the problems between Barnabas and Saul were probably due to a lack of proper and adequate fellowship
The circulation of blood in our physical body is a good picture of the fellowship, the flow of the divine life, in the Body of Christ
No part of my physical body can be separate from the other parts since all the parts must participate in the one blood circulation
The best way to stay healthy is to 'receive more blood and to give more blood,' that is, to stay in the fellowship, the circulation of life
Perhaps ten days from today, fifty brothers from fifty cities can go to a certain church to be in their Lord's Day morning meeting at 10 a
The circulation of blood within our body is like a river that always carries away the waste in our being so that it can be discharged
We need to see that it is not healthy or profitable in the Lord's recovery for anyone to have a boundary for his work
Any local church that does not keep this universal fellowship of the Body of Christ is divisive and becomes a local sect
Some so-called local churches are not genuine and have become divisions; we do not need to fellowship with such 'churches'
We should have fellowship with all the genuine local churches on the whole earth to keep the universal fellowship of the Body of Christ
We must receive all kinds of genuine believers, not according to anything of ourselves but according to Christ
A believer can be kept away from the fellowship of a local church that is the fellowship of the Body of Christ because of only three things
In dealing with the divisive ones we must also take Pauls word in Titus 310 A factious man after the first and second admonition refuse
To practice Paul's word in Romans 16:17 and in Titus 3:10 is to quarantine the divisive members in the Body of Christ
In 1 Timothy 13 Paul said that he had urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently
They do not believe that Christ is both God and man who came in the flesh to accomplish redemption for us, the sinners
The apostle John said that if such a one comes to us, we should not receive him into our home, and we should not even greet him
In his first Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul charged the church in Corinth to remove a sinful brother from the fellowship of the church
Jones, regardless of how nice, humble, and submissive she may be toward her husband, the base of her marriage will be annulled
Regarding one's condition, it is possible to pretend, but concerning the ground on which one stands, no one can pretend
We should not recommend any believer in the local churches to have any share in the meetings and activities of the divisions
The title 'the church of God' denotes not only that the church belongs to God, but also that the church must have the nature of God
The oneness of the Spirit is the oneness of the Body of Christ, which is the basic element of the unique ground of a local church
The unique ground the unique oneness of the Body of Christ, plus the unique ground of locality preserves a church from being divided
The condition of a certain church may be good, but that does not assure that the ground of that church is right
The condition of a local church can change and sometimes it does change but the ground of a local church should remain unchanged permanently
There is a difference between a denomination and a sect: a sect is not a denomination if it does not denominate itself
The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the entire Body universally, covering all kinds of genuine believers
Any bread on the Lord's table that does not signify the Lord's one universal Body but the body of a certain sect is divisive
Each time they made a strong announcement that whoever was not a member of that denomination had to leave the premises
The bread that they partook of was not a symbol of the Body of Christ; it was a symbol of the sect of that denomination
If we partake of such a divisive table without discernment, we participate in a division, which is condemned by the apostle
Some of the new believers among us may wonder what the difference is between the Lord's recovery and Christianity
We need to conduct ourselves properly, and we also need to exercise our discernment because of the confusion that is around us
We can take some time in the regular meetings of the church to speak to the saints, making the God-ordained way clear to them
The leading ones and some of the leading seeking ones should take the lead to practice, in a definite way, each step of the God-ordained way
The amount of time we spend with the new ones in home meetings depends upon our discernment of their situation
We need to get into the printed ministry that has been released on the group meetings so that we can carry them out in an organic way
If a new one says that she does not know why she has to be baptized, all of the attendants can say something to answer her question
In this way all can be perfected to do the work of the building up of the Body of Christ, that is, to prophesy
When we function and are expecting to function, the meeting becomes an enjoyment to us, and we desire to come to the meeting
We need to pray definitely for the purpose of carrying out the God-ordained way in all the churches with much patience and learning
The leading ones will have to contact the others to fellowship with them so that they can gradually enter into the new way
In this way all of us will receive the mutual help in carrying out God's ordained way to organically build up the Body of Christ
In principle, we should not let anything frustrate us from keeping this time set apart for the Lord's interests
A number of the working saints among us could not afford a house in a big city, so they moved to suburbs and small towns
The raising up of these new churches is evidence of the profit of gaining people for the Lord by our personal contact
New ones were brought in not by preaching meetings but by each saint's personal preaching and personal contact with others
During the past seventy years of our history, from 1920 to the present time, that way never brought us an increase of over twenty percent
Of course, according to history, there has not been a church in Christianity which has continuously had an increase of thirty percent
We have to admit that the old way of having preaching meetings with a gifted preacher is not the spiritual way
If you would receive mercy from the Lord to live Him, to live for Him, and to preach Him to gain sinners for Him, just do it yourself
To be cut off is not to suffer eternal perdition but to lose the enjoyment of Christ in the organic union with Him
They love the church, they are for the church, and they support the church financially, but they are not bearing fruit
The Lord wants us to have a spiritual life in the church, to go to the meetings, to worship Him, and to live Him
If all the saints in the church were like this, yet no one bore any fruit, the church would eventually die out
These twenty-five minutes should be reckoned as part of your two to three hours of labor in the gospel every week
Our publication called The Holy Word for Morning Revival has been a help to the saints to be revived by the Lord every morning
The most effective way to live the Christian life is by having a vital, living, active morning watch with the Lord
We should get two verses from the Scripture to live on every day and then contact people for the Lord in a definite way
The reason why we do not bear fruit is because we do not practice contacting people directly, personally, and faithfully
We need to redeem our time by praying for our acquaintances and relatives, writing them letters, and sending them booklets
Among the saints, you have to be the examples, the living ones who get three to five people saved every six months
It is not pleasant to see our co-workers serving the Lord full-time and yet not bringing anyone to the Lord within a year
You should find out who is available for you to contact and then contact them directly and continually over a long period of time
To get someone saved and established takes about six months, and to bring them into the church will take another six months
If twenty are meeting together in a locality, and five of them bring two people into the church life, that is a fifty percent increase
The elders need to work two to three hours in the gospel every week to bring one or two remaining fruit into the church within a year
They study the situation of their land, their crops, and the weather, and they labor accordingly so that they can reap a proper harvest
If the parents have five children, and none of them has any children, the parents will be bothered and disappointed
The rock upon which the church is built is surely Christ Himself but we need to consider the context of Matthew 1618 to see something deeper
The Lord was asking the disciples who He was, but eventually what came out was a revelation concerning Christ being the rock
The rock in Matthew 16, strictly speaking, does not refer to Christ directly but to the divine revelation concerning Christ
John 3 shows us that Christ is the Bridegroom and the church is the bride as the enlargement and increase of the Groom
Of course, the Epistles show that the bride, the increase of Christ as the Groom, is the Body of Christ, the enlargement of Christ
Even though the bride is mentioned in John 3, we could not thoroughly understand who the bride is without the Epistles
The revelation the apostles and prophets received concerning Christ is considered the foundation upon which the church is built
The building of the church upon Christ as her foundation is according to the apostles' and prophets' revelation
When Brother Nee brought the recovery to us according to the revelation he had received at his time, he actually brought in the teaching
Christians have argued, for example, over the way to baptize people, and they have been divided because of this
The apostles' teaching in the New Testament shows us that Christ builds up His Body through all of His members
We have to admit that over a period of time, we gradually drifted back to the practice of deformed Christianity
The elders should realize that the way that our Head, Christ, takes to build up His Body is to use all of His members
By trusting too much in these two categories of people, we spontaneously and unconsciously annul the one-talented ones
If such a situation is to be resurrected, the so-called clergy must be buried, and all the saints must be resurrected
Today people need to learn to use the computer because this is the computer age; otherwise, they will not be able to work effectively
The eldership in its shepherding is for the purpose of raising up all the saints, all the members, to function
We may have the label of practicing 1 Corinthians 14, but in actuality we do not have the practice of 1 Corinthians 14
If the elders want their church to be living, fresh, and even refreshing, they must know how to preach the gospel and prophesy
There are a number of saints who will not be able to take this way, but they will still appreciate your taking of the new way
You have to release everything concerning the church out of your hand, and let the saints share in these things
If you tutor the saints one by one, you will gradually gain a good number of saints to function in the meetings
You will be in fellowship with the church to whom you gave the gift, and they will be brought into fellowship with you
The circulation of the spiritual blood will become a strong factor in the Body to neutralize all the differences and take away any troubles
On the one hand, in the eyes of the Lord, all the churches are distinct, but on the other hand, they are all the same
The Lord's way is not to federate the churches, nor is it that the churches should be independent and separate from one another
Some of the co-workers may want to keep their locality or area of the country independent and, to some extent, isolated
If you have been working in one place for years, it might be good for you to take the initiative to go to another place
If you keep yourself isolated in your environment and situation, that will be a loss to you and to the Lord's interest
