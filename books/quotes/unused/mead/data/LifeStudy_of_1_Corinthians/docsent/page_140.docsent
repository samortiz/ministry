   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Becoming Idolaters</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 7 says, Neither become idolaters, as some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The abusive eating of the children of Israel was related to their idolatry in worshipping the golden calf Exo 32:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The apostle s word here implies that the Corinthians eating of idol sacrifices without any consideration was also somewhat related to idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 7 we have the biblical interpretation of idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Idolatry is to eat, drink, and play.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the children of Israel worshipped the golden calf, they sat down to eat and drink, and they stood up to play.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here to play means to have entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eating, drinking, and playing are equal to worshipping idols.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today people everywhere are committing idolatry in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever there is a holiday or a long weekend, they give themselves to play, to the pursuit of various kinds of entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, in many of today s Christian services there is the practice of idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the sight of God, the music and the dramas found in certain services are idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In many places Christians are not actually worshipping God they are practicing idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their way of service is idolatrous in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We also must be careful in the way we use musical instruments in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our singing should be for worship, not for fun.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we sing in the meetings, we need to have a genuine spirit of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If our singing becomes mere entertainment, that is idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The singing in the meetings of the church must not be play; it must be genuine worship offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>D. Committing Fornication</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 8 continues, Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and there fell in one day twenty-three thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fornication accompanies idolatry Num 25:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, these two things are referred to together, as also in Acts 15:20, 29.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Undoubtedly, the implication here is that these two evils also existed among the Corinthian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, these are the main things dealt with in chapters five through ten.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this verse Paul uses the word fell.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means to be strewn along, to be laid low on the ground by being slain.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who fell in this way were not properly buried.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead, they were scattered in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>E. Tempting the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 9 Paul goes on to say, Neither let us tempt the Lord, as some of them tempted and were destroyed by the serpents.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Literally, the Greek word for tempt means to try to the uttermost, to tempt out, to tempt thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to Numbers 21:6, those who tempted the Lord were destroyed by serpents.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>F. Murmuring against the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 10 says, Neither murmur, as some of them murmured and perished by the destroyer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The murmuring of the children of Israel Num 16:41 typified the negative speaking of the Corinthian believers against the apostle 1 Cor 4:3; 9:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The children of Israel who murmured perished; they were destroyed in death, laid low on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The destroyer mentioned in verse 10 is God s executing angel Exo 12:23; 2 Sam 24:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No doubt, by referring to the murmuring of the children of Israel Paul implies that the Corinthian believers should be careful about murmuring against him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>G. Types for Our Admonition unto Whom</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>the Ends of the Ages Have Come</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 11 Paul explains, Now these things happened to them as types, and were written for our admonition, unto whom the ends of the ages have come.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Again Paul says that the things that happened to the children of Israel in the wilderness are types.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These types were written for our admonition.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Admonition here implies a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verse 11 Paul speaks of the ends of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Greek word for ends also means fulfillment or consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The ends of the ages here refer to the New Testament age, from the Lord s first coming to His second coming Heb 9:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This implies that the New Testament age, in which we are, is the age of grace, when we may take the admonition concerning the history of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Following this age is the kingdom age, when these examples in the Old Testament age will no longer serve for our Christian race.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this verse Paul seems to be saying, This age, the age of grace, is the end of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Brothers, you are all in the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What happened to the children of Israel is still a type as an admonition for you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you do not heed the warning of this type and walk in the light of this warning, you will miss the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When this age is over, these types of the children of Israel will no longer serve you.</S>
