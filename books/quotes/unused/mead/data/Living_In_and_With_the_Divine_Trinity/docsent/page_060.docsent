   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many Christians do not think about God's move in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some in the Pentecostal movement like to shout, cry out, and even jump.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They like a big, outward display, but God's inward operating in us does not necessarily have such an outward display.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The current of electricity in a building is a very good illustration of God's operating.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we enter into the building, it may seem that nothing is working there because everything is quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, there is an operating going on, and this quiet operating is vigorous.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The operating of the electricity in the building enables all the appliances, machines, and devices in the building to move and function.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If this electricity is switched off, everything in the building is shut down.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more I have experienced God throughout the years, the more I realize that God's move within us is a very quiet, fine operation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He operates in us finely and quietly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although we are Christians, it may seem that we have nothing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may wonder at times what the difference is between us and the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The truth concerning regeneration and transformation is very high and great.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even though we have been regenerated and are being transformed, we may feel like common persons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, however, God is operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although a big building is under the operation of electricity, this operation is quiet and calm.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to see that God's operating in us is a miraculous normality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is altogether normal, yet altogether miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>D.L. Moody said that the greatest miracle in the universe is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No miracle is greater than regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regeneration means that we have the divine life in addition to our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have the divine life, but we may not feel that we can see much of the manifestation of this life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may feel that others who are not regenerated are actually better than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even though we are regenerated, we may lose our temper again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, our being better or worse than others is an outward matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are regenerated, we have the inner realization that something is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This "something" is the living and moving God who is now operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether a person is outwardly bad or good may be according to his natural birth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What matters is not whether we are good or bad according to our natural constitution, but the fact that we have received the operating God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is now operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul used great words in the book of Philippians to speak of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He said that he magnified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To magnify is to show or declare great without limitation , to exalt, and to extol.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and he says that for him to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the end of Philippians, Paul said, "All the saints greet you, and especially those of Caesar's household" 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Caesar's household comprised all who were attached to the palace of Nero.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some of these were converted through contact with Paul and became believers in Christ in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No doubt, some in Caesar's household became Christians because they saw Christ in Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The majority, however, did not see Christ in Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Surely Christ was with Paul all the time, but many did not see.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Seeing Christ in such a way depends upon the Lord's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It depends upon whether God has chosen or predestinated someone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul magnified Christ before everyone, but not everyone saw this magnification.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This was because they did not receive the Lord's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They were not chosen or predestinated.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's operating in us is not outwardly spectacular, but in a spiritual sense it is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have the spiritual discernment, the spiritual realizing power, we can see that all the things in the book of Philippians related to God's operating in us are great.</S>
