   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO GOD S PLAN CONCERNING THE CHURCH 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The origin of the church is God s eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church did not come into existence by coincidence.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Neither did the church come into being simply because a group of sinners were saved by God and gathered together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, the church was planned by God in eternity before the creation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everyone learning to take God s way must be clear regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many times our concept regarding the church is too natural and lacking in revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We think that when a group of sinners in the world is saved by God from perdition and gathers together to meet, to worship God, and to serve God, these sinners become the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This thought is altogether according to our human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must see the church from a divine, heavenly, and eternal perspective.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In eternity past God planned to have the church, whether or not we sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who know the Bible know that God created the universe to gain the church; the church is the center of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If God did not intend to gain the church, He would not have created the universe and all things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The creation of all things was for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All God s plans and all His intentions are to gain the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Revelation 21 and 22, after God completes all His work, the new heavens and new earth are the boundary, the new creation is the means, and the New Jerusalem is the new center.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate expression of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This clearly shows that God created the universe in order to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, the church was planned by God in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can illustrate God s plan concerning the church with the following few points.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Being the Economy of God</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word economy can be translated as management or dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s plan concerning the church is God s economy or, we may say, God s management.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the economy that is spoken of in Ephesians 1:10 and 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Most English versions translate this word as administration, but some translate it as economy, and others as dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The best translation is economy, meaning that God manages something for a particular purpose of administration, management, and arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that before the creation of all things, God had a plan in Himself to manage a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This economy has a dispensation, an arrangement, and an administrative management.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who have entered into the Word with some depth can touch this thought in God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In an economy there are three main factors: the resource, the energy, and the means.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In God s eternal plan He Himself carries out the work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, God carries out His economy with Himself as the resource, His power as the energy, and His wisdom as the means.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In eternity God s plan, God s dispensation, to obtain the church involved using Himself as the resource, His power as the energy, and His wisdom as the means.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These three crucial factors in God s economy are revealed clearly in the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God Himself</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, in eternity when God planned the church, He intended to carry out His plan Himself, that is, to use Himself as the resource.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the Ministry of Economic Affairs intends to operate a hydroelectric plant, it must have certain resources.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The ability of the hydroelectric plant to operate depends upon these resources.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God in His plan desires to obtain the church, and the resource that He uses is Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, Ephesians 1:23 says that the church is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, and 3:19 says, That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In addition, Colossians 2:9-10 says, In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you have been made full in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These verses show that God uses Himself as the resource to produce the church, that is, to make the church full.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God uses all His fullness as the resource to carry out His plan for the church, that is, as the material to build up the church.</S>
