   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In 2 Corinthians 12:14 Paul said, "Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This was Paul's attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How stern he was toward himself!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some had spoken against Paul and had a problem with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, when Paul was ready to go to them the third time, he was not a burden to them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 14 he continued, saying, "For I do not seek what is yours but you."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Was he being narrow-minded and mean?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No. He continued in the same verse, saying, "For the children ought not to store up for the parents, but the parents for the children." Brothers and sisters, do you see how sweet Paul's attitude before God was? The Corinthians heard many rumors and said many things about Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, Paul was forced to decline their gifts, but even though he declined their gifts, he did not shrink from the responsibility of teaching them about money.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second Corinthians may be the book that touches the matter of money the most.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Had Paul refrained from any speaking of money, some could have construed that Paul was offended by the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But he was not offended, because money had so little influence over him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He went on to teach the Corinthians about money.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He told them to send the money to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did not advise them not to send it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was above money; therefore, he was above the Corinthians' attitude towards him personally.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He refused their gift because he wanted to maintain his dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet he boasted to the Macedonians that the Corinthians were well prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the same time, he entreated the brothers to make their promised blessing ready beforehand, lest they be put to shame by their unpreparedness when the Macedonians came to them 9:2, 4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His personal feelings were completely set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's servants must be delivered from the influence of money.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Had Paul not been delivered from money, the Corinthians would never have heard such a message.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul would still have spoken to the Ephesians or the Philippians, but he would not have spoken to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But Paul still went after the Corinthians; he would not give up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He continued to talk to the Corinthians about money.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He showed them that God could use their money, but that he himself would not; he did not want anything from them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this matter, he did not become burdensome to them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, he still expected them to have a way to go on in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brothers and sisters, can we differentiate between them and theirs whenever we communicate with others in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we see the brothers, are we after them or after theirs?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If they have a problem with us and we cannot gain their hearts, will we still support them, edify them, and pray for their growth?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul had plenty of reasons to turn away from the Corinthians, but he came to them again and again, and even a third time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet he was not after their possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a great temptation to God's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to learn to do what our brother Paul did.</S>
