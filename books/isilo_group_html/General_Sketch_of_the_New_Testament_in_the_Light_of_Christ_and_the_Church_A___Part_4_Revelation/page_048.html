and the Name of God and of the Lamb<br />
Being on Their Forehead</h2>
<p>Verse 4 continues, &ldquo;And they will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads.&rdquo; That those who serve God will see His face indicates that genuine service leads us into fellowship and the presence of the Lord. Whether or not our service is proper can be checked in this way: Does our service lead us into the Lord&rsquo;s presence? The more some people serve, the more they do not have the fellowship of the Lord and the more they lose His presence. This means that their service is wrong. The right way to serve is that the more we serve, the more we see His face. Moreover, because His name will be on the foreheads of God&rsquo;s redeemed, people will quickly recognize that these persons belong to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being under the Illumination of the Lord God</h2>
<p>Verse 5 says, &ldquo;And night will be no more; and they have no need of the light of a lamp and of the light of the sun, for the Lord God will shine upon them; and they will reign forever and ever.&rdquo; The light of a lamp is made by man, and the light of the sun is natural light. In the holy city we will have no need for human-manufactured light or natural light. The outer court of the tabernacle in the ancient times required the light of the sun, and the Holy Place needed the light from the lampstand. However, in the Holy of Holies there is no need for the sun or a lamp because there God Himself is the light. Again, this proves that the holy city is the Holy of Holies.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Reigning Forever</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s redeemed in eternity will reign forever and ever. On the one hand, they will be priests coming to the Lord to serve Him, while on the other hand, they will be kings going to the people to reign over the nations. First Peter 2:5 and 9 speak of two kinds of priesthood, the holy priesthood and the royal priesthood. According to the holy priesthood, we go to God, while according to the royal priesthood we go to people. When we go to the Lord to pray for others, we are the holy priests, and when we come out from the presence of the Lord to minister to people, we are the royal priests. When we come into the Lord&rsquo;s presence, we are priests according to the order of Aaron, and when we come out from the presence of God to minister something of God to people, we are priests according to the order of Melchisedec, who ministered bread and wine (Heb. 5:6, 10; 6:20; 7:11, 17; Gen. 14:18). For eternity God will be everything to us. He will mingle Himself with us, dwell among us, and make us one with Him to serve Him as priests and reign with Him as kings.</p>
<p>In Revelation 22:1 through 5, God sits on the throne with authority as the very center of the holy city. Out of the throne issues the flowing river of water of life, and in this flow there is the supply of life. Along this flow there is a street. Moreover, this very God in Christ is our temple, and He is the light in the holy city. God Himself in Christ is everything to us. As we read this portion of the Word, we mainly find God Himself. The water we drink, the food we eat, the street we walk on, the temple in which we serve, and the illumination by which we live will all be God Himself in Christ. At that time God will be everything to us. Other than God we will need nothing.</p>
<p>How do we enter into this experience? It is by the gates of pearl, the death and resurrection of Christ. Therefore, we have to be regenerated and transformed. All the natural, sinful, and old things must be filtered out by the cross, by the death of Christ, at the pearl gates. Only that which is regenerated and transformed can pass through the pearl gates. Then, after entering by the pearl gates, we walk on the way of the divine life and nature. In this way we have the flow of life, and in this flow of life there is the supply of life. Day by day we enjoy the Holy Spirit with the all-inclusive Christ as our supply. We are under the headship, the kingship, and the authority of God in Christ in the fellowship of the flowing Holy Spirit. In this way the Triune God is mingled with us, and the work of the Holy Spirit produces precious stones that are good for the building.</p>
<p>These experiences must be the model, pattern, reality, and goal of every church as a local expression of the Body of Christ. In the church there must be nothing sinful, fleshly, soulish, worldly, or individualistic. Everything must be divine and even human, yet in resurrection. Everyone must be regenerated, transformed, and built up together in harmony to express God.</p>
<p>In the picture of the holy city we see the Triune God. God is the light and Christ the Son is the lamp. Moreover, God in Christ is on the throne, and out of the throne the Holy Spirit flows as the living water to bring God&rsquo;s authority and the life supply of the Son to minister to God&rsquo;s redeemed. In this way the entire city will feed on the Triune God, live by the Triune God, and be mingled with the Triune God to be built up together as one corporate Body to express Him, serve Him, and reign with Him to fulfill His eternal purpose. This is all that I can say with human utterance. This is wonderful!</p>
<p>Moreover, this must be our goal. All our daily walk, living, work, and activity must be toward this goal. This is the ultimate conclusion of the entire Scriptures. God&rsquo;s eternal plan is to reach this goal. After reading Revelation 21 and 22 we can look back at the sixty-six books of the Bible and see that this is the very goal of all of God&rsquo;s work, both in creation and in redemption. God&rsquo;s goal is to have the corporate Body of Christ to express the Triune God. This must also be our goal today.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, A - Part 4: Revelation &nbsp; pg 48</div><br></body></html>
