<P>Young people, you all must study. Do not use the three weekly life-study messages as an excuse. You must both study earnestly and read the life-study messages. Otherwise, I would have no trust in you because the Lord would put no trust in you. You must acquire the "Tyrian" knowledge and graduate from the "University of Tyre." But after you gain your "Tyrian" education, you must put your "Tyrian" father in a coffin and bury him, so that your "Danite" mother becomes a widow. Then you will be of the tribe of Naphtali, useful in resurrection for God's building.</P><P>Some may ask me about the Apostles Peter and John, pointing out that they had no higher education and that in Acts 4:13 they were described as "uneducated and unlearned men." This, of course, is true. But who was the leading pillar builder in the New Testament? Undoubtedly, it was Paul. Peter wrote just two Epistles, but Paul wrote fourteen Epistles. Peter even recognized his shortage by recommending Paul's writings, saying, "Our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you" (2 Pet. 3:15). Peter even confessed that some of Paul's writings were difficult to understand (2 Pet. 3:16). Peter seemed to be saying, "You must read Paul's writings to learn something deeper than I can give you." We need Peters today, but we also need Pauls, those who can write more epistles. Some may still say, "How about the Apostle John? Didn't he write a gospel containing twenty-one chapters and the book of Revelation containing twenty-two chapters?" John's "Tyrian" education only enabled him to do this much; he could not do what Paul was able to do. John could say, "In the beginning was the Word," "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men," and "Behold, the Lamb of God." John could tell people that if they believed in Him, they would have life, but that if they did not believe in Him, they would die. But John was not able to write Romans chapters four or seven or the book of Ephesians. If John had been asked to do this, he might have said, "I am not able to do it. Go to Brother Paul." John was qualified to see the vision of the great harlot and of the New Jerusalem, but he was not the one to write books like Romans, Ephesians, and Hebrews.</P><P>There is a need in the Lord's recovery today for those with the highest education. Young people, you must endeavor to gain the best education. Arrange your daily schedule in this way: seven and a half hours for sleep, one and a half hours for eating, one hour for exercise, eight hours for study, and six hours for spiritual things. If you expend your energy in this way, by the time you are thirty you will be able to begin your ministry like the Lord Jesus did (Luke 3:23). Continue your studies until you are thirty. If many take this way, we shall have no shortage of pillar makers.</P><P>Do not get married too soon. I do not like to see the brothers getting married before the age of twenty-five. Do not be burdened down too soon with marriage and children. Rather, use your time and energy for studying. The age of twenty-six is soon enough for brothers to begin having children. Furthermore, I do not like to see the sisters getting married before the age of twenty-two. If the sisters marry too early and have children too soon, they may be overburdened and even spoiled. Follow the schedule I recommend until you are twenty-five years old and see what will be the issue. This surely is good for God's recovery.</P><P>Are you anxious to be a Hiram? If you are, then you must be related to your "Tyrian" father, learn the "Tyrian" skill and trade, and gain the wisdom of the "Egyptians." Do not stop your schooling too soon. You should get a master's degree, or preferably a Ph.D. All the church people must be learned ones. We are neither ignorant nor undereducated. Rather, we would have the highest education. We would acquire all the wisdom of the "Egyptians," but we would not work for the "Egyptians"&#151;we would work for the holy tabernacle. We should be able to say, "I know medicine and nuclear science, but I am not working for that. I am working for the building up of the church. I have learned a trade, but I am not occupied with this. I am building the pillars for the temple of my God." For this, our "Tyrian" father must die, our "Danite" mother must be widowed, and we must belong to the tribe of "Naphtali," the tribe of transformation. Be a person full of learning, but do not use your learning for secular business. Use it fully for the Lord's building work. Your life and your being must not only be transformed but also transferred. You must no longer be of "Dan" or of "Tyre," but absolutely of "Naphtali." As hinds that have been freed, we would trust in God, walk upon the mountaintops, and live in resurrection for the church life, giving forth words of life, grace, salvation, wisdom, knowledge, and building. If we are like this, then we shall be builders of pillars.</P>
