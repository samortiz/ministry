[1]  Messages for Building Up New Believers, Vol. 1 CONTENTS
[2]  FOR THE BUILDING UP OF NEW BELIEVERS A Talk with Co-workers on July 12, 1950 THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BUILDING UP
[3]  At the very beginning of his Christian life, every new believer should be taught emphatically to have no trust in himself.
[4]  Baptism means the burial of everything of the past.
[5]  Suppose that a person who is fifty years old is saved and about to be baptized.
[6]  The meaning of baptism for him is not just that the Lord buries his life but, more specifically, that the Lord takes away every one of the fifty years of his former life.
[7]  In delivering a lesson, the main goal is not to help the new believers understand more teachings but to do some carving work on them.
[8]  One should pay attention to the areas that require carving; he should know what needs to be torn down and what needs to be added.
[9]  Questions should be pertinent and limited to the subject of the lesson.
[10]  CHAPTER ONE BAPTISM Scripture Reading: Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; 22:16; 1 Pet 3:20-21; Rom 6:3-4; Col 2:12
[11]  We need to be clear about two aspects concerning baptism.
[12]  First, before we are baptized, we need to be clear as to what baptism can do for us.
[13]  Second, after we are baptized, we need to look backward and ask, What is the significance of baptism?
[14]  Because Adam sinned and became a sinner, all men became sinners.
[15]  Today God has saved you from among many men.
[16]  If you are on the world s side, no matter what kind of person you are, you are opposed to God, and you are God s enemy.
[17]  There are four major facts concerning the world as shown in the Bible: 1 The world is condemned in the eyes of God, 2 the world lies in the evil one, 3 the world has crucified the Lord Jesus, and 4 the world is at enmity with God; it is God s enemy.
[18]  C. Baptism Being for the Washing Away of Sins
[19]  Ananias came to Paul and said to him, Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name Acts 22:16 .
[20]  The above four portions of the Scripture clearly show us what baptism is.
[21]  Once we are baptized, we are freed from the world.
[22]  You must see the position of the world before God.
[23]  Once we believe in the Lord, we should realize that we are no longer a part of the world.
[24]  God is telling them, Do you not know that when you were baptized, you died together with Christ and were buried and resurrected together with Him?
[25]  Brothers, when we step into the water of baptism or when we look back after being believers for many years, we must remember that we are already dead.
[26]  We allowed others to bury us because we believed that we were already dead.
[27]  If our heart is still beating and we are still breathing, we cannot be buried.
[28]  As soon as this gospel is preached to us, we should learn to look from God s viewpoint and acknowledge that we have died in the Lord.
[29]  Today we come to the question of how a person deals with his past after believing in the Lord.
[30]  After believing in the Lord, a person still carries many things of the past with him.
[31]  The entire Bible, both the Old Testament and the New Testament, but especially the New Testament, shows that God does not pay attention to what a person does before he believes in the Lord.
[32]  Even the Epistles, which touch on our wrongdoings in the past, mainly tell us what we should do hereafter, not what we should do about our past.
[33]  The books of Ephesians, Colossians, and 1 Thessalonians all cover something about our past, but they do not tell us how we should terminate our past; they only tell us how we should go on.
[34]  But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God 1 Cor 6:11b .
[35]  And you, though dead in your offenses and sins, in which you once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience; among whom we also all conducted ourselves once in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest; but God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ Eph 2:1-5 .
[36]  There is only one termination our Lord s termination of everything for us based upon the great love with which God loved us and the rich mercy of God.
[37]  This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness...that you put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.
[38]  What then should we do with the things of our past?
[39]  In reading the New Testament, I have spent much time to find out how one should terminate his past after believing in the Lord.
[40]  And a considerable number of those who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them before all; and they counted up the price of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver Acts 19:19 .
[41]  This is another matter which new believers should deal with and terminate.
[42]  This is not a command or a teaching; it is the result of the work of the Holy Spirit.
[43]  When a person is saved, he surely has many unsettled secular matters at hand.
[44]  These may easily hinder him from following the Lord.
[45]  Here, a man came to Jesus and said to Him, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father v. 21 . The Lord said, Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.
[46]  CHAPTER THREE CONSECRATION Scripture Reading: Exo 28:1-2, 40-41; 29:1-25; Lev 8:14-28; Rom 6:13, 16, 19; 12:1; 1 Cor 6:19-20; 2 Cor 5:14-15
[47]  Let us now turn to the matter of Christian consecration.
[48]  Whether or not a person consecrates himself depends on whether he has a healthy salvation experience.
[49]  If he views his faith in the Lord Jesus as being a favor to the Lord and his faith in God as a courtesy to Him, it will be impossible to talk to him about consecration.
[50]  It is equally futile to talk about consecration to a person who feels that he is promoting the cause of Christianity and that his conversion is a great honor to it.
[51]  Although consecration is the first basic experience of our service to God, we do not find many direct teachings from God s Word concerning it.
[52]  Second Corinthians 5:14-15 clearly shows us that the constraining power of the Lord s love is the basis for God s children to live unto Him who died for them and has been raised.
[53]  We are no longer our own; we are the Lord s. We must glorify God in our bodies because we are not our own; we have been bought by the Lord with a price.
[54]  Merely being constrained by love or acknowledging His legal right does not constitute consecration.
[55]  After a person has been constrained by the Lord s love and has acknowledged His right, there is a further step that he should take.
[56]  Through the Lord s constraining and based on His purchase, we separate ourselves from every other thing.
[57]  Leviticus 8:14-28 speaks of a bull, two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread.
[58]  In order to receive the holy service before God, that is, in order to consecrate oneself to God, the first thing that has to be taken care of is the propitiation for sin.
[59]  The burnt offering is the sweet savor of the Lord Jesus before God that secures God s acceptance of Him.
[60]  This means that since God has accepted us in Christ, we should acknowledge the blood s separation of our ears, hands, and feet fully unto God.
[61]  We should declare that our ears, hands, and feet are fully God s. Because of redemption, our ears, which were made for hearing, should now hear for God; our hands, which were made for working, should now work for God.
[62]  After the sprinkling of the blood, there was the wave offering.
[63]  Our two ears will only listen to the Lord s word, our two hands will only do the Lord s work, and our two feet will only walk the way of the Lord.
[64]  The goal of consecration is not to become a preacher for God or to work for Him.
[65]  To wait upon God means that you stand when He wants you to stand.
[66]  If He wants to shuffle you aside, you allow Him to shuffle you aside, and if He wants you to run, you run.
[67]  CHAPTER FOUR CONFESSION WITH THE MOUTH Scripture Reading: Rom 10:10; Prov 29:25; Matt 10:32-33 I. THE IMPORTANCE
[68]  Once a person has believed in the Lord, he should not keep the matter a secret; he has to confess the Lord with his mouth.
[69]  Confessing the Lord with our mouth is a very important matter.
[70]  Likewise, if a new believer does not confess the Lord immediately after he believes in the Lord, I am afraid he will be dumb for the rest of his life.
[71]  There is great profit when one confesses with his mouth after he has believed in his heart.
[72]  Suppose you do not open your mouth and say, I have decided to follow the Lord Jesus; I am His now.
[73]  In your heart you realize that you are a Christian and that it is wrong for you to be among them.
[74]  If you do not confess with your mouth, that is, if you are a Christian secretly, you will experience much more difficulty than those who are Christians openly.
[75]  In John 9 the Jews made a decision: Whoever confessed Jesus to be the Christ would be put out of the synagogue v. 22 . In chapter twelve the Bible says that many Jewish rulers believed in the Lord Jesus secretly, but they dared not confess Him because they were afraid of being put out of the synagogue v. 42 . Do you think that these people had peace in their hearts? Perhaps they felt uneasy about confessing the Lord, but they felt even more uneasy about not confessing the Lord.
[76]  They think that having good behavior is the most important thing for a Christian and that confession with the mouth is not that crucial.
[77]  They think that a change in what one says is not important, but that a change in what one does is important.
[78]  Some people dare not confess because they are afraid of men.
[79]  Many people can honestly say that they have no other reservation in their heart; they are willing to stand up and confess, but when they see the faces of others, they become afraid.
[80]  This is where many people are stumbled; they are afraid of men and do not have any boldness to open their mouth.
[81]  Why did the rulers in John 12 not confess the Lord?
[82]  They did not confess the Lord because they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
[83]  Many people dare not confess because they want both; they want Christ, and they also want the synagogue.
[84]  If people persecute you after you have confessed the Lord with your mouth, you should also say, Lord, I thank You.
[85]  If Peter had returned home and remained silent after he believed in the Lord, if Paul, Luke, Darby, and the rest had remained silent after they believed, and if everyone in the church had remained silent and dared not confess the Lord, their troubles definitely would have been less, but there would be no church on earth today!
[86]  The Lord also said, But whoever will deny Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father who is in the heavens v. 33 . But he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God Luke 12:9 . What a great contrast! All we have to do is confess that this excellent One, this chiefest among ten thousand, is the Son of God.
[87]  If today we find it difficult to confess Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, then on that day, when our Lord comes back, He will find it difficult to confess us before His Father and all the glorious angels.
[88]  CHAPTER FIVE SEPARATION FROM THE WORLD Scripture Reading: Exo 10:8-11, 21-26; 12:6-11, 37-42; 2 Cor 6:17
[89]  There are many commandments in the Bible concerning separation from the world.
[90]  The Old Testament contains many examples and teachings concerning this.
[91]  The story of Israel s exodus from Egypt shows us how difficult it was for them to leave Egypt!
[92]  Egypt tried to hold them back again and again.
[93]  He knew that if a person served God in Egypt, he would not have a testimony and he would have to serve Pharaoh in the end. Even though one wanted to be God s servant, he would eventually end up being Satan s servant.
[94]  Today we Christians must come out of the system and the organization of the world.
[95]  Leaving the world refers to our deliverance from the moral world, not the physical world.
[96]  In other words, we are still living in the world, but this world has become a wilderness to us.
[97]  We should refrain from anything that the world considers improper for Christians to do.
[98]  If you do not meet this standard, you have failed them.
[99]  When you do something, you should not give the Gentiles any ground to ask, Do Christians do this?
[100]  It is difficult for us to point out the world item by item; the list is endless.
[101]  But we should grasp one basic principle: everything that quenches one s spiritual life in the Lord is the world.
[102]  The world is anything that kills one s zeal for prayer to God.
[103]  The world is anything that takes away one s interest in God s Word.
[104]  Second Corinthians 6:17-18 says, Therefore come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you ; and I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty.
[105]  El is God, sha is a mother s breast or milk, and shadai means something that is with milk.
[106]  The words Almighty God in the Old Testament are also Elshadai, which should be translated as the All-sufficient God.
[107]  Second Corinthians 6:17 tells us that if we come out from their midst and do not touch their unclean things, God will welcome us and be a Father to us.
[108]  CHAPTER SIX JOINING THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 2:19, 22; 1 Cor 12:13, 27
[109]  The immediate question every believer asks after his conversion concerns joining a church.
[110]  We have covered the matter of separation from the world.
[111]  This does not mean, however, that a person only needs to separate himself from the world and then can stop there.
[112]  We must remember that while we receive God s life to be His children individually, the life we obtain is also in thousands of other children of God.
[113]  But today God dwells in the church; the church has now become the dwelling place of God.
[114]  We as God s many children have been gathered together by the Holy Spirit to be the dwelling place of God.
[115]  Third, we are joined together in the Body of Christ to become one Body.
[116]  As God s dwelling place, even though I am a living stone, I can be left alone if I do not like to be built with others.
[117]  But many sober-minded persons will not automatically accept your church just because you have introduced them to the Lord.
[118]  No matter how big a church is, it cannot extend beyond the boundary of its locality.
[119]  At the same time, no matter how small a church is, it cannot have anything less than the locality as its unit.
[120]  If a church is smaller than a locality, it is not a church.
[121]  The Bible does not say anything about joining the church.
[122]  If you are in, you are in; if you are not in, you are not in. Being a part of the church does not mean that one passes a test that qualifies him to be a member of a church.
[123]  If a person sees something concerning sin and the blood through God s mercy and if he has received salvation, forgiveness, and a new life, having been regenerated through resurrection by God, He has put such a one into the church already.
[124]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE LAYING ON OF HANDS Scripture Reading: Heb 6:1-2; Acts 8:14-17; 19:5-6; Psa 133; Lev 1:4; 3:2, 8, 13; 4:4, 15, 24, 29, 33
[125]  The Bible clearly shows us that a man needs to be baptized.
[126]  Today, if God s children are only baptized without experiencing the laying on of hands, their experience is not complete.
[127]  Laying hands on an animal s head in Leviticus 1 meant that the offerer and the offering were united as one.
[128]  This poses a question: Why did a person who came to the Lord to offer something, whether it was a sin offering or a burnt offering, not offer himself instead of a bull or a goat?
[129]  If we have to put ourselves in the fire, does this not mean that God s demand is more severe than Molech s demand?
[130]  First, let us explain briefly the Body of Christ and the anointing.
[131]  This man subjected Himself perfectly to God; He absolutely represented God and absolutely lived out the life of God.
[132]  When God poured His Spirit upon Him and endued Him with the Spirit, God did not pour the Spirit upon Him individually.
[133]  The Lord Jesus did not receive the anointing from God as an individual; He was standing in the position of the Head of the Body when He received the Spirit upon His head.
[134]  God s Word shows us that each time a person is baptized into Christ, the representative authority established by God, such as the apostles, should lay hands upon such a one on behalf of the Head and the Body.
[135]  When an apostle, who represents the church, lays his hands on you and says, Brother, you are one with the Body of Christ, the anointing from the Head will flow to you.
[136]  Therefore, when an apostle s hand is upon your head, it is not only the church that is laying hands on you but also Christ who is laying His hands on you.
[137]  THE LAYING ON OF HANDS IN ACTS A. The Case in Samaria
[138]  Finally, we should look at the two cases in Samaria and Ephesus.
[139]  As a result of Philip s evangelistic visit to Samaria, a group of people believed and were baptized.
[140]  There is only one exception in the Bible concerning the laying on of hands.
[141]  Cornelius s house was an exception because after Pentecost, all the apostles thought that the Lord s grace was confined to the Jews.
[142]  CHAPTER EIGHT ABOLISHING ALL DISTINCTIONS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:13; Gal 3:27-28; Col 3:10-11 I. BELIEVERS BEING ONE IN CHRIST
[143]  After a new believer has received the laying on of hands, has come into the church, and has come under the headship of Christ, he has to see the oneness of believers in the Body of Christ.
[144]  In other words, he has to realize the abolishment of all distinctions.
[145]  This means that there should be no distinctions among believers who have become one in Christ.
[146]  THE ANNULLING OF NATIONALITY A. There Being No Distinction
[147]  Another intransigent relationship in human society is class distinctions.
[148]  We do not experience national distinctions too much unless we meet foreigners.
[149]  The fourth distinction that has been abolished in Christ is that of gender, that is, the distinction between male and female.
[150]  Therefore come out from their midst...and I will welcome you ; and I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me. After we have believed in God and are delivered and separated from the world and its polluted and unclean influence, God will receive us like a Father, and we will be His sons and His daughters.
[151]  The book of Colossians speaks of two kinds of peoples barbarians and Scythians.
[152]  We know that the Jews are circumcised with a mark on their bodies, indicating that they belong to God, that they fear God, and that they deny the flesh.
[153]  They think that only those who are circumcised are under God s covenant, while those who are not circumcised are not under His covenant.
[154]  CHAPTER NINE READING THE BIBLE Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:15-17; Psa 119:9-11, 15, 105, 140, 148 I. THE IMPORTANCE OF READING THE BIBLE
[155]  Every Christian should read the Bible because it is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness 2 Tim 3:16 .
[156]  It shows us many things that God has done for us and the way He has led men in the past.
[157]  If we want to know the riches and vastness of God s provision for us, we must read the Bible.
[158]  If we want to see God s step-by-step guidance for men, we must read the Bible as well.
[159]  God s speaking to man today is based upon what He has already spoken in the past.
[160]  God rarely speaks things which He has not already spoken in the Bible.
[161]  Even though a person may be quite advanced in his spiritual walk, God s revelation to him will still be confined to the words that He has spoken in the Bible.
[162]  If a person does not know what God has spoken in the past, it is difficult for him to receive His revelation in the present because he lacks the basis for God s speaking.
[163]  If we do not know what God has said in the past, He cannot speak through us to others, and we are useless in the eyes of God.
[164]  Everyone who wants to know God must study His Word in a serious way, and every believer should realize the importance of reading God s Word from the very beginning of his Christian life.
[165]  After we have analyzed the facts accurately, categorized them properly, and compared them clearly before God, we will have the ground to take on the fourth point God s enlightening.
[166]  John 14:16-20 says, And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.
[167]  We should read our Bible during two different periods of time.
[168]  We should have two copies of the Bible for these two occasions.
[169]  In the morning period or the first half of the early morning reading, we should meditate, praise, and pray as we read the Word, mixing our reading with meditation, praise, and prayer.
[170]  For I might seek to set the truth before the unconverted, I might seek to benefit believers, I might seek to relieve the distressed, I might in other ways seek to behave myself as it becomes a child of God in this world; and yet, not being happy in the Lord, and not being nourished and strengthened in my inner man day by day, all this might not be attended to in a right spirit.
[171]  Now, I saw that the most important thing I had to do was to give myself to the reading of the word of God, and to meditation on it, that thus my heart might be comforted, encouraged, warned, reproved, instructed; and that thus, by means of the word of God, whilst meditating on it, my heart might be brought into experimental communion with the Lord.
[172]  The first thing I did, after having asked in a few words the Lord s blessing upon his precious word, was, to begin to meditate on the word of God, searching as it were into every verse, to get blessing out of it; not for the sake of the public ministry of the word, not for the sake of preaching on what I had meditated upon, but for the sake of obtaining food for my own soul.
[173]  Now, prayer, in order to be continued for any length of time in any other than a formal manner, requires, generally speaking, a measure of strength or godly desire, and the season, therefore, when this exercise of the soul can be most effectually performed is after the inner man has been nourished by meditation on the word of God, where we find our Father speaking to us, to encourage us, to comfort us, to instruct us, to humble us, to reprove us.
[174]  By the blessing of God I ascribe to this mode the help and strength which I had had from God to pass in peace through deeper trials, in various ways, than I had ever had before; and after having now above fourteen years tried this way, I can most fully, in the fear of God, commend it....
[175]  A new believer who recently has received the Lord should not engage himself in intense research of the Bible for at least six months because he is not familiar with the Bible as a whole yet.
[176]  He should rather spend a few months to read through the whole Bible and familiarize himself with it in a general way.
[177]  The second twenty minutes can be used for word study.
[178]  There are many special terms like reconciliation, blood, faith, joy, peace,hope, love, obedience, righteousness, redemption, mercy, etc., which are scattered throughout the Bible, and they all are very meaningful.
[179]  There are many topics in the Bible, such as creation, man, sin, salvation, repentance, the Holy Spirit, regeneration, sanctification, justification, forgiveness, freedom, the Body of Christ, the Lord s coming, judgment, the kingdom, eternity, etc. You can choose certain topics and then gather information about them from the Bible.
[180]  CHAPTER TEN PRAYER Scripture Reading: John 16:24; James 4:2-3; Luke 11:9-10; Psa 66:18; Mark 11:24; Luke 18:1-8 I. PRAYER BEING A BASIC CHRISTIAN RIGHT
[181]  Christians have a basic right while living on earth today, the right to receive answers to prayers.
[182]  The moment a person is regenerated, God gives him the basic right to ask of Him and to be heard by Him.
[183]  John 16 says that God answers when we ask in the name of the Lord so that our joy may be made full.
[184]  If we pray without ceasing, we will live a Christian life that is full of joy on earth today.
[185]  If we unceasingly pray, yet God does not unceasingly answer our prayer, or if we have been a Christian for years and God hardly or never listens to our prayers, there must be something seriously wrong.
[186]  We should ask, but there is a second condition to prayer; we should not ask evilly.
[187]  You ask and do not receive because you ask evilly James 4:3 .
[188]  While God often gives us superabundantly above all that we ask or think Eph 3:20 , asking evilly is a different matter.
[189]  A condition on the positive side for having prayer answered is faith.
[190]  The Lord Jesus said, All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them v. 24 . We must believe when we pray.
[191]  If we believe that we have received what we are praying for, we will have them.
[192]  We hope that as soon as a person has received the Lord, even a week after his conversion, he will know what faith is.
[193]  The Lord said to the paralytic, Child, your sins are forgiven v. 5 . Some scribes reasoned in their hearts, saying, Why is this man speaking this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except One, God? v. 7 . In their hearts they thought that only God could forgive sins and that Jesus could not.
[194]  It is true that God can do everything, but how do I know that He is willing to heal me?
[195]  Perhaps the Lord is not willing to heal me.
[196]  Another point about prayer which requires attention is that we must persevere in prayer and never stop praying.
[197]  Luke 18:1 says, They ought always to pray and not lose heart.
[198]  One has to pray to such an extent that the prayer seems to wear out the Lord and force Him to answer.
[199]  The Lord said, Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth? v. 8 . This faith is different from the faith spoken of earlier, but they are not contradictory.
[200]  If you do not have a heart to pray, how can you expect God to have a heart to listen?
[201]  CHAPTER ELEVEN EARLY RISING Scripture Reading: S.S. 7:12; Psa 57:8-9; 63:1; 78:34; 90:14; 108:2-3; Exo 16:21 I. EARLY MORNING BEING THE BEST TIME OF THE DAY
[202]  A sister once put it well when she said, How much a person loves the Lord can be judged primarily by the way he chooses between his bed and the Lord.
[203]  Do you love your bed or the Lord more?
[204]  If you love your bed more, you sleep a little longer.
[205]  In the Bible we find God s servants rising up early in the morning.
[206]  Although there is no commandment in the Bible that tells us to get up early, there are sufficient examples in the Bible to show us that all faithful servants of God rise up early.
[207]  There must be the sound of praise and singing in the early morning.
[208]  The early morning is the best time to sing praises to God.
[209]  It means to enjoy Christ, to enjoy God s Word, and to enjoy His truth early in the morning every day.
[210]  In the early morning we should fellowship, praise, and gather the manna.
[211]  Every believer should do these four things conscientiously before the Lord early in the morning: fellowship with Him, praise Him, read the Bible, and pray to Him.
[212]  CHAPTER TWELVE MEETING Scripture Reading: Heb 10:25; Matt 18:20; Acts 2:42; 1 Cor 14:23, 26 I. CORPORATE GRACE BEING FOUND IN THE MEETING
[213]  God s Word says, Not abandoning our own assembling together Heb 10:25 .
[214]  Because God dispenses His grace to us through the assembling together.
[215]  God s grace to man can be divided into two categories personal and corporate.
[216]  God gives us not only personal grace but also corporate grace.
[217]  The first principle in the Bible concerning meetings is that all meetings are conducted in the Lord s name.
[218]  What does it mean to be gathered under the Lord s name?
[219]  We do not go to a meeting to visit certain brothers or sisters, nor do we go because we are attracted by certain brothers or sisters.
[220]  If you meet to listen to someone s preaching, I am afraid you are coming under that person s name, not under the Lord s name.
[221]  Whenever we meet and whenever we fellowship with one another mutually, we should remember that, as believers, we are one in Christ.
[222]  First Corinthians 12:13 says, For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.
[223]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN VARIOUS KINDS OF MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Acts 2:14, 40-42; 1 Cor 10:16-17, 21; 11:20, 23-26; 14:26-36; Matt 18:19-20
[224]  In the previous message we covered the principles of the meetings.
[225]  In this message we will cover the practice of the meetings.
[226]  An unbeliever does not know where to sit when he comes to the meeting hall.
[227]  You must let him know where he should sit.
[228]  If the ushers in the hall have made an arrangement already, you must cooperate with them.
[229]  If you bring one person to the meeting, you must sit beside him.
[230]  After the meeting, help them write down their names if there is the need for them to leave their names.
[231]  Help them write if they do not know how to write.
[232]  If some ask why they should leave their names, say, We want your name so that we can come and visit you.
[233]  When Paul speaks of the bread in 11:24, he refers to the Lord s physical body, saying, And having given thanks, He broke it and said, This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me. Christ s body was given up for us.
[234]  The gospel meeting and the bread-breaking meeting are important meetings, and the prayer meeting is also important.
[235]  Another basic requirement is to be genuine in our prayer.
[236]  I am afraid that many words in the prayer meeting are spoken in vain.
[237]  Many people pay attention to the nicety of the words and care little whether or not God listens to them.
[238]  It seems to be of little consequence to them that God does not listen to their prayers.
[239]  Another principle in the prayer meeting is to not offer prayers that go beyond our personal prayer.
[240]  The way you pray in the meeting should be governed by the way you pray at home by yourself.
[241]  V. THE MEETING FOR THE PREACHING OF THE WORD
[242]  The fifth type of meeting may not be as crucial as the other meetings, but it is used equally by God to release His word to the saints.
[243]  If an apostle passes through our place or if we have apostles, teachers, prophets, or ministers of the word permanently residing among us, we should have a meeting for the release of the word.
[244]  We are not saying that this kind of meeting is unimportant.
[245]  God completed the creation of all things in six days and rested from all His work on the seventh day.
[246]  For man to enter God s rest means that man does not do his own work but instead accepts God s work.
[247]  In the Old Testament God chose one day out of seven, the seventh day, to be the Holy Sabbath.
[248]  Acts 4:10-11 says, Let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified and whom God has raised from the dead, in this name this man stands before you in good health.
[249]  The Bible emphasizes three things that we should do on the first day of the week:
[250]  First, Psalm 118:24 speaks of the attitude that all God s children should have on the first day of the week.
[251]  First, it is the declaration of our fellowship with God, our fellowship with the Lord, and second, it is the declaration of our fellowship with the Body, that is, our fellowship with the church.
[252]  Although on earth we are limited by time and space from fellowshipping with every child of God and from shaking hands with all of them, every Lord s Day every child of God puts his hand on this bread, regardless of where he is.
[253]  But the Bible does tell us to exult and rejoice on the Lord s Day; it tells us to come to the Lord in singleness of heart to receive grace from Him, to remember Him, to serve Him, and to consecrate ourselves to Him.
[254]  In The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles one of the first books of the church in addition to the Bible, written between approximately A.D. 75 and A.D. 90, the same era as the book of Revelation , it says, But every Lord s day do ye gather yourselves together, and break bread, and give thanksgiving after having confessed your transgressions, that your sacrifice may be pure Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, eds., The Ante-Nicene Fathers.
[255]  In chapter nine of this epistle, he stated clearly, If, therefore, those who were brought up in the ancient order of things referring to those in Judaism have come to the possession of a new hope, no longer observing the Sabbath, but living in the observance of the Lord s Day, on which also our life has sprung up again by Him and by His death... ibid., Vol. I, p.
[256]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN HYMN SINGING Scripture Reading: Psa 104:33; Eph 5:19; Matt 26:30; Acts 16:25
[257]  After a person believes in the Lord, he must learn to sing hymns.
[258]  It is difficult when a Christian goes to a meeting but does not know how to sing hymns.
[259]  Now let us look at a few hymns to illustrate our point:
[260]  Example 2: Hymns, #578 My will is weak, my strength is frail,
[261]  We can classify the hymns into four categories: 1 the gospel trumpet; 2 words of praise; 3 Christ as life; and 4 the church life.
[262]  It includes songs on the guilt of sin, the sinner s position, God s love, His righteousness, the redemption of the cross, repentance, faith in God, and so on.
[263]  Sometimes a sinner does not know how to pray or come to God, but the hymns help him come to God and pray.
[264]  This kind of hymn either preaches to men or encourages men to go to God.
[265]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN PRAISING Scripture Reading: Psa 22:3; 50:23; 106:12, 47; 146:2; Heb 13:15
[266]  Praise is the highest work carried out by God s children.
[267]  We can say that the highest expression of a saint s spiritual life is his praise to God.
[268]  God s throne is the highest point in the universe, yet He sits enthroned upon the praises of Israel Psa 22:3 .
[269]  David said in a psalm that he prayed to God three times a day Psa 55:17 .
[270]  Both David and Solomon touched God s heart and offered up sacrifices of praise that were pleasing to God.
[271]  We have seen that our praise is a sacrifice.
[272]  Many people say that Satan is afraid of the prayers of God s children; he flees whenever God s children kneel down to pray.
[273]  This is why he often attacks God s children and frustrates them from praying.
[274]  Finally, in Psalm 50:23 God says, Whoever offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies Me. Here, the word thanksgiving can also be translated as praise.
[275]  Today we have the opportunity to learn the best lesson; we can learn to praise God even today.
[276]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN BREAD-BREAKING Scripture Reading: Matt 26:26-28; 1 Cor 10:16-22; 11:23-32 I. THE INSTITUTING OF THE LORD S SUPPER
[277]  There is a supper in the church which all God s children should attend.
[278]  This supper was instituted by the Lord Jesus on the last night He was on earth.
[279]  God s children today are saved and delivered from the sins of this world, and they partake of the Lord s supper.
[280]  There is another significance to the Lord s supper.
[281]  First Corinthians 11:26 says, For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord s death until He comes.
[282]  In charging us to take His supper, the Lord is asking us not just to remember Him but also to proclaim His death.
[283]  First Corinthians 10 has another expression for the bread-breaking meeting.
[284]  As a supper, which He instituted on the last night before His death, this meeting is for remembering Him and declaring His death till He comes.
[285]  There is another aspect to the church s breaking of bread, which is signified by the Lord s table v. 21 . The meaning of the Lord s table is clearly defined in verses 16 and 17, which say, The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ? Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread.
[286]  In particular, we have to take care of one matter in the bread-breaking meeting: As those who are cleansed by the Lord s blood, we do not come to ask for the cleansing of His blood.
[287]  As those who have received the Lord s life, we do not come to ask for His life.
