   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NECESSITY OF CHRIST S BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some of my friends have advised me, saying, Brother Lee, don t say that Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you say this, many Christians will be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Twelve years ago, before I gave a series of messages that were later printed as the book, The Economy of God, a friend of mine advised me in this manner, saying, The Bible says that Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You are not unscriptural for saying this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if you say that Christ is the life-giving Spirit, you will offend people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I replied, Brother, since you have said that this is according to the Scriptures, will you please give me the liberty to speak it?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>My burden is on this very matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you do not allow me to speak on this, I shall be jobless and have nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am familiar with other doctrines of the Bible, but I have no burden to speak on them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My unique burden is to minister Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I know that Christianity will rise up against this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If there is no opposition, I will be surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>My friend was offended.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A couple of weeks later, I gave those messages on the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His advice was an encouragement to me because it stirred my spirit and showed me the need of the completion of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit, how could He be in us?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Recently, a few brothers met with the leading ones from an opposing group.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They condemn us for saying that Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The brothers asked them how Christ could be in them if He were not the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They denied that Christ was in them, but said that the Holy Spirit, who represents Christ, was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What twisting!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is not a verse in the Bible saying that the Holy Spirit represents Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They accuse us of damaging the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to them, Christ is only the Son and the Son can never be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, when the brothers asked them about 2 Corinthians 3:17 Now the Lord is that Spirit they had nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are not fighting over doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have the adequate experience to support what I am saying in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If my Christ were not the life-giving Spirit, how could I live by Him today?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our critics say that Christ is only a person sitting on the throne in the heavens and that the Holy Spirit comes into us to represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From where do they get this teaching?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And they condemn us for being heretical!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who is heretical those, like us, who believe the Bible according to the clear black and white letters, or those who twist the Word of God?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In a sense, I sympathize with our critics because they are under the influence of traditional concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are not arguing for a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are for Christ in us, the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some from the same opposing group argued with our brothers, saying, Luke 24 says that after Christ was resurrected, He came to His disciples with a body of bones and flesh and His disciples touched Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How can Witness Lee say that after His resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Doesn t he believe Luke 24?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They thought that they had won the case.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But a little knowledge is dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I believe Luke 24 more than they do.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have published a book stating that the resurrected Christ possesses a physical body, not a natural physical body, but a resurrected one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, according to their explanation, they have the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ possesses a physical body of bones and flesh, but He came into the closed room where His disciples were.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How did He get in?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not attempt to understand the Bible according to your limited mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How can a Christ with flesh and bones be in us?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot explain this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every truth in the Bible has two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nothing, not even a thin handkerchief, can exist without having two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Robert Govett has written a booklet entitled, The Twofoldness of Divine Truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>More than twenty-eight years ago we translated this booklet into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From the side of Luke 24, which we fully believe, the resurrected Christ possesses a physical body of bones and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is not a natural body but a resurrected body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the other side, the Bible also says that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How can we reconcile this?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I do not know and I do not try.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I cannot reconcile it because I am not God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I simply believe both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our critics may be right, but they are right on just one side.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They should not condemn others because of their shortsightedness and lack of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Rather, they should reread their Bible, not deleting any verse or adding any words.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If they take away anything, they will miss the blessing, and if they add anything, they will receive the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should simply take the pure Word whether we understand it or not.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There are many things in our human living that we do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Everyday I eat a variety of foods, but I understand very little about them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If I did not eat any food until I understood it, I would have been buried long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I was born before I knew anything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even now, I do not know how I was born.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There are many things that we do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do you know in what part of the universe you are today?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Let me say a word to our critics: your knowledge is too limited.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you think that you know everything about the Trinity, you are foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We cannot adequately understand the Trinity because it is altogether a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Nevertheless, it is an undeniable fact that, as revealed in the Bible, Christ is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But how can He be in us as long as He possesses a physical body of bones and flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But I do believe He has a physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He is now in the heavens with a resurrected physical body, and He will come with a physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Every eye will see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There are many things in the Bible that we simply cannot reconcile.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Since Christ is already in us, why does He need to come?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Forget reconciling, take the pure Word, and care for your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We are fighting against any doctrine that tells people of a Christ that cannot be experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Bible reveals a Christ that can be experienced by us continually.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is Christ in us, the hope of glory.</S>
