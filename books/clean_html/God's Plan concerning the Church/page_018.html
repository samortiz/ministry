<h2 class="head1">HAVING FELLOWSHIP WITH OR<br />
DOING A WORK ON OTHER GROUNDS</h2>
<p><em>Question: According to the truth that we preach, if we return to the local ground of the church in order to worship and serve together, should we have absolutely no contact or fellowship with the believers on other grounds and no union with them in their work?</em></p>
<p>Answer: With regard to this question, we need to answer it according to two aspects. The first aspect is concerning fellowship. If you fellowship in the Lord with individual saints, it is absolutely proper and acceptable; however, if you have any involvement with a work or organization that is not on the ground, we believe that such involvement is wrong. The second aspect is concerning the work. We have had much consideration concerning whether we should work or preach on a different ground. Both Daniel and Ezekiel were prophets in the land of captivity. They were not in Jerusalem but in the land of captivity. Nevertheless, both had a ministry raised up by God. Hence, we need to ask, &ldquo;What was their ministry?&rdquo; As prophets doing the work of God, they told the people that Babylon was not the proper place and that, as God&rsquo;s people, they should return to Jerusalem (cf. Ezek. 34:13; 39:25, 28; Dan. 9:2-27).</p>
<p>According to this principle, when we go to preach on a different ground, our basic attitude should be, &ldquo;I come here to speak Christ and the word of God to you, but you are on a ground that is not proper and is condemned by God. You should return to Jerusalem.&rdquo; If your preaching is a different kind of preaching that strengthens and solidifies their ground, not only will we say that this is not right, but everyone else will also say that this is not right. In the end, we can only say that the matter of serving on a different ground is something that should be decided by each person according to his own conscience; this is altogether a matter of a person&rsquo;s enlightenment. Some people have a conscience enlightened to the extent that they dare not and cannot do a work on a different ground; hence, we do not want to control. Rather, each one should live before the Lord with a pure conscience and according to the light that he has received. In seeking fellowship, no one should have a definite opinion or preconception, claiming that our refusal to interact and work with other Christian groups is sectarian and wrong. This kind of speaking is wild and rough. We should allow every believer the freedom to walk before God with a pure conscience.</p>
<p><em>Question: If a person breaks bread with you and is thus in fellowship with you, can he do a work among you?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Our Lord&rsquo;s table is absolutely open. We do not refuse any saved one who wants to break bread with us&mdash;regardless of his background, the ground he stands on, or his current involvements. We must receive and break bread with anyone whom God has received, that is, every believer, unless he has committed a gross sin that God condemns. Nevertheless, we feel that since the Lord has commissioned and raised us up to bear a particular testimony, we cannot open the responsibility for the ground to everyone. Only those who are willing to bear the same testimony can bear responsibility among us. A believer can break bread with us, but he cannot participate in the responsibility, because this is related to the testimony of the church. If we make the Lord&rsquo;s table and the matter of receiving the believers narrow, then we have become an exclusive sect. This is something that we cannot do. The Lord&rsquo;s table is for all children of the Lord. Nevertheless, since the Lord has commissioned and raised us up to bear a particular testimony in this age, we cannot carelessly open the responsibility for the ground to everyone.</p>
<p>Partaking of the Lord&rsquo;s table is one thing, whereas bearing responsibility within the church is another thing. If people condemn us, saying that we are an exclusive sect because we do not allow others to bear responsibility for the church, this is a word of slander. The Lord&rsquo;s table is open, but we cannot open the responsibility for the ground to everyone or allow everyone to do whatever he wants.</p>
<p>Regardless of the kind of view a brother holds, he may come and break bread with us. If he wants to do any kind of work apart from us, we will not interfere, because that is his personal business. However, if another comes and breaks bread with us, while openly or secretly doing another kind of work among us, we cannot agree with that.</p>
