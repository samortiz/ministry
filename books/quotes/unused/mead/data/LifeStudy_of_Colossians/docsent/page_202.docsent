   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO SHORTAGE OF GOD S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We thank the Lord that the situation in His recovery is altogether different from this.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have an abundance of the Lord s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Consider how much of the word of God has been released among us in the recovery during the past years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reason there is so much of God s speaking in the recovery is that here we have genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We experience this oneness and the harmony in the Spirit not only when the churches come together for a conference, but also in the meetings of the various local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the meetings we have the Lord s speaking, and we are edified, nourished, and enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the peace of Christ arbitrates in us and keeps us in a situation full of oneness and harmony, we become the place of God s speaking, His oracle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Deep in my spirit I realize that the meetings are an oracle, a place where God can come in to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we see the connection between 3:15 and 16.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The peace of Christ arbitrates in us to keep us in a proper condition to receive God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The arbitrating peace of Christ is for God s oracle, the place of His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For a proper Christian walk we need to set our mind on things above.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we do this, we switch on to the heavenly transmission, the divine current of electricity which flows from the throne in heaven to us on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This transmission causes the renewing of the new man, for it brings a new element, the divine substance, into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Following the renewing, we have the arbitrating peace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The very element of Christ transmitted into us becomes the essence of the peace which rules in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This arbitrating peace not only solves our problems, but also dissolves them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It enables us to be kept in oneness and to be preserved in a harmonious condition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It also opens the way for the word of God to come with the bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because we have the arbitrating peace, in the Lord s recovery there is no shortage of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>FUNCTIONS OF THE WORD OF GOD Enlightening</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we must go on to consider how the word of God functions within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, the word of God enlightens us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we did not have the Word, we would be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But because God s word is full of light and it enlightens us, it can make us very clear about many different things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nourishing</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, the word of God is food, full of nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that God s word nourishes us while it enlightens us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I can testify that throughout the years I have been adequately nourished through the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It truly has been food to me in my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Quenching Our Thirst</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word of God also quenches our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thirst is even more serious than hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Usually a person can go longer without eating than without drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not have water, we simply have no way to live.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How good that the word of God is not only food, but also the water of life!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word of God enlightens us, feeds us, and quenches our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Strengthening</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Another aspect of the function of the word of God within us is that of strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word of God strengthens us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christians are weak because they are thirsty and undernourished.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No one who is hungry and thirsty can be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we experience the word of God nourishing us and strengthening us, we shall be strong not only in spirit, but also in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, we shall be strong psychologically as well as spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, God s word will even strengthen us physically.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I can testify that my body is healthy not only because I eat the proper physical food, but also because I take the word of God as my spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God s word in my spirit makes my spirit strong and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This strength and happiness help me to be healthy physically.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a fact that when we are happy spiritually and psychologically we shall be healthy in body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The word of God makes us strong in spirit and also in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Strengthened in spirit and soul, we shall be healthy in body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The word of God is the best cure; it strengthens us and it heals us.</S>
