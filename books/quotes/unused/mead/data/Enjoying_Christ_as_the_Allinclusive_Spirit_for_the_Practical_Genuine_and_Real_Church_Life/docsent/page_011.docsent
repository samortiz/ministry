   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR ENJOYING THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO INHERIT THE PROMISE OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 3:23-29; 4:4-10, 19, 21-31 GOD S PURPOSE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO WORK THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s purpose is to work Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The entire Bible reveals that this Christ is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As God, Christ is the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Isaiah 9:6 says, A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / And the government / Is upon His shoulder; / And His name will be called / Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father, / Prince of Peace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Son given to us is called Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As God, Christ is also the Creator Col 1:16; John 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In time He was incarnated to be a man v. 14 , who was crucified on the cross as the Lamb of God to be our Redeemer v. 29 . Following this, He rose from the dead, and as the resurrected One He is our living Savior Acts 5:31; 13:23 . He died on the cross to redeem us from our sins, and now He lives as the Savior to deliver us from every sinful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moreover, in resurrection, through resurrection, and by resurrection this wonderful Jesus became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now as the ascended One, the One who was raised to the third heaven and seated on the throne of God, He is the Lord and Christ Acts 2:36 , the One appointed and anointed by God to execute all that God planned to do for the accomplishment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Greek name Christos means the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God was incarnated to be a man by the name of Jesus, which means Jehovah the Savior Matt 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since Jesus is not only Jehovah but also Jehovah becoming our salvation, we may say that He is Jehovah plus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, Jesus is also called Emmanuel, which means God with us v. 23 . Again we may say that Jesus is God plus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Jews have Jehovah, and they have God, but we have Jehovah plus and God plus, that is, Jehovah the Savior and God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the foregoing items are related to Christ as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In addition, Christ is light, life, power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, our spiritual food, our spiritual drink, and our spiritual breath, as well as our practical virtues, such as kindness, humility, and patience John 8:12; 1:4; 1 Cor 1:24, 30; 10:3-4; John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jesus Christ is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BEING THE TOTALITY OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some who are shortsighted claim that Christ is only the Son, not the Father or the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If Christ were not the Father and the Spirit, He would not be all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only by being the Son, the Father, the Spirit, man, the Lamb of God, the Redeemer, the Savior, the Lord, the Master, and so many items can He be all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The holy Word tells us that Jesus is even signified by the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Like plants, we are living organisms as God s farm 1 Cor 3:9 ; as such, we have been rooted in Christ Col 2:7 , our soil, our earth, so that we may absorb all His riches as our nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Similarly, Christ is also signified by heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Luke 15:21 the prodigal son confessed to his father, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To sin against heaven is to sin against God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Heaven represents God, and God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our real heaven is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If our real heaven were not Christ, we would not care to go there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may compare this to a small babe, who does not care where he is; he cares only that his mother is there.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Likewise, we do not care to go anywhere, even to heaven, apart from Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, wherever Jesus is, that is heaven to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Jesus was laid in a manger, even that small place became heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If Jesus had not been there, that manger would have meant nothing to the magi from the east or to the shepherds Matt 2:9-11; Luke 2:8-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not listen to the traditional teaching that the three persons of the Godhead revealed in Matthew 28:19 are three separate Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the wrong concept conveyed by the traditional teaching in Christianity, many believe that the Father is one God, the Son is another God, and the Spirit is yet another God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We receive the pure Word, which says, Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit v. 19 , and thus we believe that God is triune, but we do not believe that there are three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three in one and one in three.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Are God and the Word one or two?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is wonderful but too difficult for our natural mentality to fully comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When possible, we prefer not even to use the word persons when referring to the three of the Godhead, because the Bible does not use this word when speaking of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even we ourselves are a mystery, and we cannot understand ourselves adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Jeremiah 17:9 says, The heart is deceitful above all things, / And it is incurable; / Who can know it?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to the Bible and according to our experiences, we have two hearts; one is the physical heart, and the other is our psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We know where our physical heart is, but no one can say where our psychological heart is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moreover, we have a soul and a spirit, and we have a mind and a will, yet we do not know where they are within us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All this proves that we do not understand ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, we should not try to understand the mysterious God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nevertheless, we know that God is real.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot fully understand Him, but we can receive Him according to His pure Word.</S>
