We thank and praise God the Father that He has reserved for His own great name many faithful ones who have not bent their knees to Baal
What we preach is the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ and how it saves sinners from the condemnation of sin and the power of sin
We know that the Lord Jesus died for sinners on the cross so that all who believe in Him can be saved apart from any work
We know how to die with the Lord, how to apply the death of the Lord by faith, and how to die with Him to deal with sin and self
The audience pays much attention to us when we preach the cross of the Lord; they like it and are touched by it
Under such circumstances, we ought to see many people receiving life and many believers gaining the more abundant life
You have the best words and voice, but behind the words and voice you do not have the kind of authority that 'controls' people's lives
In other words, you can make people listen attentively to you at the meeting hall, but the Holy Spirit is not co-working with you
Although your mouth flows out words, your spirit does not flow out life to nourish, raise up, and quicken the dying audience
We cannot see the grace of God working in the audience to the point where they truly obtain the regenerated life
In these verses we see three things: the message that Paul preached, the person of Paul himself, and the way Paul preached his message
If we forget the cross and do not make the cross and Christ our unique subject, how much will we and our audience miss!
If others are stirred up or excited or even repent and agree with what we preach but do not have Gods life in them what good will this do
Even when we preach the deeper truths or try to help others to understand the truth of co-crucifixion, the same principle holds true
Weakness fear trembling being void of selfconfidence considering oneself as totally useless these are the characteristics of a crucified man
Unless one is a crucified person, he cannot preach the word of the cross and cannot give to others the life of the cross
Many times what we preach is the cross, but our attitude, our words, and our feeling do not seem like we are preaching the cross!
And my speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power'
When we preach the word of this foolishness we should have the form of foolishness the attitude of foolishness and the speech of foolishness
The message we preach may be good, but we should examine ourselves in the light of the Lord are we truly crucified men?
The failure of our work comes because we love to give the cross to others before we know whether or not we have the cross in ourselves
We can hear deep words about various aspects of the cross or read from books about the meanings of substitution and co-crucifixion
Despite the fact that they have understood everything, there is not an urging power to make the audience pursue what they have understood
They may be affected at that one moment, but have we only given them thoughts and doctrines, or do we need to give life to them?
Our failure lies in the fact that many times we study the Word of God with our own wisdom and prepare our notes with our own thoughts
We often take the knowledge we gain from books and the doctrines we hear from our teachers and friends and make them our sermons
Only when we are transformed by the cross and when we receive the life and the spirit of the cross can we dispense the cross to others
The cross should daily do a deeper work in our life so that we can have solid experiences of the suffering and the victory of the cross
Only life can reach man's spirit, the result being that man's spirit either receives a regenerated life or a more abundant life
Although what one speaks may be very persuasive outwardly, we have to know that the Holy Spirit is not co-working with him
May the Spirit of God make us realize that thoughts can only reach man's soul, and only life can flow to man's spirit
The life we are speaking of here refers to the experience of the word of God in our lives and the experience of the message we preach
It is true that we should resolve to practice what we hear, but the 'doing' in the Bible is not a 'doing' with one's own strength
We should cooperate with the Holy Spirit in our life through our will so that we can experientially live out what we know
The Lord Jesus had to be crucified before He could draw all men to Himself and dispense spiritual life to others
In this way, our spirit will constantly bear the cross of the Lord to the extent that our life becomes the life of the cross
We only need to preach the word of the cross of the Lord faithfully, and others will receive the life which they lack
It must be deeply engraved on our heart and be burned and seared into our life through the sufferings in our daily living
He not only knew the Lord Jesus' substitutional death, but he took the Lord Jesus' cross as his own cross in experience
His meekness, endurance, infirmities, weepings, sufferings, and chains were all the manifestation of the life of the cross
Because Paul was able to live out his gospel, he was able to beget many spiritual sons and daughters through the gospel
We should allow the Holy Spirit, through the cross, to do a deeper work in us so that we can live out the cross
When we have the life of the cross, we go one step further and take the spirit of the cross as the very life in our daily living
He was 'always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in body'
He was willing to endure ear-grating words, high-handed methods, cruel persecutions, and unreasonable misunderstandings for the Lord's sake
Who can say to the Lord that he is willing to die and not resist in the midst of all opposing and suffering circumstances?
We know that Paul not only preached the cross as a crucified person, but he preached the cross in the spirit of the cross
When he announced the cross, he did not exercise his 'excellence of speech or wisdom,' or 'persuasive words of wisdom' which he was good at
He knew that for him to do this would be to preach the great truth of the cross with ways that are contrary to the cross
To announce it with worldly excellence of speech and wisdom would be contrary to the spirit of the cross and would not be of any profit
Paul was willing to abandon his natural intellect and to announce the cross with the attitude and spirit of the cross
How our heart desires that our audience could see what we have seen, or would desire to acquire the same experience as we have!
It is then that we begin to understand that our natural gift is insufficient and that we ought to seek for greater power
If we are manifesting the life of the cross in our daily lives, we should also manifest the spirit of the cross in the Lord's work
We should reckon ourselves helpless and should always consider ourselves untrustworthy, being in fear and trembling for ourselves
Because he preached the Savior of the cross with the way of the cross, he had the demonstration of the Spirit and of power
If the Spirit and His power are not working behind our speaking, our words are useless even if they are enticing
May we despise our natural abilities, and may we be willing to lose all to gain the power of the Holy Spirit of God!
If those who have the life of the cross proclaim their experience from their spirit, the Holy Spirit will surely be with them
The Lord Jesus said, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit
He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life'
The Lord told us that we must first die and must first have the experience of the cross before we can have the authority of the Holy Spirit
The nature of the fruit here also proves what we have said before, that the purpose of our work is to give life to others
Everything that a person possesses by nature, such as his will, power, emotion, and thought, are all part of the soul
Often, we have to wait until all natural power of our body is depleted before we begin to rely upon the power of the spiritual life
Others who are more advanced would continue on in their weakness and would go on working by trying to trust in the Lord's strength
For the sake of taking care of the weakness among many of God's children, we will discuss this question in detail
We do not realize how much we are confident in ourselves and how much we depend on the power of the soul when we work!
Those saints who are dominated by their feelings, stimulations, and emotions are working by the power of their soul-life
Because we do not know how to seek after God's will, many times we take the thoughts of the mind as God's will and are led astray
Sometimes when we prepare a sermon we try hard to exercise our mind to come up with outlines sections expositions significances and examples
Sometimes we speak to others from the Scriptures that we have memorized or from our old sermons, old commentaries
We begin to preach from our memory the truth that we formerly experienced, but this has become merely a work of the mind
We should be willing to die with the Lord here and remove our dependence on the natural abilities, the feelings, and the mind
Even though we already know what we are going to preach, we do not try to dig out such teachings from our head or our mind
It is best for us to spend a long time before the Lord prior to our preaching to allow His word to be impressed upon our spirit afresh
In order to do this, our spirit must be very open to the Lord and be intimately connected to Him at ordinary times
All the works done by us through the exercise of our memory are more or less equivalent to the preaching of backslidden believers
Otherwise, if we try to persuade others by our love and zeal, we may end up being hardened and cold ourselves!
Every time we preach, we should be like Isaiah, who received first a burden for prophecy and then uttered his prophecy
We should pray that the Lord would give us this burden so that our work would not be of the emotions, the natural abilities, and the mind
Satan attacks the messengers of the cross by causing them to be ill or to lose their voice in the course of giving a message
He may put them in dangers, cause them to be depressed in their spirit and to lose their freedom, and suffocate them
He can also work in the environment to stir up misunderstandings, oppositions, and sometimes even persecutions
Sometimes he works in the meeting atmosphere, making it heavy and suffocating and bringing in drowsiness and darkness
Since we have such an adversary and such oppositions, it becomes necessary for us to know the victory of the cross
The Lord's accomplishment on the cross not only solved the problem of the sinners, it also pronounced the judgment on Satan
Colossians 2:15 says, 'Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it'
We know that 'the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil' , but where were the works of the devil undone?
We can declare this continually until we are assured in our spirit that the Lord will win the victory this time
We should learn to apply the manifold victory of the cross through our prayer to oppose the wiles, the power, and the attacks of the enemy
Although we may not feel anything, we should believe that as soon as we invoke the victory of the cross, the enemy is defeated
