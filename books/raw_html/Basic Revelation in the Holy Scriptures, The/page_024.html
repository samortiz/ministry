<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Sanctified Positionally</H2><P>As part of our initial salvation, we have been positionally sanctified, that is, separated by God from the world unto Himself. First Corinthians 6:11 indicates that we are sanctified first and then justified. Positional sanctification precedes justification; dispositional sanctification follows justification.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Justified</H2><P>The death of Christ has fully fulfilled and satisfied God's righteous requirements, so that we are justified by God through His death (Rom. 3:24). We are "justified from all things" from which we "could not be justified by the law of Moses" (Acts 13:39).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Reconciled to God</H2><P>We needed to be reconciled to God because when we were sinners, we were God's enemies (Rom. 5:10). We have been reconciled to God through the death of His Son.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Regenerated</H2><P>When we believed in the Lord Jesus and called upon His name, we were regenerated; that is, the very Spirit of Christ entered into our spirit and enlivened us (John 3:6; Eph. 2:5). Regeneration has made us children of God (John 1:12-13; Rom. 8:16), members of the household of God (Eph. 2:19). It has also made us members of Christ, members of the Body of Christ (Eph. 5:30; 1 Cor. 12:27). We who have been regenerated are members of the Body of Christ and also the sons of God.</P><P>Regeneration took place in our spirit, not in our physical body or in our mind. This means the Triune God is now in our spirit (Eph. 4:6; 2 Cor. 13:5; Rom. 8:9). What a treasure we have within (2 Cor. 4:7)! The Triune God has come into our spirit to stay (John 4:24; 2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16). Here in our spirit is where the unsearchable riches of Christ are.</P><P>To enjoy these riches we must call on the name of the Lord Jesus (Rom. 10:12). If we want to be nourished, we can call "O Lord Jesus!" When we are at home and also when we are at work, we can call on the Lord's name. When we call, we touch the Spirit (l Cor. 12:3). Many of us pray often, but we do not get the nourishment from our praying. This should not be so. We are not praying to an idol; we pray to the living God. He is the very God who is now in our spirit. When we speak to Him, He responds in our spirit. When we exercise our spirit, we realize Him within our spirit. If we merely exercise our mind and pray from our mouth, the Triune God within us has no way. He is not in our mind. but in our spirit. We must exercise our spirit (1 Tim. 4:7). In this way we can experience this true, real, and living God who is right now in our spirit. In our regenerated spirit dwells the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit.</P>
