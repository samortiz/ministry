<P>Previously, we saw from Ephesians 2 that while the Lord Jesus was being visibly and outwardly crucified on the cross, He was working invisibly. Visibly, He was being crucified. Invisibly, He was creating the one new man. This was a great work. We pointed out that Ephesians 2 is in two sections. According to the proper sequence, the second section (vv. 11-22) took place first. This is because Christ's crucifixion should come before God's enlivening. When Christ was crucified on the cross, we believers, both Jewish and Gentile, were included in Him and crucified with Him (Gal. 2:20). His crucifixion cleared up the oldness. Then we received His resurrection life as the element to germinate us. In His resurrection, His new element, the divine element, His resurrection life, was applied to us.</P><P>The first section of Ephesians 2 (vv. 1-10) reveals that God the Father came in to coordinate with God the Son. God the Son was clearing up the old man and the old creation on the cross, and He was creating the new man in Himself as the new element in resurrection. In the meantime, God the Father came in to enliven each one of us with the resurrected Christ as life, as the enlivening element. He made us alive, raised us up from the dead, and uplifted us to the heavens with Christ.</P><P>Who can see this? This is a record of the invisible things in the invisible world, in the invisible sphere, and in the invisible scene. We can be certain that the Triune God saw this, and that He revealed this to the apostle Paul. The Triune God gave Paul a "video" of what was going on while the Son was being crucified on the cross. Paul saw this on the "heavenly television." This is why he prayed for us that we might have a spirit of wisdom and revelation (Eph. 1:17). Revelation means a video. We need a video. For us to hear alone is not adequate; we need to see. We need to see the video of what took place when Jesus Christ was being crucified.</P><P>Actually, crucifixion was a means for Him to create us into one new man. We were crucified with Him on the cross. Then God the Father came in to enliven us with the resurrected Christ as life, as the enlivening element. While Christ was creating, God was enlivening. We need such a video, such a vision, of what took place in the Lord's death and resurrection. When we read Ephesians 2 in the past, we probably did not see such a vision. One day when I read Ephesians 2, I saw this. I did not see this vision in the past as clearly as I do now. Praise Him! Today I feel that the heavens are opened, and I am receiving a fresh vision, a heavenly video.</P><P>As a part of the new creation, I was created at the time of Christ's crucifixion and resurrection. As a part of His organic Body, I was also enlivened by God at that time. According to my human concept and feeling, I was saved sixty-six years ago. But according to God's viewpoint, I was made alive about two thousand years ago. When Jesus was crucified on the cross, I was also crucified. Then God the Father came in with Christ's resurrection life as the element to enliven me. I have seen this vision. I have a heavy burden because I want all of us to see such a vision. I am burdened that all of us would be granted by God's mercy to have a trance. We should not remain in the old sphere any longer. We must have a trance and be transferred into another sphere. We need to see what the Body of Christ is intrinsically.</P><P>In the previous chapter, we saw the intrinsic view of the Body of Christ in Ephesians 3. This chapter tells us that God the Father strengthens us with power through His Spirit into our inner man (v. 16). We should experience the Father's strengthening us into our inner man every day. Whenever I have a time with the Lord, I receive this strengthening from within. When we spend time with the Lord in prayer, we are strengthened into our inner man. Then Christ has the way to make His home in our heart. Christ's making His home in our heart is not a matter which is once for all. This should be a continuous matter. Before I come to the platform to speak, I need to spend some time in prayer to allow God the Father to strengthen me into the inner man so that God the Son can come in to get Himself more settled in my inward parts. This practice equips me to speak.</P><P>We have to see a vision of Christ making His home in His believers' hearts. This is something invisible. Who has seen this? The people in the world would think that we are speaking foolishness, but we are in a trance. We are in another field, another realm, which cannot be substantiated by our natural and physical senses. This morning when I was walking into this meeting, I had the speaking within to ask our God to give us a trance. This was a new subject for prayer. We need to pray, "Lord, we ask You to give us a trance that transfers us from the natural sphere into another sphere, the spiritual sphere." I desire to see all of us in such a trance. When we are in this divine trance, we are in Him. He Himself is our trance.</P>
