[1]  These different terms signify that we, the believers, have been regenerated into the Body, and now we need to be tempered together and built up as one Body to fulfill God s intention.
[2]  When we come to the matter of serving the Lord, we all need to be very clear that we need the Body, and we need a heavenly vision concerning the Body.
[3]  May the Lord grant us all such a vision that will bring us into a full realization that we need to be in the reality of the Body, even that we cannot serve without the Body, and, in fact, that we cannot live, we cannot exist spiritually in life, outside the Body.
[4]  After you see the Body, spontaneously you will ask, Where is the Body?
[5]  It is not sufficient to say that we have seen the Body and we are living by Christ as our life, and therefore we have the oneness and are in the unity and in the Body.
[6]  We have Romans 12, and we have 1 Peter 2, but we need to go on to 1 Corinthians 12, especially to take note of one word in verse 24: But God has tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked.
[7]  We are all here together, we have seen the Body, we are in the Body, we are living in Christ and by Christ as our life, but we need to check ourselves to find out how much we have been tempered together.
[8]  CHAPTER TWO THE TESTS OF OUR SEEING THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 4:1-4; 1 Cor 1:10; 3:1-4; Phil 2:1-4; John 17:21, 23
[9]  The genuine Christian service is based upon the building up of the Body of Christ.
[10]  The base, the foundation, of all genuine Christian work is the building up of the Body.
[11]  Seeing the Body very much involves the matter of the ground of the church.
[12]  The Body is one, and this unique Body is expressed in and by the local churches.
[13]  If you have seen the Body, you could never be individualistic, you could never be independent.
[14]  You cannot move, you cannot work, you cannot serve without the Body, because you have seen the Body, and you realize that you are simply one member of the Body.
[15]  As long as you are not restricted, as long as you are free, as long as you are independent, as long as it is so easy for you to have your own choice, no matter how much you know about the Body and how confident you are that you have seen the Body, you have not seen the Body.
[16]  If we have really seen the Body, we would not murmur or criticize any of the other members.
[17]  Even a little murmuring that shows your dissatisfaction proves that you have not seen the Body.
[18]  Even a little word of criticism about a certain member of the Body proves that you have never seen the Body.
[19]  If you have seen the Body, you would never complain, murmur, criticize, or say anything against any of the members.
[20]  The condition of some of the members may be quite poor, but, on your side, for you to say that their condition is poor is a proof that you have not seen the Body.
[21]  TO THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 1:17; 2:22; 3:16; 4:23; 5:18; 6:18; 1:22-23; 2:6; Acts 2:32-33, 36
[22]  In this message we come to six crucial points in the book of Ephesians, which is a book on the church, the Body of Christ.
[23]  We have seen that the building up of the Body of Christ is the foundation of all genuine Christian service, and we have been emphasizing our deep need to see the Body.
[24]  May the Lord be merciful to all of us that we may see the Body in order that we may serve Him in a proper way.
[25]  If you do not have the vision in your spirit, if you do not have a spirit of revelation, a seeing spirit, you could not see the Body.
[26]  To use your mind is to use the wrong organ to see the church, and you cannot see it.
[27]  As long as you remain in your mind, you are through with the revelation of the church.
[28]  We have a spirit, and this spirit is a spirit of revelation, but when it comes to the matter of the church, the matter of the local church, we do not even realize that we should use our spirit.
[29]  The matter of seeing the church is in the spirit, and the building up of the church is also in the spirit.
[30]  In Ephesians 2:22 Paul says that you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.
[31]  As long as we stay outside of the spirit, we are divided, and we are also divisive.
[32]  As long as we stay away from our spirit, we see no need to be tempered together, and we feel it is necessary for each of us to maintain a distinctiveness from others, to take care of our individual personality created by God, and to hold on to our own prestige.
[33]  However, if we would turn ourselves to the spirit, right away we would see that we need to be tempered, we would be willing to be tempered, and we would even cry out to the Lord for His mercy that He would temper us together.
[34]  In chapter three of Ephesians Paul prayed, That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man v. 16 . Not only is the seeing of the Body in the spirit, not only is the building up together of the Body in the spirit, but the strengthening in the inner man is also in the spirit.
[35]  In the first four chapters of Ephesians there is the seeing in the spirit 1:17 , building up in the spirit 2:22 , being strengthened in the spirit 3:16 , and being renewed in the spirit 4:23 .
[36]  In chapter five Paul indicates that we need to be filled in spirit.
[37]  When Christ makes His home in our heart, and when we are strong to apprehend with all the saints the dimensions of Christ and to know by experience His knowledge-surpassing love, we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[38]  It is a matter of not only seeing the church in our spirit, not only being built up in the spirit, not only being strengthened in the spirit, not only being renewed in spirit, but also being filled with all that God is in Christ in our spirit.
[39]  We need to see the Body in the spirit, to be built up in the spirit, to be strengthened in the spirit, to be renewed in the spirit, to be filled unto the fullness of God in the spirit, and to pray in spirit as members of the Body, identified with the Head.
[40]  CHAPTER FOUR SERVING IN OUR HUMAN SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Acts 17:16; 18:25; 19:21; 20:22; Rom 1:9; 2:29; 7:6; 12:11; 1 Cor 2:4; 4:21; 5:3-4; 2 Cor 2:13; Gal 6:1; Col 2:5; 2 Tim 1:7
[41]  In a number of verses the Apostle Paul tells us that he served God in his spirit, that he exercised his spirit in many different ways in the service of the Lord.
[42]  By pray-reading all these verses, we receive a deep impression concerning the way the Apostle Paul served the Lord.
[43]  In Paul s record of how he served the God of his forefathers in the Jewish religion before his conversion, he did not mention anything about his spirit in relation to serving God.
[44]  Not only was the Apostle Paul one who could say that he served God in his spirit, but he was also one who could be provoked in his human spirit when he saw the whole city of Athens full of idolatry Acts 17:16 .
[45]  He was not provoked in his emotion, or in his zealous heart, but in his spirit.
[46]  We need to spend time reading and pray-reading all the verses related to the way the Apostle Paul served God in his spirit.
[47]  Paul had been a person zealous in serving the God of his forefathers, but he was zealous in his natural emotion.
[48]  It is rather hard for anyone to say whether the spirit mentioned in Acts 19:21 and 20:22 is the Holy Spirit or Paul s human spirit, because by that time the Holy Spirit was one with Paul s spirit.
[49]  Then chapter three tells us that we need to be strengthened into our inner man, the regenerated human spirit v. 16 . Chapter four tells us that we are being renewed in the spirit of our mind v. 23 , and chapter five tells us that we need to be filled in our human spirit unto all the fullness of God v. 18, with 3:19 . Finally, chapter six tells us that we need to pray as the church, as the Body, in the spirit v. 18 . From all these verses we can see that the Body is altogether a matter in our spirit.
[50]  The main purpose of the spiritual service is to minister life to others, to minister Christ to others.
[51]  If we do not know how to exercise our spirit, how to apply our spirit, it is impossible for us to minister Christ as life to others.
[52]  We may not minister life, but instead minister knowledge, teaching in letters, because we do not know how to exercise our spirit and because we are not in our spirit.
[53]  We have covered two main aspects of the exercise of the spirit.
[54]  Number one, to touch the Body and to be authorized in the Body you need to turn yourself to the spirit.
[55]  Then, number two, to minister Christ as life to others you need to turn to the spirit.
[56]  If we exercise our spirit, we are in the Body, we are entitled, we are authorized with the Body, and we have something of Christ to minister to others as life because we are in the spirit with Him.
[57]  CHAPTER FIVE SERVE BY PRAYING Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 2:42; 3:1; 4:31; 6:4; 10:9; 11:5; 12:5, 12; 13:2-3; 14:23; 16:25-26; 20:36; 21:5; 22:17; 28:8
[58]  To serve the Lord and to serve the church, it is necessary for us to be in the Body and to serve in the Body, and it is also necessary to serve in our human spirit.
[59]  Not only is the Lord s way of prayer the way to carry out the matter of moving out to other cities for the spread of the Lord s recovery, but it is also the way to take care of such matters as the cleaning of the meeting hall and arranging the chairs for the meeting.
[60]  Not only did the apostles, the first group of serving ones, pray in this way, but the first group of new converts after the day of Pentecost continued to pray in the same manner.
[61]  I received the Lord s calling in 1925, but it was not until eight years later that I had the boldness to give up my job to enter into fulltime service for the Lord.
[62]  In August, 1933, the Lord had raised up things in my environment to force me to drop my job.
[63]  I was burdened because of the need around me, and I was pressed because of the Lord s pleasure in my spirit.
[64]  Now we come to Acts 11:5, where Peter tells us something quite strange: I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in an ecstasy I saw a vision lit.
[65]  First we have the aspect of life, then the aspect of service.
[66]  We have the life matter settled first, then, based on that fact, we have the matter of service.
[67]  The Greek word rendered priesthood is rather hard to translate.
[68]  If we are going to serve the Lord in the way of the church service, we need to pay our full attention to these three matters.
[69]  First we need to be built up as a Body.
[70]  We should be separated from the common things unto the Lord and learn how to remain in the presence of the Lord, how to bring the need of the people, the need of the sinful world, to the Lord and pray.
[71]  TO MINISTER CHRIST TO OTHERS Scripture Reading: Rom 7:6; 2 Cor 3:6, 8 THREE VITAL POINTS
[72]  Suppose you plan to choose a hymn for a meeting.
[73]  There are two ways to choose a hymn the way in the letter, and the way in the spirit.
[74]  Suppose on the Lord s day morning we are having a morning service in the way of the letter, and we have one to take charge of the service.
[75]  When you are going to visit one of the saints, you need to learn to visit in the spirit.
[76]  Whenever you meet another saint, there is a serious need for the exercise of the spirit.
[77]  The purpose of all we do in the church service is to minister Christ to others.
[78]  CHAPTER EIGHT SERVING IN COORDINATION Scripture Reading: Rom 7:6
[79]  We have already seen that we need to serve the Lord in the spirit, and that in our service the one thing we need to do is to minister Christ to others as life.
[80]  Whatever we do in the Lord s service, we must do it in the spirit.
[81]  In Romans 7:6 we are told that we need to serve the Lord not only in the spirit, but also in the newness of the spirit: But now we are discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, that we should serve as slaves in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.
[82]  However, if you serve the Lord in the spirit, you will surely have the newness of the spirit.
[83]  In my experience I have always been tested by the brothers in the service.
[84]  This kind of testing is very hard to take, but you simply need to take it.
[85]  You may tell the Lord, Lord, this is a cup from You, and I have no choice but to take it.
[86]  We do need the training in this matter, and we need the practice.
