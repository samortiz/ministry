   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ARGUMENT BASED ON 1 CORINTHIANS 8:11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message, we will consider a few more verses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 8:11 says in the King James Version, "And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse presents a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This person mentioned here is definitely saved, for he is called a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is true that he is a weak brother.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But nevertheless he is a brother, a person who belongs to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But here it says that he could perish.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word perish, apollumi, carries two meanings in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One can be translated as perish.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The other can be translated as destroy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But this word is the same as the word perish used in John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>John 3:16 says that everyone who believes in Him shall not apollumi, but have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we can use the word destroy in 1 Corinthians 8:11, then we can translate John 3:16 as destroy also.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here then is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we read the Bible, we cannot read it in a superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to study the context in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only after reading the context carefully can we know what the verse says.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One cannot hear clearly what others are saying by leaning the ear against someone's window.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One of the most foolish things on earth is to listen to others through the keyhole behind closed doors, for one may not catch what is spoken before or after.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you pull a sentence out of context from the Bible, you will surely not be able to understand it clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To understand it clearly, one must read the context.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The subject of 1 Corinthians 8 is on the forbidding of Christians from eating food offered to idols in the idol temple.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Corinthian believers proposed that it was all right for Christians to eat food offered to idols in the idol temple.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Their reason was that there is only one God in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The idols are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If one offers food to the idols, and the idols are real, then the offerings are real offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the idols are not real, then the offerings are not offerings at all, but are food only.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If they are not offerings, what harm is there to eat them?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the idols are not real, then the temples are but non-temples, and it would not mean anything for one to eat the offerings in the temples of the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They therefore thought that the offerings could be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is what the Corinthians said.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But Paul said that the offerings should not be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His reason was not that the idols were real or the temples real.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the beginning of chapter eight, Paul said, "Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word "we" refers to the Corinthian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because all have knowledge, therefore they can eat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, "knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The purpose of love is to build others up, whereas knowledge puffs up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is true that the Father is God, that Jesus is the Lord, and that the idols are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But there were many weak brothers in the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They did not have the knowledge; their minds were not as keen as yours are.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although you can turn the words around and consider there to be nothing, these ones do not understand the things you are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They still think that it is against the commandment of the Lord to do something like this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One has to remember who these people were and what their backgrounds were.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today you may think that idols are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But these ones had offered to idols before, thinking that they were offering to God; they thought that the idols were gods.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When you eat, you do not feel anything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But if they eat, they would be reviewing their past sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They were not like you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You have the knowledge, and therefore you can eat and go away.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But they would feel that they were doing the same thing that they had done before and were sinning the same way they had sinned before.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In their mind, they still consider this as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, for the sake of the other Christians, and for the sake of loving them, though you may have the knowledge, you would rather not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have the knowledge, but they do not have the knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They feel condemned in their conscience before God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They feel that they have committed some great sin and are falling away again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, for their sake, we would not eat.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the general meaning of this passage.</S>
