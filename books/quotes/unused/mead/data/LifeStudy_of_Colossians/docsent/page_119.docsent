   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FORTY OBJECTIVE REVELATION, SUBJECTIVE MINISTRY,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE Scripture Reading: Col 1:15-19, 25-29; 2:2b, 6, 9, 18, 23</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although the book of Colossians is short, the revelation it contains is higher than that in any other book in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible may be compared to Mount Zion, which has a number of peaks.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The highest peak in the Bible is Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A COMPARISON</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we compare Colossians with the Gospel of John, we shall be helped to realize how high is the revelation in Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Most of us appreciate the Gospel of John because it is a book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is also a book of the mystery of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the Gospel of John is mysterious, the revelation it contains cannot compare with the revelation in Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John s Gospel opens with the words, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1:18 John goes on to say, No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Colossians does not tell us that the Word was God, but it does speak of Christ as the image of the invisible God 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul s utterance and expression here are marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then, in apposition to this clause, Paul continues in the same verse by speaking of Christ as the firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that the firstborn of all creation is synonymous with the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This proves that the firstborn of all creation is the very image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John 1:3 says, All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Compare this with Paul s word in Colossians 1:16 and 17: Because in Him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And He is before all things, and all things subsist together in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is rather easy to recite John 1:3, but it is difficult to recite Colossians 1:16 and 17, verses which are far more complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to Colossians, the very Christ whom we have received as our Savior and our life is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, the One who is the image of God is the firstborn of all creation because in Him, through Him, and unto Him all things have been created.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, we see from 1:17 that Christ is before all things and that all things subsist together in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This word points to Christ s eternal preexistence and to the fact that all things exist together by Christ as the holding center, just as the spokes of a wheel are held together by the hub at their center.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a revelation as given in these verses is beyond our ability to understand fully.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1:18 Paul goes on to say that Christ is the Head of the Body, the church, and that He is the beginning, the firstborn from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then in verse 19 we read, For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The fullness has more than one aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, Paul is careful to point out that all the fullness, the fullness with its various aspects, is pleased to dwell in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The different aspects of the fullness include the fullness in the firstborn of all creation, the fullness in Christ s being before all things, the fullness in creation s being in Him, through Him, and unto Him, the fullness in being the firstborn from among the dead, and the fullness in His being the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All this fullness was pleased not only to dwell in Christ, but also to reconcile all things to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Where else can we find a revelation to compare with this?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In contrast to the Gospel of John, Colossians does not use simple words, expressions, and sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The sentences in this Epistle are complicated and often include many phrases and clauses.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In fact, all the verses from 1:9 through 20 should be regarded as a single sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is much different from the simple expressions in the Gospel of John: I am the bread of life, I am the light, I am the door.</S>
