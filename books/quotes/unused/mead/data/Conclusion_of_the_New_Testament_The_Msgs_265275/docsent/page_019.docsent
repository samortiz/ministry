   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we see that the Lord Jesus considered the people as sheep and Himself as the Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Christ came to the Jews the first time, they were like lepers, paralytics, demon possessed, and all manner of pitiful persons, because they had no shepherd to care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, He ministered to them not only as a Physician but also as a Shepherd, as prophesied in Isaiah 53:6 and 40:11.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They were cast away and were wandering, not knowing where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To such ones Christ came as the Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the Shepherd, the Lord is not rough but is very fine. b.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matthew 9:36 tells us that when the Lord Jesus saw the crowds, He was "moved with compassion."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Compassion is deeper, finer, and richer than mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Mercy is somewhat outward, but compassion is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, compassion is longer lasting than mercy.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Corinthians 1:30 tells us that Christ has become "wisdom to us from God."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For Christ to become wisdom to us from God indicates that there is a transmission of Christ as wisdom from God to us for our daily experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ should continually become wisdom to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ as wisdom should unceasingly flow from God to us to be our present and practical wisdom in our experience.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are the children of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ's work is to produce us as the children of wisdom.</S>
