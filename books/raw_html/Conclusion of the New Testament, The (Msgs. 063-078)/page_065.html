<h2 class=head2>6. Slaying Antichrist</h2><p>After Christ marries the overcomers, He will slay Antichrist. “The lawless one shall be revealed (whom the Lord Jesus will slay by the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the appearing of His coming)” (2 Thes. 2:8). This will be fulfilled in Revelation 19:19 and 20: “I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army. And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who in his presence had done the signs, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worship his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.” As the heavenly general with the overcoming saints, the faithful ones, as His army, Christ at His coming back will fight against Antichrist, slay him, and cast him into the lake of fire.<h2 class=head2>7. Gathering and Saving All the Tribes of Israel</h2><p>At His coming back Christ will also gather and save all the tribes of Israel. In Paul’s words, at that time “all Israel will be saved, as it is written. The Deliverer will come out of Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob” (Rom. 11:26).<p>Matthew 24:30 and 31 say, “The sign of the Son of Man shall appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the land shall wail, and they shall see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He shall send His angels with a loud trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from the extremities of the heavens to their extremities.” The tribes here refer to the tribes of the nation of Israel, and the land, to the holy land. At Christ’s appearing all the tribes of Israel will repent and wail (Zech. 12:10-14; Rev. 1:7). After the great tribulation, at His coming back to earth, the Lord will gather together the scattered Jews from all parts of the earth to the holy land. This will be the fulfillment not only of His word in Matthew 23:37 but also of God’s promise in the Old Testament (Deut. 30:3-5; Isa. 43:5-7; 49:9-13, 22-26; 51:11; 56:8; 60:4; 62:10-12; 27:13; Ezek. 34:13; 37:21; 28:25).<h2 class=head2>8. Judging the Gentiles, the Living Peoples</h2><p>Finally, in His work at His coming back Christ will judge the Gentiles, the living peoples. This will be the day of Christ’s judgment of the inhabited earth (Acts 17:31). This is the day when Christ will judge the living at the throne of His glory (Matt. 25:31-46). After He defeats Antichrist and his army, many of the Gentiles will still be living on earth. The Lord will gather them to Himself and judge them. Matthew 25:31 and 32 say, “When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He shall sit on His throne of glory; and all the nations shall be gathered before Him, and He shall separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.” “All the nations” are all the Gentiles who will be left at Christ’s coming back to earth after He destroys those Gentiles who follow Antichrist at Armageddon (Rev. 16:14, 16; 19:11-15, 19-21). Those that are regarded as sheep will be transferred into the millennium to be the people under the kingly ruling of Christ and the overcoming believers (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4-6) and under the priestly ministry of the saved Jews (Zech. 8:20-23). Those who are regarded as goats will go with their leader, Antichrist, “into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels” (Matt. 25:41).<p>On earth today there are three categories of people: the believers who comprise the church, Israel as God’s chosen people, and the Gentiles. At His coming back the Lord will deal with all three categories. First, He will take up the overcoming believers and later catch up the majority of the saints. Then He will judge all the believers, selecting those who will make up His bride and His army. Following this, He will marry the overcoming saints and come with His army to destroy Antichrist and his army. Then He will gather and save the scattered Jews. After He sets up His throne in Jerusalem, He will judge all those who remain from the nations. In this way Christ in His work at His coming back will deal with the believers, the Jews, and the Gentiles.
