   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXTRACT OF THE LAST ADAM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can the tabernacle and the offerings, which are the reality of the universe, be realized by us and enjoyed by us?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we have the last Adam and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Who is the last Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The last Adam is God incarnated to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first Adam was simply and merely a man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the last Adam is the God-man, One who has both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The last Adam is God manifested in the flesh and God mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is Adam, but He is Adam with the divine nature and also the divine Person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, the One who is the last Adam is nothing less than God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But He is God with humanity, God with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, this One who is the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The life-giving Spirit is the extract of the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the first message of this series on the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John, we pointed out that an extract may be understood as a liquid extracted from a plant or other organic matter that contains its essence in concentrated form.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A synonym for extract is "spirit," which is the essence of a substance extracted in liquid form.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Wine, for example, may be regarded as an extract, or spirit, of grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever you extract the essence of a particular substance, you get the spirit of that substance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a similar manner, the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit, and now the life-giving Spirit is the extract of the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose a certain kind of herb is useful in healing a particular illness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How can that herb be applied to a sick person?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The best way is to take out the extract of that herb and use it to make medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then a sick person simply needs to take this medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no need for him to eat the herb.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may use this as an illustration of the life-giving Spirit as the extract of the last Adam, God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Just as herbs need to pass through a process in order for an extract to be brought forth, so the last Adam, the God-man, had to pass through a process in order to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just as herbs may be pressed to produce the extract, so the last Adam was "pressed" on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He certainly passed through the process of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chapter fifteen of 1 Corinthians is concerned with resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It was through resurrection that the last Adam was made an extract, an extract that is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Of course, resurrection was preceded by death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, through death and resurrection the last Adam became the omnipresent life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because the Spirit is everywhere, we can contact Him simply by exercising our spirit and calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way we enjoy Him as the Lamb of God, as the all-inclusive offering.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then through Him as the offerings we enter into Him as the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The content of the record of the Bible is the Triune God passing through a process to become the tabernacle, a mutual abode for God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we may dwell in Him and He in us through Himself as the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the content of the Bible and the reality of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Gospel of John is the condensation of the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this book we have the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The reality of the universe is the Triune God as the tabernacle and the offerings, and this reality is the content of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The whole Bible is condensed into one book, the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, in the record of this Gospel we have the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
