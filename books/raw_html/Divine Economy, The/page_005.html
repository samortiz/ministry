<P>Now we need to ask why God created man in His own image, making man a copy of Himself, and why God created man with a spirit. God's economy is the answer to these questions. John 4:24 tells us that God is Spirit and that we must worship Him in spirit. Only the spirit can worship the Spirit. God created man in His own image, after His own likeness, with a spirit to worship Him and contact Him because of His divine economy. The divine economy is to carry out the divine dispensing of God into man. God created man in His own image so that He could dispense Himself into man, and God created man with a spirit so that He could dispense Himself into man.</P><P>A container is always made according to its contents. A round box was meant to contain something round, while a square box was meant to contain something square. God made man as a copy of Himself with the intention that man would be His container. In Romans 9 Paul told us that God created man as a vessel (vv. 21, 23), a container to contain God. From the time I was twenty years old, for seven and a half years, I was with some very knowledgeable teachers of the Bible. They taught me the dispensations, the prophecies, and the typologies. This was all very good. But they never told me that God made man as His container. We all need to see that we were made to contain God. When I was a little boy, I attended Sunday school. I was told the story of God's creation and many stories of Jesus, but I was never told that I was made to be God's container. Christian teachers teach many things. They may teach us that we have to love our neighbors, that the wives should be submissive to the husbands, that the husbands should love  the wives, that the children should honor their parents, that the parents should not provoke their children, that the servants should be faithful, and that the masters need to be kind. Many of us were taught these things in the past, but we were never told that we were made to contain God. This is wonderful! We all need to have the realization to declare&#151;"I am a container of God!" God wants to be our contents. The God who is love, light, holiness, and righteousness is our contents! We have to be filled with Him.</P><P>We must realize that God is a Spirit. God is invisible in the same way that electricity is invisible. Edison invented the light bulb to express electricity. In like manner, radio waves are invisible, and in those waves there may be some Japanese music or some Italian singing. Within a radio there is a receiver to receive these waves that contain the music and the singing. Man is just like a radio with a receiver to receive the invisible God. One day God "tuned our spirit" to receive Him, the invisible Spirit. Our human spirit is the receiver for us to receive "the heavenly music," the invisible God. We can exercise our spirit, our inner receiver, to receive the heavenly divine transmission of the wonderful Triune God. When we sing to the Lord, when we pray and call upon the name of the Lord, the "heavenly electricity" gets into us to make us "crazy" with the enjoyment of Christ. We were made as copies of God to contain Him, and we were created with a spirit, which is the receiver for us to receive God the Spirit as the "heavenly radio waves."</P>
