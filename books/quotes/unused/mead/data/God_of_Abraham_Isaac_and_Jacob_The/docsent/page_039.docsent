   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE THIRD TEST THE OFFERING OF ISAAC</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Abraham had been tested twice concerning his son.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first test was in the begetting of Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second test was in praying for the women of Abimelech's house.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now he was tested for the third time concerning his son.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This third test was the offering up of his son Isaac on Mount Moriah.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Abraham Offering Isaac</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Abraham had reached the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One can say that he had reached the peak, the pinnacle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After chapter twenty-two, the record turns to the story of his old age.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, chapter twenty-two marks the peak of Abraham's life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One can say that this was the high noon of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Genesis 22:1-2 says, "And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This demand had to do with the fulfillment of God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Isaac was Abraham's only son, and he was his beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was a great price for Abraham to offer up Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But this is still not the main point.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hebrews 11 shows us something that Genesis 22 does not record.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hebrews 11:18 says, "In Isaac shall your seed be called."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, it was not just a matter of sacrificing Abraham's beloved son, but a matter of God's own promise, goal, and work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God did not give Abraham's son to him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His intention was to achieve His goal through Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If Isaac died, what would happen?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was Abraham's test.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This test involved himself as an individual and himself as a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hebrews 11:18 shows us the aspect of the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God promised to give Abraham a son.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet He wanted this son to be offered up as a burnt offering!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is something that the flesh cannot stand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A burnt offering must be burned by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All of God's promises hinged on Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If Isaac was burned up, would not God's promises be burned up?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's goal and His work were with Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If he was burned up, would not God's promise, goal, and work be burned up as well?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was reasonable and right to cast out Ishmael because he was born of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But Isaac was born according to God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why should he be offered up as a burnt offering?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Abraham had sought for satisfaction with Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But God Himself said, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was God who repeatedly said that Sarah would have a son.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Abraham did not insist on having this son; it was God who gave this son to him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now God wanted him back, and not in an ordinary way, but as a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was beyond his comprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If Isaac should not have been born, God should have told him sooner.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If it was right for Isaac to be born, Abraham should have been able to keep him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If God did not want Abraham to keep Isaac, He should not have given Isaac to him in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If He did want Abraham to have Isaac, He should not have demanded that he be offered up as a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What was the purpose of begetting a son and then offering him up?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was solely to bring Abraham into a deeper realization of God as the Father!</S>
