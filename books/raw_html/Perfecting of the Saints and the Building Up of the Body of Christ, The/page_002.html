<p>Prayer: Lord, You have brought us out of many preoccupations and have called us into Your name. Tonight we are all gathered together. Here we have You, we have Your Spirit, we have Your name, and even more we have Your Word. Lord, when we read Your Word, we sense Your presence. While we are speaking here, may You vindicate that we are one spirit with You. Speak through our speaking. While we speak, may You speak also. O Lord, grant us the feeling, and grant us Your thoughts, Your expression, and Your utterance, even a spontaneous and fresh utterance, an utterance that will meet Your need as well as ours. Lord, what we need is just You. You are the Word, and You are the Spirit. You are even our expression and utterance. Strengthen us within and without, and make our inner man stronger than our outer man. Lord, may You pour Yourself upon us, and fill us up, nourish us, saturate us, and water us. Wherever we are, whether we sit on the balcony or on the main floor, may You fill us. Open up Your Word to every one of us. Lord, may You teach us mouth to mouth and reveal to us Spirit to spirit. May we touch You and Your presence, Your loveliness, and Your grace. May everyone present in this meeting feel Your presence with us. Grant us the warmth, the binding of our wounds, the healing, the recovery, and even the strengthening. Lord Jesus, we really need You. We wait on You from the depth of our being. Thank You that You have taken the church in Taipei onto the proper track and that it is now going on steadfastly in this new way. May You glorify Your name again tonight. Shame Your enemy, and grant Your blessings to us. We bind the evil one, which is Your enemy, by Your victorious name. Not only do we bind him here in Taipei; we bind him over the whole earth that there would be churches in Your recovery everywhere on earth. Do destroy all of his evil works and all the dark moves. We believe that the cross has overcome the enemy. Today we declare Your victory by the cross. Manifest Your glory, and shame Your enemy. We lift up our hands and call on You. Amen.</p>
<p>In this special conference, we want to see something higher than before. The inward reality is deeper, more far-reaching, and profound. The six verses in Ephesians 4:11-16 are the peak of the truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Without the leading of the Lord and the revelation of the Bible, there is no way for us to understand them. What is an apostle? What is a prophet? What is an evangelist? What is a shepherd and teacher? How do these four kinds of gifts combine together to perfect the saints for the work of the ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ? How do we arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ? When you put these words together, seemingly you can understand all the words and phrases. But when you put the six verses together, it is difficult to understand the meaning of them. For this reason, tonight we have to ask the Lord to bring us to this peak of the Bible.</p>
