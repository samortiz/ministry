   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The heavenly armies following the Lord will fight against Antichrist and the false prophet and their armies and will destroy them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 19 speaks of Christ s enemies: I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ s enemies are the beast, Antichrist undoubtedly including his associate, the false prophet , and the kings of the earth and their armies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In particular, the kings of the earth include the ten kings under Antichrist 17:12-14 , and the armies include the two hundred million horsemen from the rising of the sun 9:14-16; 16:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The beast and the kings of the earth and their armies will gather together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army 19:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ and His armies will defeat Antichrist and his armies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The beast will be seized, and with him the false prophet, who in his presence did signs by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These two will be cast alive into the lake of fire, which burns with brimstone v. 20 . Antichrist and the false prophet will be the first to be cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The rest will be killed with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse v. 21 . This is Christ as the King of kings and Lord of lords with His armies defeating Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the end of the great tribulation three unclean spirits like frogs will come out of the mouths of the dragon, Antichrist, and the false prophet 16:13 .</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that Satan and his power to act will be limited to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The kings on earth will be gathered to the place which in Hebrew is called Armageddon v. 16 . All the kings and their forces, including the two hundred million horsemen spoken of in 9:14-16, will come forward to participate in the war at Armageddon.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The war at Armageddon will be the last war among mankind before the millennium.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Antichrist will attempt to destroy them also; however, Jehovah as Christ will come with His saints 14:3, 5 and go forth to fight against and defeat Antichrist and his followers, the nations Joel 3:11; Rev 17:14; 19:11-21 .</S>
