   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE PERSON OF AN ELDER I. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we read the whole Bible carefully, we can see that God's plan and His purpose are fulfilled in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without the church, God's plan cannot be fulfilled, and God's desire cannot be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, we can say that God's plan and His desire hinge upon the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible also shows us that the focus of the church is the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a local church has no elders, strictly speaking, it is as if there were no church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This can be compared to a country in the world that cannot be considered a nation because there are citizens, but there is no government.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same principle, it does not matter how many brothers and sisters there are in a locality; if no elders are raised up, they cannot be considered a church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a nation must have a legitimate government in addition to having citizens, so a church must have elders appointed in addition to having a group of saved saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I hope that the brothers and sisters would have a strong feeling concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not only does the Bible say this, but history also testifies to this, and our experience can also attest to it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Wherever there are strong elders, there are strong churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Wherever there are spiritual elders, there are spiritual churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether a church is strong or weak, spiritual or fleshly, absolutely depends on the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Wherever you go, the condition of the elders in that place determines the condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is something very real.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, we have to see that the most important group of people in the whole universe is the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If there were no church, the universe would be a void; it would be useless to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The elders are the center of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without the elders, the church would likewise be a void.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, the elders are the most important group of people in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps some brothers would ask, "Does not the Bible say that the apostles are higher and more important than the elders?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No doubt, the apostles are the ones to raise up the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even the elders in the church are appointed by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please remember, however, that the key to the condition in the church does not hinge on the apostles; rather it hinges on the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have the assurance to say that if a local church has strong elders, even if the apostles are a little weak, the church will nevertheless be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if the elders are weak, even if the apostles are strong, the church will still be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whether a church is strong or weak depends directly on the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From the seven epistles in Revelation, you can clearly see the importance of the position of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The beginning of Revelation shows us that in the whole universe God's testimony is the churches in the different localities as His lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The seven lampstands are the seven local churches, shining for God in the universe as His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>None of the seven epistles to the churches were written to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every one of them was for the messengers of the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Under normal circumstances, the messengers of the church are the elders of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is true that the different churches are God's lampstands in the different places.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet when the Lord came to speak, He did not speak directly to the churches; rather He spoke to the messengers of the churches.</S>
