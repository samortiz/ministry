   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. Not Speaking to Abraham for Thirteen Years</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God did not speak to Abraham for thirteen years because he took Hagar as his concubine, who brought forth for him a son, Ishmael, when he was eighty-six years old Gen 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Abraham offended God, his Friend.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, God would not fellowship with Abraham for thirteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 16:16 says, "And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then Genesis 17:1 says, "And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram..."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This shows that for thirteen years there was not any communication, fellowship, or speaking between God and Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I. Appearing the Seventh Time to Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When He Was Ninety-nine Years Old</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God appeared the seventh time to Abraham when he was ninety-nine years old and made with him the covenant of circumcision so that he would be the father of a multitude of nations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He also changed his name from Abram to Abraham and his wife's name from Sarai to Sarah, of whom Abraham would have a son, Isaac Gen 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The covenant of circumcision is a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the chosen ones of God should be circumcised, meaning that they should cut off, crucify, their flesh Gal 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The body of the flesh should be cut off, crucified Col 2:11 , to regenerate us and renew us, making us a new person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Abraham was living a model of the Christian life, because the covenant of circumcision signifies that he was crucified, regenerated, and renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was so that he would be the father of a multitude of nations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, his name and his wife's name were changed from Abram and Sarai to Abraham and Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because the person is changed, the name should also be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, Sarah gave birth to Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that after we have been crucified and regenerated, we will bring forth the real seed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Otherwise, we will produce Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are not crucified, regenerated, and renewed, we cannot produce Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We will produce false Christians, not the real believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can produce the real believers only by being circumcised, that is, by being crucified, regenerated, and renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>J. Appearing the Eighth Time</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>to Him by the Oaks of Mamre</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God appeared the eighth time to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre, fellowshipping with him as with His friend Gen 18; 2 Chron 20:7; Isa 41:8; James 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the past I wondered why God came with two angels to visit and stay with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God conversed with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Abraham served Him water for Him to wash His feet, and Abraham's wife made a meal for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God talked with Abraham as a friend.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Abraham saw God, conversed with God, and walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then God was forced to tell him what He was about to do to Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God indicated that He could not hide this from Abraham because Abraham was His intimate friend.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, God's purpose and intention in coming to visit Abraham was for Lot's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God told Abraham what He was about to do to Sodom with the intention that Abraham would intercede.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God was motivating Abraham to pray for Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, God and Abraham, as close friends, were speaking of Lot but they did not mention Lot's name.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually, Lot was saved from Sodom, meaning that God answered Abraham's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Genesis 19:29 says that when God destroyed Sodom, He remembered Abraham and sent Lot out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That means He answered Abraham's intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This shows that our living the Christian life must be to the extent that we become God's friend and God becomes our Friend.</S>
