   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT CHRIST AS GOD'S WORD ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 1:1-2 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was in the beginning with God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we are told that the Son of God is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, the ministry of the word is the ministry of God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To serve the church with God's word means to serve the church with God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A minister of God's word dispenses God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Just like the seven deacons in Acts 6 who served by dispensing food to the saints, a minister of the word is one who serves by dispensing the word to others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet this word is not merely words per se; this word is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This word is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For this reason, serving others with the word means to serve them with the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A minister serves the church by ministering God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some people can only serve others with biblical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They cannot serve others with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They live in the realm of letters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They can only serve others with truths, doctrines, and teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their service only goes this far.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They cannot serve others with the Christ who is contained in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They cannot minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the problem with many people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's word is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible is not merely a book; it is not merely pages of writings from which men receive doctrines and teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the book, the Bible, is separated from the person, Christ, the book is a dead thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In one realm the Bible is a book; in another realm it is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a person remains in the first realm, all he has is the book, and he cannot serve as a minister of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He can only minister doctrines, truths, and teachings to others; he cannot minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only those who are in another realm can minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul's word is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said, "So then we, from now on, know no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer" 2 Cor 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today we do not know Christ according to the flesh; rather, we have to know Him according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, we do not know Him as the Jesus of Nazareth who walked on the earth, that is, the historical Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today we know Him as the Christ in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to remember that those who know Him as the historical man do not necessarily know Him at all.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many Jews thought that they knew the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They said, "Is not this the carpenter's son?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And His sisters, are they not all with us?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Matt 13:55-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They thought that they knew Him because they knew these things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we know that they did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>John the Baptist was a man from God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet he confessed, saying, "He who is stronger than I comes after me, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have baptized you in water, but He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit" Mark 1:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To stoop down and untie someone's sandal was a work of slaves at the time of the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the master came to the door, the slave would stoop down and untie his sandals.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This was a very humiliating work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>John knew that the One who was to come after him was far greater than he.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Did he understand it?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yes, he did.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Was he clear about it?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yes, he was.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet he did not know that the Lord Jesus was this very One who was to come after him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was not clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As far as their fleshly relationship went, John was Jesus' cousin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They had known each other since their youth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But he did not know that the Lord Jesus was the One who was to come after him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He said, "And I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God" John 1:33-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the day when the Lord Jesus was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, and John recognized this Jesus, who had been his cousin for thirty years, as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Prior to this time he was close to the Lord and very intimate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yet he did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It was the Spirit who opened his eyes to recognize such a One.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A man could be with the Lord Jesus for thirty years on earth and yet still fail to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>During those thirty years, John the Baptist kept up his acquaintance with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yet he only knew Him as his own cousin.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He knew the historical Jesus, the Jesus from Nazareth, but he did not realize that this Jesus of Nazareth was God.</S>
