   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Wherever God Is Being Holy</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The word holy is not found in the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first time this word is used is in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In a sense, man in Genesis was still not brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was in the book of Exodus, not in the book of Genesis, that God began to have a dwelling place on earth, and to bring man into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No matter how high were the spiritual experiences of those in Genesis, there was not on earth the Holy of Holies for man to enter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But in Exodus something extraordinary took place: on earth among men there was a place called the Holy of Holies, and God was there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Men could go to that place and meet God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There in the Holy of Holies, God spoke and administrated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because such a place is not to be found in Genesis, the word holy is not used in that book.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When God came in to charge His people to build the tabernacle with the Holy of Holies, the word holy began to be used.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first mention of this word is in the calling of Moses in Exodus 3.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As Moses was shepherding the flock, he saw a bush burning in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When he turned aside to see why the bush was not consumed, God spoke to him out of the bush, saying, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground Exo 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that wherever God is, that place is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Remember, only God is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you have nothing to do with God, then you are not holy, no matter how sinless or perfect you may be.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may be sinless and altogether perfect, but if you are not related to God, you are not holy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But once you are related to God, you immediately become holy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>C. Whatever Is of and for God Being Holy</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Any place, any thing, any matter, and any person that is related to God is holy, for whatever is both of God and for God is holy Lev 20:26; Num 16:5; Neh 8:9; Exo 30:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>D. The Spirit of God</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Reaching People Being Holy</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, when the Spirit of God reaches us, He is holy Luke 1:35; Matt 1:20; 28:19; see Rom 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the reason that the term Holy Spirit is not used in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The occurrences of this term in Psalm 51:11 and Isaiah 63:10 and 11 should be rendered the spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This term was first used when the Lord Jesus was about to be conceived in Mary Luke 1:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This signifies that holiness brings God to man and man to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To go further, it also means to bring God into man and man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When God gets into us, we are holy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we get into God, we are more holy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when we are mingled with God, we are most holy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, we become holy by having God in us, we become more holy by being in God, and we become the holiest by being mingled, soaked, and saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The book of Ephesians calls the believers saints 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everyone who has believed in the Lord Jesus is a saint.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But some saints are holy, some are holier, and some are the holiest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no doubt that we all are holy, but it is open to question whether or not we are holier or the holiest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, during your time with the Lord in the morning, you may be under the process of being soaked and saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But then your wife may say something to offend you and you lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, after breakfast you go back to your room and pray, O Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I was being saturated with You, but one word from my wife caused me to be apart from You.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Lord, bring me back to the soaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Lord, how I praise You for the cleansing blood!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The purpose of this illustration is to point out that when we are in touch with God, we are holy, for then we are under His saturation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when we are away from God, we are not holy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I repeat, to be holy is not to be perfect or sinless; it is to be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we are saturated and soaked with God, we shall be the holiest.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have seen that holiness is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first time the word holy was used was when God began to have a people on earth among whom He might dwell and who might come into His presence in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From that time onward, this word is used again and again in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So many things found in these books are called holy because in these books God has come among man and man has been brought to God; thus everything related to the tabernacle and the priesthood was holy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everything related to God s ordination in the Old Testament was holy because it involved the meeting together of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have pointed out that the term Holy Spirit was used the first time when the Lord Jesus was conceived in the virgin Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This was something far greater than God s dwelling in a tabernacle among men.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The tabernacle was God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But Christ s incarnation was God s tabernacling among men.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>John 1:14 says, The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This began when Christ was conceived within the womb of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His conception was not only a matter of holiness, but also a matter of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although many things in the Old Testament were holy, there was not anything that was of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only in the New Testament time, when God came into man and became man, do we have something that is of the Holy Spirit Matt 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the Greek text of the New Testament many times the expression the Spirit, the holy is used 1 Thes 4:8; Heb 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have not yet found an adequate explanation of such an expression in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some explain it as merely being a Greek idiom, but I doubt that this explanation is adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to my spirit, I believe that the reason for this is that in the New Testament the emphasis is not only on the Spirit, but also on holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Spirit is holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, the Holy Spirit is sometimes called the Spirit, the holy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Where the Spirit is, there holiness is also.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today, the Spirit is not only in us; He is making Himself one with us and us one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, holiness actually means to be saturated with God, to cause a common person to be fully saturated with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When God came to dwell among men, the word holy was used the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When God came as man, the term Holy Spirit was first mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In order for an article of furniture in the tabernacle to be holy, there was no need of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Once the furniture was placed into the tabernacle for God, it immediately became holy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are not like furniture that is for God; we are living people with the Spirit of God in us to make us one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is not merely to be holy, but to be saturated with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To be holy is firstly to be separated to God; secondly, to be taken over by God; thirdly, to be possessed by God; and fourthly, to be saturated with God and one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Eventually, the issue of this in the Bible is the New Jerusalem, which is called the holy city, a city that not only belongs to God and is for God, but a city possessed by God, saturated with God, and one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The New Jerusalem is a holy entity belonging to God, possessed by God, saturated with God, and one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is holiness.</S>
