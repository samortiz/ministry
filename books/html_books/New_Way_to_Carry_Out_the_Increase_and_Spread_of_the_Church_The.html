<p>In our fellowship concerning the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date move, I do not have any intention to stir up a revival. I want the Lord to get an army to fight the battle. If all of us would take the fellowship in this book to join the divine army, the Lord would gain more and more on this earth for the carrying out of His New Testament economy to build His church, to prepare His bride, to bring in His kingdom, to consummate the age. In this chapter we want to fellowship concerning how to visit people by knocking on their doors.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPREADING THE CHURCH LIFE AND DISTRIBUTING<br />
THE TRUTH TO THE LORD&rsquo;S HUNGRY SEEKERS</h2>
<p>I want to tell you what is on my heart and why I have been so much burdened with this matter. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery began among us in 1922. Now sixty-four years have passed. In all these sixty-four years, new light concerning the truth has come to us nearly every year. In 1962 the Lord brought His recovery to the United States. Within these twenty-four years that the recovery has been in the United States, many crucial truths have been revealed to us. The contents of a forty-four chapter book entitled <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy,</em> comprised of messages I gave in 1984, are the consummation of what the Lord has shown us in His recovery. It would be more than worthwhile for you to spend the time to read this book.</p>
<p>In 1925 I received the vision of the recovery, but I never had the chance to practically enter into it until 1932. I came into the center of the recovery, working with Brother Nee for eighteen years. Then I was sent out to Taiwan and stayed there for over ten years. Finally, I came to the United States and have been here for twenty-four years. According to my observation throughout these past fifty-four years, in spite of how many truths the Lord has released to us, the rate of increase and the speed of the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony have not been as fast as we expected. When we came to Taiwan from mainland China, within less than six years we had a hundredfold increase. We began the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in Taiwan in 1949. By 1955 we went up from about less than five hundred people on the whole island to about fifty thousand. But after that time the rate of increase went down, and it never came back. In the first twelve years of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States from 1962 to 1974, our rate of increase was quite promising. Since 1974, the rate of increase among us has been very low, and the spread has also been quite slow. On the one hand, this has been due to the opposition. We cannot deny this. Since 1922 on mainland China there has always been a battle fought for the truth because we would not compromise. We do not like to have any kind of mixture, and we would not deviate from the track of the divine truth. This factor has limited and restricted us. It has been hard to get the increase because of this battle. We also have to realize that despite the fact that we have received so many truths, we did not pay much attention to the way to carry out the truths.</p>
<p>We have spent a tremendous amount of time and energy to dive into the truth. In note 6<sup>6</sup> in 1 John 1 of the Recovery Version, there are eight points concerning the definition of the word truth according to the New Testament usage. I spent about two weeks to write this one note. This is just one example of how much time and how much energy we spent to get into the truths, but we did not spend that much time to get into the way to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We were very good in &ldquo;producing cargo,&rdquo; but we did not spend enough time on &ldquo;marketing the cargo.&rdquo; Since October of 1984, I began to pay attention to our marketing, to our way. We would not follow any worldly way, but we want to take the way revealed in the Bible. I came back to the New Testament once more to thoroughly study the matter of meeting. I found out that the God-ordained New Testament way of meeting is in the homes (Acts 2:46; 5:42; 20:20; Rom. 16:5; 1 Cor. 16:19; Col. 4:15; Philem. 2). On the day of Pentecost, three thousand new ones were brought into the church life, and the same day they began to meet in the homes (Acts 2:46). The Bible says that they met from house to house. &ldquo;House to house&rdquo; means that every one of the homes had a meeting. No person organized, taught, or invented this. It was altogether guided by the Holy Spirit. Meeting from house to house was the Holy Spirit-guided and God-ordained way.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the church life in Acts the believers also met in the temple, but that was something temporary. God had no intention to ask the New Testament believers to meet in the temple forsaken by God (Matt. 23:38&mdash;24:2 and note 1<sup>1</sup> in Matt. 24). In 1 Corinthians 14:23 Paul refers to meetings in which &ldquo;the whole church comes together in one place&rdquo; (cf. 14:26). There are two categories of the way to meet&mdash;one is to have home meetings and the other is to have big meetings. But for so many years we only paid attention to the big meetings and neglected the home meetings.</p>
<p>From 1949 to 1955 when I was in Taiwan, we greatly used the small group meetings. That was one of the factors of the hundredfold increase within five or six years. But from that time onward gradually up to October of 1984 when I went back to Taiwan, the small group way was nearly put aside unintentionally. The saints in Taiwan had come down from the top of a mountain to a valley, not on a steep slope but on a very flat slope little by little over twenty-nine years. The decline was unnoticeable because the church in Taipei still had a large number. When I left Taipei, there were over twenty-two thousand saints. Through all the years of having mostly big meetings, by 1984 the church in Taipei had only eleven thousand left. This factor caused me to search the Scriptures again concerning our way of meeting. I found out that the home meetings are the God-ordained way to meet.</p>
<p>There are many established local churches on this earth, and the cargo, the merchandise, of the Lord&rsquo;s precious truths is with us. But how can we spread the church life and distribute the truth to so many hungry seekers? We do not want to take any worldly way or any human-invented way to do this. We must take the home meeting way. The entire globe is under a serious famine of spiritual food comparable to the real famine at Joseph&rsquo;s time when only his storehouses were full of food (Gen. 41:56-57). In the same way we must honestly testify that our storehouses are full of food which can meet the need of the present world.</p>
<p>Since 1974 we began to have the Life-study on the New Testament. Now we have printed Life-study Messages covering every book of the New Testament in addition to Genesis and Exodus in the Old Testament. Our Recovery Version of the New Testament has been printed, and its notes present the truth, minister the life supply, solve the common and hard problems in the New Testament, and open up the books of the Bible. We have also published many books full of spiritual truths within the last twenty years. Now is the time that people all over the globe are waiting for the truth. Our responsibility, our obligation, is to distribute, to send out the truth, by home meetings. The Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses and the Mormons practice going to others&rsquo; homes with heretical teachings, but our way to visit people by knocking on their doors is very different from their way. What I will share with you is the result of our experience in Taipei for the past one and a half years. During this time we have discovered and learned a lot.</p><h2 class="head1">BRINGING A MEETING TO THEM IN THEIR HOMES</h2>
<p>First, when we are going to knock on people&rsquo;s doors we must learn one thing&mdash;we are not going out to invite people to our meeting. We are going out to send a meeting to their homes. When we go to them, we bring the meeting to them. Some dear saints have been absent from the church meetings for years. If we asked them to come back to the meetings, it would be hard for them. Out of one hundred, maybe three or five would come back. But the new way we have found out is so easy. If you go to visit some saints who have been absent from the meeting for five years, you can go to them and have a meeting in their home. Then they would ask you to come back again. Right away in a backslider&rsquo;s home, a meeting is set up. They are happy to have home meetings in their homes by your going there.</p>
<p>In the past we had big gospel meetings with gospel campaigns and conferences, but very few were really caught by the Lord. Now we found out that it is so easy to knock on the doors and establish a home meeting in another person&rsquo;s home. To knock on people&rsquo;s doors and invite them to our meeting is to practice the old way. When you open up your mouth in this way, you will lose. You will receive no for an answer most of the time. Our intention is not to bring people into the church life in this way.</p>
<p>In Taipei we scheduled that from 1985, within five years five hundred new full-timers would be produced every year. Right away the Lord did something in Taipei since these full-timers took the new way to visit people. The news came back that hundreds were baptized. At first all the elders were happy, but after two or three months they became disappointed. They said, &ldquo;Where are the baptized ones? We supplied all the full-timers to go out to baptize people, but thus far we have not seen one coming to the church meetings. Also, the more full-timers we supply, the more of them we lose. At the church meeting time they do not come to the meeting but go out to baptize people. Therefore, our number is reduced in the church meetings.&rdquo; I told the brothers not to be in so much of a hurry. When you sow you apparently lose something, but your labor needs a period of time for the fruit of it to be seen (Psa. 126:5-6). When you have a harvest you will be happy. We all would like to have a quick harvest. Tonight I sow and tomorrow I reap. Then everyone is happy immediately. But we must realize that a quick harvest only yields artificial things. It takes time for real flowers to grow into many blossoms, but factories can produce artificial flowers overnight by the thousands. Constantine the Great did something like this when he accepted Christianity and made it a state religion. Millions of unbelievers became &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; by Constantine&rsquo;s edict, without having to be born again. The millions that became &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; were artificial believers, not genuine believers.</p>
<p>We need to exercise patience. We should not expect to reap quickly. We have to go out to sow like the Lord Jesus did. We need to read the four Gospels again to see how much the Lord sowed. At one time He fed five thousand (Matt. 14:14-21), and at another time He fed four thousand (15:32-39), not including the women and children. The Lord sowed Himself into thousands of people, but eventually in Acts there were only one hundred and twenty in the upper room (1:15). Those one hundred and twenty were the cream of the result of the Lord&rsquo;s work after three and a half years. In His resurrection He showed Himself to over five hundred disciples (1 Cor. 15:6), but not all five hundred were there in Jerusalem&mdash;only one hundred and twenty. We have to follow the Lord to sow, the more the better. Do the best to sow. Sooner or later whatever you sow will become your reaping.</p>
<p>When you go, you must first get yourself prepared. The best way to get yourself prepared is to pray to contact the Lord, not to pray for your going out, not to pray for the gospel work, but to pray to fellowship with the Lord. Let Him enlighten you so your entire being will be brought fully into light; let Him shine in you, upon you, over you, and through you. In the light you will see all your shortcomings, all your weak points, all kinds of sinful things. Spontaneously you will make a thorough confession. The more you confess, the more you will be filled by the Spirit. To prepare yourself for going out to visit people by knocking on doors, you should be filled with the Spirit. Acts 4:31 says that after praying the believers were all filled with the Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness. For the brothers and sisters to go out to knock on others&rsquo; doors may be quite threatening, but if we get ourselves prepared by being filled with the Spirit, we will have the boldness.</p><h2 class="head1">PRESENTING THE GOSPEL AND THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>I want to stress one thing&mdash;when you go to knock on doors, do not invite people to come to your meeting. You must forget about this. Also, when you go in do not talk to them too much. You may speak two sentences of greetings, and then tell them you want to present the gospel or the truth to them. You have to pray that the Lord would give you the instant utterance, speaking the same thing to present the gospel and the truth but by different utterance with different people. When you talk to an older man you should use one kind of expression, and when you talk to a young lady or young boy you have to change your utterance. You must look to the Lord and follow His leading. He will give you the words. Then you will find out whether your contact is saved or not. If he is saved, you do not need to repeat the gospel, but you surely have to present the truth. If he is not saved, you should present the gospel with the truth. You should not divide the truth from the gospel. Again I say, do not go to people to invite them to come to your meeting, but present the truth to them and bring the meeting to their home.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING OUR PUBLICATIONS</h2>
<p>When you begin to present the gospel and the truth you should not speak your own word. The more you speak your own word, the more impact you will lose because your contacts do not know who you are or what your status is. When you speak something, they may not have much confidence in it. But if you present them a proper, printed book, they will be impressed. In general, people respect books because a book should be written with much consideration and scholarship. When you present a book, they would respect it, especially when you present the Bible. The Bible is a famous and highly regarded book. Mostly everyone, even the opposers, would recognize that the Bible is a great book. If you present them a short portion of the Bible and say something in brief according to the notes in the Recovery Version, this will surprise and impress them. They will feel that you are a person who knows the top book in this world, so this will stir up their respect and give them confidence in what you present.</p>
<p>When you go out, you must have a Recovery Version and the rainbow booklets, which contain a slightly edited version of the Life-study Messages. The most important publication for you to bring is the booklet entitled <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em> Using this booklet is the best way to catch people. This booklet is also good for those who are saved, because so many saved ones never got to know what the mystery of human life is. If you use this, you will catch them. In Taiwan thousands have been brought to the Lord through this booklet. You do not need to read the whole booklet with them. This booklet talks about four keys to the mystery of human life. Just use one key with those that you visit. People respect books and they respect the Bible even more. You must open up the meaning, the revelation, of the Bible to people in a short time. Then show them a note in the Recovery Version, and let them read it. This will catch them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GRASPING THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD THEM<br />
TO PRAY AND BELIEVE IN THE LORD JESUS</h2>
<p>Salesmen know that if they talk too much, they will lose their sale. Basically, they impress people with their product in as little time as possible. When the person says that their product is good, that is the time for them to close the deal. They do not talk any further. We found out the same thing in presenting the gospel with the truth to people. When we are reading from <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> with someone and they respond positively, that is the time for us to lead them to pray and to get them baptized. But the more you talk, the more the person may want you to leave.</p>
<p>Most people will be polite to you since you are so polite to them, going to visit them voluntarily and showing them a book. If you ask them to read one paragraph of <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> with you, they would say that it is very good after reading it. At least they would say that it is good. When they say this, you should say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pray.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t ask, &ldquo;Would you pray?&rdquo; If you ask this, surely most of the people would say no. No one trains their little children to say no, but they spontaneously know how to say no. A knowledgeable mother would never ask the children, &ldquo;Would you eat this?&rdquo; She would tell the children to eat it, leaving them no choice. If she asked her children whether or not they wanted to eat something or drink something, they might say no most of the time. Thus, we should not ask our contact any question. Just say, &ldquo;Please read this.&rdquo; He will be polite and may be honest enough to say that what he read was very good or good. When you say, &ldquo;Let us pray,&rdquo; he will follow you to pray. Once the word &ldquo;good&rdquo; comes out of his mouth, that is the golden opportunity to lead him to pray. Just lead him or her to pray by repeating what you say to the Lord. His prayer may initially be something not real, but after praying two or three sentences it becomes real. You could lead him to pray something simple such as, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, thank You that You died for me. Lord Jesus, I call on Your name. Lord Jesus, I love You, and I receive You as my life right now.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">ASSURING THEM THAT THEY ARE SAVED<br />
BY CALLING ON THE LORD</h2>
<p>After they pray, you must have the boldness to assure them with a verse that they are saved, and the best verse is Romans 10:13&mdash;&ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo; You have to give them this verse and assure them with this verse that they have been saved. Do not ask them if they are saved. If you ask them, they would probably say that they do not think, believe, or feel that they are saved. Your responsibility is to assure them that they have been saved. Let them read Romans 10:13.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIRECTING THEM TO BE BAPTIZED</h2>
<p>Then read to them Mark 16:16 which says, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; After they pray and have been given the assurance that the Lord Jesus lives in them, you need to say, &ldquo;Let us be baptized.&rdquo; Do not ask them if they would like to be baptized because you would receive no for an answer most of the time. This is why I say to direct them to be baptized.</p>
<p>According to our experience in Taipei, by using these principles the saints were successful eighty percent of the time. Generally, your contacts will follow your directions. You may be speaking to the husband of a family concerning getting baptized, and at the same time direct the wife to fill up the bathtub with water before he has even decided. Sometimes the wife would even tell the husband to be baptized even though she has not yet decided to be baptized. In Taipei the saints always went out in groups of three or four. While two or three would be baptizing the husband, a sister would be fellowshipping with the wife. After the husband was baptized, then she would say to the wife, &ldquo;Let us be baptized.&rdquo; Most followed this direction. You may be concerned about bringing in some false ones. But you must realize that at the beginning everyone seems to be false. After you preach the gospel to a person, after he believes and is baptized, and after some prayer, this false one becomes a real believer. He is now one with you.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE CHANCE<br />
TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THEM<br />
FOR THE NEXT MEETING</h2>
<p>After you direct someone to be baptized, take the chance to make an appointment with them for the next meeting. Do not ask them if you can meet with them again. This gives them the ground to refuse you. You need to talk with them to induce them to meet with you again. Many times they would ask you if you would come back again. Take this opportunity to make an appointment with them that fits in with their time schedule. When you visit them the next time, you will present more truths and they will get more help. Eventually, you can take the opportunity to make appointments for regular meetings in their homes weekly. Some of the homes that you visit will have already been prepared by the Lord just as the Lord prepared the house of Cornelius (Acts 10:17-33). When Peter went to Cornelius&rsquo;s house, everything was ready. From the time that you knock on the door until you make an appointment for another meeting should take about twenty minutes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOCKING ON DOORS<br />
FOR THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>I would propose to all the churches that the leading ones should take the lead to practice this, to get some experience either in some homes or in the meeting hall. Then based upon what you have learned in this practice, go out strictly according to all these instructions. I believe that you will &ldquo;close many deals.&rdquo; Go and do it!</p>
<p>We expect all the full-time trainees to go out every day to knock on doors. We are also expecting them to baptize one person a week as a result of this labor. Fifty door knockers will bring in two thousand six hundred yearly. If you do not practice what I am fellowshipping with you, this may seem like a dream. But if you practice this, it is not a dream. Twenty full-timers who knock on doors every day of the week should bring in about one thousand a year. After my study and investigation, I have the full assurance that this is workable. Ten full-timers could bring in forty every month and four hundred eighty new ones in an entire year. It is worthwhile for some to drop their jobs to be the &ldquo;door knockers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would also like to say a word to the elders. Do not merely be an elder in the church service office. Go out to knock on the doors. If a full-time elder would take my word to knock on doors every day, he could bring in fifty-two a year. Suppose you would go seven days a week for about two hours every day. Within these two hours you could knock on at least ten doors. Out of these ten doors perhaps five will open to you. This means thirty-five doors will be opened to you per week. Out of these thirty-five, you can surely baptize one.</p>
<p>We must admit that in the past we had the wrong way, so we wasted much of our time. We had big gatherings for gospel preaching. We labored much and invited people to gospel feasts. When someone came to our feast, this was a great gift to us. We were so grateful that they came, but eventually they disappeared. There was not much increase in the past due to our way. Again I say, if you drop your job to go knock on people&rsquo;s doors for one year, you will bring in fifty-two. I am hoping that in 1987 we will have five hundred full-time workers in the United States. With each one of these full-time workers knocking on doors for two hours each day, seven days a week, within one year we can have an increase of over twenty-five thousand in the United States. We need the persons, and we need the right way. What I am fellowshipping with you is the right way to practice to get the increase. May we all go to practice this.</p>
<p>Not everyone can drop their job, but everyone should be able to go out two hours a week. Seven weeks of this kind of labor equals one full week of a full-time worker&rsquo;s labor. Through this kind of labor, you could bring in at least one every seven weeks. This amounts to a brother bringing in seven every year. If you went out two hours every week, every year you could bring in seven. This means that the churches will have a sevenfold increase. If there were one hundred saints in your locality willing to practice this, you could have seven hundred new ones after one year. With the money-making full-timers there could be a sevenfold increase, and with the job-dropping full-timers we could have a fifty-two fold increase.</p>
<p>As a conclusion to our fellowship in this chapter, it would be good to sing <em>Hymns,</em> 473. We all need to take the charge in stanza three of this hymn to rise up and strike the holy bargain&mdash;the fragment for the whole. &ldquo;All things are yours when you are His, and He and you are one.&rdquo;</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO SET UP MEETINGS<br />
IN THE HOMES OF THE NEW CONTACTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16</h1>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Make an appointment in the first contact for the following meetings.</li>
<li>Learn to use the Recovery Version and our publications.</li>
<li>Learn to teach people to sing the hymns and songs and to pray.</li>
<li>Learn to stir up the interest of all the members of a home to share the activities in the home meetings.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head1">KNOCKING ON DOORS TO GAIN HOMES</h2>
<p>Previously we have seen the way to visit people by knocking on their doors. To knock on people&rsquo;s doors is not the end; that is just the initiation, the beginning. According to our past study and experience, if you would knock on people&rsquo;s doors in this way, you will not be altogether rejected. Some doors will not be open to you, and some people will reject you. However, those in a good percentage of the homes will open up their doors and will welcome you. This will give us a very good chance to get into the homes, to not only gain individual persons but to gain homes. Do not forget that to knock on people&rsquo;s doors is not simply to gain individual persons but to gain home after home. Our stress is on the home. The home is our unit, our goal. We are going out to gain homes because a home always involves a lot of persons. If you could get a home, you could get a good number of persons through that home. We have to take the home as our goal for our going out to knock on doors.</p>
<p>Throughout the years we have been hearing that it was too hard to get people, to bring people in. It was hard because we took the wrong way. You cannot drive a car onto the roof. We have been trying to drive the car of the recovery onto the roof for many years. That was the wrong way. Now we would not go out to get people for our meetings but bring the meetings to them. The home which you gain may have only three persons, but after a number of weeks their relatives, in-laws, and friends will come in. Do not forget that when you go to knock on people&rsquo;s doors, it is to get a home. Do not be satisfied just to get one person. That is not so promising. One person could be easily lost, but a home cannot. Remember well that your going out is to get homes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING AN APPOINTMENT IN THE FIRST CONTACT<br />
FOR FOLLOWING MEETINGS</h2>
<p>In your first contact you must grasp the time and seize the opportunity to make an appointment for the next meeting. What will you do in all the following meetings? This is the burden of this chapter. From the second time you go to visit them you must begin to do one wonderful thing, that is, to set up a meeting in their home. This is why we need training. We are getting ourselves prepared to knock on doors. When the doors are opened to us, we will go in to start a meeting. From now on the church meeting will go out to be in other people&rsquo;s homes. I hope that when people open their doors to you and you go in, you would not be persons so dear and precious yet unable to do anything. It is not sufficient to simply go in and say, &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; What you can do depends on whether or not you would be trained. Formerly we considered that only the elders and the co-workers needed to learn these things. This is why in October of 1984, I had a big burden to change our entire practice, to tear down the clergy-laity system. All the saints need to learn how to set up meetings in the homes of the new contacts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO USE THE RECOVERY VERSION<br />
AND OUR PUBLICATIONS</h2>
<p>To set up meetings in the homes of the new contacts we must first learn to use the Recovery Version and our publications. Whether you use the Recovery Version first or the other publications first depends upon the present situation and atmosphere. When you go to a home the second time, do not speak with your own words. You must learn to speak what is printed on our pages. Most people respect the words printed in books. Whatever you speak may not be that valuable. Whatever is printed surely is something better than the word out of our mouth because it has been thoroughly considered. Everyone on this earth knows that the Bible is the highest book, regardless of whether they are believers or unbelievers. When you present people the Recovery Version of the New Testament, read one verse to them with one of the notes. Do not read it carelessly; you have to read it meaningfully. For this you have to prepare yourself in using the Recovery Version. You have to spend time to read the text with the notes day by day. You must be trained in knowing and using the Recovery Version.</p>
<p>Recently some sisters were singing in their house. Across the street an elderly lady heard the singing and came to see them. She was happy because she also was a seeking Christian. One of the sisters read note 3<sup>2</sup> in Matthew 1 concerning the five women in the genealogy of Christ. This note attracted that seeking Christian and stirred up her desire to get a copy of the Recovery Version for herself. The five women were Tamar (v. 3), Rahab (v. 5), Ruth (v. 5), Bathsheba (v. 6), and Mary (v. 16). Tamar was the daughter-in-law of Judah, who begot sons by her. The second woman was Rahab, a prostitute. A prostitute became one of the ancestors of Christ. You must learn to know all these verses with wonderful notes such as these, which are very attractive to the seeking ones.</p>
<p>Recently, two brothers had the burden to go door-to-door to introduce the Recovery Version to people. After two doors they met a woman who had begun to doubt the inerrancy of the Word due to the three missing generations in Matthew 1. These brothers showed her note 8<sup>1</sup> of Matthew 1 which deals with this problem. Students of the Bible have debated about this for many years. They had no answers as to why the three generations in 1 Chronicles 3:11-12 were omitted from the genealogy in Matthew 1. After reading this note, she was convinced that the Bible was really inspired by God. As a result of these brothers reading this note to this seeker, she bought two Recovery Versions and her entire home was gained by the Lord.</p>
<p>When you are received into a home through some questions and a short talk, you may realize that these ones are Christians. Then you have to use the Recovery Version. Just as in fighting, you must know how to use the proper weapons. Even carpenters in their carpentry know how to use their tools&mdash;sometimes they have to use an axe and at other times they have to use a hammer or a saw. You all have to learn how to use the Bible the Lord has put into our hands. Become familiar with the text of the Bible and with the notes in the Recovery Version that help to open up the Bible.</p>
<p>You also need to know the contents of the small booklets, especially the booklet entitled <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em> You do not need to use the entire book. Use only one of the four keys in this booklet that unlock the mystery of human life. When you talk to a particular person, you may have the realization that the last key would be very good for him. Simply use that one key and open the door with it. We also have many rainbow booklets, all selected from the Life-study Messages on the New Testament books. We should also take these booklets with us when we go to others&rsquo; homes.</p>
<p>We have to realize that we are here living to the Lord (Rom. 14:8; 2 Cor. 5:15). We should bear the burden to go out to spread the truth with the gospel. We have to know the truth. The truth is in the Bible, yet the Bible is a book that needs expounding. Luke 24:13-35 is a good illustration of this. There the Lord Jesus met the two disciples going to Emmaus and &ldquo;interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself&rdquo; (v. 27). They did not know how to understand these things until the Lord Jesus opened their understanding to know all the verses concerning Himself in the Old Testament (vv. 31-32). Likewise, in Acts 8:26-39 the eunuch from Ethiopia was reading Isaiah 53 but did not know what it meant until Philip explained to him what was there.</p>
<p>The holy Word needs to be expounded. In 1936 I wrote a booklet on Christ&rsquo;s genealogy after I spent about eleven years to study it. The consummation of my labor on the genealogy is in the notes on the first seventeen verses of Matthew 1. Many Bible students would rather skip over this portion of the Word, but these notes bring us into its real significance. We all need to study the Word. Thank the Lord that through the notes to the Recovery Version and through the Life-study Messages the New Testament has been expounded. The notes and the Life-studies open up the Bible to us. The &ldquo;mine has been opened,&rdquo; but there is the need of more digging to gain the truth.</p>
<p>We should also spend some time on the rainbow booklets. It is better to pass out what you have read. Then you will know what is there and how to use it. Therefore, when you go to a home the second time, the first thing you must be able to do is to show them some interesting and attractive portions from the Recovery Version and our publications. Pick a paragraph or a page and open it to the one with whom you are speaking. Either he or you will read or you may read together in a very close and intimate way. Do not read too much. The notes on the genealogy of Christ are quite long; most of the saints just use one paragraph or point. The sisters I mentioned used the point on the five women, and the brother used the paragraph on the three missing generations. This is good enough.</p>
<p>When you set up meetings in the homes, do not keep the meeting too long. It is better if it is thirty minutes or at the most forty-five minutes, but never over one hour. Use one paragraph from <em>The Mystery of Human Life,</em> the rainbow booklets, or some other Life-study Messages. You will see the result and the response. Then grasp their response to &ldquo;close the deal.&rdquo; You may close the deal to get one person baptized, because that person may have received the help from your reading or from his reading with you. You may close the deal with a prayer, with an appreciation of the Lord Jesus, or with the knowledge of God&rsquo;s salvation. It all depends upon what you have read. All the saints should learn this and practice this. Then your going out would never be in vain; it will be so productive all the time.</p>
<p>Do not think that because a certain one was baptized by you that you may go on right away to tell him something else. As long as he was baptized that is good enough. Do not go further. Leave the other things for the future. Each time just do one thing. Do not be greedy to accomplish more than one item. You will have a regular, weekly meeting, and you will come back again. When you come back, you can continue. Do not do many things at one time. Remember that it is very crucial and effective to use the Recovery Version and all our publications.</p><h2 class="head1">TEACHING PEOPLE<br />
TO SING THE HYMNS AND SONGS</h2>
<p>We also should learn to teach people to sing a hymn or a song. Some would say that they are not good singers, but not many people are. I have published five hymnals, but I am not an accomplished singer. Good singing may only provide amusement for people&rsquo;s ears. You may sing poorly, but if you sing in life, you will stir up people&rsquo;s interest to consider the spiritual things. Simply go to the home meetings to teach people to sing hymns. You should not sing a long hymn, mostly just one or two stanzas with a chorus. Most children and young people like to sing. Therefore, you must learn to use some hymns and songs and how to sing with people. To learn the Bible, to learn the truths in our publications, and to learn the hymns all need time and labor.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TEACHING PEOPLE TO PRAY</h2>
<p>Presenting people written pages and teaching them to sing will lead them to prayer. You must learn to never let a person go without prayer. You yourself must be a very prayerful person, a praying person. You must learn to pray all the time. Then you will lead people to the point of prayer. The most effective way to close the deal in your speaking with people is prayer. It is by prayer and through prayer that people spontaneously exercise their spirit. In their spirit they will meet the Spirit. That means they will touch the Lord. When they touch the Lord, they will be touched. That is good enough. The worst thing that could happen is that in your visit you would have too much talk without the spirit of prayer. You must lead people into prayer. Often many persons will say that they do not know how to pray. Then you must pray, and tell them to follow you in the way you are praying. You must open and begin the prayer. Then you may say, &ldquo;Will you please follow me? What I say, you say.&rdquo; To bring people into the spirit of prayer always requires much practice. If you would give me a hammer, I may use it in a wrong way because I have not practiced using it. You have to practice using all the points I am giving to you. I believe that many doors will open to you, and you will have good opportunities to practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STIRRING UP THE INTEREST<br />
OF ALL THE MEMBERS IN THE HOME<br />
TO SHARE IN THE ACTIVITIES IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>You must also learn how to stir up people&rsquo;s interest in sharing, in participating, in the meeting activities. In the past we always had meetings in the way of some gifted ones doing everything in them. They prayed, sang, read the Bible, and did mostly everything. That was absolutely wrong. First, you can stir up the members of the home to be very much interested in singing. Let them sing spontaneously. Do not make a schedule for the home meeting&mdash;when to sing a hymn, when to pray, when to talk, and when to read the books. That is too dead. If in a home a young girl or boy would sing what they heard you sing, take the opportunity to follow their lead. Then the meeting will begin, and the child will be stirred up with an interest to participate in the activities of the meeting. Sometimes you may even ask a little boy to read a paragraph. You may ask the wife to read a note. Do not do everything by yourself. Always try your best to bring people into the activities. After three or four weeks all of them will be knowledgeable about the activities in the meeting. Do not explain to them beforehand how to meet. When they do something, confirm that it is right and tell them that all the meetings will be their responsibility. This will be a very good training to them. They will learn how to carry on a meeting. Maybe after two months, some of them will go to their relatives to set up meetings in their homes. What you do will be very productive. Learn to use the written word, learn to use singing, and learn to stir up people&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD, THE SPIRIT, SINGING, AND PRAYING</h2>
<p>For going into the homes of the new contacts to set up meetings, you need four items: the Word, the Spirit, singing, and praying. A meeting could always be stirred up or carried on by the Word of God, by the Spirit, by your singing, and also by your praying. Ephesians 5:18-19 and Colossians 3:16 show us that to have a Christian meeting, we need these four elements. For this reason you must become familiar with the Recovery Version and with the booklets. You must also be persons daily filled inwardly with the Spirit.</p>
<p>You must have these four elements&mdash;the Word, the Spirit, singing, and praying. Then you can stir up a meeting. Without these four elements, what could you do? You must give others the Word. When you give them the Word, the Spirit is working. Likewise, you must exercise in singing. You should sing spontaneously, call on the Lord, and pray in the meeting. Such a meeting will be rich. As long as you are there, everything should be stirred up with these four elements. Have a meeting of about thirty to forty minutes, and go back the next week to do the same thing. You will see the result. We all have to treasure the homes. Regardless of how they respond, do not give them up. Pray for them, nourish them, and care for them so that they always keep their home open to you.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h2 class="head1">GOING OUT WITH LIFE AND TRUTH TO SPREAD<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>A brother recently encouraged us with a report that in his city the saints had visited over two thousand five hundred homes within the past month. Among these two thousand five hundred homes, one hundred home meetings were established! In one out of twenty-five homes the saints were able to set up a meeting. Now I have the assurance to say that one saint, who really has the heart to go out for the Lord and knock on doors, will get one home within one month&mdash;one saint, one home, one month. Go out on the weekend or on the Lord&rsquo;s day. Every Lord&rsquo;s day, every weekend, you could knock on six doors. In a month you will knock on about twenty-five doors and according to the rate of one out of twenty-five doors, you will gain one home. Therefore, year round, each person will get twelve homes.</p>
<p>Around the globe in different countries, there are more than six hundred churches comprising over one hundred and twenty thousand saints. If the Lord is really merciful to all of us and we are faithful to receive His grace, out of this number perhaps sixty thousand around the globe will go out. In one year&rsquo;s time we can get seven hundred and twenty thousand homes around the globe. These homes will be our mission field. We do not need to go out to a mission field to be missionaries. Let us just be &ldquo;home missionaries.&rdquo; From each of these seven hundred and twenty thousand homes, we will get two persons each year. If we would be faithful, we could have an increase of up to one and a half million a year. This rate is for the regular saints, not the full-timers.</p>
<p>We have fellowshipped in the past that out of twenty saints there should be one full-timer (see p. 75 of <em>The Way to Practice the Lord&rsquo;s Present Move</em>). Out of one hundred and twenty thousand saints, there should be six thousand full-timers going out to knock on doors. Could not each full-timer under a strict training baptize one a week? Thus, one full-timer should get fifty-two a year. Six thousand times fifty-two would yield another three hundred and twelve thousand. Therefore, it is not too much to say that with sixty thousand saints and six thousand full-timers, we could get about two million a year. This is glad tidings!</p>
<p>I have participated in the carrying out of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for over fifty-four years, and I am full of thanks to the Lord that I am still here. Recently I began to consider how merciful the Lord has been to me. I am now over eighty. In Psalm 90:10 the Bible says that a man&rsquo;s life or age can only reach eighty &ldquo;by reason of strength.&rdquo; If I were not here, it would be hard for anyone to change the practice of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. But, from October 1984 in Taiwan, I began to see the glad tidings that the only way for the Lord to build up His church is by the homes and the home meetings.</p>
<p>The elders should take the lead as the head sheep (1 Pet. 5:3) to go out and should not merely sit in the church service office. Go out! You have to take the lead to go out to knock on the doors, not only on Saturday or the Lord&rsquo;s day but every day. Go out both in the morning and the evening. In the evenings, you would meet the gentlemen and in the mornings you would meet the ladies, especially the elderly ladies. If you go, the elderly ladies will welcome you. You will gain many of them and much prayer will be offered by these ladies for their sons, grandsons, and relatives. May all the elders rise up to go out every day, morning and evening, with prayer in the afternoon, to knock on doors, teach the truth, and set up home meetings.</p>
<p>No other Christian body can imitate us because of two main reasons. The Lord started His recovery with two things&mdash;life and truth. In church history, it is hard to find any organization, any group of Christians, that has been raised up, established, and built up with life and truth. Regardless of how short a time you have been in the recovery, you should have realized that the main item is life. I do not mean that each one of the saints is in life all the time. But in a general way most of the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are for life. With life there is also the truth.</p>
<p>The Lord has also blessed us with the truth. Now we can go out by life with the truth. We have the life within which is our very fiber, our very element, our very essence. We go out with this life essence within and with the truth in our hand&mdash;life within and the truth without. We have the Recovery Version of the New Testament, <em>The Mystery of Human Life,</em> the rainbow booklets, the Life-study Messages, and all the books in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Two heretical groups, the Mormons and the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, knock on people&rsquo;s doors very much. They bring heretical teachings to people, but we bring the divine life and the divine truth. We have the mingling of the divine life with the human life within and the truth in our hands without. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to the United States in 1962, yet even by 1970 the time was not yet ripe for us to go out in a full-scale way because not much of the ministry had been published. Now, however, we have Life-study Messages on the entire New Testament and a Recovery Version of the New Testament. Furthermore, most of the churches, especially those in Taiwan and in the United States, have been fully and strongly established. Hence, now is the time for all the saints to go out. We have the life with the truth in the established churches.</p><h2 class="head1">BEGETTING, NOURISHING, AND TEACHING</h2>
<p>All of us need to be those who are begetting, nourishing, and teaching others. To go and knock on doors is for begetting, bringing forth, children. The full-timers should bring forth or beget one child every week. After one is baptized, that one is delivered. Baptism is a kind of delivery. Then the child needs nourishing and feeding. Without nourishing and feeding, no child can grow. After nourishing there is the need of teaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING PEOPLE TO GROW IN THE HOME MEETINGS<br />
BY NOURISHING THEM<br />
WITH THE MILK OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>To carry out the growth in the divine life is a crucial and central point in the divine revelation. The main point in leading people to grow is to nourish them. In 1 Peter 2:2-3 and Hebrews 5:12-14 there is the secret of the nourishing of our spiritual children. No other verses are better than these two portions. First Peter 2:2 says that as newborn babes we need to long to drink the milk of the word. This indicates clearly that the word in the holy Scriptures is considered by Peter as milk. All the mothers know that the best nourishment for their children is to feed them milk. If we have tasted the Lord (1 Pet. 2:3), then we will long for the nourishing milk in His word. Once a little babe tastes milk, he will long to drink more all the time. When little babies cry, their crying is a kind of prayer. The mothers answer their prayer by giving them some milk to drink. Every day, even in the night, the children &ldquo;pray&rdquo; this way because they have tasted the good taste of milk.</p>
<p>You have to believe that once you baptize a person, that person should have tasted the good taste of God&rsquo;s word. When you visit people, do not speak your own word; present them with God&rsquo;s word. Their enjoyment of the good taste of God&rsquo;s word will create an appetite within them. The little babes do not know what milk contains, but they have tasted the taste of milk which creates an appetite within them to long for milk. Perhaps on your second visit to a person&rsquo;s home, he will get baptized. Then when you go to them the next time, you will set up a home meeting. In these following times, you have to learn how to nourish them, how to feed them. In the matter of nourishing and feeding, there is much to learn. In this matter I do not consider that I have graduated. I am still learning how to nourish people, how to feed people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING THE NEW LIFE LESSONS WITH PRAYER</h2>
<p>According to what I have learned, the first thing in leading people to grow in the home meetings is to nourish them with the milk of the word by using the <em>New Life Lessons.</em> The titles of the ten lessons are as follows:</p>
<ul class="none">
<li>Lesson One&mdash;Assurance of Salvation</li>
<li>Lesson Two&mdash;Prayer</li>
<li>Lesson Three&mdash;Reading the Bible</li>
<li>Lesson Four&mdash;Meeting</li>
<li>Lesson Five&mdash;Preaching the Gospel</li>
<li>Lesson Six&mdash;Fellowshipping with the Lord</li>
<li>Lesson Seven&mdash;Consecration</li>
<li>Lesson Eight&mdash;Living in the Spirit</li>
<li>Lesson Nine&mdash;Experiencing Christ</li>
<li>Lesson Ten&mdash;Knowing the Church</li>
</ul>
<p>At most you can cover one lesson at a time in each meeting. Every lesson is very short, but you have to learn how to use these lessons. First, you should train the new contacts how to pray. Before reading, it would be good to say, &ldquo;Let us pray.&rdquo; Then you may need to explain a little bit what prayer is. To pray at this juncture is to ask the Lord to breathe upon His word, to anoint His word by His Spirit. We ask the Lord to do this through His blood which washes us all the time. You have to explain this to a new one. This is the way to train them. Do not explain too much though. They will learn. Then take the lead to pray. Sometimes, depending upon the environment and atmosphere, after you pray one or two sentences, you could charge the new contacts (maybe one or two of them) to pray once and again. After a few times of your visitation, these new ones will learn to pray. Their learning how to pray is a kind of nourishment. You are nourishing them.</p>
<p>After this prayer, with a little amount of training to pray, open to the first page and ask the new contact to read with you. Not only should he read, but you also need to read with him. You have to learn to cooperate with the new contacts in the reading and stress the main points. Then at every stress of an important or crucial point, you should pray together&mdash;only two or three sentences of prayer. Always keep praying along with the reading of the lesson. Thus, you will impress them with the crucial points and also train them to pray, even to mingle their prayer with the word. Actually, this is pray-reading. Every lesson is so short; therefore, this would not take a long time.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAY-READING THE BIBLE VERSES OF EACH LESSON</h2>
<p>If there is some time left, you could go back to pray-read the main verses quoted in the lesson in order to impress them with such verses. In Lesson One, John 6:47 is quoted which says, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has eternal life.&rdquo; You have to lead the new contact to pray-read this verse. You may say, &ldquo;Thank You, Lord, I believe in You.&rdquo; Ask him to repeat this. This is a kind of leading pray-reading. You may continue by saying, &ldquo;Has eternal life...has eternal life. Lord, this is Your word. Now, I believe in You, so I have eternal life.&rdquo; To impress them, ask them to pray this word. Then this word will get into them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW CONTACTS<br />
TO SING THE PROPER SONGS AND HYMNS</h2>
<p>To lead people to sing the proper songs or hymns is a little harder. This is because you have to learn the hymns and songs and also learn to choose the proper ones. The full-timers as well as all of the saints have to learn the songs, the hymns, the gospel songs, and the gospel hymns. In our hymnal there are a lot of good songs.</p>
<p>The message and the song do not have to match exactly in wording. In wording the song might not be the same as the message, but in actuality it is the same. For instance, there is a song whose first line of the chorus is: &ldquo;Since Jesus came into my heart&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> 309) and the phrase from John 6:47 says, &ldquo;He who believes in Me has eternal life.&rdquo; You can sing this hymn because it could be considered as a proper song on the assurance and joy of salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES TO CONFESS THEIR SINS<br />
THAT THEY MAY BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>While you are helping the new ones to pray along with the lesson, you must take the lead to train them in their prayer to confess their sins. You have to take the lead to confess your sins. You may say, &ldquo;Lord, I was born a sinner. Lord, even this day I have been mistaken, having done some things wrong.&rdquo; Do not make your prayer wordy or too long. Lead them into an atmosphere where they may spontaneously say, &ldquo;Lord, I am also sinful. Lord, even today I made a mistake with my wife.&rdquo; You could not do this by one visit but after many visits. If you go four times in a month to visit this family, surely you could train them. You will bring them into the Spirit, leading them to confess their sins. If they would confess their sins with a long prayer, do not stop them. That is a good sign. Let them pray, confessing their sins. They may say, &ldquo;O Lord, I offended my father. That was wrong. And I did something wrong with my mother.&rdquo; If they confess many things, let them say it. The more they would confess, the better. The ultimate consummation of a &ldquo;sin-confessing prayer&rdquo; is the filling of the Spirit. You do not need to teach them to seek after the filling of the Holy Spirit; they will have it.</p>
<p>I hope that every time you go to a home, after a meeting has been set up, that your visit will end with the filling of the Holy Spirit. Every time bring the new contacts into the experience of the filling of the Holy Spirit. However, you do not need to point out to them so quickly that this is the experience of the filling of the Holy Spirit. Let them experience it a few times. There will be a time to let them know that what they have experienced is the filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HANDLING THE WORD, TOUCHING THE SPIRIT,<br />
SINGING, AND PRAYING<br />
ACCORDING TO THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When you go to nourish them, you must use these few steps which we have shared. It is hard to say which step should be first. It may be that the Holy Spirit will lead you at the opening of the meeting to nourish them or you may take the lead to confess your sins. You have to get yourself acquainted with all the <em>New Life Lessons,</em> and get yourself ready, going to the home meetings as a prepared and trained person. As a trained person, you can use all the &ldquo;weapons and bullets&rdquo; in any way. This does not mean that you use this gun first, and that gun second, and this bullet last. It all depends upon the atmosphere and the leading of the Holy Spirit within.</p>
<p>In the past, our reading of the word was not so living. We might have said, &ldquo;Let us read John 6:47.&rdquo; Then you might say, &ldquo;Let me read the first verse, and then you read the second.&rdquo; This is to read in a somewhat dead way. You must learn how to read a verse in a living way. It is not just that you read and someone else listens. It is better for you and him to work together. Make the reading living and coordinated. This requires much practice.</p>
<p>To set up a meeting you must use the word, the Spirit, singing, and praying. It is hard to say which point should be first. But you must use these four things. The <em>New Life Lessons</em> are the word. Leading them to sing the proper songs and hymns involves singing. Leading them to pray-read the Bible verses involves praying. Leading them to pray along with the lesson by confessing their sins that they may be filled with the Spirit involves the Spirit. The word, the Spirit, singing, and praying are the basic things involved in the meeting. You must be able to practice these four things. If you can handle the word, touch the Spirit, know how to sing, and know how to pray, then you will have a good meeting. Every point in this chapter needs our practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GAINING PEOPLE BY NOURISHING THEM</h2>
<p>All of the nourished children love their mother. Spiritually speaking, others will love you because you nourish them. Because the mothers nourish the children, they spontaneously respond with love for her. Do you want your new contacts to love you? You have to render them the best nourishment. If you continue to visit one home and establish a meeting full of nourishment, after five times that home will love you. This means that you have gained them. If you would gain homes in this way the Lord will gain something and His recovery will be increasing and spreading.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<li>Lead them to give testimonies of their experience.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head1">USING THE HOMES FOR THE INCREASE<br />
AND SPREAD OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We have spent much time since October of 1984 to study the matter of the increase and spread of the church. Until that time the increase and spread in the churches was somewhat disappointing. There had been very little increase or spread for years. In 1962, Taipei had twenty-two thousand members. By 1984 the number had decreased by fifty percent. Many new ones had been saved, but the total number had not increased. At the same time we had about a hundred churches in the United States and Canada, yet the number of the saints was very small, not over ten thousand.</p>
<p>Since that time, I began to consider the proper way to have the increase and spread, and the Lord began to show me the way of the homes. In the New Testament, when the Lord Jesus ministered for three and a half years, He used people&rsquo;s homes (Matt. 10:11-13; 26:6). Even the more, on the day of Pentecost three thousand were added and right away began to meet in their homes, from home to home (Acts 2:46). This was a new beginning; the meetings in the Old Testament were not carried out in this way (Deut. 12:5-14). According to history, the Christian groups which have met in the homes were profited.</p>
<p>Because of this, throughout all these months my burden has not been on anything besides the homes. I consider the homes all day. I love the homes. I do not think that in the Lord&rsquo;s new move the big meetings are much needed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOING OUT TO GAIN HOMES</h2>
<p>Every brother or sister who would go out to knock on doors for the gospel could establish a home meeting every four weeks. You do not need to be a job-dropping full-timer to do this. Take care of your job, but every week spend two to three hours going out. The best time is on Saturday or the Lord&rsquo;s day. If you went out for two or three hours every week for four weeks, you could gain one home. If not within four weeks, then at least within eight weeks you could get a home. This means you will get six homes a year. There are about one hundred twenty thousand saints in all the churches around the globe. If only one fourth of these saints would mean business to go out to knock on doors, we would gain one hundred eighty thousand homes after one year. This will increase us not merely by a small percentage, but by one-and-a-half-fold. Quite possibly each home will bring in two persons; even if each home only has one person, we will still gain one hundred eighty thousand persons. Yearly we will have a one-and-a-half-fold increase. Even if we only gain half this number, we will still have ninety thousand. Everybody will be very happy to see this happen. This would be a seventy-five percent increase.</p>
<p>If within the coming year you would have a seventy-five percent increase in your locality, would you not be happy? Will you be one of the four going out? Even to speak of a one-and-a-half-fold increase is very conservative. We have a wonderful way to nourish people but if nobody would do it, then what is the use of the way? It all depends upon our doing. We are coordinating and cooperating with the Lord. The Lord is ready. He has been ready for years, simply waiting for our response. The increase is in the homes, but you must go to knock on doors.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER WAY TO HAVE THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>To have the home meetings is not to ask others to come to our meetings. Do not ask people to come to you. To have the home meetings is to take the meeting to them. First, take the gospel to them, and then take the meetings to them. Our former practice of inviting people to our love feasts has not worked. We should rather have &ldquo;food-to-go.&rdquo; We should not invite people to our feast; we should bring our food to their home and put it on their dining table. In the Gospels, God did not merely take the way of inviting. Rather, God came in the flesh to this earth to seek and to save the lost (Luke 19:10). He went to the home of Zaccheus (19:1-10), and in John 4:1-42 He went to the Samaritan woman. He sent and He gave. Now we must learn of the Lord. Do not remain so high. Lower yourselves down (Phil. 2:5-7). Come down to reach people where they are (Luke 10:33-34). From now on we would not invite people to come to our meeting. We will send the meeting to their homes as food-to-go!</p><h2 class="head1">GOING WITH BOLDNESS AND AUTHORITY</h2>
<p>When you send spiritual food to people&rsquo;s homes, you must have the boldness to &ldquo;put it on the table.&rdquo; Do not think you will offend them. You must have the boldness to ask everyone in that home to eat. This way requires your faith and your confidence. You must have faith and boldness to knock on people&rsquo;s doors. Before the Lord Jesus told the disciples to go and disciple all the nations, He said, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.&rdquo; Then He continued, &ldquo;Go therefore&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19). All authority is given to the Lord, and because we are His members, the authority is transmitted to us. Therefore, we go, not with shaking but with boldness and power. You need the faith, and you need the boldness. You should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I do not believe my fears. I have the authority. Before my knocking at the door I give commandment to all the demons to leave this house. Demons, you have no right to remain here. I have the authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes it is not the one with whom you speak that would not believe; it is you who would not believe. When you say, &ldquo;Let us be baptized,&rdquo; you have to say it with faith. Before a newly saved one hears your speaking, he may have said that he would not be baptized. But when he hears your speaking, this word would convince and subdue him. Immediately he would change his mind.</p>
<p>Do not ask people if they would be baptized. If you ask them, they would probably say no. You must say something positive. Your word will become power and authority, subduing them. You must have the faith, and you must be willing to see them baptized. Always have the boldness. You do not know how subtle the demons are. While you will be talking to people, the &ldquo;flaming darts of the evil one&rdquo; will come (Eph. 6:16). One dart will bring the thought, &ldquo;He will not understand.&rdquo; Another dart will be the thought, &ldquo;Even if he understands, he will not believe.&rdquo; Another dart will be the lie, &ldquo;Even if he believes, he would not be baptized.&rdquo; Do not listen to all the lies. Every lie is a dart. Simply reject them. You have to say: &ldquo;Lord, I take the helmet of your salvation. I do not take all the darts. I believe that this one understands; I believe that this one would believe; and I believe that this one will be baptized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You must command the demons to leave. When you talk to a sinner for their salvation, there is a battle. The Lord Jesus told us that when one sinner repented there would be joy in the presence of the angels of God (Luke 15:10). This may indicate that before the repentance of the sinner, there was a battle between the good angels and the evil spirits. This is the reason that the Lord Jesus, before charging the disciples to go out to disciple the nations, told them that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth. We go out not just to preach the gospel; we go out to command the demons to leave and to command people to believe.</p>
<p>Be trained in this way. Do not forget that you are not going out alone. You are going out with Him. Actually, He is going out with you (Matt. 28:20). Be aggressive and bold in the spirit to obey the Lord&rsquo;s command to go and disciple the nations. Do not leave any ground to the enemy. Always be aggressive and on the offensive. Do not be defensive. Do not invite or take a negative thought. Even if the situation is very dark, you should say: &ldquo;I do not believe the darkness. The darkness is a lie. With me there is no darkness. Wherever I am, there must be light.&rdquo; This should not be your outward preaching but your inward practicing. While you are talking to sinners, you have to practice in this way. Take the food-to-go, and have the confidence that this is the best food and that everyone would take it.</p>
<p>Throughout our many years in this work, both in the Far East and in the United States, our going out sometimes produced little result. However, since we have begun to go out in the new way of knocking on doors to establish home meetings, many people have opened to us. When we do this, we exercise the Lord&rsquo;s authority. This is a strong proof that what we are undertaking is something of the Lord. Do not care about losing your face. When you speak, speak with faith and boldness.</p>
<p>You must go with the food-to-go. You must go with the gospel. You must go with believing. You must go baptizing. Go, believing that everyone would take what you would offer. You must have the belief. When you shoot a basketball, you must have the faith that it will go in the basket. If you are doubting, the ball probably will not enter the basket. When you are doubting, the ball will also &ldquo;doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may love the Lord and His recovery, yet could we be for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and not care to see the increase and spread of the church? Forget about inviting others to your meeting. The way to have the increase and spread is by going to knock on doors, door-to-door, with boldness, with faith, and full of confidence. A person who would go in this way will always convince people.</p><h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW CONVERTS<br />
TO CALL ON THE LORD AND TO PRAY-READ</h2>
<p>The home meetings are the home meetings of the new converts. You must help them to consider that it is their meeting. It is not your meeting. It is not that you invite them to come to your meeting, but it should be that they would invite you to go to their meeting.</p>
<p>To nourish the new converts in their home meeting, you have to tell them that the Bible is the word of God. In one visit, you can read them the verses at the beginning of this chapter and help them to pray-read, telling them that we live not only by physical food, but by &ldquo;every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&rdquo; (Matt. 4:4). For our physical body, we need the physical food, but for our spirit, we need the word of God. Do not say too much. Read Jeremiah 15:16 which says, &ldquo;Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts.&rdquo; Then explain a little concerning eating the word. You could tell them that Matthew 4:4 tells us that the word of God is our food, and that Jeremiah 15:16 tells us to eat the word. Eating the word is not merely to read nor to study, but simply to eat. Then read John 6:63, where the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life,&rdquo; and tell them that the way this word becomes spirit and life is by our taking it into us. Then you could also read to them Psalm 119:130, &ldquo;The entrance of thy words giveth light,&rdquo; and explain, that the word is not only spirit and life, but by entering into us through our eating, it becomes light to us.</p>
<p>You may then need to read to them Romans 10:12b. &ldquo;The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.&rdquo; You may explain to them a little what calling on the name of the Lord and pray-reading are. Do not say too much. After you do this, right away you could say, &ldquo;Let us pray-read these few verses.&rdquo; In one visit simply spend the entire time leading them to learn how to call on the name of the Lord and how to pray-read the word. It is not too hard, but it depends on your practice. You yourself must be a person who calls upon the name of the Lord and who pray-reads the Word. If you are such a person, it will be so easy. Begin to lead them to call on the name of the Lord with you. You do it first, by exercising your spirit to say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Do not say in a common way with no exercise of the spirit, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, thank You. Thank You I am here to help this friend.&rdquo; This does not work. You have to call from the depths of your being, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! Lord Jesus, thank You. Lord Jesus!&rdquo; They may only listen to you at first, but you must do it. Then direct them to do it. Every human being is a follower. When one comes to the United States from another country and stays here for twenty years, he will learn many American things, because there are so many Americans to follow.</p>
<p>When you enter into a home, you must be one with such a character that everyone would be subdued by you. You must take the role of influencing the entire family. This could be accomplished only by the Holy Spirit. Even if you are quiet by nature, when you look at them your eyes should be very convincing. We all have to learn this. Then you could pray-read and call on the name of the Lord. Your calling will be subduing, and they will follow you. You do not even need to ask them to follow you. If you say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; they will say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; and they will improve their calling. If you do not know how to call, you must go home and practice calling. The more practice you have, the more effective you will be. Then when you go out, you will subdue people. You will look at them, and your look will subdue them. When you open up your mouth, your calling will subdue them, and they will follow and go along with you. Then you could open up Matthew 4:4 and begin to pray-read: &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; Give them a short word; then go on to pray-read, &ldquo;Oh, every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God! Oh, the word, the word, that proceeds out through the mouth of God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first thing you have to lead them to do is to call on the Lord. The second thing is to lead them not only to eat the word of God but to masticate it. Do not merely teach them. Teaching alone does not work so well. Rather, you have to take the lead to do it. This will convince and subdue them, and they will spontaneously learn to follow you. In one visit you will bring them into calling and pray-reading. The new converts should learn to masticate the word by pray-reading the Bible verses quoted in our publications. In the beginning it is better to use the <em>New Life Lessons.</em> There are many crucial verses there.</p><h2 class="head1">LEADING THEM TO MINGLE THE WORD WITH PRAYER</h2>
<p>We must also lead the new converts to mingle the Word with their prayer. Lead them into prayer which mostly does not use their own wording, but rather the terms, the phrases, and even the clauses of the Bible verses quoted in our publications. This is not merely to read, or to repeat, but to mingle the word of the Bible with their prayer, that is, to make their prayer one with the word of the Bible. This is the best prayer. By this way you will &ldquo;kill two birds with one stone&rdquo;&mdash;this prayer touches the Word, and this prayer also touches the Spirit. The Word and the Spirit will both get into you. Then the Lord&rsquo;s words will be spirit and life to you, and you will have the light of life (John 8:12; cf. 1:4). Three things will be in you&mdash;the Spirit, life, and light. The new converts will be nourished with food-to-go if we lead them to mingle the word with prayer. Perhaps you could not do all these items at once. In one visit you can cover two or three, leaving the rest for another visit. Do not go too fast. You have much time ahead of you. Go back again and again, continually.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THEM TO SHARE WITH OTHERS<br />
IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Also, we should lead them to share with the others in the meeting what they have received from the word of God. You must set forth yourself as an example of one who does this. Share something with them, and then they will learn from you. This will be a deep digestion of the word. To share with others what you have received is not only to eat and not only to masticate but also to digest. Any food that gets into us needs digestion. After digestion it becomes our nourishment. We must help them to digest by sharing with others something which they have received of the Word. This is also the way to build up their home meeting. By doing this, after three to five months, they will be so acquainted with the way to have a living home meeting. Then they also will go out to establish new home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THEM TO GIVE<br />
TESTIMONIES OF THEIR EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>Leading the new converts to give a testimony is not only for them to share something. To share is to tell others what they have received instantly. To give a testimony is to testify what they have experienced in their daily life. By your third visit, they surely should have experienced something. Let them speak out what they have experienced.</p>
<p>If you could do all these things, you will not only lead them into the nourishment, but you will also lead them into the proper way to have a living home meeting. Perhaps after two or three months they would not need you to come more than once every two or three weeks because they will have learned how to have a home meeting. They will have been brought into the proper practice. However, you must be faithful to continue going to the same home for at least eight or nine weeks.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARING FOR THE HOMES WE HAVE GAINED</h2>
<p>What we have seen concerning the going out is very good, but this will bring to you a heavy burden. After going out to knock at people&rsquo;s doors for one year, you may have six homes that you must care for. After you have gained homes, you will need to visit them throughout the week. Every weekend you should go out to get new homes, but on the week days you have to go out to visit the homes you have gained. Be prepared for this. You cannot deliver a newborn child and give it no nourishment or care. If you do this, all the newborn children will die. The Bible tells sinners to repent and be baptized (Acts 2:38), and to believe and be baptized (Mark 16:16), but you must take care of the ones baptized by you. You need to nourish them.</p>
<p>Perhaps three who go out as a team would gain a home each week. Within four to six weeks, the three will gain three homes. They must keep going out to knock on doors, but at the same time each of the three should take care of one home. However, for only one to go to a home would be inadequate. Therefore, the one needs to pick up a dormant brother or sister. While you are going out to knock on doors, you have to work with the others who do not have the burden to go out. Perhaps out of four hundred saints only one hundred will go out. This one hundred, while they are going out, will also have to work with the three hundred, to testify to them, to convince them, and to bring them into this practice. When you have a home that you need to take care of, you can ask a certain brother or sister to go with you to help you. Most of them would not reject you; they will go with you. It is in this way that you will stir them up and bring them into this flow. You will bring them into this new move of the Lord, and you two will go together. Not only will you be gaining the new homes, but you also will be stirring up the dormant ones.</p>
<p>If you would learn all these things and practice all these things, you could take care of a home for six or seven weeks. Then the ones in that home will learn these things, and they will begin to take care of other homes. On the one hand, we must get new homes, but on the other hand, we must produce more saints to take care of the new homes. You will have many things to do. Out of four thousand active saints in Taipei, one thousand may go out. Within one year they will bring in ten thousand homes. Who will take care of the ten thousand homes? You can see the great burden. It is in this way that every saint will be brought into the service. No one will be left idle. At that time everyone will love the homes because they will realize that in the homes they could better render their service to the Lord.</p>
<p>In this new way, the Lord is going to change us. We will forget about always coming together to meet in large gatherings. We have been coming together for many years. Many faithful ones came to the big meetings four or five times a week, yet we have not accomplished much in the way of bringing all the saints into function or for the increase and spread of the church. However, the new way will open the door and bring in a new way of service, which will require all the saints to rise up and do something. When you do something as part of a definite service in the homes, the Bible will be new and sweet to you. When you are going to nourish others, the messages will become your nourishment. Then the whole church will be a living church and a serving church. Everyone will be busy. Everybody will be occupied, not with the worldly things, but with the service of the Lord, either to bring people to the Lord, to nourish them, or to teach them.</p>
<p>We need the foresight to see the long term goal, and we have to reach the goal. We also have to learn to help the home meetings practically in a detailed way. The new ones will be nourished and built up, and then will be taught and trained to do what you are doing. This will increase not only the number of saved ones but also the number of serving ones. Every new convert under this kind of nourishing will be a good serving one within half a year. They will begin, at least, to help to take care of a home.</p>
<p>This will arouse within you many prayers. I believe you will pray much more because you will have a burden. You will have somebody that you have to pray for. While you are driving your car, you will pray. Quite often many have considered for whom or for what they should pray. It may have seemed that everything was right and settled, not requiring any prayer. But now every week there will be new homes and new persons requiring our prayer. To touch the homes and to gain the homes is the way for us to go on. We must go along with the Lord in this way. If we will be faithful, He will have a way to come back.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

</ol>
<p>In order to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s new move, we have to be careful not to put the new wine into the old wineskins (Matt. 9:17). Otherwise, we will burst the skins and lose our wine. Our practice may be too old. Oldness means opaqueness, opaqueness means darkness, darkness means death, death means killing, and killing means to bring everything to naught. Based upon this consideration, the fellowship in this chapter is crucial.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO FORM THE VISITING TEAMS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not According to Personal Preference</h2>
<p>We want to avoid forming the teams to visit others in an old, natural, and personal way. We should not form the teams according to personal preference. In everything involved with the church life, including the forming of teams to visit others, we should not have personal preference or choice. In anything regarding the church life or the church service, once personal preference comes in, that damages everything. It mainly kills the Spirit, so we must do our best to avoid this. If we are going to be successful in this new way to knock on people&rsquo;s doors, we must drop our personal feeling, our personal preference. Otherwise, this will kill the Lord&rsquo;s new move among us. We must drop our preference and turn ourselves to the spirit. The formation of the visiting teams needs much prayer. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, we are all in the church, and the church is now picking up the new way to go out to knock on people&rsquo;s doors. Lord, I need co-workers to go out with me, but I do not want to select them. I do not want to have any preference. Lord, I pray that You would be sovereign in selecting whom I would go out with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We believe that the Spirit is really with us. Within each one of us, in our spirit, is the Spirit (Rom. 8:16). You must go along with the Spirit. To go out to knock on people&rsquo;s doors is not a small thing. It is a matter of life and death. Whether people will perish or be gained by the Lord depends on our visiting them. We must consider this matter so seriously.</p>
<p>Since October of 1984 when I went back to Taiwan, my heart has been on this one thing&mdash;the new way to spread the kingdom, the new way to get the increase, the new way to spread the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. After our experience in Taiwan, I have the confidence with the full assurance that it is the Lord&rsquo;s way to go out to visit people&rsquo;s homes by knocking on their doors and to set up meetings in every home. First, we studied the situation, and then we put what we had studied into practice in Taipei. The results confirmed my understanding and encouraged me to go out to spread this new way. This new way is being carried to all the churches around the globe in all the six continents, and nearly all the churches are practicing this. The news we have received from the churches tells us that this new way is really workable.</p>
<p>My burden is to help us to realize the Lord&rsquo;s new move, but even in forming the teams for visiting, we may do this in an altogether old way. Our way to form the teams may be too old, and our way to knock on the doors may be too old. Even our way to give a testimony might be considered very good, yet it is too old. All of our oldness should be fully dropped. I urge you to do this. Do not believe in your old way.</p>
<p>One and a half centuries ago people used the mule wagon for transportation, but today if you use the mule wagon you will be behind the times and backward. You should either use an automobile or travel by plane. Many years ago it took a sailing boat about six months to go from California to the Far East. Today it only takes about thirteen hours to fly from Los Angeles to Taipei. We must take the new way. Do not stay in the old way. We cannot change the earth, the earth was created by God, but we can improve our way of travel. Air travel has improved tremendously since the invention of the airplane. In like manner, we cannot change the truth, the divine revelation in the Bible, but we can improve our way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Why would we not take any step to have any improvement?</p>
<p>Through all the years I have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, by His mercy, one thing I hate is oldness. In the Bible, oldness equals darkness and death. Spiritually speaking, if you are old, you are like a dead person. Whenever I open to a certain portion of the Bible, I exercise not to have any consideration that I know this particular portion. Every verse is new to me. I hope you would take my word and be wise. A wise man is a renewed man. If you are going to be wise, you have to learn to be new, to be renewed day by day (2 Cor. 4:16).</p>
<p>We need to form the visiting teams in a new way. To do this we must drop our personal opinion, personal preference, personal choice. You have to pray desperately that the Lord would give you the proper persons to go out with. When Barnabas and Saul of Tarsus were sent out to the nations, they were fasting and praying with three others (Acts 13:1-4). Then the Lord, the Spirit, spoke to them. In principle it is the same with us. Do not think that to go out to knock on people&rsquo;s doors, even in our neighborhood, is different from Barnabas and Saul&rsquo;s visit to foreign countries. In principle, it should be the same. We should not go out to knock on people&rsquo;s doors on our own. Then our knocking on people&rsquo;s doors might be a damage to them instead of a blessing. We do not want to bring damage to people but blessing, so there is the need of much prayer.</p><h2 class="head2">According to the Spirit&rsquo;s Leading<br />
and the Practical Situation</h2>
<p>To pray or not to pray before one speaks makes a great difference. You must pray before you go out. Without enough prayer, you should not go out. Get yourself qualified by praying. Then the Lord will be sovereign in leading you. We surely have to follow the Spirit. To follow the Spirit, the basic principle is to drop our own things, our personal things. We should not do anything on our own, but do everything according to the Spirit&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<p>The proper way for the church to carry out this new way for the Lord&rsquo;s spread is that the elders must take the lead. This is absolutely different from the past. In the past the saints did things, and the elders were just giving directions or orders. But now the elders must realize that they should knock on doors much more than the other brothers and sisters. For the elders to merely sit in the church office is not a real profit. A real profit for the church is that the elders would go out. This corresponds to the biblical principle concerning the elders. The elders should take the lead not to rule over the saints or to give commands or instructions, telling people to do things. The elders should take the lead by doing it themselves. Then all the others will follow (1 Pet. 5:2-3).</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the leading ones, the elders, should bear the responsibility to form the teams. The teams have to be formed through the elders&rsquo; arrangement, not just by the saints. This may seemingly contradict the points I told you concerning going out according to the Spirit. You may feel that to go out according to the Spirit is one thing, and to go out by the elders forming the teams is another thing. The Bible gives us the principle, however, that if there is no church you should follow the Spirit according to the situation; but if there is a church, you must follow the Spirit through the church.</p>
<p>Philip was a good model. He followed the Spirit directly in Acts 8 because at that juncture there was no church where he was. But Barnabas and Saul of Tarsus did not go out on their own. Five brothers were praying who were in the church at Antioch (Acts 13:1). Those five brothers were the living and acting members of the church there. They represented the church at Antioch. They prayed together and received the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s leading. By this we can see that if there is a church, we have to receive the leading of the Spirit through the church. We are not here in an independent way, but we are here living the church life. It is not you individually taking this new way, but the church corporately taking this new way. The elders are the leading ones in this matter, so they must bear the responsibility to form the teams.</p>
<p>There is the need of some human way under the guiding of the Spirit to form the teams properly. According to our experience, one team should not exceed four persons. If you had seven persons going out to visit a family, the family would be apprehensive, to say the least. Also, it would be hard for them to receive you all. The best number is three. Always try to have one older person, one younger person, and one middle-aged person. Do the best to form the teams in this principle. If three young men go out to knock on one door, some people may be afraid that you are coming to rob them. For three girls to go out together by themselves is dangerous. It is neither wise for three older brothers or three older sisters to go out as a team. A good team could be composed of an older sister, one younger sister, and a middle-aged brother or of one older brother, one younger brother, and one middle-aged sister.</p>
<p>Every team must have a brother. The brother will be for baptizing. There is nothing in the Bible to indicate that sisters can baptize people, so the brothers have to bear the burden to baptize. Everyone has to learn not to do anything on his own. We must learn to go out to do a proper job, and this proper job includes one thing&mdash;to baptize people. For the teams, it is best to have one brother matched by two sisters. Sometimes two brothers could be matched with one sister.</p>
<p>When the elders form the teams, they should also have the following point in their consideration&mdash;of the three, one must be at least a little stronger in life and in speaking. A good number of the saints would not dare to stand up to say anything in a meeting, but in a small group going out to visit other people, they may all like to take the lead in speaking. This is not good. In a visiting group, only one should be the main speaker, and the other two should learn how to coordinate. The elders should do something to train the saints in this way. You cannot collect five people and expect them to work together as a basketball team without any coaching. If you pass the basketball to them, they will not know how to play. There is the need of some amount of training. What I am giving you are some principles. I hope that the elders would take these principles and put them into practice to train all the saints.</p>
<p>A certain group could be composed of an older brother, a middle-aged sister, and a younger sister who is only sixteen or seventeen years old. In life, in spirit, and even in knowing the Word, this younger sister may be stronger than the older brother and the middle-aged sister. Thus, they should let the young sister take the lead to open her mouth to talk to people. When the elders arrange the teams, they should realize that the proper speaking person should be this younger sister. The younger sister should be bold, the older brother should give in, and the middle-aged sister should understand the situation. When this young sister &ldquo;makes a deal&rdquo; for baptism, the older brother should be ready to baptize, and the middle-aged sister should also be very strong to urge the wife of the household to fill up the bathtub with water.</p>
<p>According to the Spirit&rsquo;s leading, the elders need to consider the practical and particular situation of the saints. First, the ones who form a team need a car, so among these three there must be one who has a car. Three persons going out will only need one car to travel in. If none of the three has a car, the elders should rearrange the group so that one person in the group has a car. It is also better to put three into one team from the same vicinity so they can go out together easily. They will not need to wait for someone else from another neighborhood. Also, the elders have to consider the functions of the ones in the group. One of them may have a car, and they all may be in the same neighborhood, yet each one of them may not be skilled in speaking to others. Based upon this, they could not be formed into a team. The elders need to realize that it is not an easy thing to put these principles into practice. There is the need of much labor on the part of the elders. The saints need to forget their considerations regarding the formation of the teams. No one should have the freedom to choose with whom they will go because the elders will form the teams.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to set a time for all the teams to come together to pray in the meeting hall is awkward. This means that they will all have to travel to the meeting hall and will have to wait for latecomers. This practice will kill the Spirit. Let every team in their own place pray, and let them make a decision as to the proper and profitable time for them to go out to knock on people&rsquo;s doors. This will save time and travel. But what the elders should charge each team to do before going out, is to have at least fifteen minutes to pray together. You must have a time to pray yourself into the spirit, to pray to have the impact, to pray to have the faith with boldness. All of the teams should pray, but there is no need for all of the teams to come together for this.</p>
<p>Do not consider my fellowship as commandments that I am giving you. This is a leading composed of principles. I am not in your situation. When you practice, you will find that some aspects should be adjusted in your situation. There is nothing wrong with this.</p>
<p>To go out to spread the gospel with the truth is a great thing. Our going will open the door for the Lord to go on. No one can tell how far the Lord will go. We are still studying our situation and putting the results of this study into practice. You must learn to do things in a new and living way, dropping your old concepts. In doing anything, do not keep the old way. Try the best to get some new way to improve what you are doing.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO PRACTICE<br />
THE NEW WAY OF GOSPEL PREACHING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Dropping the Old Way</h2>
<p>I may be taking the lead to speak in a visiting team, but I could never forget my past or my old way of preaching. I may not even want to drop the old way. I realize that our new contact is very stubborn, so my way is to give him a personal testimony of something miraculous that happened to me many years ago. This may be very good, but it is old. In Christianity people always like to hear messages related to two things&mdash;blessing and happiness. Many sermons in today&rsquo;s Christianity are centered on these two things. Some may say that you need to believe in Jesus because if you believe in Him you will have many blessings: your business will make more money, you will be promoted, and your health will always be strong. These are earthly blessings. Eventually you will always be happy. Of course, they would also tell people that they are sinners and that Jesus died on the cross, resurrected, and can save them because He is powerful. Then He can give you blessings and happiness. We cannot say that this kind of preaching is absolutely not scriptural. But strictly speaking, it is against the biblical New Testament way and is too natural.</p>
<p>In the Scripture reading, two portions from John are quoted that show the biblical way. While Jesus was living on the earth, He performed many miracles, but John uses the word signs instead of miracles. John 2 tells us that the Lord Jesus would not entrust Himself to the persons who believed in His name because of the signs which He did (vv. 23-24). The Lord has no confidence, no trust, in those who believe because of miracles. The following chapter, chapter three, begins with the word &ldquo;but.&rdquo; &ldquo;But&rdquo; shows us a contrast. Many believed in the Lord because they saw the miracles, yet the Lord would not commit Himself to them. Then the following chapter says, &ldquo;But there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus&rdquo; (3:1). The case of Nicodemus differs from the cases in the foregoing verses, 2:23-25. Nicodemus came to Jesus not because he saw the miracles, so the Lord went further, went deeper, to touch the inner life, to touch regeneration.</p>
<p>Many of us think that if we talk about deeper things, people will not understand us. But in the Lord&rsquo;s talk with Nicodemus, He talked about regeneration. Throughout the entire Old Testament, there was not such a thing as regeneration. Nicodemus had never heard this. He even thought that to be born again was to go back to his mother&rsquo;s womb (3:4). But the Lord told him, &ldquo;You must be born anew&rdquo; (v. 7), born of water and the Spirit (v. 5). He told Nicodemus that he had to be born in his spirit by the Spirit (v. 6). All these were new points to this seeker. Do you believe that Nicodemus fully understood the Lord? Then the Lord referred Nicodemus to the brass serpent in Numbers 21&mdash;&ldquo;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up&rdquo; (John 3:14). All these are new points. But whether Nicodemus understood them or not, eventually he received what the Lord preached. He did not receive any miracle, any sign, but he received regeneration; he was born of water and the Spirit. He received the Lord Jesus as the brass serpent, and he received the eternal life (3:15). The eternal life was a great mystery at that time. Although this also was an altogether new item, the Lord Jesus preached the gospel in this way. This is a wonderful example of the new way, the new preaching. After having been in this line of preaching the gospel for so many years, I found out that the old way and the old preaching really will not work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Using the Booklets</h2>
<p>We have recently published a little booklet entitled <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em> The points in this booklet with the thought of four keys to unlock the mystery of human life is altogether new. The way the gospel is presented in this booklet is new, the preaching is new, and the thought is new. When this booklet was put out, it was very much used by the Holy Spirit, especially in Taipei. Quite close to ten thousand in Taipei were saved and baptized through this booklet. It has been proven that the Lord&rsquo;s blessing is on the use of this booklet. It is so easy to get people saved by using it. To use <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> is the new way of preaching the gospel. We should not preach the gospel according to our natural thought. You may contact a man whom you feel is quite stubborn, so you will give him a testimony to convince him. This is to preach in the old, natural way. You may come across someone whom you feel needs more understanding, so you preach more to him. To some extent he may argue with you and you would do your best to debate with him. According to my knowledge and observation, this way never works.</p>
<p>The more you talk, the more people would not believe or be convinced. Salesmen are taught not to speak their own word and not to talk too long. If a person is not so promising, leave him in a polite way, hoping that at another time he will be promising. Come back another day. Do not stay there for forty minutes or an hour to explain or to convince him. The more you explain, the more you speak, the more you try to convince him, the more he would not be convinced. I have heard of one salesman who makes an outstanding commission by selling things through the telephone. His secret is this&mdash;every call should not exceed three minutes. He has the ability to discern within three minutes whether the one to whom he is talking is promising or not. If not, he politely and quickly closes the conversation, hoping for a sale the next time. Even in the preaching of the gospel it works in this way&mdash;the more you talk, the more you drive people away from you. If your talk with someone does not work so well within fifteen minutes, close the conversation politely and say, &ldquo;Let us come together another time.&rdquo; Quite often a man would not be open in this time, but the next time he will be open. In this time he would not believe, but in another time he would believe.</p>
<p>You do not need to give long testimonies. You do not need to argue, debate, or give long explanations and definitions; all this will not work. The new way we have found is to use the booklets we have published because the booklets were written with a certain goal, with a certain purpose. Our booklets are short and are always on life, not on blessings or happiness. You have to learn to use the booklets to go directly to a person&rsquo;s spirit.</p>
<p>You may contact a man who tells you that he is not clear about the Bible and that he wants to study the Bible more before he will believe. What should you do? Or he may even say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like Christianity and I don&rsquo;t believe that Jesus is the Son of God.&rdquo; What would you say? Do not argue with him. Just open the booklets, especially <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em> Maybe you would ask him to read the page on the parts of man with the three circles (page 5). This way has been tested. Many have expressed their different opinions concerning Christianity and have said they would not believe in the Lord. Our brothers and sisters would not care for what they would say. Regardless of what they would say, they would still ask this person to read a page of <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em></p>
<p>Many times these dissenters at a certain point would say, &ldquo;This is very good.&rdquo; Once &ldquo;very good&rdquo; came out of their mouth, immediately the brothers would stop talking and say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pray.&rdquo; When a man prays, his prayer will lead him into his spirit. In prayer, his spirit is touched and exercised and in his spirit he meets God the Spirit. You do not need to argue with the person. You do not need to convince him that what you believe is right and what he believes is wrong. This is very awkward and not wise. You need to go directly to his spirit. Very rarely would a dissenter, an unbelieving one, believe after your argument. We must take the straight way to directly touch the new contact&rsquo;s spirit. This is the way from the very beginning to bring them to the Lord through the spirit and to know the way of life.</p>
<p>In John 6 the Lord Jesus fed five thousand. The next day many came back seeking after Him. Then the Lord told them, &ldquo;Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides to eternal life, which the Son of Man shall give you&rdquo; (v. 27). The Lord Jesus turned them from the miracles, from the signs, to the inner life. We may think that the Lord&rsquo;s talk was too high, too deep, too profound. He spoke about the eternal life, the bread out of heaven (6:32), the living bread (v. 51), the bread of life (v. 48), and the bread of God (v. 33). To some His word in John 6 was too hard (v. 60), but a good number of those who heard it received His word. We have to learn to preach our gospel, not along the line of happiness or blessings, but always along the line of life by touching a person&rsquo;s spirit. You do not need to deal so much with their understanding, but turn them from their mind to their spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Being Stopped by the Unpromising Ones</h2>
<p>You should not stay in any home over thirty minutes. Set up a rule to visit at least four families when you go out for two hours. Going out for three hours, you must visit six families. Sometimes we are not so wise because we got stuck with one family for the entire time and we caught nothing. Our time was occupied with vain talk and was wasted. Within fifteen or twenty minutes you will realize whether or not this person is promising. If he is not, leave in a polite way and make an appointment with him for the next meeting. Then go to the next door. Maybe in the first hour you would knock on four doors and not one is promising. But in the second hour, you may have two doors which are very promising and you may baptize two people. This means that you are not stopped by the four unpromising families. If you would leave the unpromising ones and go on to knock on other doors, you will find a promising home. The more doors you knock on, the more chances you would have to gain a home.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Exercising Our Spirit and Faith with Boldness</h2>
<p>Remember to exercise your spirit. Do not just exercise your spirit at the time you talk. Before you go, you have to pray. Go to knock on doors always by exercising your spirit. Faith is not in our mind; faith is in our spirit (2 Cor. 4:13). If we only exercise our mind, faith is gone. Exercise your spirit to believe. Believe that the door will be opened to you. Believe that the persons will be convinced. Believe that persons will believe. You have to exercise your spirit and faith with boldness. Use the booklet up to a certain point; even five minutes of reading would be too much. While the person is reading, exercise your spirit to pray something from within&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, catch this one. Lord, touch this one. Lord, open him up that I may lead him into prayer.&rdquo; Then the Lord will answer your prayer, and this one may say, &ldquo;Not bad.&rdquo; That is a sign that it is the time for you to take the lead to bring this person into prayer. You have to do this in boldness. When you pray, he would not pray, yet you must exercise your boldness to say, &ldquo;Follow me. What I say, you say.&rdquo; Do not ask him, but give him a kind of commandment. Tell him to follow you to pray. Most people would follow you, and most people would repeat what you say in prayer. Then after the prayer, direct him to be baptized.</p>
<p>You have to exercise your faith. If you believe, then the person you are talking to will believe. Too many times it was not that they would not believe, but that we would not believe. In my natural life, I am a timid person. It is hard for me to talk to people and at a certain time to pray with them. But I learned the lesson to exercise my spirit to talk to people and at a certain point to pray with them. When the person says that he does not know what to pray, just ask him to say what you say. Make it so simple. With boldness take the lead to bring people into the spirit to contact the Lord. After they pray, say, &ldquo;Let us be baptized.&rdquo; Then one of the helpers would say, &ldquo;This is very good!&rdquo; And the young sister would go to the wife to say, &ldquo;Let us fill up the bathtub with water for the baptism.&rdquo; The Bible never tells us in any case that people should wait to be baptized. When Saul was waiting, Ananias said, &ldquo;Why do you delay? Rise up and be baptized...&rdquo; (Acts 22:16). You have to stand on the fact that your new contact prayed to receive the Lord. If you would bring Him into baptism and he would call on the name of the Lord, he would complete the steps for salvation (Mark 16:16; Acts 22:16). After he is baptized, you need to go to visit him regularly so that the life within him can grow, develop, blossom, and bear fruit.</p>
<p>You may feel that this fellowship is legal, but there is even a law in maintaining our human life. Are you going to get air? You need to breathe. Breathing is very legal. If you say that you do not like this legality, this means that you do not want to breathe. If you do not want to breathe, you will expire. What we have shared in this chapter is the way to bring people into salvation. It is a very short way and very living. People will believe not because of miracles but because of touching the Spirit. After a person is saved in this way, it would be very easy for us to bring him on in the divine life. If you bring people in through blessings, through miracles, or through happiness, later it would be hard for you to turn them to the spirit. You would have a poor start, a wrong start. All the elders in all the churches need to put all these points into practice. May all of us rise up and exercise our spirit to form the visiting teams and to practice the new way of gospel preaching.</p></body></html>
