   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Pentecostal Christians think that the church can be built up by the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But history has shown that doctrines and gifts have divided the Lord's children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The only way that the church can be built up is for us to be spiritual Christians, Christians who live according to our spirit mingled with the Spirit of God.</S>
