<p>To learn to go out in this way we must first be empty in our spirit. Matthew 5:3 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit.&rdquo; Regardless of how old we are and how experienced we have been, we must learn to be poor in spirit. It should seem that we know nothing because we are so empty in our spirit. We should be so new and willing to learn as little children. Then we will be willing to pick up the new way. We will be taught and be successful.</p>
<p>We may think that to set up a home meeting is easy. It may seem that to have a home meeting is merely to go to someone&rsquo;s home and sit with them to sing a hymn, open the Bible, read one or two verses, and speak a little to them. But this alone is not a proper home meeting. On the day of Pentecost, the first day of the church life, three thousand new ones met in their homes. No doubt they had a big success. I tried to find out the secret of their successful practice, and in the recent full-time trainings I have passed on what I have found out.</p>
<p>The building up of a group meeting is even harder. It is difficult to group together new ones who do not know each other. What will we do when we come together? If we call a hymn, direct the reading of the Bible and the prayer, and speak something to the new ones, we may become a pastor holding a little church service in a home. This is not what we want. This absolutely cannot build up a local church. To carry out the proper way is not easy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE MEETINGS<br />
TO BE FULL OF MUTUALITY</h2>
<p>We must build up a practice of preaching the gospel by knocking on people&rsquo;s doors, we must build up the home meetings and group meetings, and we must build up the meetings to be full of mutuality (1 Cor. 14:26). It is hard to collect a number of people to speak and listen to one another fully in mutuality. Furthermore, we must help the attendants to speak and to listen in a living way, not by exercising their mind, but by exercising their spirit. This is altogether something new to the human mind and to the entire human society. Naturally speaking, no one has the concept of such a thing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE LOCAL CHURCHES</h2>
<p>We must build up the local churches in the new way (1 Cor. 14:4, 12). We must not build in the old way, the way of a Sunday morning service with a preacher speaking to an audience. We must build in the way that is so living and so much in the riches of Christ, the way according to 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25. To build up a church according to the old way is somewhat easy. We could build a hall or a chapel or rent a large room, hire a good speaker, and send out advertisements and invitations. When people come, we could have a church service and speak to them. A local church could be &ldquo;built up&rdquo; like this within two months. However, is this a church or is it merely a social gathering? How much will the life of Christ be ministered into these people?</p>
<p>The way to practically carry out God&rsquo;s ordained way is to build up a practice of the proper preaching of the gospel, build up home meetings and group meetings, build up the meetings to be full of mutuality, and build up the local churches for the building of the universal Body of Christ. We all must learn to do this. We cannot graduate from these four things. We need our entire life to finish the course. I am still here striving, struggling, endeavoring, and laboring to run my course. While I am speaking, I am running the course. I do not know when I will finish this race. After entering into the fellowship in this book, we cannot say that we do not know the Lord&rsquo;s way. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we are here and we know His way. Our eyes have been opened and the divine scenery has been presented to us. We cannot deny that something has been presented to us and that our eyes have been opened. Some heavenly light has come to shine over and within us, and something of this light remains in our inner being.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> </body></html>
