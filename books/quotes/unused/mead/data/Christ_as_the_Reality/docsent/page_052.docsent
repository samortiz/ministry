   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE HUMANITY OF JESUS FOR THE SPIRITUAL WARFARE Scripture Reading: Gen 3:15; 1 John 4:2-3; Matt 4:3-4; 8:29; 2 Cor 10:1-4; 2 Tim 1:7; 1 Thes 4:3-4; 1 Cor 6:15, 18-19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen six main things in the past chapters on the meal offering: 1 it constitutes the proper worship to God; 2 it affords the proper diet for the priesthood; 3 it produces the standing boards; 4 it forms God's house by uniting the boards; 5 it produces the proper gifts; and 6 it produces the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now in this chapter we must see that the humanity of Jesus is absolutely necessary for the spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE SEED OF A WOMAN</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The spiritual warfare between the enemy and the saints is mainly dependent upon the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the Bible, the spiritual warfare is between Satan and God, yet God would never fight the battle by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is because Satan is a creature of God and a fallen creature at that.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Creator would never fight with His creature; to do so would lower His position.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why there is the need of man, and this is also why man was created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For the spiritual warfare, God needs another creature to deal with the fallen creature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Genesis 1, God says that He commits His dominion to man that man might subdue the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word "subdue" includes the meaning of fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is impossible to subdue something without a certain kind of fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's intention was that man would war against Satan to subdue the rebellious earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet we know how man was ruined by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Satan knew that man was strategic in the spiritual warfare; therefore, he caused man to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But, praise the Lord for Genesis 3:15!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God promised that Christ would come as the seed of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This seed of woman is a man, but a man who is different from the other man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible says that Christ is the second man 1 Cor 15:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first man failed, and then God sent the second man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ became a man to fight the battle for God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He partook of blood and flesh that through death He might destroy the Devil Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These verses reveal to us that Christ as a man fought with his humanity against Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE SON OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The temptation in the wilderness was the first confrontation between Satan and the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There the Devil challenged the Lord by saying, "If you are the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>" This was not only a challenge, but also a subtle attack.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the Lord Jesus had acknowledged at that time that He was the Son of God, He would have been defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But Jesus knew the subtle wiles of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, He answered, "Man shall not live by bread alone."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He said, in other words, "Before you, Satan, I am not in the position of the Son of God, but in the position of man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am not fighting against you as the Son of God, but as a man."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the reason why the demons cried out that Jesus was the Son of God when they met Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They dared not confess that Jesus was the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If they had, they would have been defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nevertheless, the Lord silenced them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And this is why 1 John 4:2-3 says that every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that we all must confess that the Lord Jesus did come in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He came in the flesh not only to redeem us, but also to defeat Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christians today have the wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They believe that to fight the spiritual warfare we need spiritual power with something heavenly and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But listen to what Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:1: "Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul's beseeching was real fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The spiritual warfare between the enemy and the saints is not so much in divine power, but in the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For the spiritual warfare, we need the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To fight the battle against the enemy, we must exercise the humanity of Jesus in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our family life needs the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Among the saints in the church we need the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In other words, if we are not proper in humanity, it is impossible for us to defeat Satan; we are defeated already.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As long as we do not have the proper and normal humanity, we are already defeated.</S>
