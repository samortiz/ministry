   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 17 Date:July 16, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER K. Y.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a God-loving family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My parents loved the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the age of five or six, I had a consciousness of God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In August of 1928 I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am an optimistic person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God dealt with me by putting a love for men's souls within me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was in Peking, I encountered some difficulties and hard circumstances, and I sought help from Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time he was preaching on overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was constantly in frustration and pain, even to the point of death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through Brother Nee's messages, I saw that Christ is my victory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I looked at myself, I saw nothing but weaknesses, frustrations, and failures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But when I looked to Him, I received joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later I moved to another place to work for the Lord, but no one was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I suffered for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1948, the Lord arranged for me to come to Kuling Mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During my stay here, I suffer every day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am buffeted every day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord buffets me through the words of His servant.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I cannot stand it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A few times I tried to run away.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes I even wanted to kill myself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I can do nothing about myself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I hate myself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I love Brother Nee because the Lord has indeed spoken to me through him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although I suffer so much outwardly, inwardly I am full of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>May the Lord deliver me through His word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Among all the testimonies that I have heard, no other testimony has used the words joy and suffer as much as yours.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It seems that these are two extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, you are easily touched in your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the other hand, you are hiding behind your feelings, and it is very difficult to touch you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are a person who lives completely in your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You are far from what your true self is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is your biggest problem.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You think that you have received some help in your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, you have not received any help at all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word restriction does not apply to you at all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Your prayers are full of your emotion, and your spirit has never been released.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Your emotion is so strong that it is impossible to separate it from your very self.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Your prayers are so emotional that they are void of heart and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Your testimony was filled with rejoicing and sufferings from beginning to end, yet one did not find the Lord or the church in your testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When you feel joyful or painful, your whole being is taken hostage by your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You should separate yourself from your joy and pain; that is, you should separate yourself from your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Christian life has nothing to do with joy or pain.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Christian life should only be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whether or not I feel joyful or painful means little.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The main thing is whether or not I am in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only that which is spiritual is real.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Your emotion and feelings are illusory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, your name is Chow, and my name is Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have never in my life felt that my name is Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But whether or not I feel that my name is Nee does not alter the fact that my name is Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>My name is Nee; this is a fact, not a feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How can you confuse your feelings with the facts in the spiritual pathway?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It seems as if the Lord is not your Lord, but emotion is your lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You simply cannot work for the Lord this way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Spiritual facts far transcend feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Before the Lord we should consider if our life is one that is in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You have only seen what you are in your emotion; you have not seen the facts that are true in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we say that a man has eternal life by believing in the Lord Jesus, it does not mean that he will feel that he has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It means that he will have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is a spiritual fact.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Your whole being is immersed in your emotion, not in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once you realize that all the feelings in the emotion are false, you will be delivered from your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Suppose I say that I am saved in Christ, yet I feel that I am perishing; this feeling is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you have any feeling that runs contrary to the facts in Christ, you should declare, "This is a lie."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You have made your emotion your lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You do not consult the Lord; instead you consult your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is your problem.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You should not be so easily touched.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You should praise God in the darkest room, saying, "God, Your throne remains in heaven; it is forever unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Your throne never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You are forever trustworthy."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Not only feelings of joy and pain, but all other feelings should be dissolved in the presence of His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we have faith within, we will touch the spiritual facts.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>These facts transcend all feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When an airplane is tens of thousands of feet above the earth, one only sees the brightness of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But when one looks up from the earth, he may see nothing but layers and layers of clouds; he may not see the sun at all.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He may even see lightning and hear thunder.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Our walk is based on spiritual facts.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must forget how we feel.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must live above the doubting clouds, not below them.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must be so objective that everything we do is based on God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Even so-called spiritual feelings are not warranted.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Once I could not believe in God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I told Him, "Lord, I am in doubt about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I only believe in Your word."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It has been ten years since I said that, and I can still testify that God's word is faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we build our faith upon God's word, we will move away from Satan's battlefield.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In nautical studies, there is one kind of calculation called a "dead reckoning."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It means to ignore everything.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If you can set aside all your feelings and declare them false, you will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Your condition is very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>You have been deceived by your emotion for a long time, to the point that you can now no longer separate yourself from your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When a man walks up a hill, he may feel that he has a temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But if one measures him with a thermometer, he will find that there is no fever.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The hotness is only a superficial feeling; it does not reflect the true condition of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>From today onward you cannot trust in any of your joyful or painful feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Even if heaven falls down on you, God's word will still stand.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>No matter how you feel, you have to remember that spiritual facts are the foundation of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The facts are facts.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If you believe them, you can praise God for them.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If you cannot believe them, you should still praise God for them.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Spiritual facts are contained in God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>All we have to do is believe God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>One brother pays attention to nothing but confession of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>From morning till evening, he does not do any work; the only thing he does is confess.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We know that such a one is deceived by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It seems as if he exists for his confession.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>He confesses for what is true and he confesses for what is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>I told him once, "Listen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>From now on do not confess anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Just say to the Lord, Lord, I can be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>But I cannot even tell what is right from what is wrong.'</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>You should not try to differentiate between what is right and what is wrong, because it is not the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When the time is right, you can try to distinguish it."</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Not long after I said this, our brother was recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>May the Lord use such incomplete words to deliver you from your problems, that is, from the falsehood in your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>May the Lord lead you to trust in His word alone.</S>
