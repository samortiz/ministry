<h1 class="title">HE WHO BELIEVES HAS ETERNAL LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: John 3:36</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Eternal life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The eternal life is not just a blessing, but even more, it is another life.</li>
	<li>The eternal life is a life that is eternal. It is God&rsquo;s life. Only God&rsquo;s life is an unlimited life, a powerful, holy, bright, loving, and righteous life.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man&rsquo;s original life is a fragile life. Being hit by a car or taking a little too much tranquilizer will immediately terminate it. It is also a limited life. Men live fifty, sixty, eighty, or even one hundred years and die. The life span is limited and life soon vanishes away.</li>
	<li>Man&rsquo;s life is also evil and is destined to die. Speak on sin and death.<br />
	Items I and II are the comparisons of God&rsquo;s life with man&rsquo;s life.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to obtain eternal life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The eternal life is in God&rsquo;s Son. It is the life of God.</li>
	<li>In order to have the eternal life men must have the Son of God.</li>
	<li>The Son of God is God and is also the Spirit. In order to have Him men must receive Him with their spirit, that is, believe in Him.</li>
	<li>After receiving Him with their spirit, after believing in Him, men will have the eternal life. As the Scripture says, he who believes in the Son has eternal life.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The consequence of not believing
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Men who do not believe will not have eternal life because the eternal life is in God&rsquo;s Son. If you do not believe, you will not have eternal life.</li>
	<li>If you do not believe, the wrath of God is upon you. The eternal life is in the Son of God, while the wrath is according to God&rsquo;s righteousness. If you believe in the Son of God, you will have eternal life. If you do not believe in the Son of God, you will remain under the wrath of God. God&rsquo;s wrath is like the thunder ready to roll. When it rolls, men will perish.</li>
