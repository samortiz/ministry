[1]  It would be difficult for us to obey God and do His will or to have anything deeper than an external and ordinary fellowship with God and knowledge of God.
[2]  For example, there are many commandments, laws, and teachings which are indications that God wants man to bear responsibility.
[3]  We must pray until the Spirit of God is so stirred in us that we feel deeply that this promise is intended of God for us.
[4]  If there is no condition attached to this promise, we can immediately exercise our faith to receive it, believing that God will act according to His promise and accomplish in us what He has promised.
[5]  Then we come to God through prayer and ask Him to act according to His faithfulness and righteousness and fulfill His promise in us.
[6]  In other words, facts are God s accomplished work.
[7]  In the Old Testament God promised that the Lord Jesus would be born of a virgin Isa 7:14 .
[8]  Then, when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law, that He might redeem those under law, that we might receive the sonship Gal 4:4-5 .
[9]  From what we have seen in the previous examples there are the following principles: 1 We need to discover what God s fact is.
[10]  3 We need by faith on one hand to praise God that we are this way; on the other hand we need to act and manifest that we are such.
[11]  4 Whenever temptation or trial comes to us, we must believe that God s Word and His fact are more dependable than our feelings.
[12]  God opened her eyes and showed her three things in this chapter: a that Christ has been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, has poured down the Holy Spirit v. 33 ; b God has made Him both Lord and Christ v. 36 ; c this promise of receiving the Holy Spirit is for the Israelites and for their children, and also for those who are afar off v. 39 . She saw that it is a fact that the Holy Spirit has been poured out.
[13]  In God s word of grace, three things are included: God s promise, God s fact, and God s covenant.
[14]  Now let us come to the matter of God s making a covenant with Abraham.
[15]  He asked, What wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus? v. 2 . This shows that he had not yet known or seen how gracious God s promise was.
[16]  If, having made a covenant with man, God does not fulfill it, He becomes unfaithful and unrighteous.
[17]  We know that the reason God makes a covenant with man is that man may become bold enough to inquire of Him and demand Him to fulfill what He has promised in the covenant according to righteousness.
[18]  Then he knelt down before the congregation of Israel, raised his hands towards the heavens and said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven, or on earth; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart....Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying....Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David 2 Chron 6:14, 16-17 .
[19]  CHAPTER THREE A GENERAL SKETCH OF THE NEW COVENANT
[20]  The obvious ones are those He made with Noah, with Abraham, with Israel at Horeb after they left Egypt, with Israel at other times Deut 29:1 , and with David.
[21]  However, besides these covenants, there is the one God made with us through the Lord Jesus Christ, which is often referred to as the new covenant.
[22]  Although there are many covenants, the most important are the one which God made with Abraham and the one called the new covenant.
[23]  The new covenant imparts God s laws into man s mind and inscribes them upon man s heart Heb 8:10 .
[24]  The new covenant is a covenant in which God gives you life and power to do the good He intends you to do, so that He may be your God and you may be His people Heb 8:10; Titus 2:14 .
[25]  Those who are deeply taught by God s grace and who deeply know Him, consider that there is very little difference between His promise and His covenant, for they know that God is faithful even as He is righteous.
[26]  When speaking of the new covenant age we must ask three questions: 1 With whom did God originally establish the new covenant?
[27]  According to the Scriptures, God never made any covenant with the Gentiles.
[28]  In Matthew 26:28 we read, For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins marg.
[29]  . This verse reveals that the blood of Christ is the blood of the new covenant.
[30]  This blood is especially for the establishing of a covenant.
[31]  Concerning the relationship between the blood and the covenant, we can say that the blood is the base while the covenant is the contract, the writing.
[32]  The inheritance which God has given us is recorded in the contracted covenant.
[33]  This is the new covenant which God made with us through the blood of the Lord Jesus.
[34]  It is by this new covenant that we receive the spiritual inheritance which God has given us.
[35]  It is important to realize that God s salvation before the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus was all accomplished by His grace, but that after the Lord s crucifixion it was accomplished by His righteousness.
[36]  In Hebrews 13:20-21 we read, Now the God of peace Who brought up from among the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of an eternal covenant, equip you in every good work for the doing of His will, doing in us that which is well-pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ, to Whom be the glory forever and ever, Amen.
[37]  The writer of Hebrews asked God, through the blood of the eternal covenant, to cause the resurrected Jesus Christ to dwell in us, so that we may do God s will and accomplish the things well-pleasing to Him.
[38]  This shows us that a prayer with faith, a great prayer, is one prayed by standing upon the eternal covenant of the Lord s blood.
[39]  In chapter three we pointed out that in the new covenant there are promises as well as facts.
[40]  We also pointed out that the word testament in Hebrews 9:16 is the same word for covenant in the original text.
[41]  Indeed, we might say that Hebrews has this one specific purpose, that is, to tell us what the new covenant is.
[42]  Hebrews 9:16-17 tells us that where there is a testament there must of necessity be the death of him who made it.
[43]  For a testament is confirmed where there has been death, since it has no force when he who made it is living.
[44]  One day our Lord told His disciples: This cup is the new covenant in my blood Luke 22:20 .
[45]  When the Lord Jesus brought the blood into the Holy of Holies Heb 9:12 , He was telling God that the One who made the testament had died.
[46]  We will now look specifically at the characteristics of the content of the new covenant.
[47]  We have seen in previous chapters that according to Hebrews 8:10-12 the contents of the new covenant include three major parts.
[48]  According to God s eternal purpose, He first imparted His life and power into us; then He became our God in the law of life that we might be His people in the law of life, that we might have a deeper knowledge of Him, and that we might live Him out through us.
[49]  Since forgiveness of sins is only a procedure by which to achieve His purpose, Scripture puts forgiveness of sins at the very end. However, according to our spiritual experience, we first obtain cleansing, that is, the cleansing which comes from forgiveness; then we become God s people in the law of life, and then we possess a deeper knowledge of God in an inward way.
[50]  Praise God, the blood of the Lord Jesus deals with the charges of sin against us before God and purifies our conscience Matt 26:28; Rev 1:5; Heb 9:14 ; and the cross of the Lord Jesus deals with our old man, delivering us from the power of sin and freeing us from sin itself Rom 6:6, 18 .
[51]  According to the experience of those who serve the Lord, the more one sees his sins in the light, the more sorrowful he feels for his sins and the more he senses the grace of forgiveness.
[52]  With some, because they have sinned so much and so grievously, there is always the fear that God will not forgive them.
[53]  It refers to God s forgiving us our sins in Christ.
[54]  God can be propitious to our unrighteousnesses because Christ has shed His blood for us.
[55]  God s forgetting of our sins is not that He hides His face or purposely ignores them, but that Christ s blood has blotted out the charges of sin against us and washed us from our sins Isa 44:22; Heb 1:3; Rev 1:5 .
[56]  When a sinner knows that he is a sinner and believes in the Lord Jesus, his sins are forgiven.
[57]  3 In 1 John 3:9 we read that Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God.
[58]  If we are clear concerning these three points, we will admit that the more fellowship we have with God and the more we walk in the light of God, the more we need forgiveness and cleansing.
[59]  We have seen previously that in the new covenant the forgiveness of sins is the gospel of grace.
[60]  Concerning this aspect of the new covenant they not only believe, but they are also willing to testify that God has forgiven them their sins and cleansed them from all their unrighteousnesses.
[61]  However, in addition to this aspect of the new covenant concerning the forgiveness of sins, there are also two other extremely glorious and precious parts of the new covenant: one is the matter of life and power, and the other is the matter of the inward knowledge, or knowing God in an inward way.
[62]  The first is Hebrews 8:10: For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them, and I will be God to them, and they shall be a people to Me. Another is Hebrews 10:16: This is the covenant which I will covenant with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws upon their hearts and upon their minds I will inscribe them.
[63]  When speaking of how God has put His law within us and has inscribed it upon our hearts, we must start from regeneration, for regeneration means that the Holy Spirit has put the uncreated life of God into man s spirit.
[64]  Regeneration is a new thing that takes place in man s spirit; therefore regeneration is not a matter of behavior but a matter of life.
[65]  We read in Genesis 2:7 that Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
[66]  The spirit, which includes the faculties of the conscience, intuition, and fellowship, knows how to worship God, how to serve God, and how to enter into relationship with God.
[67]  In order to deal with man s sin and bring fallen man back to Himself, God sent Christ.
[68]  Christ Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness 1 Pet 2:24 .
[69]  The children of Israel had committed sin and deserved death, but God told Moses to lift up the brass serpent so that those who had been bitten by the serpent might look upon it and live.
[70]  Let us read Hebrews 8:10 again: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them.
[71]  This verse shows the difference between the new covenant and the old.
[72]  In the old covenant the law was placed outside of man and written on tables of stone.
[73]  From God s Word we see that the law which can be imparted into us and inscribed upon the heart is not the law of letters, but the law of life.
[74]  The law which God imparted into us comes from the life which God imparted into us.
[75]  In Hebrews 8:10 and 10:16 we have the plural word laws, although the law of life is singular not plural.
[76]  Why then in these two verses does it say laws?
[77]  When the Holy Spirit regenerated us, we received the uncreated life of God.
[78]  If there are problems with our conscience, our mind, our will, or our emotions, God s life will be hindered.
[79]  God s life has been imparted into our spirit, but this life desires to spread out and move into the different parts of our inward being.
[80]  Ezekiel 36:25-27 speaks of at least five things: 1 we have been cleansed with clean water; 2 we have been given a new heart; 3 we have a new spirit within us; 4 our stony heart has been removed, and we have been given a heart of flesh; and 5 God s Spirit has been put within us.
[81]  The result of putting these five things together is that we might walk in God s statutes and keep His ordinances.
[82]  We have already pointed out that God has given us a new heart with a new spirit and that the Holy Spirit dwells within us.
[83]  Now we shall give attention to the matter of how God removes our stony heart and gives us a heart of flesh.
[84]  Mark 12:30 says, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.
[85]  The verse shows that we have to use our whole heart, our whole soul, our whole understanding, and our whole strength to love God.
[86]  Hebrews 8:7 says, For if that first covenant was faultless, no place would have been sought for a second.
[87]  We have mentioned before that the reason the first covenant had fault was not because the covenant itself was faulty, but because it was weak when applied to man.
[88]  The reason the new covenant is a better covenant is because through it the law is imparted into man; it is inscribed on man s heart.
[89]  The new covenant law of life can cause man to obey God s will and does not need man s teaching.
[90]  If we are those who are truly saved, whose heart has been renewed, even if we have turned to other things and become cold, yet we clearly realize within us that God is having mercy toward us, His life keeps moving within us, until one day it will move us to say aloud or in silence, O God, I pray that You will turn my heart.
[91]  However, if we are truly saved and our heart has been touched, even though at times we backslide and our heart becomes hardened, yet within us we know the story: God has mercy toward us, His life is still moving in us, and eventually it will move until our heart will again have the desire to obey God.
[92]  The Apostle Paul said: His grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain 1 Cor 15:10 .
[93]  We know this was true because he labored more abundantly than all the other apostles.
[94]  Yet he says, Not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
[95]  He could labor more abundantly than others, not because his body was stronger, nor because he was more diligent than others, but because the grace of God was with him.
[96]  When the law of life is allowed to move in us without hindrance, it will develop to a state where Christ can be formed in us Gal 4:19 .
[97]  When Christ is gradually formed in us, we will be transformed 2 Cor 3:18 .
[98]  To the extent that God s life becomes mingled with us, Christ will be formed in us, and to that extent we will be transformed.
[99]  To the extent that a man is filled with the life of Christ, lives Christ out, and expresses Christ, he is conformed to the image of God s Son, as mentioned in Romans 8:29.
[100]  Conformation spoken of in Romans 8:29 and Philippians 3:10 means in the original text to be of like form and nature or to be alike.
[101]  This Greek word is used only three times in the New Testament: in Romans 8:29, in Philippians 3:21, where it is used as an adjective, and in Philippians 3:10, where it is used as a verb.
[102]  Although the redemption of the body is clearly a matter of God s grace, nevertheless, after the Apostle John said that we should be like Him and see Him as He is, he immediately followed by saying: And every one that hath this hope set on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure 1 John 3:3 .
[103]  Put into its context, this hope refers to the words be like him.
[104]  A brother who has become learned in the Lord spoke of purification in this way: The danger of spirituality is to experience victory and sanctification, to be fruitful in our work, to possess spiritual gifts and righteousnesses that are of life....Deeper purification means that even that which comes from God s revelation, which issues from the resurrection life of Christ, should not be allowed to remain.
[105]  Although God is God, the marvelous fact is that He desires to dwell among men.
[106]  God commanded Moses to build Him a sanctuary, saying clearly, ...that I may dwell among them Exo 25:8 .
[107]  Again He said, And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.
[108]  And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them: I am Jehovah their God Exo 29:45-46 .
[109]  Because they know God as the God of creation, they worship Him and say: You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, for You have created all things, and because of Your will they were and have been created Rev 4:11 .
[110]  Regarding the characteristics of the content of the new covenant, we have already mentioned two main aspects.
[111]  It is true that God is propitious to our unrighteousnesses and no longer remembers our sins.
[112]  Just as man s body has its senses, man s spirit also has its senses.
[113]  The sense of the human spirit is in the innermost part of man s being.
[114]  No doubt some one will raise the question, Why then do the Scriptures speak in many places of teaching?
[115]  For instance, Paul said, For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church 1 Cor 4:17 .
[116]  The Lord s anointing is in the intuition of our spirit and it teaches us concerning all things, but sometimes our mind cannot understand the sense in the spirit.
[117]  Romans 12:2 shows us that first the mind must be renewed and transformed; then we can prove what is God s good, well-pleasing, and perfect will.
[118]  Colossians 1:9 shows us that we must first have the spiritual understanding; then we will be filled with the full knowledge of God s will.
[119]  According to the Scriptures, man s knowing God can be divided into three steps.
[120]  Psalm 103:7 says, He made known his ways unto Moses, His doings unto the children of Israel.
[121]  To know God Himself is the greatest blessing and the greatest glory in the new covenant.
[122]  God Himself cannot be known by the flesh, but only by the intuition.
[123]  John 17:3 says: And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him Whom You have sent, Jesus Christ.
[124]  This verse tells us that every one who has eternal life knows God and the Lord Jesus.
[125]  First Corinthians 2:11-12 says, For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man, which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God.
[126]  Whether this spirit of wisdom and revelation is a function which has been hidden in the spirit of the believer and which will be uncovered by God through prayer, or whether it is through prayer that the Holy Spirit causes the believer to receive anew the wisdom and revelation in his spirit, is difficult to say; in any case, this spirit of wisdom and revelation enables the believer to have the full knowledge of God.
[127]  Our outward expression of God cannot exceed our inward knowledge.
[128]  The Apostle Paul said, But when it pleased God, Who set me apart from my mother s womb and called me through His grace, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the nations, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood, neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me Gal 1:15-17 .
[129]  From the time God was manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 , this great mystery has been revealed.
[130]  This glorious One who is both God and man has manifested God s holy and glorious life.
[131]  To exercise ourselves unto godliness is to let this godly life express itself and become a godly living, until one day we shall be completely like God.
[132]  There is a hymn of prayer which properly expresses this pursuit.
[133]  This does not mean that we are complete to such an extent that we no longer need confession, no longer need God s forgiveness, and no longer need the cleansing of the precious blood.
[134]  It is very important, for it shows that God being propitious toward our unrighteousnesses and by no means remembering our sins anymore is the cause; but that God has imparted His laws into our mind and has inscribed them upon our hearts and has become our God in the law of life and has made us His people in the law of life for this purpose: that we might have a deeper knowledge of Him.
[135]  We have spoken a great deal concerning the characteristic of the new covenant.
[136]  But to really know and understand it, we must have the revelation and the illumination of the Holy Spirit.
