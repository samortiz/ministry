In the Psalms Christ is revealed but we cannot say that the church is revealed because in the Psalms the church is still hidden as a mystery
Because of their nearness and openness to God, they provide a way for God to utter something within their utterance
On the one hand they are the expression of the godly saints, and yet on the other hand they are the expression of God Himself
On the one hand it was and still is the utterance of the writers, but on the other hand it is the utterance of Christ
The writers, being godly saints, did their utmost to utter something in praise to God according to their experiences
The Psalmists spoke according to their concept, but, when God suddenly uttered something within their utterance, the concept was changed
They experienced so much of God's goodness that they praised God with all these aspects of their experience of God
Christ Himself told His disciples that in the books of Moses in the prophets and in all the Psalms many things were written concerning Him
Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3 tell us that we must be in the Spirit, always praising with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs
You cannot hear much concerning the church as the house and the city of God in the praises of most Christians today
That is well, but we must realize that whenever we praise God, our praises must be Christ-centered and church-centered
There is further improvement with the beginning of Book III: 'Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a pure heart'
There is even more improvement when we come to the beginning of Book IV: 'Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations'
Finally, Book V begins on the highest plane of all: 'O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth forever'
One of them said the same thing If thou return to the Almighty thou shalt be built up thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles
Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways' '
We think that if we keep the law if we do nothing wrong if we are good and delight in the law day and night then whatever we do will prosper
The godly saints were not accurate in their concept, but in their person they were so close to the Lord and open to Him
In Psalm 1 there are two points: Blessed is the man that keeps the law, and the way of the ungodly shall perish
The conclusion of Psalm 2 is that all they that put their trust in Christ are blessed, and that we should 'kiss the Son, lest he be angry'
Whether you will be blessed or not, whether you will perish or not, depends upon whether you put your trust in Christ and kiss Him
In the eyes of God, whether or not you are blessed, whether or not you will perish, depends not on the law, but absolutely on Christ
It is not a matter of keeping the law or delighting in the law, but of putting my trust in Christ and kissing Him
It is not a matter today of keeping the law, but absolutely a matter of putting our trust in Christ and kissing Him
It includes, in the following centuries, all the rulers, kings and princes of this earth who arise and plot against Christ
While the other world rulers were plotting against Christ, God undoubtedly was in the heavens laughing at them and having them in derision
He ascended to the heavens, where He asked of the Father, and the Father gave Him all the nations as His inheritance
Regardless of how much the world opposes Christ God has appointed Him God has anointed Him and He has declared that now we must preach Him
We must tell the people to be wise, to repent, to fear and rejoice with trembling, to put their trust in Him and love Him
What have we to do but praise Him, be wise, be admonished, fear and rejoice with trembling, put our trust in Him and kiss Him
He who sitteth in the heavens In contempt will laugh at them, Vex them in His fierce displeasure, Terrifying all such men
Now 'tis Christ, 'tis God's Anointed, Who declares the Lord's decree: 'Thou'rt my Son , This day I've begotten Thee
Now be wise, O be instructed, All ye rulers of the earth, Fear the Lord, rejoice with trembling, Serve the only One of worth
Lord, we praise Thee, we have seen Him- Thy unique Anointed One- And from vanity repenting, We in love have kissed Thy Son
The book of Galatians was written for the very purpose of showing us the difference between the law and Christ
Galatians 3:24 says that the law was our schoolmaster, or, according to a better translation, our child conductor
Galatians 5:4 says, 'Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace'
Many times in Christendom, after people have been brought to grace, they have been helped immediately to keep the law
He said Lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elijah
You see, if you still treasure Psalm 1, it means that you are pitching two tents, one for Christ and one for Moses
And there appeared a great sign in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars
They are three different dispensations: the dispensation of the sun, the dispensation of the moon, and the dispensation of the twelve stars
The moon is good, but it is much inferior to the sun; likewise, the law is good, but it is far inferior to the New Testament
The age of the patriarchs was the period of the forefathers before the law, from the time of Adam or Abel to Moses
The thought of Psalm 2 is the same as that of the New Testament; thus, in a sense, you may find every part of Psalm 2 there
We have seen that the first section of Psalm 2, verses 1 to 3, is the opposition of world rulers against Christ
The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ
Christ was the One sitting on the horse, and the antichrist, the kings and all the armies were making war against Him
The fulfillment of the first section of Psalm 2 began with Pontius Pilate and will be ended with the beast, the antichrist
In the second section of Psalm 2, God declared that He has anointed Christ as His king on Zion, the hill of His holiness
Do not care for many things; only care for this: God has declared that He has anointed, installed, and established Christ as the King
God made Christ a little lower than the angels-this was the incarnation, and this was the man by the name of Jesus
We have the incarnation, the resurrection, the ascension, the enthronement, the Lordship, the Kingship, the Kingdom, and the Body of Christ
In Psalms 3 through 7 the writers were occupied with the adversaries and their own problems; so they asked God to solve these problems
The human race has done its utmost to solve its problems, but the more problems they solve, the more they have
Out of the mouth of little ones Thou hast established praise, That Thou may still Thine enemy And swiftly end his days
O Jesus Lord, Thou art that man, The One who joined our race, Who put upon Himself the flesh And took a lower place
Thine incarnation, rising too, And Thy transcendency, Thy Lordship, Headship, Kingdom full, And Body here we see
When you left the meeting, by the time you got home, you had descended from the peak to the bottom of the valley
Meanwhile, while they were expressing something in this way, they still realized their need of the house of God
They praised God in the dwelling place of God, and they declared that God's salvation issues from His dwelling
If we do not have the heavenly vision, if we only have the human concept, we will say that every Psalm is wonderful
When we have vision from above, we see that many of these so-called good Psalms are in the valley, at the bottom
Let us firstly read Psalm 15 to see the Psalmist's expression according to his human concept: 'Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle?
He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor
When Peter was on the mount of transfiguration, he spoke nonsense, but when he spoke on the day of Pentecost, he was transparently clear
Christ proclaims that God has begotten Him by resurrection, and that God has given Him all the nations of this earth as His inheritance
Then we preach the gospel Be wise kings of the earth be admonished princes of this earth you must kiss the Son lest he be angry with you
We have the next Psalm of Christ, Psalm 16, which begins by telling us the kind of life Christ lived as a man on this earth
Psalm 8 told us that He was a man, a little lower than the angels, but it did not tell us the kind of life He lived
Verse 3: 'To the saints that are on the earth, and to the excellent, thou has said, In them is all my delight'
We need to pray-read these eight verses and become intimately acquainted with the kind of life Christ lived while He was on earth as a man
He was put to death and laid in the grave, and while He was dying, He was glad, for He said, 'My heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth'
Consult some of the better translations of the Bible: they all interpret glory here as the innermost part, the spirit
Whenever we praise the Lord, our praise must issue from our glory, our spirit, but it is always expressed by our tongue
If we have God's presence, we have fulness of joy; if we are at His right hand, there are pleasures forevermore
Psalms 17 through 21 are down from the level of Psalm 16, but they are not as far down as Psalm 3 through 7 and 9 through 15
They realize that God hears their voices from His temple, that God sends them help from the sanctuary and strengthens them out of Zion
In Psalms 17 through 21 the concept changes from the law to God's Anointed; it is gradually shifted from one line to another
Many Bible students believe this expresses the desire of Christ during the three days between His crucifixion and resurrection
Now verse 50: 'Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and showeth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore'
Psalm 21:3-5: 'For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head
We could not see this kind of improvement in Psalms 3 through 7 or 9 through 15; it did not appear until after Psalm 16
In order to understand this Psalm, we must realize that it is one of a group of three Psalms concerning Christ-Psalms 22, 23, and 24
In order to understand these three Psalms, we must keep in mind all the preceding Psalms concerning Christ-Psalms 2, 8, and 16
Psalm 22 is divided into two sections: verses 1 through 21 compose the first section, while verse 22 to the end of the Psalm is the second
In the entire Bible, not another passage relates the crucifixion of Christ in so much detail as the first section of Psalm 22
The chief priests mocking Him, with the scribes and elders, said, 'He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him'
Verse 16: 'For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet'
There is no other book in the Old Testament which presents the things of Christ in so much detail as the Psalms
The word 'resurrection' is not used in the passage, but the fact of resurrection is indicated clearly and definitely
Because by His resurrection all His disciples were regenerated and made the sons of God; thus, they all became His brethren
If you prayread this section again and again looking unto the Spirit you will see that it describes the result of His death and resurrection
We are the meek ones, and they are the proud ones; we are the truly prosperous ones, but they are the miserable ones
The third aspect is seen in verse 29: 'All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and he that cannot keep alive his own soul'
The fourth aspect of the result of Christ's resurrection is in verse 28: 'For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he rules over the nations'
The fifth point concerns the Gospel preaching: 'A seed shall serve him; it shall be told concerning the Lord to the coming generation
They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this'
It is not sufficient for us merely to enjoy Him; the purpose of the enjoyment is that we may go on and walk in the paths of righteousness
We who have been following Him for years can tell you that the further we go, the more difficult the situation becomes
The valley is not at the top, but at the bottom; it is not the shining, but the shadow; it is not the life, but the death
You would like to stay in the green pastures with the still waters, but sooner or later you will enter the valley
When you are passing through the valley of the shadow of death, the Shepherd is nearer to you than ever before
The rod is for protection, to keep the wolves away, and the staff is for guidance in whatever way your need demands
The Psalmist did not say that he would pass through the house of the Lord, but that he would dwell in the house of the Lord
After passing through all the courses on earth, they think, they will die and go to heaven, where they will dwell in the house of the Lord
The shepherding of the resurrected Christ is to lead us into the local churches, to lead us into the house of the Lord forever
Have you realized that on this earth there was at least a hill, which was called the hill of His holiness, and at least that hill was His?
We may express it this way: the earth is the Lord's, yet only the hill of Zion was actually possessed by the Lord
The church is a hill which is occupied by the Lord today as the very stepping-stone, the beachhead, for the Lord to come back
Verse 7: 'Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye ancient doors; and the King of glory shall come in'
David said, 'Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye ancient doors; and the King of glory shall come in
If Christ could not come in to the church today in an adequate and fuller way, how could Christ come back to the earth?
Before You come back to the earth, come in to the church, come in to fully possess this little hill, the hill of Zion'
While the ark was entering David said Lift up your heads O ye gates and be ye lifted up ye ancient doors and the King of glory shall come in
That He may have a spot on this earth, a hill in this usurped earth, as a stepping-stone for Him to come back to regain the entire earth
The nations will be an inheritance to Christ, and the earth, including the uttermost parts, will be Christ's possession
In Psalm 22 we have more concerning the earth: 'All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord'
The brethren were brought forth by the resurrection of Christ, and the resurrection issued from His crucifixion
We need the Psalms, but we also need heavenly vision to read the Psalms; otherwise we only receive a certain kind of inspiration
The main purpose here is to show how the saints experience and enjoy God through Christ, especially in the house and the city of God
Psalms 25 to 41 show us how the saints experience and enjoy God through Christ, especially in the house and the city of God
There are a number of verses which indicate the various aspects of Christ's suffering and His attitude in suffering
All these verses in the Psalms are the words of the suffering saints, but their sufferings were identical to the sufferings of Christ
Now let us come to the most strategic point, the house and the city, and see how the saints experience and enjoy God there
Not only must we dwell in the house of the Lord, but we must also offer sacrifices of shouts of joy in the house
We have Psalm 27 showing us that the house of God is not only a place to behold His beauty and inquire of Him, but also a place to shout
You may say that this is merely an Old Testament practice but Paul says I will therefore that men pray every where lifting up holy hands
In Gods house the saints are under the shadow of Gods wings enjoying His precious lovingkindness How precious is thy lovingkindness O God!
In God's house they are satisfied with the fatness of His house: 'They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house'
In God's house the saints are drinking of the river of God's pleasure: 'Thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures'
We have the river of pleasures and the fountain of life; and here, where life is, there is always light, for the life is the light of men
One verse speaks of dwelling in the house of the Lord forever, and the other mentions the hill of the Lord, which is the site of the house
When we reach Psalm 122 in the last part of the Psalms, the city reaches its consummation-'O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem'!
The Psalmist goes on, 'My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God'-not for the law, not for knowledge, but for the living God Himself
We enjoy the house so much now and we are praising, but after this we enjoy something of Christ in a much deeper way
There is reverence here in Psalm 45, but it is a reverence with a sweet and tender feeling, an inner feeling of preciousness
Regardless of what the situation is on this earth, regardless of what the nations are doing, Christ is riding on triumphantly, prosperously
Verse 6 speaks of His kingdom: 'Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter'
The Lord loves all the things related to God and hates everything related to the evil one; He loves God and hates Satan
Because He loves righteousness and hates wickedness, God has anointed Him with the oil of gladness above His companions
Whatever He does, whatever He works, is filled with the savor of His death and resurrection-the myrrh and the aloes plus the cassia
Whenever we meet in all the local churches, the first thing, the main thing, the central thing, must be the singing, the praising
In all the local churches praising must be the central feature, because out of the ivory palaces stringed instruments make Him glad
If you would praise the King, you must say something concerning the queen, because the queen is part of the King
In the third and last section of the Psalm, verses 16 and 17, the praises are also to the King, but about His children
If you would render Him complete praise you must say something about Himself something about His queen and something concerning His children
In the book of Revelation, we have the local churches, and we also have the princes, those who will reign with Christ
Even in Genesis 2 we have these two figures: firstly, the materials for the building, and secondly, a bride, Eve
When we say, 'Praise the Lord for the church in Chicago,' or, 'Praise the Lord for the church in Atlanta,' He is well pleased
Because the proper instructions given to the church make the church more really the church; therefore these too are praises
If we would leave all the past and go on with the Lord in a new way, we would obtain beauty in the King's eyes
In verse 1 of this Psalm Christ is the King, in verse 2 He is a man, in verse 6 He is God, and in verse 11 He is the Lord
Verse 12: 'And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor'
Now let us go on to verse 13: 'The king's daughter is all glorious within the inner part of the palaces: her clothing is of wrought gold'
Now this wrought gold, this Christ, has become our clothing, our righteousness, that we may stand justified in the presence of God
On one hand you have been justified, but on the other hand you are short of Christ being wrought into your being
In the local churches we need many needles to do the embroidery work that Christ may be wrought into our being
Praise the Lord, we have the first robe, but we need the second that we may not only praise Christ, but be a praise to Christ
In that day the earth in a practical way will be possessed to the uttermost by the King through all His princes
All the earth, all the saints, and the entire universe will say, 'O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth'!
Verse 17: 'I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the peoples praise thee for ever and ever'
Our tongues as pens are ready, We've volumes here to 'write'- The glories of our Bridegroom, Our Lord and our delight
The queen in gold of Ophir At Thy right hand doth stand; King's daughters are the women Who fill Thy honored band
The church in all her glory Shall match her glorious King, And all the saints, the women, Thy likeness there shall bring
Tis by the Spirit's stitching That Christ in us is wrought, And with this glorious garment We'll to the King be brought
When the church is strengthened and enlarged, it becomes not only the house in which God dwells, but also the city in which God rules
Book I Psalms 1 to 41 Book II Psalms 42 through 72 Book III Psalms 73 through 89 Book IV Psalms 90 to 106 and Book V Psalms 107 to 150
Because they were human because they were religious and because they were so well taught in the law their concept was naturally lawcentered
When they were praising according to their religious concept, the Spirit of Christ was given the opportunity to speak
While the Psalmist was scribing Psalm 1, someone who was subconsciously with him in the driver's seat shifted to another lane in Psalm 2
His intention was to drive in the left lane, but eventually he shifted to the right, not by himself, but by someone subconsciously with him
Next, in Psalm 24, we have seen that the holy hill is the stepping-stone for Christ to regain the entire earth
Following Psalm 24, we have all those Psalms in the last part of Book I, Psalms 25 to 41, concerning the house
Martin Luther, for instance, said that Psalms 110 and 118 are the greatest of all the Psalms, for these Psalms speak of Christ
It is after these Psalms on the house, then, that we come to Psalm 45, where we encounter a richer and deeper experience of Christ
As Christ is known by the saints in a deeper way, He becomes the saints' sweeter experience in the local churches
Following these deeper and sweeter experiences of Christ in such an intimate way, we come immediately to Psalms 46 through 48
The climax of the house is in Psalms 27 through 36; now in Psalms 46, 47, and 48, we have the climax of the city
The sea is in the earth, but in the city there is a river, 'the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God'
We are the most joyful people because in the city, in the church, we have a flow of living water-not just a trickle, but a river
If we are in the local church, we are in the morning; if we are outside the local church, we are simply in the night
He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire
When the church is truly enlarged as a city, in which we enjoy God as our everything, we will surely clap our hands
When the church is enlarged as a city, God shall subdue the peoples through the city and rule over all the earth in Christ as a great King
It is the church enlarged as a city that will bring the entire earth under God's authority and kingship in Christ
Verse 2: 'Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King'
In Brother Watchman Nee's three-volume book, The Spiritual Man, there is a section concerning spiritual warfare
Evan Roberts himself experienced considerable spiritual warfare, but what he experienced was only on an individual, personal level
At that time the church on this earth had failed to see that spiritual warfare is not an individual matter, but a Body matter
At that time, by the mercy of God, Brother Nee came to see the Body in a practical way and gave many messages on this matter
Verses 10 and 11: 'According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness
Now we have two wonderful verses, 12 and 13: 'Walk about Zion, and go round about her: count the towers thereof
If you have ever seen such a church life, you can understand why the Psalmist was so excited about the city of God
O set your heart on her bulwarks, O set your heart on her walls, O set your heart on her bulwarks, Consider her palaces
Praise waiteth for Thee Lord in Zion Praise waiteth O God for Thee Praise waiteth for Thee Lord in Zion For Zion is filled with Thee
How great the Lord is in Zion, How greatly to be praised, How great He is in that city Which over the earth is raised
O bless the Lord out of Zion, O let His praises swell, O bless the Lord out of Zion, Ye who in Jerusalem dwell
O tell it to all generations, O tell it to all who will come, O tell it to all generations, The Spirit and Bride say, 'Come'!
Following these three Psalms, we still have many wonderful and precious verses concerning the house and the city
One day, when we are all there in the New Jerusalem, we will exclaim, 'O Lord, now we are really in the perfection of beauty'!
While we are still in this old age, while we are still on this old earth, in my realization, the church is even now the perfection of beauty
He is going to build up the church, fill it with His glory, and grant the church His presence with abundant spiritual blessing
Many of us can testify how wonderfully the Lord has already done good in His good pleasure unto His church in this land
In Psalm 55:14, the Psalmist said that he 'took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company'
Perhaps you are in the local church now, and you sense that it is good, but you do not sense how wonderfully good it is
From now on, whenever you come to the meeting, do not bring two ears itching for teachings, but two lips ready for praise
In 2 Timothy 4:3 the apostle Paul said, 'The time will come when they will heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears'
Psalm 65:4 says that to dwell in God's courts and be satisfied with the goodness of His house is blessed by God
We must all bow before Him and say, 'Lord, it is Thy doing; it is all of Thee that we are in Thy building today and not outside of it'
The Lord has caused us to dwell in His courts, and now we may come to the house of God with praises of Christ as an offering
In all the local churches we need to be trained to praise Him that we may always have praise concerning Christ as an offering to God
We all need to beseech God to build the walls of the city that we may have the full safeguard in the local churches
We will see that in this Psalm we have firstly Christ, secondly the house, thirdly the city, Jerusalem, and fourthly the earth
When we come to the highest peak of all the Psalms, we only have Christ in the house within the city for the whole earth
The building up of Gods house is for the expansion of the city and the expansion of the city is for Christs reigning over the entire earth
God is moving on this earth, He is moving in and through His church, and He is moving with Christ as the center of the church
Verses 7 and 8 continue the thought of Gods move O God thou wentest forth before thy people thou didst march through the wilderness Selah
Many times in reading the Old Testament we are impressed only with the failures of God's people, the children of Israel
The dove is the Spirit, and the wings are the soaring power; so the spoils are the soaring power of the Spirit
From our human point of view, Jesus was put to death by human hands; but from the heavenly viewpoint it was He Himself who walked into death
While He ascended into the heavens He made such a show, such an exhibition, in His triumphant procession before the entire universe
It is as if, when Christ ascended to the Father with the train of vanquished foes, He said, 'Father, look at these foes defeated by Me'
The Father replied All right let Me take some of those foes let Me take Saul of Tarsus and this one in Los Angeles and that one in Houston
He had become exceedingly violent in persecuting Jesus, but when the Lord cast one look upon him he fell to the ground
You thought you were persecuting James, John, Peter, and Stephen, but you did not know that you were persecuting Me'
The Lord is transforming so many foes into gifts for His Body, and He is doing it that the Lord God might dwell among them
We are in the Church, the house of God; we are in the dwelling place where God dwells through the ascended Christ
Following this, the third point, the ascension of Christ, issues in the fourth point, the gifts for the building
Praise the Lord, now God has a house to dwell in, a dwelling place on this earth among men, even among the rebellious
In verse 5 we read, 'A father of the fatherless, and a protector of the widows, is God in his holy habitation'
Before you came into the church, you were solitary because you had no family, and you were desolate because you had no home
Verse 10: 'Thy flock found a dwelling place in it : thou, O God, didst prepare it in thy goodness for the needy'
The chariots of God are twenty thousands, even thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the sanctuary'
After God's dwelling place is built, we have the enjoyment in God's house of all that God is, all that God does, and all that God can do
God has defeated all His enemies: Bashan has been defeated by Him, the Egyptians have been drowned by Him in the Red Sea
The Lord had not yet revealed the way of preaching the Gospel as a church, the whole church preaching together
Verse 25: 'The singers went before, the players on stringed instruments after, in the midst of maidens playing on timbrels'
The women publish the glad tidings of victory; the women tarry at home and divide the spoil; and now the women praise
He is the One who works; He is the One who fights, and who has already won the battle; He is the One who does everything
There is little Benjamin in the lead, the princes of Judah with their company, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali'
In the Bible, Benjamin and Judah always go together; likewise, Zebulun and Naphtali are put together, especially in Matthew 4
Benjamin was the youngest and smallest of the twelve tribes, but the tribe of Benjamin was exceedingly strong and bold in fighting
By incarnation, Christ became the son of sorrow; He fought the battle, devoured the foes, divided the spoils, and gained the victory
From Genesis 49 we must go to Revelation 5, where we see the lion of the tribe of Judah, the One who is worthy of our worship, our praises
He is the victor He has the power and the authority He will come back as the peaceful One and we His brethren will worship and praise Him
The haven of ships is for transportation, and it signifies the Christ who is being spread throughout the entire earth
The last two names, Zebulun and Naphtali, signify the Christ who is being spread and propagated all over the earth
When we praise the Lord, we must praise Him for all He is, and we must also praise Him for His spreading throughout the earth
Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us out of thy temple'
We need God to make all that He has wrought for us so real to us, out of His church, out of His dwelling place
God has wrought everything for us, and now He would strengthen all that He has wrought for us out of His house
When we experience the strengthening of God in the local church, the church is transformed from a house to a city
Many souls, many persons, who will be released and brought by you into the local churches as presents to the Lord
O God, thou art awe-inspiring out of thy sanctuaries ; the God is he who giveth strength and power unto his people
The righteous shall rejoice With a loud, triumphant voice, Singing praises, singing praises, Singing praises unto God!
The lone have found a family, Here the desolate a home; Prisoners are brought from bondage To prosperity unknown
For the flock-what wondrous grace- God prepared this dwelling place: Hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah, Amen!
Now the Lord in mighty triumph Sends the news of victory; We the 'women' spread the tidings- 'Kings of armies flee, they flee'!
Lo, on high Christ hath ascended, Leading captives in His train; These as gifts He has perfected That the Lord may dwell with them
Blessed be the Lord forever: Day by day He loads with good, E'en the God of our salvation- Spread His worthy praise abroad
They have seen, O God, Thy goings In Thy holy dwelling place, Thy triumphal, high processions Midst a mighty voice of praise
Little Benjamin is leading, Then great Judah's company: Son of sorrow at God's right hand, Lion with the scepter see
Saints, thy strength has been commanded From the temple glorious; Still we pray that God may strengthen All that He has wrought for us
Psalm 72 is the last Psalm of Book II, and it ends in this way: 'Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things
Psalm 41 closes the first book of the Psalms, and its last verse says, 'Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting
In Book II something is added: it still says, 'Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel,' but it adds, 'who only doeth wondrous things
Something is mentioned in Book I, and then something more in Book II, until we reach Psalm 68, the peak of all the peaks
In Psalms 69 to 71 we mainly see the sufferings of Christ and how He behaves and expresses Himself in all His sufferings
He was one hundred percent for God's house, for He came to this earth with the express purpose of building it up
He was not only persecuted and crucified by man, but, because He suffered in our stead, He was smitten and wounded by God
Psalm 70, briefly, is the desire uttered by the Spirit of the suffering Christ in the expression of the suffering saint
Psalm 72 tells us how Christ shall reign over the whole earth and how the saints shall be glorified and blessed with Him
Even at the time when Christ returns for judgment, He will be like rain upon the mown grass, as showers that water the earth
He will be the King, not by exercising power to subdue others, but by supplying living water to satisfy the thirsty
Jerusalem in that day will be the center of the earth, and in the center of Jerusalem will be the house, from which the river flows
He shall live forever, the earth shall be restored because of Him, and men shall be blessed in Him and bless Him
Psalm 72 gives a glorious picture of what it will be like for the Lord to recover, possess, and reign over the earth
Only when we exalt Christ adequately and properly will the enjoyment of God's house and God's city be preserved and maintained
By keeping this in mind, we may realize how Book III is a further improvement in the progression of the Psalms
Something which has been built up something which has already existed and become so wonderful has been brought to desolation and destruction
Book III could never take the place of Book I, for without the building already established, there could be no desolation
According to Psalm 1, it is not the wicked and the ungodly who will prosper, but the godly saints, those who keep the law
If he would utter publicly, 'I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency,' he would not be faithful to God's children
According to the traditional teachings of Christianity today, there is absolutely no way to reconcile these two Psalms
Our spirit and the local church are the places where we receive divine revelation, where we obtain the explanation to all our problems
He realized that God was working to deprive him of all material things that he might enjoy God in such an absolute way
God's intention with the seeking saints is to remove all material blessings and all physical enjoyments that they may find everything in God
It is not a matter of keeping the law or of being right or wrong, but of having God and of keeping God as everything
Verse 4 answers: 'He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully'
If we read Psalm 73, we have these very matters mentioned: 'I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency'
To so many God-seekers, their personal sufferings mean very little, but the desolation of God's dwelling place affects them greatly
By reading Psalm 74 we partake of the feeling of hurt suffered by the saints for the desolation of God's house
The first part of this Psalm records the Psalmist's grief concerning the enemy's work of destruction upon God's house
Verses 7 and 8 tell us They have cast fire into thy sanctuary they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground
They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the places of assembly of God in the land'
If we concentrate on the local church, but neglect Christ Himself, we are in danger of allowing God's house to suffer desolation
May the Lord be merciful to us that we may heed this warning and give Christ His due honor, appreciation, and exaltation
The answer is in Psalm 75: Christ will come in to deal with the situation; He will come to judge the desolater
Lifting up comes not from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south, but from the north, because God is in the north
It is in God's dwelling place, in the local churches, that God defeats and destroys His enemy and smashes all his instruments of war
The desolaters of God's sanctuary are the mountains of prey, but Zion is more excellent and more glorious than all the desolaters
Do not forget that all these Psalms are written in poetic form; hence, we must understand them in a poetic way
In Psalm 73 we see the personal sufferings of the seeking saints, then in Psalm 74, the desolation of the house of God
Psalm 75 speaks of Christ's intervening to judge the desolaters, and Psalm 76 declares the victory of God in His dwelling place
They have come to know God's intention that they may enjoy Him in an absolute way and then enjoy the house of God
God's house has lain desolate for so long because they failed to give God's Anointed the proper and pre-eminent position
In Psalms 77 to 83 we are further impressed with the reason for the desolation of God's house and the way of recovery
After the desolation, God's dwelling place can only be restored by His people giving the pre-eminence to Christ
When Christ is given His rightful position, God will be able to take possession of the earth through the local churches
Since His doings are mysterious, we must get into the heart, the very center of all the situations to understand them
In Psalm 73, the Psalmist received revelation in the sanctuary; in Psalm 77, he finds the answer also in the sanctuary
Psalm 78 tells how God built His sanctuary among His people, in spite of their dishonesty, unfaithfulness, instability and failures
The Lord had abandoned the tabernacle, His dwelling place, as though He were sleeping; but now the Lord awoke as One out of sleep
The Lord chose a place and built up His sanctuary, exalted as high as the heights of the heavens and stable as the earth
O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps'
Notice in verse 15 that the word branch as in the King James version must be changed to son the son that thou madest strong for thyself
Psalm 80:17-19: 'Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself
Desolation has resulted from the loss of His proper position, and recovery will result from our rendering to Christ His due place
Suppose that two brothers of a local church in a certain city talk together in a critical way about the leading brothers of that church
We all must submit ourselves to His headship and say, 'None among us is anybody; You are the only One, Lord, who has the pre- eminence
Now every one of us, both the young brothers and sisters and the elder brothers and sisters, must give Him His due place
Never take the pre-eminence among the Lord's people in the local church; the pre-eminence must always be given to Christ
The first secret for us in maintaining the house of God and restoring it from desolation is to give the pre-eminence to Christ
At the beginning, the situation in that church was excellent, but then a problem arose due to these two sisters
If any of us, especially any of the sisters, fail to give the pre-eminence to the Lord, there will be desolation in the church
The church life will be restored if we will always say, 'We are nobody; Christ is the only One; we give Him the pre-eminence'
Psalms 81 to 83 tell how Christ will judge and inherit the earth, and how the enemy desires to take God's habitation in possession
In order to understand the Psalms we must enter the heart of the Psalmist and get into the spirit of all the seeking saints
That is why we have spent so much time to see what is in the heart of all the Psalmists and what is hidden in all the Psalms
In Psalms 81 through 83 there are not many crystals, but there are two points which indicate that God's intention is to inherit the earth
Gods intention is to give Christ His right position throughout the local churches and then through the churches to take over the whole earth
According to Psalm 83, God will surely do something to show His enemies that He alone is the most High over all the earth
One day through the local churches the whole universe will know that God alone is the most High over all the earth
In Book II we have reached the highest peak, with the house and the city as the stepping-stone for the Lord to regain the earth
How wonderful it is to be in the house and in the city, but we must realize that it is possible for this sweet enjoyment to be lost
After we have come to the local church and enjoyed it greatly, the stripping hand of God has come to take away many things
According to our experience, however, we can testify that, when we love the Lord, He begins gradually to strip us of many things
The second aspect of Book III is that among the Lord's children we must continually give Christ the pre-eminence
The right hand of God is the first place in the entire universe, and that is the position we must give Christ in the church life
After the stripping and desolation, in the recovery and restoration, the house of God is sweeter than ever before
In the church life there is the honeymoon period, and there is the period following many experiences and trials
In Psalm 84 we have a hint of the trials: 'Passing through the valley of weeping, make it a place of springs '
The altar in the holy place was the altar of incense, which signifies the resurrected Christ as our acceptance to God
The second item is the praising: 'Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be praising thee all the day long
Come into the local church and stay there for just two months, and you will see how easy it is to trust in God when you are in the meetings
The highways of Zion must be in our hearts: 'Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the highways to Zion'
Sometimes we have the concept that the matter of the church ground and the church practice are not matters of life
In other words, when you are out of the church way, you are erring, at least to some extent, in the way of spiritual life
When we are deeply in the inner life, we will certainly be in the way of the church; the highways to Zion will be within us
My burden in sharing all the verses of these Psalms is to point out the attitude you must take to go on in the church life
If you continue in the church way, you will go from strength to strength, and you will appear before God in Zion
Ezekiel 47 speaks of the measurement of a thousand cubits, and the millennium covers a period of a thousand years
If you go to a meeting which you consider poor and feel that you haven't gained anything from it, you may think it is better to stay home
If you want the fullest blessing, if you would turn one good day into a thousand, you must come to the local churches
Before we come to the end of Book III, we need to review the main points we have already covered in the Psalms
When we come to the second book, we have the deeper experiences of Christ; hence, the house is increased to a city
The second book continues by telling us that through further and deeper experiences of Christ, the house is increased to a city
In the house and in the city, we enjoy God with this house and city through the suffering, exalted and reigning Christ
In the first two books we have Christ, the house, and the city-this is the peak, the highest enjoyment, of the saints
When Christ is given His proper position in the church, we can continually preserve the church life at the peak
These leading Psalms present the main features of Book II solidly and adequately and bring us to the climax of enjoyment
In Psalm 73 we have seen how we need God as our unique portion, and in Psalm 80 we have seen how Christ must have the unique position
It has been recovered by the experience of God as our unique portion and by Christ being given the unique position
The gates are the places of coming in and going out: this is the communication, the fellowship, among God's people
How blessed to have brothers from one church visiting another, coming and going in sweet harmony and fellowship!
People may say that this man was born in Egypt and that one was born in Babylon this man was born in Philistia and that one was born in Tyre
Verse 5 tells us of this man and that man, including all the saints, but verse 6 records that this One, even Christ Himself, was born there
God has made Him His firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth , and He shall take the earth from the sea to the rivers
Psalm 87 is of Zion, the house and the city, and Psalm 89 is of Christ as the King who will possess the entire earth
Have you noticed that all the Psalms from Psalm 42 through Psalm 48-all these deeper and more precious Psalms-were not written by David
Notice now the authorship of Psalms 42, 45 through 48, 84, and 87, which include some of the deepest Psalms of Books II and III
Almost all of the deeper Psalms, the Psalms which are so sweet and precious to us, were written by the sons of Korah
The sons of Korah wrote Psalm 42:1, 'As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God'
The earth is the Lord's, and now He is coming to claim His legal right and title over the whole earth through Christ in the church
Not only are all five books of the Psalms in a wonderful sequence, but each separate Psalm within each book is in good and perfect order
Psalm 1 ends in this way: 'For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish'
A thousand years to Him are but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night-a mere two or three hours
If we are in such a position, we are those who are really working for God, and our work will be established by His hands
Verse 1 of this Psalm says, 'He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty'
Only by dwelling in God, by taking God as our habitation, and by letting His beauty be upon us, can we be filled with His praises
By combining these two portions, we see that to dwell in God as our habitation causes us to realize what the work of God is
Formerly we were afraid of this and afraid of that but after we came into the local churches we said Hallelujah our horns have been exalted!
The word for 'anointed' in verse 10 is the same as that in Leviticus 2:4 for 'mingled'-'unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil'
When God is our habitation in the local churches, we are like palms and cedars, so stately and secure, planted in the house of God
We flourish to such an extent that even when we are old, we still bring forth fruit; we are full of sap and green
These nine Psalms tell of the recovery of God's title over the earth through Christ in the house and the city of God
Other words in a similar vein are used as well such as the nations the heathen and the people or properly translated the peoples
The subject of this group of Psalms, as we have seen, is the enjoyment of God as our dwelling place, which makes us absolutely one with God
When we abide or dwell in the Lord and let Him abide or dwell in us, it means that we are absolutely and practically one with Him
We are identified with Christ: He and we, we and He, are one, as a great, universal, corporate man, taking God as his dwelling place
Psalms 93 through 97 have no titles Psalm 98 just Psalm Psalm 99 no title Psalm 100 just A Psalm of praise Psalm 101 A Psalm of David
Book II, however, reveals the house and the city in fullness, and at the end of this book, at its climax, we have the earth
In Psalm 94 He turns judgment to righteousness: 'But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it'
In the entire earth there is no judgment according to righteousness but when Christ comes to reign He will judge the earth in righteousness
He is a great King above all, and all the earth and the sea belong to Him: 'For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods
You see, the holy hill of God is really the beachhead to which Christ will return and from which He will reign over the whole earth
All the earth must enter into the gates of God with thanksgiving and into the courts of God with praise to serve Christ-Psalm 100:1-4
It is that God is coming to reign in Christ to recover His legal right in the whole earth for the fulfillment of His eternal plan
We have seen Christ already in the first section of Book IV: how He was identified with the saints in taking God as His dwelling place
We have also seen Christ in the second section of Book IV: how He is the King to reign over the entire earth for the recovery of God's title
Now at the end of Book IV, we have these five Psalms, Psalms 102 to 106, revealing something more concerning Christ
Verse 13 says, 'Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favor her, yea, the set time, is come'
It is through Zion, through the church, that the nations will turn to the Lord and the kings give glory to the Lord
Today we have the position, and we are in the position to understand this poetry and to have such an experience
The nations shall fear the Lord and all the kings give glory to the Lord, for He hath built up Zion and hath appeared in Zion in His glory
There are many verses in the Psalms which tell us that the house or the city of God is the place to praise the Lord
We had never met her before, and she had never met us, yet somehow she knew that we are the 'Hallelujah people'
It is due to Christ and the building up of the house of God that peoples will be gathered and the kingdoms will serve the Lord
We all must be turned from the religious concept of keeping the law to Christ Himself, that the house and the city may be built up
We may declare His name and His praise, the peoples will be gathered to serve Him, and God's legal right over the earth will be recovered
Notice now that by the end of Book IV the 'Hallelujahs' have begun, with the first instance at the end of Psalm 104
At the end of Psalm 106, that is, at the close of the entire Book IV of the Psalms, there is the fourth 'Hallelujah'
Now in Book IV, because the earth has been fully recovered by God, the Psalmists break forth with four 'Hallelujahs'
Hallelujah, Christ is here in the church as the house and the city, and the recovery of God's title over the earth has been accomplished
Book V, Psalms 107 to 150, indicates how the house and the city of God become the praise, safety, and desire of the saints
When we come to the last book of the Psalms, the temple has all but disappeared; but we do have the city as a high mountain
All together, there are more than twenty instances in the New Testament where Christ is referred to as sitting at the right hand of God
Verse 2: 'The Lord shall send the scepter of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies'
Verse 4: 'The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek'
He is the King-priest: the King to rule over the nations, and the Priest according to the order of Melchizedek to care for us
To understand fully the meaning of the order of Melchizedek, we must read Hebrews, chapters five, six, and seven
While Christ is on His way, while He is fighting through to defeat His enemies, He needs refreshment; He needs a living fountain
We are the dew to Him in the morning, and we are the brook to Him in the daytime, while He is on His way to fight with the enemy
The margin of the American Standard Version says, 'in the day of thy army,' and the Goodspeed translation has 'on your day of war'
He is a Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but in the power of an endless life
We do not realize how much He prays for us, how much He is sustaining us all the day long, by being our Priest
It is clear, by combining all these six points, that Psalm 110 is the highest peak in the revelation of Christ
He is the King, He is the Victor, He is the Warrior, He is the Priest, and He is the Coming One-at least these five items
These praises are 'in the assembly and in the congregation' ; 'in the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem
Included within Christ as the cornerstone are His resurrection, His ascension, His enthronement, and His ordination
In another sense, He is also the Builder; but the point upon which we must now focus is that He Himself is the material for the building
The house of Israel was made to know that God had made the stone whom they had rejected the head of the corner
The resurrection, the exaltation, the setting of Christ at the right hand of God and making Him the chief cornerstone is the Lord's doing
At that time the people laid their garments before Him and shouted, 'Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord'!
It is divided into twenty-two sections, each of eight verses, and each beginning with a different letter of the Hebrew alphabet
The author of this Psalm was one hundred percent immersed in the concept of the law, but within His utterance there is the utterance of God
All the verses indicated at the beginning of the chapter show the difference between this Psalm regarding the law and Psalm 1
In this sense, the law is the testimony as a type of Christ, for Christ is the expression of God, the full revelation of all that God is
Verse 4: 'Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord'
The peace is within the walls, and the prosperity is within the palaces, and both are within the local churches
As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever'
Others say that these Psalms were used extensively by the captives when they returned from Babylon unto Jerusalem
Neither should we forget Psalm 122 in the second section of Book V, the Psalms of ascension-it is the first precious one in this group
The turning of their captivity was like a dream because it was too good, too great, too wonderful, and it occurred so quickly
He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for scattering, shall come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him'
After the first group returned from captivity unto Jerusalem, there should be another group to follow them out of captivity
If we do, it will not be long before more captives will be brought into the church life just as the bundles of sheaves
Psalm 1271 Except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain
From all the captivity, from all the failures, we have come to know the Lord, we have learned to put our trust in Him'
Now let us go on to Psalm 128:5, 'The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life'
Even when the ark was returned to the children of Israel, it was not yet put into its proper place, the tabernacle
He said that he would not enter his house until the Lord could find a habitation; he would not take sleep until the Lord should find rest
In the local churches we have the horn, the lamp, and the crown; and here we see the enemies put to shame day by day
After such a wonderful Psalm as Psalm 132, we see a wonderful church life, the wonderful life of the brethren living together in unity
It is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aarons beard that went down to the skirts of his garments
Sometimes when we are in the meetings late in the evening, we experience the refreshing dew as in the dawn of the morning
It is not only as ointment upon the Body of Christ, but also as heavenly dew upon the local churches for our enjoyment
The beauty, the joy, and the blessing of the unity of God's people are with the Body of Christ and in the local churches
The last verse of Psalm 134 is the answer the reply of the priests to the people The Lord that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion
With all these main Psalms and main points as a background, we come to the next group of psalms in Book V, Psalms 135 to 145
In these, the saints' praise to God in the house and the city of God eventually turns to the reigning Christ and His Kingdom
In Psalm 134 we have, 'The Lord bless thee out of Zion,' but in Psalm 135 we have, 'Blessed be the Lord out of Zion'
The Psalmist here gives thanks to the Lord, the God of gods, and the Lord of lords, for His mercy endureth for ever
Though we had attempted to be led into captivity, unless He had allowed it, it could not have been accomplished
If we have never fallen and been brought back, we have never tasted the sweetness of the Lord's mercy in restoring us
Just recall all your experiences throughout the past two years, and you will taste something of this sweetness
There they were at some other rivers; they were not drinking at the river of the house of God, the river which makes glad the city of God
Verse 7: 'Remember, O Lord, against the children of Edom, the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof'
Verse 8: 'O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rendereth unto thee as thou hast meted out to us'
After the house and the city have been established, all the kings of the earth praise the Lord when they hear the words of His mouth
In the meantime, while the saints were praising concerning the house and city of God, they were still in the enjoyment of God
We have read Psalm 136, verses 1 to 3, concerning giving thanks unto the Lord, the God of gods and the Lord of lords, for His enduring mercy
We cannot tell how many thoughts the Lord has toward us, and all of them are so exceedingly great and precious
Praise the Lord, if we are under His good Spirit, He will continually lead us to an even land, a plain country
Even though we may be subjected to some form of suffering on one hand, we will be balanced on the other hand by our enjoyment of God
Now verse 21: 'My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever'
In verse 10 the Psalmist gives the reason for his praise: 'The Lord shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations
He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him
We must be even more loud in extolling Him, 'for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven'
Let them sing aloud upon their beds-in the night, not only in the day; in the bedroom, not only in the living room or in the meeting hall
A voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great
Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad and give glory to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready
To her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, bright and pure: for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints
We have also seen that the picture given us by the book of Psalms is exactly the same as that portrayed by the entire Bible
Christians before the last century had gone to one extreme: they said that the temple and city of ancient times were the church
Then the Brethren went to the other extreme, saying that the temple and the city had nothing to do with the church
How may we prove that the building up of the temple and the city in the Old Testament are types of the building up of the church?
The purpose of Christ's ascending on high and receiving gifts was that the dwelling place of God might be built up
In many instances the Psalms do not specifically mention the house, but instead they refer to Zion, the holy hill, or the holy mountain
We have seen the aspects of Christ and the church as the house in the Psalms; now let us consider the aspects of the church as the city
In other churches we sense not only the presence of God, but also something of divine government and heavenly authority
God's enemy is still usurping the earth to frustrate God's purpose; hence, the struggle between God and Satan is over this earth
His full and longing desire is to step into the earth, but there is as yet no stepping-stone; there is no place where He may put His feet
From the beginning of the last century to about 1930 the Gospel was brought to nearly every corner of the earth
Undoubtedly, He must recover the practical building up of His local churches in many places with so many believers as the materials
In this day, before His soon coming, He must have such a building on this earth, at least in all the leading cities
The house enlarged the city is; The joy of all the nations 'tis, The place for God to rule is this On Zion's holy hill
Break forth and sing for joy, Break forth and sing for joy, All nations will proclaim His worth, Break forth and sing for joy
