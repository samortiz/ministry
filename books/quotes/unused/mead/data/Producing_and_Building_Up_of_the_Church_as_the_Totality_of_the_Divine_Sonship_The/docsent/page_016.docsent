   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWTH AND TRANSFORMATION PRODUCING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Transformation spontaneously results in the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the more we desire to come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is not an organization or a social gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is an organism built up by the transforming work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As natural persons, we are clay Gen 2:7; 2 Cor 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to be supplied with Christ in order to be transformed into precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By becoming precious stones, we are spontaneously built together 1 Cor 3:2, 6, 9-12a .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As clay we can never be built up, but the more we become precious stones, the more we are built up by growing together Eph 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a finger is broken, the way for it to be built again into the body is to grow together with the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why the building in the church is so solid.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This building is constituted of the believers in Christ not merely placed together but growing together.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we grow together, nothing can divide us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, Christ is a living stone, and we who come to Him also are living stones 1 Pet 2:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That the stones are living means that they are growing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the way the building is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this building there are the riches of life, the beauty of life, the expression of Christ, and the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the proper church life, and this is the preparation of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation 2:17 says, To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and to him I will give a white stone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this verse there are the hidden manna as the nourishing element and the white stone as the building material.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we eat Jesus as the hidden manna, we will be transformed into white stones for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First Peter 2:2-5 expresses the same concept.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verses 2 and 3 say, As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation, if you have tasted that the Lord is good.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To taste the Lord is to eat, drink, and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This causes us to become living, growing stones to be built up into a spiritual house v. 5 . This house is not a physical building but a building produced by the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the way that the church is built up and the bride is prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must all have the vision that the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ is now dwelling in us with all His attainments, accomplishments, and riches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we simply need to open to Him by calling on His name, praising Him, and singing to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more we do this, the more we eat Him, drink Him, and breathe Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way His element is added to and wrought into our being, causing an organic change, a metabolic transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This transformation spontaneously causes us to grow together with others, which is the genuine building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the work of the indwelling Christ revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is by this indwelling work that the church is built up and the bride is prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mere teachings cannot replace this work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why we do not care to have regulations and forms.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We care only to open ourselves to Christ and receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the life-giving Spirit, the all-inclusive pneuma, the fresh air.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we breathe Him in, we receive His element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Teaching cannot cause people to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A mother and a father should not try to teach a newborn baby to grow to be six feet tall.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The way of teaching is the way of today s religion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the church we do not teach people how to behave.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We simply nourish people, helping them to eat Christ day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to eat Christ, we should not only read the Word; we must also eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Jeremiah 15:16 says, Your words were found and I ate them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus also said, Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God Matt 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christianity has made the Bible a book of knowledge, but the Bible must be a book of nourishment to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to eat the word by calling on the Lord and pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may pray-read Genesis 1:1, for example, by saying, O Lord Jesus, in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Oh, in the beginning!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the beginning God created the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Oh, He created the heavens and the earth!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By pray-reading in this way, we open ourselves up, and the living Christ adds more of Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To pray-read in the morning is to have a good breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Day after day we can eat and drink Jesus, and all day long we can breathe Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This will cause us to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all need to put this into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It will change our whole life, concept, and view, because Christ is living, real, and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ the processed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before Christ was incarnated, He was the raw Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, He was processed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now this processed and living Christ, who is seated in the heavens, comes into our being as our nourishment to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>His transforming work builds us up together so that we can have the church life and become His bride prepared for His coming back.</S>
