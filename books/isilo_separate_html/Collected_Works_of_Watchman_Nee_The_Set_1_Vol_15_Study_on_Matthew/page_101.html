Revelation 4:1-4. The advocates of this school think that (1) Revelation 2 and 3 refer to today's church age, (2) Revelation 4:1 refers to the church, (3) the twenty-four elders in Revelation 4:4 signify the church's being raptured and glorified, and (4) Revelation 5 and 6 then go on to mention the beginning of the great tribulation.</P><P>But Revelation 4:1 does not address the whole church; it addresses only John when it says, "Come up here." This is an accomplished fact that occurred on the island of Patmos. Otherwise, Philip's being caught away in Acts 8:39 would indicate that he also was raptured.</P><P>As to the twenty-four elders being the glorified church, this is truly nonsensical because: (1) Twenty-four is not the number of the church, but seven and multiples of seven are numbers referring to the church-for example, the seven churches. (2) There is no place in the Bible where elders signify the church. In the church and among the Jews there are elders, but not every believer is an elder. God first created the angels, then selected the Jews, and finally gave grace to the church. How can elders be taken to be the church? (3) In Revelation 4 and 5 the elders are sitting on thrones and are crowned with crowns of gold, and Christ is standing. Since the thrones and crowns of gold are symbols of kingship, can it be that the church was glorified before Christ was glorified? (4) Some say that the white robes that the elders wear refer to the righteousness of the Lord, and that they were washed in the Lord's blood. However, in the Bible there is no record that says that the robes of the elders were washed by the blood. Because of sin our robes need to be washed white by the precious blood, but the twenty-four elders never sinned. (5) These elders never sang the song of salvation for themselves. In chapter four they sang of God's creation. In chapter five they did sing the song of salvation, but they were not referring to themselves. They were referring to the redeemed ones. Several versions of the Bible translate the passage in verse 9 as "redeemed us." This translation is wrong. The word "us" should be "men." It is absurd for the church to sing a song referring to God saving others. (6) Revelation 4 does not speak concerning the church, the Gentiles, or the Jews, but refers to the universe. Thus, the elders there are the elders of the universe. The church is not the elders of the universe. (7) According to Revelation 5:8 the church cannot bring man's prayer to the presence of God. (8) In Revelation 7:13, if John also is part of the church, then it becomes the church asking the church. (9) Since John addressed the elders as "Sir," or "My lord," obviously John's position is inferior. If the twenty-four elders are the church, since John is a patriarch, he would be the elder among the elders. (10) The number twenty-four is interpreted literally; it is not a symbol. Since one among the elders spoke with John, how could one twenty-fourth of the church speak with John? Since the number is fixed, the elders also are fixed. The twenty-four elders are in fact the archangels who govern the universe. Even under Satan there are princes and rulers.</P><P>D. These say, "Do not 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and 17 refer to the rapture?" Of course they refer to the rapture, but they do not say at what time. They mention the fact of the rapture but not the time of the rapture. This cannot prove that the rapture is before the tribulation.</P><P>E. First Corinthians 15:50-52 shows that both the dead and the living will be raptured. This refers to the fact of the rapture, but it does not say that the rapture will be before the tribulation. On the contrary, it proves that the rapture will be after the tribulation, at the time of the last trumpet, which equals the seventh trumpet in Revelation 11:15. Some say that according to the Roman custom, the trumpet was blown three times, and therefore the last trumpet would be the third trumpet. This is wrong, because the Holy Spirit does not borrow the Roman way in giving revelation. There is no connection and it is meaningless.</P><P>F. These argue that in Luke 21:36 the Lord clearly promised that the church can escape the great tribulation and "stand before the Son of Man," which, to them, is the rapture. But here this promise is conditional. It is not conditioned on salvation by regeneration; it is conditioned on watching and praying. If one is accounted worthy after he watches and waits, it becomes a promise conditioned on watching and praying. Not everyone in the whole church is watching and praying. We need to pay attention to this.</P><P>G. Revelation 3:10 is, for these ones, the strongest reason. But here it is also a conditional promise. One cannot say that, based on this, all will be raptured before the tribulation. In the church not everyone will follow the word of the endurance of Christ. What does "the word of My endurance" mean? Today men revile the Lord, curse Him, and deny Him. Yet the Lord does not send lightning from heaven to kill them. The Lord does not punish them. This is the word of the endurance of Christ in this age. Today we endure together with Christ; we do not resist. Is it really possible that everyone keeps this word of endurance? If this is so, then all the believers can be raptured; if it is not so, then not all the believers can be raptured before the tribulation. And if this is the argument, then it follows that the whole world will be saved according to John 3:16. But they forget the condition in John 3:16, "every one who believes into Him." The promise of the Lord here in Revelation 3:10 was to the whole church in Philadelphia. They say that since Philadelphia is a representation of the church, the whole church will therefore be raptured before the tribulation. At that time in Asia Minor there were the seven churches, but this promise of the Lord was spoken only to one of the seven. Thus, Philadelphia cannot represent all the churches. Otherwise, the overcomers in the other six churches could not be raptured and would have no hope of being saved from the tribulation.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_100.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_102.html">Next</a> </body></html>
