<P>When we believe in God, spontaneously we will not worry and strive. We will not do these things; this is the negative works of faith. The negative works of faith are important and necessary, but they are not complete. After one has faith, he still needs the positive works of faith. We have previously mentioned that there are things that we should not do. Now, through the power of God, there are things that we should do. Our positive works must match our faith. Furthermore, these works complete our faith, and we receive the promised blessings of God much sooner. This is not a matter of hastiness in the flesh, but an expression of the strength of the power in the spirit. God would like to give us what we need immediately. But, if the death of our natural life is not substantial and deep enough, an immediate answer would strengthen our soul-life. Until our own life has lost all possibility of being active again, God has to delay what He has long promised. Positive works are a death-blow to our self-life and an expression of the vigor of spiritual strength. Therefore, they will accelerate the accomplishment of God's promises. What are the positive works of faith? They are to walk and act as if we have received God's promises. In other words, we believe that something is already accomplished and behave as if it is already accomplished. Let us consider a few matters.</P><P>Suppose you are sick. God may give you a personal promise that you will be healed. On the negative side, you should rest in God's work and not disturb His work by any human means. Rather, you should commit yourself to the hand of the Almighty without worry or concern. On the positive side, there are important steps that you should take. You should walk as if you are a healed person. You do not have to wait until you are really healed before you can consider yourself healed. When God gives you the faith to believe that you are healed, at that moment you are healed. If you are healed, you should act like you are healed. Therefore, when you receive faith, you should ask, "How should I act if I am a healed person who has been restored by God? Should I lie on my bed for a long time, or should I stand up to walk?" You should walk as if you are a healed person. However, this must be done after you have received a promise from God and must be carried out in complete reliance on God. Otherwise, the result will be a failure.</P><P>The same is true in regards to trusting in God for our living. Although sometimes we may be in great want, what we look toward is a fountain and not a bucket. We should not worry or be tempted to borrow (Rom. 13:8). In the God-ordained principle of giving, we should still be very generous. If we trust in God when we are in trials, we should not tell others, hint at help from others, or resort to other methods. We should live as if nothing has happened. Other matters such as peace within the family, occupations, livelihoods, sufferings, dangers, and other similar matters should follow the same principle. We have to know that God is not only interested in our spiritual affairs; He is equally concerned with the many matters related to our physical being. This is the characteristic of faith: faith does not wait until something is done before believing, because then there is no need to believe anymore. Faith is exercised before something is accomplished and believes, based on God's promises, that it has already been accomplished. The Lord Jesus' teaching concerning faith is, "Believe that you have received them, and you will have them" (Mark 11:24). Faith is not believing after receiving. Rather, it is believing, before ever receiving, that one has received. This is the most profound aspect of the law of faith. Nevertheless, we have mentioned that faith must be expressed through works. Therefore, when one believes that he has received, he should act as if he has received.</P><P>Such work is very spontaneous. The eyes of faith do not see dark clouds in the sky. Rather, they see an unchanging sun above the dark clouds. Physical eyes can only see the present darkness, but the eyes of faith can see the light. They do not imagine; they actually see. Is not the light they see more real than the darkness the world sees? Faith despises all dangers, sufferings, and trials, for it knows what the end will be. The work of faith is not a risk but a sure and practical act. It sees what others do not. Although others may consider such acts dangerous, these "dangers" have been well thought through, prayed about, promised by God, and taught by the Scriptures. If a person has not received the teaching of the Scriptures or the promise of the Holy Spirit in his spirit, forcing himself to do such acts is indeed a risk. But for a believer who has truly received God's revelation and has faith, these acts are spontaneous and unpretentious because they are the most natural result of his faith. Although many believers have never heard these teachings yet, God has been leading them this way already. If the work of our faith is something conscious, artificial, and pretentious, we have not yet learned the lesson of faith. Although all the works of faith are beyond human reason, they are carried out according to the principle of one's living. This one has received God's promise and knows what is going to happen. Therefore, he acts ahead of others. The works of faith are often the works that glorify God.</P>
