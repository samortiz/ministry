   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXAMPLES OF READING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some may understand this fellowship in theory, but they do not know how to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They may not know how to restrict their mind and exercise their spirit, allowing it to take the lead when they read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A brother may be touched in his inner being and moved when he reads Romans 4:17, which says that God gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then he may immediately exercise his mind to understand this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is pursuing the doctrine of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because he does not realize the weakness of the mind, he is unconsciously distracted even though he had a good beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although his mind may have more ideas, his spirit is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The proper way for a person to read the Bible is to guard his thoughts when touched by a verse.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A person should not ask what it means to give life to the dead or to call the things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, he should simply eat the Word and receive it into his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He should immediately exercise his spirit to pray, saying, Lord, You give life to the dead, and You call the things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I thank You that You are inside me and have become everything to me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When he prays in this way, he is contacting God with his spirit rather than considering doctrines with his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He might not understand much, but his spirit has eaten and enjoyed God because he has touched God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is what it means to read the Bible with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we read the Bible, we must guard ourselves against arguing over doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will not touch God if we study doctrines, because we are exercising our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If something touches our spirit, we must control our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is true that when reading a verse we may be led to consider a second verse.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, this must be initiated by the Spirit; we should not initiate it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must control our thoughts and not consider doctrine when we read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, we should exercise our spirit, and turn the word that has touched us into prayer so that we can breathe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While we are praying and breathing, the Spirit may point out our true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When reading Romans 4:17, the Spirit may point out that we are dead and that we are in a state of not being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should respond immediately and pray, God, that is right!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am in a dead condition, a condition of not being !</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But I praise and thank You because the deadness and the nothingness afford a basis for Your resurrection life to abound.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In such a prayer we are not exercising our mind; rather, we are taking the Word as food and eating it with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way we will discover that God is the element within this food.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are contacting and enjoying God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In another situation the Holy Spirit may point out that instead of being dead and nothing, we are alive and full of many things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have not died and have not been brought to the point of nothingness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For this reason, God cannot work in us; He cannot manifest the power of resurrection within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may respond, Lord, be merciful to me!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have not been brought to the point of death, to absolute desperation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I still have my natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am neither like Abraham nor like Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not need to memorize these prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such prayers will be given to us by the Spirit as we breathe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is different from merely studying doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a verse touches us, we should digest it with our spirit and turn it into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we pray in this way, and the Spirit speaks to us, we should again turn the words into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the end, we will be inwardly satisfied even though we may not understand much doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brothers and sisters, this is a crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do not practice this, we will not eat much God when we read the Bible; we will not receive much genuine supply in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may be familiar with the Bible, knowing how one verse relates to another, but our spirit will be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We will not have received the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, we must always guard against our mind when we read the Word to enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must guard against studying doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must exercise to be limited by our spirit, and we must exercise our spirit to breathe in God by means of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should pray and digest the words of the Bible with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we read a portion that we do not understand, we should let it go.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even if we understand what we read, we should not consider it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether or not we understand a passage, we should not spend time to consider it; rather, we should restrict our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not dwell on our thoughts, nor should we try to understand too much.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These are the activities of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must learn to be restricted by our spirit even when we understand what we are reading.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should exercise our spirit and turn the Word into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this way, we will enjoy God through the Word.</S>
