<p>As we drink of the Spirit and enjoy Him, we will be filled with Him as the essential Spirit of God. Acts 13:52 says, &ldquo;And the disciples were made full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This infilling of the Holy Spirit is essentially for life, not for power. Joy, being a matter of life, not of power, proves this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ANOINTED BY THE ALL-INCLUSIVE COMPOUND SPIRIT AS THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</h2>
<p>The infilling Spirit anoints us as the all-inclusive compound Spirit, who is the compound ointment (1 John 2:27; Exo. 30:23-25). The compound ointment in Exodus 30 typifies the all-inclusive Spirit. This ointment is composed of oil compounded with four spices&mdash;myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. The olive oil typifies the Spirit of God. Myrrh typifies the precious death of Christ. Cinnamon typifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death. Calamus refers to the precious resurrection of Christ. Although it grows in a marsh, it is able to shoot up into the air, signifying the rising up of the Lord Jesus from the place of death. Cassia was used as a repellent to drive away snakes and insects and signifies the power, the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. This shows that the Triune God in His consummation has been compounded with His death, with the sweetness and effectiveness of His death, with His resurrection, and with the power of His resurrection.</p>
<p>The four kinds of spices are divided into three groups of five hundred shekels each. There are five hundred shekels of myrrh. The two spices listed in the middle, cinnamon and calamus, are two hundred and fifty shekels each. The last spice, cassia, is five hundred shekels. These three units indicate the Triune God. The middle unit of five hundred is split in two, signifying that the Son, the second of the divine Trinity, was split on the cross. It is marvelous that our Triune God is a compounded God as the anointing ointment.</p>
<p>Now the very Spirit of God is a compound Spirit that has become an ointment for anointing. Paint is a kind of ointment, and painting is like anointing. The more that something is coated with paint, the more the essence and element of the paint is applied to it. Likewise, the more that the compound Spirit anoints us, the more that the essence and element of God is painted into our being. When the Spirit as the compound ointment is being painted into us, we are becoming more organically united with the processed Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LED BY THE SPIRIT OF THE DIVINE SONSHIP</h2>
<p>Day by day and hour after hour, we are being led by this Spirit, which is the Spirit of the divine sonship (Rom. 8:14-15). We may like to be led by God and we may also pray, &ldquo;Lord, show me Your leading.&rdquo; But we need to realize that His leading is Himself. While He is anointing us, He as the anointing One is our leading. When Abraham was called by God, God did not tell him where to go (Heb. 11:8). The leading of God to Abraham was God&rsquo;s presence. If Abraham turned a certain way and missed the presence of God, he knew this was the wrong way. Abraham took God&rsquo;s presence as his traveling map, so the presence of God was his leading. Today our leading is the anointing Spirit. Our leading from the Lord must be organic; it must be something in the organic union.</p>
<p>In the past many young people came to me for counsel about marriage. I used to have many rules for the young people to follow in considering who they should marry. Eventually, I lost faith in my regulations. Only God fully knows who is the best wife for a brother and the best husband for a sister. In a matter such as choosing a mate, the young saints need to follow God&rsquo;s leading, which is the anointing. You have to go to the Lord. He is in you as the anointing compound Spirit. Do not consider in your mind who is the best person for you. You must follow the inner anointing. If the anointing is not there when you open to the Lord concerning a certain brother or sister, then that one is not the one you should marry. Only the omniscient God knows who the best spouse is for you. He can lead you to the right person. Once a person is married, he may feel that he made a mistake. But every so-called wrong marriage is a right one. The wife you think is the wrong one is actually the right one in God&rsquo;s feeling. She is the right one to put you on the cross. You have to say, &ldquo;Lord, thank You. I may have made a mistake, but You did the right thing.&rdquo; Even the decisions that we think are wrong were made under the sovereignty of God and will work for our good, our transformation.</p>
<p>The foregoing three items of the organic processes in the Spirit&mdash;being filled with the Spirit, anointed by the Spirit, and led by the Spirit&mdash;may be considered as a group. In the organic union, we have the infilling of the Spirit within us. This infilling Spirit becomes the anointing Spirit, anointing us all the time. This anointing becomes our leading, and we are led by the Spirit of the divine sonship.</p>
<p>All the items we have talked about in this chapter show that the Christian life and the church life are absolutely in the organic union. Everything done in the church must be in the organic union. In Acts 13 Barnabas and Paul were sent for the preaching of the gospel and the establishing of the local churches. But they were not sent in an organizational way. Five prophets and teachers were praying and fasting. To pray and fast before God is to get into the practical organic union. In that organic union, Paul and Barnabas were sent. They were sent organically, not organizationally. The organizational way has no life and no Spirit. The organic way is full of life and full of the Spirit. Even if we come to clean the hall, we must clean it organically in the organic union. This means that we have a living contact with the living God in the organic union of the living Spirit. To be an elder, a brother must be in the organic union. To be a deacon, a brother must be in the organic union. To speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, a brother must be in the organic union. The whole church is an organism in the organic union of the divine Trinity.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
