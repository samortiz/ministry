   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord Jesus must be warning the saved ones here by speaking about the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He cannot be warning the saved ones by speaking about the unsaved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose one has a maid and two daughters, and suppose this one were to say to the younger daughter, "Do you see that maid?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She is not born of me; I am beating her.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You have to be obedient today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you are not obedient, I will punish you in the same way I am punishing her."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is this word logical?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A maid is not born of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If she becomes disobedient, she may be beaten.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the daughter of the family is not a maid.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One cannot apply the way to deal with a maid to a daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The mother ought to say, "Last night I punished your sister because she was disobedient.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you are not obedient, I will punish you as well."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The mother must take the sister as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The maid cannot be used for a comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no reason for the Lord to use unsaved ones as an example to show the disciples that they ought to do God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If He did, the disciples would rise up and say, "They are the unsaved ones, but we are the saved ones."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If they were to say this, no one could say anything further.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What the Lord Jesus is saying is this: "Many people are God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are saved and are the same as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They call Me Lord,' and they have done many works.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But they are nevertheless shut outside the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason you must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have to do the will of God."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only in this way will the disciples know that though they do many works, if they do not do the will of God, they will receive the same punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If He were speaking to the unsaved ones, there would no longer be the piercing element to His word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord was warning us that only those who do the will of God can enter the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If one were to rely on his own work to come before God, the Lord Jesus would tell him, "I never knew you."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let me give you another example.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suppose a judge's son drives carelessly and hits another car.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is taken by the police to the court for a hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The judge would ask, "Young man, what is your name?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How old are you?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Where do you live?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The son down at the stand may think, "You should know all these things better than I do."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He may answer the first few questions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But after a while, he may shout to the father, "Father, don't you know me?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What should the judge do then?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He may bang his gavel and say, "I do not know you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In my home, I know you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But in the court, I never knew you."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If one sees the matter of the kingdom, he will realize that in the kingdom, it is not a matter of whether or not a person is saved and whether he is a child of God; what really matters is his work after becoming a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose after you are saved, you are very zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although you have not carried out God's will, you nevertheless prophesy, cast out demons, and do works of power in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you come before the Lord asking to be admitted into the kingdom because of these unprincipled works, the Lord will say that He never knew you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Why did the Lord say, "I never knew you"?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The next sentence explains: "Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please remember that the Lord did not tell them to depart from eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the original Greek the meaning of workers of lawlessness is people who do not follow the rules, keep the law, or abide by the regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the eyes of God, to do evil does not mean only to do bad things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It does not matter how much one has done; as long as he has not hearkened to God's demand, His judgment, and His sovereign arrangements, it is evil in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If this word "lawlessness" were translated as "evil," as some versions have done, many would have the ground to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The problem here is not a matter of doing evil, but a matter of being unprincipled.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What are the principles?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The principles are God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But what is God's word?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's word is God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you are not doing the will of God, no matter what you do, the Lord Jesus would say that you are lawless.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Those who do things according to their own self will have no part in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>My purpose in saying these things is to show you the importance of a Christian's works.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Bible shows us clearly that after a person believes in the Lord, though he will never lose eternal life, he may lose his place and glory in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we do not do the will of God, but work according to our own will instead, we will be shut out of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We may think that prophesying, casting out demons, and doing works of power are most important, because we think that if we can do these things, we will be a marvelous person.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But these things can never replace the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All those who have never learned not to work for God are not worthy to work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Those who do not know how to stop their own work surely know nothing about God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only those who know the will of God can stop working.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God wants us first to obey His will and then to work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God does not want us to volunteer to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The more one knows about the will of the Lord, the more he will learn not to work carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Thus, there is a big difference between working and doing the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today we may appreciate the works and may be interested in prophesying, casting out demons, and doing works of power.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But one day, many will be awakened.</S>
