<p>Jesus Christ gave Himself to us by dying on the cross and shedding His blood so that He can be the bread of life to us. But how can we receive Him as our life? How can we enjoy Him as the bread of life? In principle, we need to eat and drink Him. If we want to receive nourishment, we need to eat and drink. Likewise, if we want to receive Christ as the bread of life, we need to eat and drink Him into our being. On the cross His flesh and blood were separated so that we might eat and drink of Him and thus receive Him into our being. Eating and drinking is receiving. Receiving is believing. John 1:12 says, &ldquo;As many as received Him...to those who believe into His name.&rdquo; Hence, to believe into Jesus Christ is to receive Him, which is also to eat and drink Him. In John 6 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life&rdquo; (v. 54), and He also said, &ldquo;He who believes has eternal life&rdquo; (v. 47). This shows that to believe into Him is to eat His flesh and drink His blood. When we believe that Jesus Christ died and gave Himself up for us on the cross, we are eating His flesh. When we believe that He bore our sins and shed His blood on the cross, we are drinking His blood. When we believe that through death Jesus Christ gave Himself up for us, shed His blood, and bore our sins on our behalf, we are receiving Him into our being. Such believing by eating and drinking is to receive Him as our Savior and our life. If you believe in such a way, you receive Christ. Not only so, Christ enters into your being as your life for your enjoyment.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people still do not understand how Jesus Christ enters into our being when we believe in Him. They may still ask, &ldquo;How does Jesus come into us to be our food when we believe that He died and shed His blood for us? How can He become our life simply by our believing in Him?&rdquo; This is truly incomprehensible. It is more reasonable and easier to believe that Jesus Christ died for us on the cross and shed His blood to wash away our sins. Many people find it hard to understand that simply by believing in Jesus Christ, He will enter into them to be their life. In John 6 those who heard this word also said, &ldquo;This word is hard; who can hear it?&rdquo; (v. 60). They could not understand the meaning of the Lord&rsquo;s words. Therefore, the Lord Jesus said to them, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life&rdquo; (v. 63).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT GIVING LIFE</h2>
<p>Here the Lord Jesus made a turn to the Spirit. It is the Spirit who gives life. We receive life when we believe in the Lord Jesus, because He gives life to us through the Spirit and because He is the Spirit. We receive life when we believe that He gave Himself up for us on the cross and shed His blood, because when we believe, the Spirit enters into us to give us life. Therefore, the Lord said, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing&rdquo; (v. 63).</p>
<p>Christ is God becoming flesh to be our Savior so that we may receive Him as our life. On the cross Jesus Christ was crucified, and His blood was shed so that He might redeem us from our sins. Furthermore, on the cross He released His divine life for us to receive. Then He rose from the dead and became the life-giving Spirit so that He might enter into our spirit. Regardless of where a person may be, as soon as he believes in Jesus Christ, the Spirit will enter into him to be his life. This may be likened to a radio broadcast&mdash;as long as sound is turned into radio waves, any radio, no matter where it is, can receive the radio waves. Man can contact Christ in the Spirit, and Christ can become man&rsquo;s life as the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORDS BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2>
<p>Jesus Christ said that those who believe in Him have eternal life and that those who believe that He died and shed His blood have life. We have life by believing in Him because it is the Spirit who gives life. Where is the Spirit? How do we touch the Spirit? How does the Spirit give life? After saying that it is the Spirit who gives life, the Lord Jesus also said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (v. 63). The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;My words are the Spirit. When the Spirit enters into you, He is life. If you receive My words, you will touch the Spirit and receive life.&rdquo; Therefore, the Spirit who gives life is in the word of Christ. Through the word of Christ we can touch the Spirit and receive the life of Christ.</p>
<p>We cannot carry sounds with us, but we can record them on an audio tape. Wherever we take the audio tape, we also take the sounds. Whoever receives the audio tape also receives the sounds on the tape. The Spirit of Christ and the life of Christ are contained in His word. I cannot give you the Spirit of Christ and the life of Christ, but I can speak the word of Christ. When you receive this word, believing this word in your heart, the Spirit of Christ and the life of Christ will enter into you. Sounds are abstract, but when they are recorded on an audio tape, they become concrete. In the same way, the Spirit and the divine life are abstract, but in the word of Christ, they become concrete.</p>
<p>As long as you receive the word of Christ in your heart, His Spirit will enter into you, and you will receive His life. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst&rdquo; (v. 35). He also said, &ldquo;He who believes has eternal life&rdquo; (v. 47). Simply grasp one sentence, and you will receive the Spirit and the divine life. You may say, &ldquo;Lord, I receive You as my bread of life.&rdquo; Or you may tell Him, &ldquo;Lord, I come to You. I believe in You. I believe what You say.&rdquo; Then the Spirit with His life will immediately enter into you.</p>
<p>The words of Christ are spirit and life because Jesus Christ is God, and God is the Spirit and life. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; The Word is Christ. He is God becoming flesh. Therefore, He is the Spirit and life. Jesus Christ is God, the Spirit, and life. Thus, the words that He speaks must also be the Spirit and life.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ died for you on the cross. He has released His life so that you may receive His life. He shed His blood to cleanse you from your sins. He has done everything for you. If you believe that He died for you and shed His blood for you, you will eat Him. In other words, you will receive Him into your being by eating His flesh and drinking His blood. As soon as you believe, the Spirit and the divine life will enter into you, and He will become your life. As evidence, He has given you His word; you can hold on to His word. His words are Spirit and life. As long as you hold on to His word, the Spirit and the divine life will be yours. As soon as you believe in His word, you receive the Spirit and the divine life. It is the Spirit who gives life. The Spirit is in His word. If you believe in His word, you will receive the Spirit, and the Spirit will give you life. You can trust His word. People often say that you need to trust their words. If you have their word, they are obligated to you. Christ has given you His word as something that you can hold on to. If you hold on to His word, you will gain Him. His word is Spirit and life. When you believe and receive His word, you will receive the Spirit and the divine life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
