   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Part of our upcoming winter training will be a crystallization-study of the Lord's organic salvation in Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 5:10 says, "For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should pray-read this verse and then study it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The subject we refers to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At one time we were God's enemies, but we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The death of God's Son was for our judicial redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The salvation in Christ's life is for our organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to study these points and then recite them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we will be equipped to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should prophesy with what we can recite; what we can recite is what we have studied; and what we have studied is what we have pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not pray-read, study, or recite, we cannot prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have encouraged people to prophesy in the Lord's Day meeting, but they still claim that they do not know what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now we have a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we pray-read, study, and recite the points of the outlines released in our crystallization-study of the Word, we will surely prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Who cannot prophesy?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who do not pray-read the outline, who do not study the outline, and who do not recite the outline.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we practice PSR pray-reading, studying, and reciting each day, from Monday through Saturday, we will surely prophesy in the Lord's Day meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before giving this message, I studied Philip's encounter with the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verses 32 through 35 say, "Now the passage of Scripture which he the eunuch was reading was this: 'As a sheep He was led to slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so He does not open His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In His humiliation His judgment was taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who shall declare His generation?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For His life is taken away from the earth.'</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And the eunuch answered Philip and said, I beseech you, Concerning whom does the prophet say this?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Concerning himself or concerning someone else?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture he announced Jesus as the gospel to him."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was Philip's preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This account in Acts 8 shows that the practice of PSRP is not our new way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was in the Bible already, in Acts 8.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The way Philip answered the eunuch and preached Christ to him as the gospel surely indicates that Philip had studied that portion of Isaiah 53, which the eunuch quoted to him, and that he had remembered that portion so that he could preach Christ as the gospel as a kind of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If he were not familiar with that portion of the holy Word, how could he have preached Christ as the gospel according to that portion?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His preaching was a real prophesying of the holy Word with which he had become familiar.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If anyone comes to the Lord's Day morning meeting without being prepared to prophesy, this indicates he was lazy for the whole week.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Throughout the week, he did not pray-read, study, or recite.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If he had practiced this, he would be able to prophesy on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After reading the fellowship in this message, we may feel that the standard in the church is too high.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In a sense, this is true because we are in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not want to remain in degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those in Catholicism are required only to attend mass.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They do not have to function.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those in Protestantism mostly listen to sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are not required to speak for the Lord in their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord's recovery is different.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All of the members of Christ's Body should be functioning members who speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why we need to practice PSRP.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to pray-read, study, and recite the points we have studied.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then spontaneously our pray-reading, studying, and reciting will become our prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many of us like to hear certain brothers who are good speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This shows that it is not easy to change our mentality, because it is still affected by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The apostle John's writings are composed of revelations in visions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only the New Testament writers have received such revelations in visions from God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They wrote down what they saw in the New Testament, and this has been passed on to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to interpret what they saw.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In our crystallization-study of John 1, we pointed out that the Word who was God became flesh vv.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the flesh He became the Lamb v. 29 , and then in resurrection He became the dove v. 32 . Nathanael recognized Him as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord then revealed to Nathanael that He was not only the Son of God but also the Son of Man, on whom the angels of God would ascend and descend vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>49-51 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to study these points, recite them, and then we will be able to speak them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By taking this way, we will be equipped to nourish people with the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
