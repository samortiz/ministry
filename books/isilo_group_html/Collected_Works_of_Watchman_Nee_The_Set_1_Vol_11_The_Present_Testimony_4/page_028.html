Let us go on to see how Christ's redemption solves God's two problems.</P><P>(1) Christ's redemption has dealt with the rebellious Satan. What overcomes Satan is not the cross but the blood. Satan knew that if his poison were injected into the first couple, this poison would spread to all their descendants. Satan committed spiritual fornication with our forefather and put this sinful poison of lying into his soul. The life of the soul is in the blood. Man's life is passed on through the blood (Acts 17:26). Consequently, the sinful poison of this first couple has passed on to us through the blood.</P><P>Christ's blood has no poison; it is precious and incorruptible. He bore the sins of many on the cross and died, emptying all of His blood. When He resurrected from the dead, He was without blood. After His resurrection He had bones and flesh, but no blood. "He poured out His soul unto death" (Isa. 53:12). In Christ, our blood has been poured out. Satan has no ground to work in us. Christ's blood has destroyed and dealt with Satan and all he has.</P><P>(2) Christ's redemption has dealt with man's sins. Our sins need Christ's death. The substitutionary death of Christ abolished all the records of our sins before God. The representative death of Christ, the Head, has delivered us from our sins.</P><P>Christ's death accomplishes God's two goals and solves God's two problems. This is Christ's victory. This victory has already been accomplished. God keeps us on the earth to maintain this victory and to preach it to every creature (Col. 1:23). Our baptism and the breaking of bread are to display the victory of Christ's death to the angels, the devil, the nations, and all things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Goals of Redemption</H2><P>The goals of Christ's redemption are that we be His particular people (Titus 2:14) and living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1), that we would live to Him and die to Him (Rom. 14:7-9), that we would be the temple of the Holy Spirit glorifying God (1 Cor. 6:19-20), that we would live to Him (2 Cor. 5:15), and that whether through life or through death, Christ would be magnified in our body, so that for us to live is Christ (Phil. 1:20-21).</P><P>The goal of redemption is to give Christ the first place in all things. In order that Christ may have the first place in all things, He must first have the preeminence in us. We are the firstfruit among all things. First we must be subjected to Christ, then all things can be subjected to Christ. The cross enables God to reach this goal in us. The cross makes us decrease and makes Christ increase. The cross will find room for Christ and will ensure that Christ has the first place. God works through the cross, which in turn works through the environment to dig into us deeply, causing us to know Christ and be filled with Him, so that Christ may have the first place in us. Christ's redemption has accomplished God's plan before the foundation of the world. This plan is to give Him the first place in all things. We should forget about our personal interests and care only for the accomplishment of God's eternal destiny which is to have Christ gain the first place in all things. When we see the Messiah, we will cast away our waterpot! When we see God's Christ, we will cast away everything!</P><P>(Morning, January 27)</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 11: The Present Testimony (4) &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
