<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The People Who Walked<br>in the Darkness Having Seen a Great Light</H2><P>Isaiah 9:2 says, "The people who walked in the darkness / Have seen a great light;/Upon those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death/Light has shined." This prophecy was fulfilled in Matthew 4. When Christ came to Galilee, the people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, light sprang up (v. 16).</P><P>The fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah 9:2 is continuing even today. Jesus is still visiting the "Galileans"; He is still visiting "Galilee," the despised region, to gain the despised people. Therefore, to be in Galilee is to be blessed. If those who occupy high positions in society would be saved, they must become those who are in the despised region of Galilee.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Lord Multiplying the Nation</H2><P>Isaiah 9:3 goes on to say, "You have multiplied the nation; / You have increased their gladness;/They are glad before You as with the gladness of harvest,/As men rejoice when they divide spoil." This prophecy refers to Peter, John, James, and all the early apostles, and it also concerns us. We are the farmers in the harvest and the fighters gaining the spoil. This refers to the increase, spread, and growth of Christ on earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Lord Breaking the Yoke of Their Burden</H2><P>Verse 4 continues, "For You break the yoke of their burden /And the staff on their shoulder,/The rod of their oppressor,/As in the day of Midian." This indicates that Christ as the great light is breaking the yoke that has been upon us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. All the Boots of Those Who<br>in Boots Trample in the Battle Quaking</H2><P>Finally, verse 5 says, "For all the boots/Of those who in boots trample in the battle quake/And the garments/Rolled in blood/Are for burning;/They are fuel for fire." This indicates that a battle is going on. Today Christ is fighting, and we, His followers, are also fighting.</P>
