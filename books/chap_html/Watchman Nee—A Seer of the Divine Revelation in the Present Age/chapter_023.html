<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE GENERAL MEANS<br>OF WATCHMAN NEE'S MINISTRY</H1><P>Watchman Nee used eight different means to carry out the ministry wrought into him by the Lord. Five were general and three were specific. The five general means were preaching the gospel, teaching the Bible, traveling, contacting people, and corresponding with people. The three specific means were holding conferences, conducting trainings, and issuing publications.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. PREACHING THE GOSPEL</H2><P>The first means Watchman Nee adopted to carry out his ministry was preaching the gospel. This means was primary in the early years of his ministry. He preached to both crowds and individuals; he preached in homes and on the streets; he preached in cities and in villages. He also preached at home and abroad. In addition to speaking, he used tracts and pamphlets to preach the gospel. Although he was not considered an evangelist primarily, he did much evangelistic work and brought hundreds of solid fruit to the Lord for the building of His churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. TEACHING THE BIBLE</H2><P>Watchman Nee also used Bible teaching to carry out his ministry. Before 1928 he conducted a thorough study of the book of Revelation in Shanghai with a small number of believers. At the end of 1931 he conducted a one-month Bible study on church truth with the saints in Shanghai. After 1931 he conducted an intermittent study of the Gospel of Matthew with the church in Shanghai over a period of years. In or around 1932 he held a Bible study on tribulation and rapture truth with the saints in Shanghai. This study was published in a booklet entitled Tribulation and Rapture. In February 1934 following his third overcomer conference, he conducted a study with the church in Shanghai and a number of co-workers from different localities on the boundary of the local churches. These messages were published in a book entitled The Assembly Life. In May 1935 at the request of a few co-workers (fewer than ten), he conducted a thorough study on the Song of Songs at West Lake, Hangchow. These messages were also published in a book entitled The Song of Songs. In May 1937 he held a study with the church in Shanghai on gospel questions and how to enter into the kingdom. In October of the same year, he held another study with the church in Shanghai on the difference between the local churches and the work. In February 1938 he studied the truth of the Holy Spirit with the church in Shanghai. This study included the Comforter's work within the believers, the work of the Holy Spirit as poured out upon the believers, and the need for the believers' life to be filled with the Holy Spirit. In February 1938 he conducted several Bible study meetings with the church in Hong Kong. In 1945 he conducted a study on the orthodoxy of the church with the church in Chungking. This study was published in a book entitled The Orthodoxy of the Church. By means of such Bible studies, many saints were enlightened and the churches established.</P>
