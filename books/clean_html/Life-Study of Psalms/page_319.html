THE PRAISE OF THE SAINT<br>IN HIS GOING UP TO ZION CONCERNING<br>JEHOVAH'S BLESSING TO ISRAEL FROM ZION<br>AND THE PROSPERITY OF JERUSALEM<br>IN THEIR ENJOYMENT</H2><P>Psalm 128 is the praise of a saint in his going up to Zion concerning Jehovah's blessing to Israel from Zion (signifying the overcomers in the churches) and the prosperity of Jerusalem (signifying the church as God's kingdom) in their enjoyment. This indicates once again how precious are Zion and Jerusalem in the experiences and praises of the saints.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. They Eating the Labor of Their Hands,<br>and It Going Well with Them</H2><P>"Blessed is everyone who fears Jehovah,/Who walks in His ways./You will indeed eat the labor of your hands;/You will be blessed, and it will go well with you" (vv. 1-2). They will eat and they will have peace. Food and peace are two basic elements for our daily life. If we lack food, we will not have peace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B.
