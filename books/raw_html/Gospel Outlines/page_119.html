<h1 class="title">THE LORD IS THE WAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: John 14:6</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The way is the method
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To do anything we need a way. In other words, we need a method.</li>
	<li>To be saved, to be forgiven, to have eternal life, and to have God, all need the way, the method.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord is the way
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord said that He is the way; that is, He is the method.</li>
	<li>Man needs a way to be saved, to be forgiven, to have eternal life and to have God. The way is a living person, the Lord Jesus Himself. Develop this in detail.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How can we have the Lord as the way?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must confess that we ourselves have no way, no method. Concerning the matters of sins being forgiven or of being saved or of having eternal life or of having God, men have no way, no method. They can only sigh for having no way, no entrance.</li>
	<li>We must confess that the Lord is the Son of God to be our Savior, our way, our method.</li>
	<li>We must receive Him as our Savior, that is, receive Him as our way and as our means.</li>
	</ol></li>
