   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jehovah Making Christ</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>the Key of the House of David upon His Shoulder</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jehovah will make Christ typified by Jehovah's servant Eliakim a Father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the house of Judah and will set the key of the house of David upon His shoulder 22:20-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When He opens, no one will shut; when He shuts, no one will open v. 22 . And Jehovah will drive Him as a peg into a sure place, and He will become a throne of glory for His Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They will hang upon Him all the glory of His Father's house, the offspring and the issue, all the smallest vessels, from the bowls to the jars.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Isaiah 22:25 says, "In that day, declares Jehovah of hosts, the peg driven into the sure place will be removed, even cut away, and it will fall; and the burden that was upon it will be cut down; for Jehovah has spoken."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To whom does this verse refer?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It refers not to Christ but to Shebna v. 15 , who was replaced by Eliakim.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 19, referring to Shebna, says, "I will drive you from your position, / And from your standing He will pull you down."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verses 20 and 21 tell us that Shebna was to be replaced: "I will call to My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, / And I will clothe him with your tunic, / And I will strengthen him with your girding sash, / And I will put your dominion into his hand; / And he will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem / And to the house of Judah."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These verses indicate clearly that the position of steward over the king's house had been occupied by Shebna but that the Lord wanted to remove Shebna and replace him with Eliakim, who typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The fact that Eliakim is a type of Christ is proved by Revelation 3:7, which applies the word in Isaiah 22:22 to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The key of David has been given to Christ; He opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we put these verses together, we see that Eliakim is a type of Christ as a steward over God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verses 23 and 24 also speak concerning Eliakim as a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 23 says, "I will drive him as a peg into a sure place,/And he will become a throne of glory for his father's house."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 24 goes on to speak of all that will hang upon Christ as a peg: "They will hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all the smallest vessels, from the bowls to all the jars."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The bowls and jars typify the different ways and means for us to partake of Christ in His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's glory, all God's people, and all the different ways and means for us to partake of Christ and enjoy Christ are hanging upon this One.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From this we see once again that the book of Isaiah unveils Christ in a very particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How rich is Isaiah in unveiling Christ to us!</S>
