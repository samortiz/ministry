   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject One Hundred Twenty-two WHAT SHALL WE DO?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture: Acts 2:36-39 We should repent We are those who have turned our backs toward God and who live in sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God wants us to turn to Him and be freed from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Repentance starts with the turning of the mind until the whole being is turned to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Repentance in Greek means a change of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Originally your mind is toward sins and toward the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now God wants you to turn to Him, to turn your mind toward Him and then to turn your whole being to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must confess that we have our back toward Him and must reject all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should believe in Jesus Christ The word in in the phrase in the name of Jesus Christ means believing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To believe in Jesus Christ does not mean to agree, or to recognize, but to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To receive Him is to unite with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This word in has also the meaning of uniting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jesus Christ is God as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the Spirit, He is omnipresent and available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because we have a spirit within, we can use our spirit to receive the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we confess that we are sinners, repent and turn away from sins, our spirit is opened to receive Jesus Christ to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His Spirit then comes into ours to unite us with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should be baptized Believing in Christ is the inner reality, while baptism is the outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With the inner reality the outward expression is still necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that in addition to the believing in Christ with the heart there is the need of the baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What baptism shows is firstly the severing of the relationship with sins and that we are being put into God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Secondly, it shows that we are being freed from ourselves and being immersed into God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Baptism is the declaration with a physical action that the former conduct and former person have altogether been concluded, have died, and have been buried.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From now on there is no more former person and no more former conduct; but a uniting with Christ, a living out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The result of such doing Having our sins forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This includes being freed from the punishment and dominion of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Receiving the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Holy Spirit is another form of Christ Who is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, to receive the Holy Spirit is to receive Christ and to receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is also to have the eternal life of God.</S>
