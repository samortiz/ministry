Now the last part of this Psalm speaks of the resurrection of Christ in a marvelous way. The word &#8220;resurrection&#8221; is not used in the passage, but the fact of resurrection is indicated clearly and definitely.<p>Verse 22 says, &#8220;I will declare thy name unto my brethren.&#8221; This indicates a sudden change in the trend of this Psalm. The situation in the previous verses is full of intense suffering and sadness. Then suddenly He says, &#8220;I will declare thy name.&#8221; This means that He was resurrected. After His resurrection, He said, &#8220;I will declare thy name (the name of the Father) unto my brethren.&#8221; This verse is quoted in Hebrews 2:12, by which we see that it is a prophecy of Christ.<p>The Lord Jesus, after His resurrection, told Mary, &#8220;Go to my brethren&#8221; (John 20:17). Then, again, in Matthew 28:10, He said, &#8220;Go tell my brethren.&#8221; Before His death, the Lord Jesus never called the disciples His brethren. Why? Because by His resurrection all His disciples were regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3) and made the sons of God; thus, they all became His brethren. The New Testament tells us that on one hand the Lord Jesus is the only begotten Son of God (John 3:16), but on the other hand that He is the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29). Before His resurrection, the Lord Jesus was the only begotten Son; but after His resurrection, the only begotten Son became the firstborn Son, for at that time all His believers were regenerated and became His brethren, the sons of God. The only begotten Son became the firstborn Son, the firstborn of many brethren. &#8220;That he might be the firstborn among many brethren.&#8221; This is not a small matter.<p>Here we have a hint of the church: &#8220;I will declare thy name unto my brethren.&#8221; All His brethren are the members of His Body, the church.<p>Then Psalm 22:22 continues, &#8220;In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.&#8221; This is the Old Testament rendering. In the quotation of this verse in Hebrews, the word &#8220;congregation&#8221; is rendered differently to read &#8220;church.&#8221; &#8220;In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee&#8221; (2:12). Here we have the church, and we are the church. We all must believe that Christ today as the resurrected Lord is among us, and that He is singing among us. When we sing, He sings within our singing. Christ is in resurrection, and He has many brethren to be His church, His Body. Now He is in the church, singing praise to the Father, and He asks us to praise the Father: &#8220;Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him&#8221; (v. 23).<p>From verse 26 to the end of this Psalm there are some things which are difficult for many to understand. But if you pray-read this section again and again, looking unto the Spirit, you will see that it describes the result of His death and resurrection. The result is fivefold: firstly, the meek and the prosperous shall &#8220;eat and be satisfied&#8221; (vv. 26, 29). It is so good. We are the eating people. Day by day we are eating in His resurrection; so we are satisfied. Then, because we are satisfied, we worship. The worldly people and even some Christians do not understand what we are doing. We are the meek ones, and they are the proud ones; we are the truly prosperous ones, but they are the miserable ones. The meek and the prosperous ones of this earth shall eat, be satisfied, and worship.<p>The second aspect is in verse 27: &#8220;All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord.&#8221; This is really so. All the ends of the earth, especially today, do remember the Lord, turn to Him, and worship Him.<p>The third aspect is seen in verse 29: &#8220;All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and he that cannot keep alive his own soul.&#8221; This corresponds with Philippians 2, where we read that all things in heaven, in earth, and under the earth shall bow before Christ. Praise the Lord, we are the living ones, but the Bible tells us that even the dead shall bow before Him. At the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow, because Christ was resurrected.<p>The fourth aspect of the result of Christ&#8217;s resurrection is in verse 28: &#8220;For the kingdom is the Lord&#8217;s: and he rules over the nations.&#8221; Christ is the King ruling over the nations. We have not seen this with our eyes; but one day we will see it. It seems that Satan is ruling today, but with heavenly revelation we can see through to the reality. Christ is the King. The Kingdom is the Lord&#8217;s, and He rules over the nations. Do you believe the present situation, or do you believe the Word of God? Praise the Lord, we do believe the Word of God.<p>The fifth point concerns the Gospel preaching: &#8220;A seed shall serve him; it shall be told concerning the Lord to the coming generation. They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this&#8221; (vv. 30-31). No doubt this refers to the believers; the believers are the seed of Christ. We shall tell the coming generation; we shall declare His righteousness, justification, salvation, to a people yet to be born; and we will tell them that the Lord has done this. This is the Gospel preaching. The five aspects of the result of the death and resurrection of Christ are these. We cannot at this time go into these matters thoroughly; I have simply indicated the lines with all the points to you. I trust in you and I trust in the Holy Spirit that you will take time to pray-read these verses to gain something more.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
