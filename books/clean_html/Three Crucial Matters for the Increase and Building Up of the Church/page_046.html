<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING EDUCATION AND LEARNING THE TRUTH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Reading Two Verses in the Bible Every Day<br />
to Enter into the Word of the Lord</h2>
<p>The whole world would be in darkness if God had not given us the Bible. We each have a Bible in our hand, but not many of us are diligently learning the truth. If we want to grow in life and use our gift to supply others, we need to be educated by diligently learning the truth. A certain sister was over fifty years old and illiterate when she was saved. Over the past twenty years, however, her ability to read Chinese has improved, especially her ability to read the Bible. Since education has become more available, fewer people are illiterate. Hence, we should endeavor to learn the truth in the Bible, beginning with the Gospel of Matthew. If we read only two verses every morning, we would read 730 verses in a year and 7,300 verses in ten years. The New Testament has a total of 27 books, consisting of 7,957 verses in 260 chapters. If all of us would practice reading two verses every day, we would read every verse and every word of the New Testament in less than eleven years.</p>
<p>For example, we can begin from the Gospel of Matthew: &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac, and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers&rdquo; (1:1-2). Five to eight minutes are enough to read these verses with emphasis and to pray-read them. We should not excuse ourselves by saying that we do not have time. We are not required to spend thirty minutes or an hour reading. How can we say that we do not have five to eight minutes to read every morning? When we rise in the morning, it is best not to immediately occupy ourselves with washing up or getting dressed. Rather, we should first read two verses for the day and try to remember them. Then while we are washing up, we can speak these verses again and again. Even while the sisters are preparing breakfast, they can pray-read these verses. In this way no one can say that he is unable to learn the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Repeating the Lord&rsquo;s Words Continually<br />
during the Day to Keep Them in Our Heart<br />
and Speak Them to Others</h2>
<p>In addition to reading the Bible in the morning, we can read the Bible as we ride the bus to work or to school. Hence, we should have a Bible with us. If we do not have a Bible with us, we can consider the verses we pray-read in the morning. This is a beneficial practice that will enable us to keep the Lord&rsquo;s words in our heart. Even when we are at work, we can consider the verses we read. If we would learn the truth in this way, we will be able to clearly explain what is justification and what is sanctification. We can all learn this.</p>
<p>There was an elderly brother in Nanking who was a pastor when he was young. Since his memory was quite poor when he was eighty, his family had to lock him inside the house for fear that he would become lost if he left the house. I am now older than he was at that time, but most people admire my good memory. The secret to my memory is that I treasure the Bible and read it diligently. I am very familiar with every chapter and every verse of the Bible. The portions that I read in my youth are more familiar than ever to me, and I will never forget them. Therefore, the older saints should take courage. As long as we read two verses a day and repeat them during the day, we will not forget them. Not only so, we will finish the entire New Testament in less than eleven years by reading two verses a day. How wonderful this is! This is to learn the truth.</p>
<p>If all the brothers and sisters can learn the truth in this way, they will speak out of the abundance within them. Many brothers and sisters have been Christians for more than thirty years, but they have never spoken in a meeting. Suddenly they are being told to speak in the home meetings, and they do not know where to begin. Therefore, we are now undertaking an educational program. Now that we are changing the system, we will begin meetings to read <em>Truth Lessons.</em> If the young people in a country do not receive a basic education, the country will never become rich and strong. The result of being uneducated is either poverty or barbarity. Where there is no education, there is no civilization.</p>
<p>When I was young, my mother sent me to an English school to learn English. I believe that was the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement for me to receive a foundational training in English. I was in my sixties when I went to America. Before that time, I had never studied or lived in America. Many Americans were surprised that I could give messages in English. Without a foundation in English, however, even if I was filled with spiritual knowledge and divine truths, I would only be dumb, speechless, in Western countries.</p>
<p>We all love the Lord and like to speak for the Lord, but what do we speak and how do we speak? We need an adequate knowledge of the truth, and then as persons belonging to God and seeking the Lord, we will have wisdom and knowledge through the Lord&rsquo;s word to know what to speak and how to speak to people. In 1933, in my first trip away from home, I went to Shanghai to meet with Brother Watchman Nee. After a short time Brother Nee asked me to stay in Shanghai and entrusted me with the ministry of the word. At that time I spoke the Chefoo dialect, and I did not know how to serve in an environment where everyone spoke the Shanghai dialect. This is a matter of education. Since I exercised to give messages in Mandarin and use proper words when I spoke, all the brothers and sisters understood me. As a result, all the saints, young and old, brother and sister, came to see me with problems regarding their family, jobs, and school. I was able to handle the language difference and the problems concerning the truth.</p>
