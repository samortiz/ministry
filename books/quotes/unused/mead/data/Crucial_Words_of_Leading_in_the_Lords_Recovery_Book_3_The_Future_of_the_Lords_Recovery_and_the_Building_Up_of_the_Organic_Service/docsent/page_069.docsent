   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE ORGANIC FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord, we prostrate ourselves before You once again and look to You from the depths of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We were born natural and have been under all kinds of veils.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We ask You once again to open the veils that we may see You, see Your intention, and know Your ways.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, we confess that we are still not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Visit us and bring us into Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Guide us and grant us instant utterance so that every word we speak is Your expression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Cleanse us with Your precious blood, and keep us always in fellowship with You.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Cause us to be poor in spirit and to have a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We confess that we know nothing and are nothing; You are all we desire.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are all willing to place all that we have on Your altar.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not want to miss Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lead us and speak a clear word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Guide us, open us, empty us, and fill us with Your heart s desire so that we would be rid of the old things and become new, so that we would put off the old man and put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, grant us Your visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Cover us and withstand the evil one for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Withstand his accusations and attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Cover us from the disturbing thoughts of Your enemy, and grant us a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Have mercy on us, and give us clear utterance so that Your way would become brighter to us as we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>NOT ORGANIZATIONAL BUT ORGANIC</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The burden of this message is to have special fellowship concerning the organic function of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a great matter, and it is also a great need.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Body of Christ is an organism, and in this organism there is an organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the early apostles, the organic function of the church as the Body of Christ gradually weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>People began to consider the church as an organization, that is, a group of people who gather together to take certain actions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They also began to think of Peter as the head of this religion, this organization.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Peter is now regarded by some people as the church s first spokesman.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to this human view, the church is an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, from God s view the church is not an organization; it is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Head of this Body is Christ, not Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the most, Peter is only a member of this Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some members of the Body may be fingers; these are small members.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Other members may be arms; these are larger members.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, whether a believer is a finger or an arm, he is merely one of the members of the Body; he is not the head.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Catholic Church acknowledges Christ as the Head of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Catholic Church, however, believes that since Christ has ascended to heaven, He must have a representative on earth, and that the first representative was Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Catholic Church has highly elevated such representatives to be not only representatives of Christ but also to be fathers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, the title pope means father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Roman Catholic Church says that Peter was the first representative and that after Peter there have been popes throughout the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Catholic Church teaches that Christ s representative on the earth is a father to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a great heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We study the Catholic Church so that we can be warned and learn from its mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In principle, we can imperceptibly fall into the same errors.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Originally, the Protestant Reformation wanted to overthrow only the heretical teachings in the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Martin Luther did not have an intention to overthrow the papal system.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When Luther saw that salvation was by faith and not by works, his burden was to repudiate the heresy of the Catholic Church concerning salvation by works.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, his repudiation of this heresy eventually resulted in a rejection of the papal system.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Throughout the centuries, the Lord s serving ones have confronted the question of whether the church is an organization or a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They have considered whether the church is an organized group or an organic body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is correct to say that the church is not an organized group but the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, we may be clear concerning this only in doctrine, not in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Doctrinally speaking, we are clear that the Body of Christ is organic, but we are not so clear in the application of this truth to the practical service and move of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is crucial for our actions in the Body to be organic, not organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As full-time serving ones, we need to be clear that any service that is organizational involves degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order for our service to be organic, we must keep the ground, the position, of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many full-timers are not clear concerning whom they should listen to in their service.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A professor knows that he should listen to the dean, but many saints who are serving full time do not know to whom they should submit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is correct to say that our Dean is the Lord, but for two thousand years believers have had little understanding of what it means to listen to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to the teaching of the Catholic Church, listening to the pope is equal to listening to the Lord, and according to the Presbyterian Church, listening to the presbytery is equal to listening to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Throughout the centuries the question of what it means to listen to the Lord has not been resolved.</S>
