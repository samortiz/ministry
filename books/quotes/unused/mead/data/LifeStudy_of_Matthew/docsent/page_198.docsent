   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE FIFTY-THREE THE KINGDOM REQUIREMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to 19:1-22, a portion in which Matthew places together certain incidents in Christ s life to show the requirements of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 19:3-12 the Pharisees tempt the Lord by asking Him about divorce, and in 19:16-22 a rich man inquires of Him concerning eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Gospel of John does not mention either of these cases.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But in Matthew they are not only recorded; they are put in the same portion of Matthew s Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In chapter nineteen we see the matter of divorce and the matter of loving riches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Between these two things we have the matter of receiving the little children vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Apparently, these three things are not related.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But when we get into the depths of the significance of these things, we see that all are related to entering the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, they are the requirements of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I. UNVEILED IN THE DISTRICTS OF JUDEA</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>ACROSS THE JORDAN WITH THE POWER OF HEALING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Matthew 19:1 and 2 say, And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these words, He withdrew from Galilee and came into the districts of Judea across the Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Due to the rejection of the Jews, the heavenly King left them and went to Galilee in the north.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now He was coming back to Jerusalem to accomplish His death and resurrection, as He had prophesied in 16:21 and 17:22 and 23, for the establishment of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He came back still with the power of healing indicating that, as the King of the heavenly kingdom, He had authority over the negative things that damaged God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>FROM THE WRITTEN LAW BACK TO GOD S ORDINATION FROM THE BEGINNING A. Dealing with Lust</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we mean business with the Lord concerning the kingdom, we must deal with lust, pride, and the love of wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Gospel of John says nothing about dealing with lust because John is a book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But because Matthew is a book on the kingdom, it speaks of dealing with lust and other things as well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The kingdom is a matter of exercise, and most of this exercise involves various kinds of dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Lust, pride, and the love of wealth keep us from entering into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The love of money is no doubt related to the self.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By nature, we all love money for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if we would enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we must deal with this love of money.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Again and again, the Gospel of Matthew deals with lust.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the constitution of the heavenly kingdom, the King explicitly mentions dealing with lust.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The reference to plucking out our eyes or cutting off our hands in Matthew 5:29 and 30 shows how strict and serious we must be in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Otherwise, there is no way to enter the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The thorough dealing with lust has been neglected by today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Very few Christians have ever heard a sober word from Matthew 5 and 19 regarding lust.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because of this lack, there is no genuine church life or kingdom of the heavens among today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How the Lord needs a testimony on earth!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For His testimony the Lord must have a recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are not concerned about having a large number.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the time of Elijah, the Lord had only seven thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the Lord had seven thousand in this country, He would have a prevailing testimony against all adulterous things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Matthew 19:3 says, And the Pharisees came to Him, tempting Him, and saying, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The religionists did not let the Lord go, but came again and again to tempt Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, their tempting always afforded the Lord an opportunity to unveil Himself and God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here the opposition of the religionists afforded the Lord the opportunity to expose the seriousness of divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The source of divorce is lust.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If there were no lust, there would not be any divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord s word in 19:4-6 not only recognizes God s creation of man, but also confirms God s ordination of marriage, that is, one man and one woman joined and yoked together as one flesh, inseparable by man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Marriage is the union of one man and one woman.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is God s ordination, and it is very serious for anyone to break it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God s ordination here involves not only physical things, but also spiritual things; for the union of one man and one woman in marriage signifies the oneness of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As there is one husband for one wife, so there is one Christ for one church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There should not be more than one wife for one husband, or more than one husband for one wife.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How serious it would be if there were one Christ and many churches, or one church and more than one Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s ordination is to have one Christ and one church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In figure and in shadow, there must be one wife for one husband.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>That this was God s ordination in creation is clearly recorded in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In verse 7 the Pharisees asked the Lord, Why then did Moses command to give her a writing of divorce and to put her away?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This commandment was not a part of the basic law, but a supplement to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It was given by Moses, not according to God s ordination from the beginning, but temporarily because of the hardness of man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Instead of arguing with the Pharisees, the Lord said, Moses, because of your hardness of heart, allowed you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it has not been so.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The commandment concerning divorce given by Moses was a deviation from God s original ordination, but Christ as the heavenly King recovered it back to the beginning for the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This indicates that the kingdom of the heavens, corresponding with God s ordination from the beginning, does not allow any divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In verse 8 we see the principle of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Recovery means to go back to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Things that exist may not date back to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to go back to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the beginning, God ordained one husband and one wife, and there was no divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because of the hardness of the people s hearts, Moses tolerated divorce and allowed a man to divorce his wife by giving her a writing of divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord was asking the Pharisees if they would care for God s ordination or for the hardness of their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Every seeker of God should say, O Lord, have mercy upon me that I may care for Your original ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I do not want to care for the hardness of my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I condemn and reject the hardness of my heart and return to Your original ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is what is meant by recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Today many Christians are arguing for certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Because of the hardness of the fallen human heart, the Lord tolerates some of those things.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Should we agree with this toleration and the hardness of the human heart?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Rather, we must receive the Lord s grace to go back to God s original ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must go back to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Verse 9 says, But I say to you that whoever puts away his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her who has been put away commits adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Greek word for fornication means harlotry, whoredom, which is worse than adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord s word here indicates definitely that nothing but fornication breaks the marriage tie.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Of course, death automatically breaks it.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Except for fornication, there is no ground for divorce.</S>
