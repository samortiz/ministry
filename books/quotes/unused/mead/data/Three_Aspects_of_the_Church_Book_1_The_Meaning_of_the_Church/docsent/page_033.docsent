   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Entering within the Veil</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Going outside the Camp</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What we believe is not dead and empty doctrine; instead, in our spirit we have touched the Spirit, the Lord who is in resurrection and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His name is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have touched and contacted Him inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we allow Him to operate and move within us, we will be able to live a life just as that of Jesus the Nazarene, and we will be able to follow in His footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hebrews 13:13 says, Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>David s mighty men and Abigail, following David and wandering with him in the wilderness, typify going outside the camp and bearing Christ s reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our Christian living has two aspects an inward aspect and an outward aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The inward aspect can be compared to the Shulammite, and the outward aspect can be compared to Abigail.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On one hand, we are within the veil; on the other hand, we are outside the city, the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On one hand, we are in the Holy of Holies; on the other hand, we are before men.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Inwardly we enjoy the resurrected Christ, and outwardly we follow Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we pray in our room in the morning, we touch Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This can be likened to the Shulammite and Solomon living and fellowshipping together in the palaces of ivory Psa 45:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We touch the Lord in the inner chamber, in the Holy of Holies, in the secret place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we testify for the Lord and work for the Lord in our outward living, we can be likened to Abigail, wandering with David in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every day we experience these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the one hand, we are within the veil as the Shulammite, living in the Holy of Holies and enjoying the resurrected and glorified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the other hand, we are outside the camp as Abigail, living in the world and following the lowly Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Like the Shulammite and Solomon, we remain in the palaces of ivory and fellowship with the Lord inwardly, and like Abigail, we outwardly live and work by following David to war and suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The One within is the resurrected Christ, whereas the One without is Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Inwardly we have the enjoyment of the Shulammite in the secret place, and outwardly we have the public living of Abigail.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We not only enjoy the resurrected Christ within, but we follow the suffering Jesus without.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our colleagues, relatives, neighbors, and friends may persecute and trouble us when we testify for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At such times we are outwardly walking on a narrow way similar to that of Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nevertheless, when people trouble, persecute, oppose, and harass us, we enjoy the resurrected Christ inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I was arrested by the Japanese, they harassed me for a number of days.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I was beaten, punished, and interrogated under torture in the prison.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Outwardly it was truly difficult, yet at the same time inwardly I touched the Lord s presence in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Outwardly, like Jesus the Nazarene, I was tortured, but inwardly I enjoyed the Christ who is in resurrection, in glory, and in the Spirit, as typified by Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the future, when our Solomon comes back, we will be His Shulammite in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today in our spiritual experience, we can have a foretaste of that day and of the condition of that day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Philippians 3:10 says, To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As far as Christ is concerned, He first experienced suffering and then resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As far as we are concerned, we touch resurrection and then experience suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He died and then resurrected, but we resurrect and then die.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No one can take the way of the cross by himself; neither can he follow the footsteps of Jesus the Nazarene by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not until a person touches and contacts the resurrected Christ within and until the resurrected Christ enters into him that he can say, It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only when a person comes out from within the veil, the inner chamber of fellowship, can he take the way of the cross and follow the suffering Jesus on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hebrews 10:19-20 says, Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only those who enter within the veil can go forth unto Him outside the camp and bear His reproach 13:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is the resurrected Christ in us who leads us to follow the suffering Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He has walked the way of the cross and entered into us in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now He is leading us to take the way of the cross.</S>
