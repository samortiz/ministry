of the Land as a Portion of the Birthright</h2>
<p>Because of his purity, Joseph overcame the temptation of the lust of the flesh (Gen. 39:7-12). He conducted himself as a bright star shining in darkness. Hence, the birthright was transferred from the lust-indulging Reuben to Joseph (1 Chron. 5:1-2). He received the double portion of the land, signifying the enjoyment of Christ in full, as a portion of the birthright. In Genesis 48, when Joseph brought his two sons to Jacob, Jacob said, &ldquo;And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt, before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine&rdquo; (v. 5). Jacob&rsquo;s intention was to replace Reuben and Simeon, his first two sons, with the two sons of Joseph, that Joseph might become his firstborn to participate in the double portion of the land as a portion of the birthright.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Typifying Christ</h2>
<p>According to the record of the Bible, Joseph was altogether perfect, without defect. Joseph is the perfect one in the Old Testament, and Jesus is the perfect One in the New Testament. Hence, Joseph is a type of Christ in His perfection. He typifies Christ as the Father&rsquo;s Beloved (Gen. 37:3-4; Matt. 3:17; 17:5); as the One who ministered to God&rsquo;s people according to the will of God the Father (Gen. 37:12-17; John 6:38), but was hated, harassed, and betrayed by them (Gen. 37:4-5, 8, 18-28); as the One who was delivered into the prison of death (Gen. 39:20; Acts 2:23) and resurrected from the prison of death (Gen. 41:14; Acts 2:24); and as the One who was enthroned with authority (Gen. 41:40-44; Matt. 28:18; Acts 2:36; Rev. 3:21), who received glory (Gen. 41:42; Heb. 2:9) and gifts (Gen. 41:42; Acts 2:33), and who became the Savior of the world, the Sustainer of Life (Gen. 41:56-57; Acts 5:31; John 6:50-51). Joseph&rsquo;s taking the Egyptian woman Asenath as his wife is a type of Christ&rsquo;s taking the church as His wife from among the Gentiles after He was rejected by the Jews (Gen. 41:45). Joseph&rsquo;s brothers&rsquo; being forced to turn to Joseph (Gen. 42:1-6) typifies the Israelites&rsquo; being forced to turn to Christ (Zech. 12:10). Eventually, Joseph acknowledged his ignorant brothers (Gen. 45:1-4, 14-15) and enabled them to participate in his reign (Gen. 45:18; 47:4-6). This is a type showing how Christ will acknowledge the ignorant nation of Israel (Rom. 11:26-27) and will enable the Jews to participate in His reign in the earthly part of the millennial kingdom (Zech. 14:16-19).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Reuben, Levi, Judah, and Joseph were all related to the birthright. The birthright, a continuation of the various excellent qualities and blessings of the forefathers, includes the double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship. As the firstborn, Reuben should have inherited the birthright; but because his lust boiled over like water, he lost the preeminence of the birthright. Because of his cruel disposition, Levi did not receive Jacob&rsquo;s blessing; yet because of their faithfulness to Jehovah, his descendants received the priesthood as a portion of the birthright. They had the privilege of drawing near to God and of serving God. Because of his love for the brothers, in particular his taking care of Joseph, who was in tribulation, Judah received the kingship as a portion of the birthright; that is, he brought the authority of God to the people. Joseph was special among the sons of Jacob and was separate from his brothers. He continued the way of life that chooses God, the way taken by his forefathers. Although he suffered the ill-treatment of his brothers and passed through various trials and sufferings, he was prosperous in all things because he had the presence of God. Eventually, he was able to reign for God and receive glory. Hence, he symbolizes one who is mature in the spiritual life and who reigns for God. Furthermore, he received the double portion of the land as a portion of the birthright. Thus he had the right and the position to enjoy Christ in full. His whole life was altogether perfect, without defect. Therefore, he is a type of Christ in His perfection.</p>
