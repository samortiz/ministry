<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES<br />
TO SPEAK WITH BOLDNESS BY FAITH<br />
IN PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We must also lead the new ones to speak with boldness by faith in preaching the gospel (2 Cor. 4:13; Acts 4:31). After someone is saved, we should lead him immediately into speaking the Lord as the gospel, preaching the gospel in the boldness received by faith in the outpouring of the Spirit. According to the revelation of the Bible, we should pray, confess, stand on the word of God, exercise our spirit and our faith, and speak in boldness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES TO KNOW<br />
THAT THE MEETINGS OF THE BELIEVERS<br />
ARE IN MUTUALITY</h2>
<p>We also must lead our new ones to know that the meetings of the believers are in mutuality (1 Cor. 14:26; Heb. 10:25). I do not like to see the new ones come to an old-fashioned meeting with one eloquent speaker and all the others listening. This kind of meeting may be very attractive to the new ones. They may prefer to go to a meeting with a very good, eloquent speaker who speaks in a very meaningful way. But once they develop a taste for this kind of meeting, they will not want to practice the new way ordained by the Lord. Although the old, traditional way with a big building, large congregation, choir, song leader, and a learned, eloquent speaker seems to be good at first, in the long run, it gradually annuls the organic ability and function of the believers. Eventually, in such a situation, the spiritual life of the new ones will be killed. Once they get used to attending this kind of meeting, they lose their appetite and taste for taking the biblical way.</p>
<p>When we were in Christianity, we also lost our taste for taking the biblical way. We desired to listen to good, eloquent speakers all the time. But the result of such a practice is that the members of the Body lose their functions and abilities. In Christianity today there is a great facade which attracts people and keeps them under the apparent edification of teaching. But over a long period of time, this kind of traditional meeting annuls and kills, causing the function of the Lord&rsquo;s people to be reduced to nothing. In Christianity there are many believers but few who are really useful. These useful ones are usually encouraged to go to seminaries to learn to be good speakers. This practice supports the traditional practice of Christianity which depends upon organization and clergy. Rather than building up the Body of Christ, the meetings in Christianity build up the organization of Christianity and the practice of hierarchy. Thus, on the whole earth today, no group has fully entered into the practice of 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25. Therefore, we are burdened for the recovery of the practice of these two verses so that the Lord can have the practical building up of His Body. If we all receive the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace to practice the new way wisely for five to ten years, we will see the practical building up of the Body of Christ. This heavenly way is full of impact, and it can produce permanent results. The Lord will then see the building up of the Body of Christ, and He will be very happy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES TO SPEAK<br />
FOR THE LORD AND SPEAK THE LORD<br />
IMMEDIATELY AFTER BEING SAVED</h2>
<p>We should lead the new ones to know that one should speak for the Lord and speak the Lord immediately after being saved (Rom. 10:9). Tell the new ones to speak immediately what they know without waiting until they learn more. Perhaps all they can say is, &ldquo;Jesus is good. I love Him.&rdquo; Tell them to speak this to their neighbors. If a typical preacher, a &ldquo;professional speaker,&rdquo; were to say this, very few would listen. But if a so-called layman, such as a bank manager who just became a Christian, were to tell his neighbor, &ldquo;Jesus is good. I love Him,&rdquo; his neighbor would respect this word. The word out of the mouth of a so-called layman means a great deal, but the same word out of the mouth of a professional preacher means very little.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES TO REALIZE<br />
THAT THE MEETINGS ARE FOR THE BELIEVERS<br />
TO SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD AND TO LISTEN<br />
TO OTHERS SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>We should lead the new ones to realize that our meetings are for the believers to speak the word of the Lord (1 Cor. 14:26). We have to lead the new ones into the realization that they need to learn the word so that they can speak the word in the meetings. They learn the word of the Lord in order to speak the word in their home meeting, which is one of many kinds of believers&rsquo; meetings. Following our example, they can speak by the word of the Scriptures, by the hymns, and by the publications in life. When they speak, they do not need to have a definite subject and can just speak the word of the Bible.</p>
<p>The new ones should realize that our meetings are also for the believers to listen to others speak the word of the Lord (Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16). Do not think that you should only speak; you should also listen. On the one hand, as a new one you have to speak; on the other hand, you have to listen to others&rsquo; speaking.</p>
<p>The steps to raise up new believers presented in this chapter are a map for setting up home meetings in the homes of the newly baptized ones. We should put all these things into practice in a wise way. If there is a church in our locality already, we should submit ourselves to the church and go along with the church. The church in your locality may not have fully entered into the practice of the new way; therefore, do not initiate anything without the proper fellowship with the church. If, however, there is no church in your locality, you have the liberty to start everything new with the believers according to the steps presented here.</p>
