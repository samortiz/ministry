   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>13 KNOWING GRACE FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S PURPOSE CIRCUMCISION FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S PURPOSE And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis 17:9-10 In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Colossians 2:11</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the book of Genesis, nearly all the divine truths are sown as seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we come to a great and basic truth in the holy Word that is sown as a seed in Genesis 17 circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to understand circumcision, we need to see two main points of the divine revelation unfolded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first is that God's eternal purpose is to have Himself expressed and represented by man on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This matter is revealed throughout the whole Bible, from the first chapter of Genesis through the last chapter of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second point concerns God's way of accomplishing His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's way to fulfill His purpose is to work Himself into man as man's life and everything so that man may become His expression and representation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The accomplishment of God's purpose does not depend upon what we can do but upon God's working Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we see these two points, then we can understand the basic truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For the fulfillment of His divine purpose, God called Abraham out of Chaldea, a land of demons and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we have seen, Abraham did not give a clear-cut answer to God's call but dragged his feet through mud and water.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His father brought him to Haran, the half-way place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By God's mercy, Abraham answered God's call nearly in a full way at Haran, crossed the great river, and came to the very place where God wanted him to be.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That place was close to the sinful city of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was not easy for Abraham to remain in the place where God wanted him to be and not long afterward he drifted down to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But by God's sovereignty, Abraham, who had left demonic Chaldea, had forsaken halfway Haran, and had overcome sinful Sodom, was delivered out of worldly Egypt and was brought back to the place of God's choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to recall the names of three very important persons related to Abraham Lot, Eliezer, and Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abraham took Lot with him when he left Haran, and he probably acquired Eliezer at Damascus and Hagar in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>None of these three was a help to Abraham; each one was a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God rejected all three of these persons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Abraham used his natural strength to coordinate with Hagar to produce his masterpiece Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But Ishmael was absolutely rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With this as the background, we come now to the matter of circumcision 17:9-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the time of Genesis 17, Abraham had been robbed of all the places where he had been and of all the important persons he had acquired.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chaldea and Haran were past, and he had nothing to do with Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although he was in the land that God had promised to give him, it had not yet been given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, Abraham did not have Chaldea, Haran, Egypt, Sodom, or a portion of the promised land.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, Lot had separated from him, and both Eliezer and Ishmael had been rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Abraham was left alone with Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They were two old people who had gained nothing and who were able to do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps Abraham looked at Sarah and said, "What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We don't have anything and we can't do anything."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that juncture God came in, revealing Himself to Abraham as El-Shaddai, the all-sufficient Mighty One.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was then that God told Abraham that his name had to be changed from Abram to Abraham and that his wife's name had to be changed from Sarai to Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After that, God told Abraham that he had to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Abraham had been robbed of every place and every person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The only thing that still remained with him was himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God came in to deal with Abraham's self, with his flesh, natural strength, and natural ability.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This self, the flesh and natural strength, had to be cut off, circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we had been Abraham, we probably would have said, "God, don't You know that You have robbed me of so much?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no one like me on the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Everyone else has a place of his own, but I have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What will You do now get rid of me?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God might have answered, "Abraham, you are right.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have robbed you of Chaldea, Haran, Egypt, Lot, Eliezer, Hagar, and Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I will not rob you anymore, but I will cut you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What you have acquired has been taken from you, and what you are must now be cut."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is circumcision.</S>
