<h1 class="title">OFFERING MANPOWER AND FINANCES<br />
FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOSPEL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 16:9; 19:15-26; 1 Thes. 2:19-20</h1>
<p>It is a great thing to encourage the working saints to open their homes and to participate in the gospel at their work place. The increase and spread of a church is entirely dependent on its widespread preaching of the gospel. Without the widespread preaching of the gospel, the increase and spread of the church has no way to begin. If we understand that the Lord&rsquo;s heart is to cause His church to increase and spread, we will preach the gospel widely.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROMOTING THE WORKING SAINTS<br />
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THEIR FELLOW WORKERS</h2>
<p>According to our experience, we cannot merely talk about the widespread preaching of the gospel. We must find a practical way to carry it out. First, every saint must grasp the opportunity to preach the gospel to every person they encounter. Next, we need to open our homes, just as Acts 5:42 says, &ldquo;Every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ.&rdquo; At the time of the apostles every home preached the gospel. We are practicing the small groups so that after the small groups are established, every saint&rsquo;s home will become a gospel-preaching home.</p>
<p>We also need to encourage the saints to open their homes and concentrate on preaching the gospel to their fellow workers. This refers to the saints in different occupations, whether in schools, hospitals, businesses, factories, or government offices. This is according to God&rsquo;s sovereign authority, and it is the opportunity that God has arranged for us so that we can daily preach the gospel to our fellow workers. The church needs to promote this. The church should encourage all the saints, no matter what their occupation is, to concentrate on opening their homes and inviting their fellow workers with their spouses and relatives to come and hear the gospel. Furthermore, the saints need to learn to receive a burden for the gospel and not rely on others but to practice preaching the gospel by themselves.</p>
<p>Perhaps some might feel overwhelmed by this kind of gospel preaching and say that they cannot do it by themselves. Then the brothers responsible for promoting the community gospel should assist them. This especially applies to a saint who wants to begin preaching the gospel at his work place. It is not enough for the saint or his family to bear the responsibility alone. There is a need for others to help them. I hope that we will all be dreaming the same dream, conducting the same business, and working to produce ideas for the sake of the gospel. I hope that all the co-workers will work toward this dream. Often times I wake up in the early morning and cannot go back to sleep. While I lie in bed, I dream spiritual dreams. This is when all the business ideas for the gospel come forth.</p>
<p>It is very good that there are forty to fifty medical doctors among us. These saints should not merely have a high social status and make much money, but even more, they should preach the Lord&rsquo;s gospel. Although they are busy, we cannot deny the fact that they are saved. As long as they are saved, we should help them to fan into flame the gift within them and cause them to have a heart for the Lord. After they have a heart for the Lord, we need to help them to open their homes. This is the kind of dream I often have.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO BOTH OLDER PEOPLE<br />
AND CHILDREN IN THE APARTMENTS</h2>
<p>Many of the old-fashioned Japanese-style houses in Taiwan have been replaced with high-rise apartment buildings. During the day, most of the people at home in these apartments are older people whose children have grown. For this reason, the brothers responsible for the community gospel must locate all our older saints who live in these apartments. We should ask them to open their homes and preach the gospel to the older people living in their apartment building. Mobilizing our older saints will have a great influence. To gain a grandmother is to gain a household of three generations, because the grandfather will be influenced by the grandmother, and the children will be influenced by their mother. Not only so, the third generation will be influenced by the second and first generations. I have had endless dreams similar to this. If we are willing to practice this, the gospel can be promoted to all ages.</p>
<p>The older sisters who live in the apartments should preach the gospel not only to other older people in the same building but also to the children. Today every household in Taiwan focuses on the children. The parents focus on their children&rsquo;s studies and conduct because they expect the children to do well academically and be proper human beings. Hence, it is worthwhile for us to do business in the children&rsquo;s gospel. Older sisters can prepare snacks and gather the neighborhood children to their home for a children&rsquo;s meeting when the children get back from school. The sisters can teach them children&rsquo;s songs. The parents of the children will appreciate this.</p>
<p>When the older sisters sing, the children will be happy to follow and sing as well. This is one of the ways to promote the children&rsquo;s meeting and also to promote the community gospel. We can say that this is to hit two birds with one stone. Every parent likes his children to be good. After the children participate in the children&rsquo;s meetings, they become a testimony when they return to their home. Therefore, the older sisters who serve the children must believe that if we gain the children, sooner or later we will gain their parents.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> </body></html>
