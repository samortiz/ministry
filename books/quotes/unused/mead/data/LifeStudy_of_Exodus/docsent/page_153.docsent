   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE DEFEAT OF AMALEK A. By Weak Men</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In defeating Amalek the Lord used weak men Exo 17:9; Rom 7:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 17:9 Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Hebrew word for men in this verse denotes those who are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the eyes of God, the children of Israel were weak men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The same is true of believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may think that a certain brother is very strong; however, in the eyes of God he is actually weak.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our weakness is proved by the fact that we can be easily defeated, even by our children or grandchildren.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A brother may even be defeated by an unhappy expression on his wife s face.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not consider ourselves strong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No, we are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God, however, does not use the strong to fight against Amalek.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Joshua was told to choose weak men for the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We would choose strong ones, but God chose those who are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The victors over Amalek are weak men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>B. With Moses Lifting Up His Hand</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>on the Mountaintop</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Apparently the battle against Amalek was fought by weak men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually it was fought by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is proved by the fact that victory or defeat was decided by the lifting of Moses hand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Exodus 17:11 says, And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moses lifting up his hand on the mountaintop typifies the ascended Christ interceding in the heavens Rom 8:34b; Heb 7:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The question of victory or defeat did not depend on the fighting of the weak men.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although they had to fight, victory did not depend on them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It depended on the lifting up of Moses hand with the rod of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although it is necessary for us to fight against Amalek, we should not think that by our fighting we can be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the contrary, we are qualified only for defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In our fighting we must recognize the need not to fight in ourselves, but to fight by means of Moses and Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>C. With Joshua Fighting for the People</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, Moses lifted up his hand on the mountaintop; on the other hand, Joshua was fighting for the people 17:10a, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have seen that manna typifies Christ and that the living water typifies the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we must go on to point out that Moses typifies the heavenly Christ, and Joshua, the indwelling Spirit fighting against the flesh Gal 5:16-17; Rom 8:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many Christians realize that in typology Joshua signifies Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In fact, the Greek word Jesus is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although Joshua typifies Jesus, in Exodus 17 Joshua typifies the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the picture in Exodus 17, the heavenly Christ, typified by Moses, is interceding, and the indwelling Christ, typified by Joshua, is slaying the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The manna, the living water, Moses, and Joshua all typify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is the life supply, the living water, the One interceding in the heavens, and the indwelling One fighting against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In brief, Christ is all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The picture in Exodus is very clear concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is no coincidence that Christ is typified in Exodus in all these ways.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In His sovereign wisdom God prepared these types and arranged them in a marvelous sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First we have the manna and the living water; then we have Moses on the mountaintop and Joshua fighting the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all must come to know Christ as the heavenly manna, the living water, the interceding Moses, and the fighting Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We also need to experience Christ in the aspect of manna, living water, the interceding One, and the fighting One.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As the indwelling Spirit, Christ is our present, practical Joshua fighting against the flesh and putting it to death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this battle we need to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When He fights, we should fight also.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, our fighting in itself does not count for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, Christ still desires that we fight together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the way to defeat Amalek, the way to defeat the flesh.</S>
