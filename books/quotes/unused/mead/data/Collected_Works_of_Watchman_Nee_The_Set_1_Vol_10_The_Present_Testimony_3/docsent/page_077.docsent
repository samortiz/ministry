   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Some people may proclaim one day, "I have triumphed over my temper in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But the next day pride comes in. They may think, "Oh no, why is it that yesterday I overcame my temper, but today pride is rising up in me? Could it be that the word in the Bible that says, For you died,' is not dependable?" No, we have to walk on the way of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Israelites experienced the victory at Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But the very next minute they were defeated at Ai.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we trust in ourselves, we will immediately fail.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if we rely on God's word, we will overcome all the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must never entertain the thought of living in ease and comfort; we have to deal with our temper, and we have to deal with pride.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The battle of faith must go on, and the way of faith must be traveled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every step on this way must be planted with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the principles of spiritual living revolve around crossing a barrier and walking on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Previously, I did not realize that all spiritual blessings are in Christ; now I do.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is to cross the barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After we cross the barrier, step by step, we have to stand on the word God has shown us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is to walk on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to pay attention to both aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All those who have not crossed the barrier cannot walk on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a person has crossed the barrier, yet is too lazy to progress in the way, he will not be able to go on and not be able to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One must take definite steps, one by one, and must occupy the land, city by city.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The enemy will never surrender without a fight.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Spiritual warfare is something that we have to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With the matter of obedience, there is also a gate and a way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One must first enter the gate of obedience, then take the way of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have met two or three sisters who said to me, "It is very difficult to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It seems rather easy for other sisters to submit, but for me to submit is like bearing the hardship of the whole world."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I answered them by saying, "Since you have never entered through the gate of submission, how can you walk on the way of submission?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brothers and sisters, if you have not specifically put down your will and surrendered it to God, if you have not dropped what is precious to you and rejected the things you love, you should not expect to be able to walk on the way of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is impossible for many people to persuade others to obey the Lord because the ones they are trying to persuade are still outside the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must lead them through the gate first before you can help them obey God in one thing after another and walk on the way of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The principal of the Bible school that I mentioned yesterday definitely crossed the barrier when he laid aside his pursuit of a doctorate of philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If anyone asked me, "Who are some that have helped you the most in your life?", I would answer, "He is one of them."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By passing the gate of obedience, he has helped many people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brothers and sisters, did you at one time sever yourselves from your past?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Did you at one time sever yourselves from your stubbornness?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Did you at one time sever yourselves from your pursuit of self-glory?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you have not severed yourselves in this way, you have never walked on the way of obedience because you have not yet entered the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Rebekah was asked, "Wilt thou go with this man?", she answered, "I will go" Gen 24:58 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She then left her father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Psalm says, "Forget...thy father's house; so shall the King greatly desire thy beauty" 45:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the matter of obedience, Christians are like a girl on her way to the marriage; she must first leave her father's house and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After that, she has to ride on a camel and go through the way of the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After leaving her father's house, she has to take the way of suffering a camel means suffering .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only by this can Rebekah be a helpmate to Isaac and gain his pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christians should tell the Lord, "From now on, for Your sake I will drop any person, matter, or object."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Otherwise, God may say to you today, "Give this up," and you may respond, "I cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is too hard."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Tomorrow God may say to you again, "Give that up," and you may respond, "I cannot do that.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That is too hard."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It will seem that God is always picking on you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is because you have not left your father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you at one time made a definite decision, you will be able to walk on this way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have often told friends that many Christians have not suffered enough because God has never asked them for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are also many Christians who have suffered much, but are not joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever we suffer, there should be the adequate joy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many Christians still do not know what God requires of them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brothers and sisters, if you still do not know what God requires of you, what He expects of you, and how He deals with this or that matter, and if you are still at a loss about everything, you have never entered the gate of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You must tell God in a specific way, "O God, from now on I am putting aside my desire, hope, ambition, and will, and I will cut them off."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you do not do this, God will still not ask anything from you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If they had not been married, Isaac could not have asked anything from Rebekah.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do not obey God in a definite way, God will never ask us for a penny.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we offer money for our conscience's sake, we are acting from our conscience God did not ask it of us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Please remember one thing: if we hope to walk the way of obedience, we must pass the gate of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Whether we are a brother or a sister, if we have not made any spiritual progress, it is because we have not yet started to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is important that we surrender to God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do not pass through the gate, we should not dream that we can walk on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We belonged to God when we were redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In our experience, however, our belonging to God begins with our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Has anyone really consecrated themselves to God?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Have we obeyed when God touched us concerning certain things?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Are we a little afraid when God asks for something from us?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Friends, the very thing that we are afraid of may or may not be what God wants from us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But whatever we dare not think about or touch, and whatever we try to dodge, may well be what God is after.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God may be speaking to us about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many problems are confronting us, and the Holy Spirit is working in us, but we do not want to think about it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We even try to run away, say something else, think of something else, or read the Bible, hoping that we can escape this kind of voice.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many people are called by God to preach the gospel, but they try to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God says to some people, "Your motive towards money is not right."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To others God says, "Your relationship with a certain person is not right."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To yet another, God says, "Your standing in the church is not right."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When God touches them in this way, it is most painful.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, only this kind of touch from God will secure them and bring them the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Do we think that God cannot discern the depths within our heart?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We are all naked before God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is best for us to tell God once and for all in a definite way, "O God, from now on, I belong to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>From now on, my vision is only on the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>From now on, there is nothing on earth that I desire besides the Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When you do this, you pass the gate of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There is not one good Christian who has not passed through this gate or entered this door.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There is also not one good worker who has not passed through this gate or entered this door.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When you have really entered through the gate, offered yourself, and laid down everything, the Lord will come to test you.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Lord will test you to the point of His satisfaction, to the point that He is assured that you are for Him and to the point that you are also assured that you are for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>After Abraham crossed the river and entered Canaan, God tested him step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Finally, God asked him to offer up Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God wanted to prove that Abraham loved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God also wanted Abraham to be assured that he loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>After you have passed through the gate, there may be something that you like and admire in a hidden way.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But if God says to you, "You should give up this thing," you must give it up to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If you are not faithful, you will try to bypass the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Too many Christians are going around the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Whenever God wants anything from them, they go around.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Therefore, they have a longer way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If they are faithful, they will have a much shorter way.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If they are not faithful, going around the cross only makes their journey much longer.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>My only purpose today is to show us that with faith and obedience, entering through the gate is always the first step, and walking the way is the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We should pay attention to both the gate and the way.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If we only emphasize one aspect and have not yet entered the gate, do not ever say, "I have consecrated myself to God."</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Do not ever hope that we can walk the way.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Whether with faith or with obedience, we must first enter the gate and then walk the way.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Otherwise, all is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We can talk a great deal about the teaching of faith and obedience, but this will be vain talk.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We may also hear a great deal about the teaching of faith and obedience, but the hearing will also be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>May God bless us today and open our eyes to see that for His sake nothing is too difficult, no price is too high, and no offering is too much.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Because I believe in Him, I will enter the gate of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Because I love Him, I will enter the gate of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Because He is faithful, I will walk the way of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Because He has a loving heart, I will walk the way of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The path of the righteous is like the dawning light growing brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</S>
