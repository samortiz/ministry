<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE VISION OF CHRIST IN COLOSSIANS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Col. 1:9, 12-20, 25-29; 2:2-3, 6-19; 3:1-4, 10-11, 15-16</h1><p>In this message we will see the vision of Christ in the book of Colossians. We will begin by reading a number of portions from the first three chapters.<p>Verse 9 of chapter one says, “Therefore we also, since the day we heard of it, do not cease praying and asking on your behalf that you may be filled with the full knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding.” This verse reflects the prayer and desire of the apostle that we be filled with the full knowledge of God’s will. We should not consider that God’s will here is concerning minor things, such as whether or not to buy a pair of shoes, whether we should rent a house, or where we should go to college. Rather, this refers to God’s greater will, even the greatest will of God.<p>God’s will is His plan or purpose, and the knowledge of His will is in all spiritual wisdom and understanding. Wisdom is something in the spirit, while understanding is something in the mind. To realize and understand the will of God, we first need wisdom in our spirit and then understanding in our mind.<p>Verse 12 says, “Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light.” The Greek text here refers not to an inheritance but to a lot, a portion. This lot is the portion of the saints that is given to us by God. This allotted portion is Christ. God has no intention to give us something else as our allotted portion. The portion, the lot, given to us by God is the Christ of God. Beginning from verse 13, the apostle tells us who Christ as our God-given portion is. Verses 13 and 14 say, “Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.” The portion given by God to us is the Son of God’s love, and in this One we have redemption through His blood.<p>If possible, I would ask you to memorize all these words and phrases. I would even encourage some young brothers to memorize the whole book of Colossians, from the first to the last verse. Then you can speak this book from memory. At least we need to remember all the items concerning Christ.<p>Verse 15 says, “Who is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation.” God is invisible, unseen, yet He has an image. This image is Christ. Image here refers to expression. God is invisible, but He has an expression, who is Christ. Verses 16 through 20 continue, “Because in Him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him. And He is before all things, and all things cohere in Him; and He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things; for in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross—through Him, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens.” Not only were we humans reconciled by Christ to God; all creatures, the things on the earth and in the heavens, were also reconciled.<p>In these verses there are more items concerning Christ that we should memorize. He is the image of God, the Firstborn of all creation, the means of all creation, the One through whom all things were created, the One in whom all things cohere, the Head of the Body, the Firstborn from the dead, the One who has the first place, the One in whom all the fullness was pleased to dwell, and the One in whom all creatures were reconciled to God.<p>Verses 25 and 26 say, “Of which I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God, the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints.” Stewardship means “economy,” “administration,” or “dispensation.” From the very beginning throughout all the generations, this mystery has been hidden.
