The messages contained in this book concerning the home meetings were given in Anaheim, California in August and September of 1985
We were clear that the way Christianity takes to meet together was not according to the Bible and it was not so profitable
That initiation brought in on the very first day of the church life three thousand, then on another day five thousand
Others have natural eloquence, but they do not have the spiritual knowledge and do not know the contents of the Bible
To have a big hall with a big number of people coming together with a big speaker is the Christianity way to worship God today
The Lord in these days has shown us the lack, the loss, and the damage we have been suffering by missing the home meetings
If we had only one brother to collect and pile up all the materials on the ground for nine years, they would be ruined
They were all grouped together to do a certain part for the building and eventually to put all the pieces together
In the early days of the church life, when the apostles were first raised up by the Lord, they built the church in this way
Acts 9:31 says, 'So the church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up'
A call was given that all the city people should come together for a certain purpose, so there was a congregation
To meet in today's Christianity way, to have the great congregations, is altogether natural, worldly, according to human society
Even before we were saved, when we were invited to come to the 'church,' we would ask who the speaker would be
Even among us, if the announcement is given that there is to be a meeting next Saturday, many of us would ask who the speaker would be
At Pentecost through the big congregations people were brought in and right away they were put into the home meetings
Many, according to their concept, would say that they prefer to go to the big meetings rather than the home meetings
After the collection of the materials we surely needed another brother to assign all these materials to the builders
In the building of the hall we had a good situation, but today in the building of the church we are short of this
We must get into what is taught in Matthew, what is taught in Mark, what is taught in Luke, what is taught in John, in Acts, and so forth
If you teach people in mathematics in a loose way without following this educational system, when they become old, they will not know much
Six years are required to finish elementary school, another six years to finish high school, then another four years to finish college
Suppose a school with a thousand students has no classes formed but only invites people to give good speeches all year round
After some years the one which was for the big meetings, which had the big number, eventually came to a failure with a small number
All the churches have to endeavor to educate every saint fully in the spiritual truths, and to cause them all to grow in life
We should not take the way of selecting some promising homes, and then having the meetings in those promising homes
You may know the Bible be spiritual be seeking love the Lord and so forth but if you do not open your home you are not up to the standard
In one sense, for everyone to come together to have home meetings is an easy thing, but in another sense, it is the hardest thing
We studied much concerning this matter, and thus far, we are still not so sure what is the best way to build up the home meetings
We are trying our best to read, to study, to check out, and even to examine and determine the best way to have the home meetings
Those who are too much for the Pentecostal movement would say Well if you dont have the Holy Ghost you just cannot have any kind of meeting
Today in the whole universe this consummated Holy Spirit is ready for God's seekers to open up and receive Him
If we only teach their mind to know God, to understand the Bible, and to understand the gospel, that is not adequate
The conscience is the main working part of our human spirit, and when we exercise our conscience, we exercise our spirit
Every morning you have to pray, not just to ask the Lord to give you a good day, but to open yourself up again in your spirit
When you do this, you have the sense that deep within you, that is, in your spirit, you are touching the Lord, you are touching the Spirit
According to the context, if you read the entire chapter, you can see that the spirit here does not refer to the Holy Spirit
As a seeking Christian you should not be filled in your body with some physical thing; you should be filled in your spirit
The Bible implies that God created one organ in our being to be the very central organ, that is our human spirit
Verse 13 says, 'But all things which are exposed are made manifest by the light; for everything that makes manifest is light'
It continues from verse 14: 'Wherefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from among the dead, and Christ shall shine on you
Look therefore carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil
We should speak in psalms, such as Psalm 119, a long piece which has 176 verses of 22 sections according to the Hebrew alphabet
Four things are mentioned here: speaking, singing, psalming with your heart to the Lord, and giving thanks at all times for all things
You may think that this has nothing to do with the meeting, but speaking to one another indicates a kind of meeting
Sometimes if you ask to sing a hymn, the answer may be that no one knows the melody and that no one can lead the singing
Ephesians 5:18b says, 'Be filled in spirit,' and 19a says, 'Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs'
The Recovery Version translates Acts 13:52 as follows: 'The disciples were made full of joy and of the Holy Spirit'
At that time their meeting life was a great part of their daily life, because every day they met from house to house
If all six of you were so sad, not doing anything, but just expressing yourselves in this way, every new one would go away
Suppose all six of the brothers and sisters were excited, not performing, but filled with joy, eating food with exultation
Bowing his knees unto the Father, he prayed that the Father would grant the believers to be strengthened into the inner man
He prayed that the Father would grant you to be strengthened according to the riches of His glory, with power, and through His Spirit
Suppose a working brother works the whole day in the office under a lot of pressure and returns home fully exhausted
When his mother-in-law provoked him, he got strengthened into his temper with the riches of the Devil's subtlety
By being strengthened into your spirit, you can overcome the tiredness of your body and the tedious feeling in your soul
To be strengthened that you may be strong to apprehend the measurement, the dimensions of Christ with all the saints indicates meeting
We all need these two things: to be filled in our spirit with the Holy Spirit and to be strengthened into our spirit
Our hymnal includes over eight hundred pieces collected from more than ten thousand pieces from different sources
God's redemption, full salvation, And His resurrection pow'r, Sanctifying, glorifying, All transcending every hour!
He was the 'leastest,' yet this grace was given to him to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel
Even if you include eternal life in the contents of the gospel, still that does not compare with what Paul preached
In Ephesians Paul not only refers to the riches of Christ but also to the fullness of Him that fills all in all
To enjoy, that is, to experience the riches of Christ, we have to realize who Christ is today, and where He is
Psalm 133 says that the ointment upon the head of Aaron flowed down his beard, and even to the skirts of his long robe
Even before my sentence has been finished, the current of electricity has already traveled between the two places
Young sisters, do you all believe that as bona fide believers in Christ today you are one spirit with the Lord?
Do you realize that this is a fact revealed in the Bible, that we, the believers in Christ, are one spirit with Him?
Prior to the day we heard the gospel and were inspired to believe in the Lord Jesus, we did whatever we desired by ourselves
We may realize this fact, but the way we talk to others exposes whether or not we know the way to experience Christ
You will experience Christ as your patience, your endurance, your longsuffering, and your knowledge-surpassing love
Message after message has been given, but when we come to the practical things in our daily life, we are persons without Christ
When we come to the small meetings, we all can spontaneously say something and minister something that is Christ Himself
At this time he and his wife visited many Christian meetings in Taipei, but felt that they had received nothing
We must have something in spirit to pray or to sing or to say that can satisfy the hunger of the real seeking ones
Be my instant utterance, a present utterance, an utterance just for now, an utterance for some definite persons
In the same way we must have the experience and enjoyment of Christ's riches as an accumulation, a storage in us
If we have these four items, we will be the enriching, strengthening, refreshing, and renewing factors of the home meetings
We have to realize that when we speak the experiences of the riches of Christ, our speaking is just the preaching of Christ as the gospel
In Ephesians 3:8 it is to preach the riches of Christ as the gospel; in Acts 5:42 it is to preach Jesus Christ Himself as the good news
Due to the history of Christianity nearly all Christians today, including us, are not used to having mutuality in their meetings
Mostly in the so-called Christian services we see that one or two persons speak and the rest are just the audience
On the other hand, when 1 Corinthians 14 speaks of the meeting, it is referring to the meeting of the church and in the church
When we speak of the home meetings, we are surely referring to the meetings in the church and the meetings of the church
In the preaching or teaching of the meeting of the ministry, there is not much mutuality and not much speaking one to another
Verse 26 says that in this kind of meeting 'each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation'
To have a home meeting without mutuality causes that home meeting to lose its nature; it would not be a home meeting of the church
The meeting in the temple was for the ministry, for Peter and John to minister, to speak, to preach, and to teach
Verse 2 continues, 'You know that when you were of the nations,' the Gentiles, 'you were led away to dumb idols, however you were led'
Although it is not wrong to insert the word gifts in verse 1, we have to study why Paul only wrote 'spiritual'
When we touch or when we exercise the spiritual gifts, we touch a spiritual realm, we touch spiritual things, not only the gifts
Not only the gifts but also the situation, the environment, the atmosphere, the sphere, the realm, the items, and the contents are spiritual
Corinthians 12:2 and 3 say, 'You know that when you were of the nations, you were led away to dumb idols, however you were led
Apparently the composition of these two verses is not logical, but if you get into the spiritual fact, Paul is more than logical
If you do not say, 'Lord Jesus,' but instead you are so polite, so cultured, and so nice, the strangers would not be scared away
What they would say is, 'Well, the meeting in that home is very polite, very nice, and all those people are so cultured'
It would be better to have a meeting shouting, 'O Lord Jesus,' and scare people away with an impression of something
The number one manifestation of the Spirit is in the word of wisdom, not in miracles, not in healings, nor in tongue-speaking
Verse 9 says, 'To a different one faith in the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing in the one Spirit'
Five are for speaking: the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, prophecy, tongues, and interpretation of tongues
You have faith to remove some obstacles, the healing of diseases, the operations of the works of power, and the discerning of spirits
Five are for speaking: the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, prophecy, tongues, and interpretation of tongues
When he talks about the meetings in chapter fourteen, he does not say a word concerning healing or concerning miracles
Concerning all these kinds of speakings Paul says in 141 Pursue love and desire earnestly spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation'
If, however, one player keeps the ball to himself and never lets it go, that is not mutuality, but rather individuality
All the hearers were amazed that they could hear in their own language: 'We hear them speaking in our tongues the great things of God'
Corinthians chapters twelve and fourteen are also portions in the New Testament which talk about tongue-speaking
The first is the word of wisdom and the second is the word of knowledge, but the last two are tongue-speaking and interpretation of tongues
In Paul's writings, tongues and their interpretation are at the tail of every list, but today's practice makes the tail the head
Verses 1012 say Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body
For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh
We must exercise such a spirit to believe and to speak the things we have experienced of the Lord, especially His death and resurrection
We must exercise our spirit to believe what we have experienced; then we must exercise our spirit to speak what we believe
In the previous message we saw that in order to practice the home meetings, mutuality and speaking must be stressed very much
In the two Biblical languages, Hebrew and Greek, the word for prophesy means not primarily to predict, but to speak for God
In your speaking you not only speak for God, but also in this kind of divine speaking you speak God forth into others
In Isaiah a book of sixtysix chapters perhaps all the foretellings all the predictions could only comprise the equivalent of one chapter
They always opened their prophecy with 'My people, time is short,' and they always ended it with 'thus saith the Lord'
In the New Testament, when the Lord Jesus spoke in the four Gospels, He never ended His speaking with 'thus saith the Lord'
He did not say, 'Thus saith the Lord,' but he wrote, 'I give my opinion as having received mercy of the Lord to be faithful'
According to the principle revealed in the Scriptures to speak God to speak forth Christ and to speak for Christ surely we need the Spirit
When you talk about science, geography, history, or the political situation, the more you talk, the more you feel quite proud
For this reason, in the Old Testament, when the seventy were going to prophesy, the Spirit of God descended upon them
He went through all the necessary processes and in His resurrection He breathed Himself as the lifegiving Spirit into His disciples into us
Not only so, in His ascension He has poured Himself out as the economical, processed Triune Spirit upon all the members of His Body
All the members of His Body, in ancient or in modern time, Greek or Jew, slave or free, were once for all baptized in one Spirit
Whenever we would not care for the environment or the circumstances, but would only care for what the Bible says, we exercise our faith
In the New Testament, especially in the Acts, the baptism of the Spirit refers to the descending of the Spirit upon the believers
Even at home when you talk to your family concerning Christ, you have to exercise your faith, and you have to exercise your spirit
Regretfully, we feel that it is only when we are to release a message that we need faith, the spirit, and the Holy Spirit
When you do this by the exercise of your believing ability, your spirit is involved and the Holy Spirit is also involved
Brother Lee, you have to thank God for His mercy that He created you in this way-speaking, speaking, speaking all the time
The principle is this: if you do not speak a certain word very many times, that word could never be a psalm or a song
We need to become accustomed to it to such an extent that whatever we say will be a kind of poetry-a song, a psalm, and a hymn
We exercise such a spirit of faith to realize that we are really in the spirit, and that the Spirit is upon us and is also within us
We have studied church history, and we have read the biographies and classic writings of the Lord's servants through the past centuries
Even we ourselves have passed through Christianity for a long time and we have experienced very much of the church life
They also believe superstitious stories about angelic activities which are said to have occurred centuries ago in Spain, France, and Italy
Our situation is just like a housewife whose husband bought a lot of groceries for her, but she never cooked them
If you want to gradually commit suicide, not only for yourself, but also for all your children, it is up to you
Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching'
The double honor includes financial supply because they are laboring so much; they are fully occupied with the need of the church
You have to realize in our practice of the church life, the speaking of the elders has been mainly to give a message
To give a message is easy, but to take care of the church as an elder or to do some cooking all the time for the saints is hard
The way to build up the church is to gather the saints together, encouraging them to speak, even charging them to speak one by one
Every time you attend a big meeting or a small meeting, you should labor very much before the meeting in the Word
In case they do not have anything to open the meeting with, after just a few minutes you have to serve them a cooked dish
That means you have to give them a living word lasting less than ten minutes that is rich, enlightening, stirring, and watering
According to my observation, to take care of a church as an elder is harder than just to go out and hold conferences
To hold conferences is quite an enjoyment, but to stay in a locality to take care of at least four or five meetings a week is not so easy
To take care of the church is a heavy burden, and the heaviest point of this burden is to take care of the meetings
You have to realize that in a family such a good mother has to do another necessary thing, that is, to teach her children
When they come home with their school lesson books, you have to charge them to work on those lesson books, and you have to teach them
Many things have to be done just for passing on the proper knowledge of the human culture to our children for their education
It is no wonder that Paul says that overseers must be apt to teach and the elders have to labor in word and teaching
Just as a housewife, you have to cook with adequate time the proper, nourishing, tasty, and inexpensive food for your family
If the mothers could not do the work of teaching at home, the children would have a hard time going on in their education
You cannot write too many pages, nor can you list too many points, yet you must cover all the crucial points of a certain subject
From January, 1985, until now, they have also baptized four to five hundred college, high school, or junior high students
The total seems quite large, yet with 400 small groups, this averages to less than three new ones per group per month
We have printed thousands of pages of the truth and most of you have bought these pages and put them on your shelves
We all know the terms and the subject areas, but we just do not know how to present them, how to teach them to people
The leading ones must rise up to become educated, equipped, and prepared by laboring in the Word and laboring in teaching
Brothers and sisters, consider how much time you spend on the phone rather than on the Bible or the life-study messages
We always take an excuse saying, 'I do not have the time,' but you do have time to spend ten minutes looking at the newspaper
It is difficult for the Bible students to determine whether the phrase 'in all wisdom' qualifies 'let the word
The Lord Jesus said, 'But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses'
In the past you may have had the desire to speak something from the Bible, yet you felt that you were short of utterance, short of words
If you do not read the Bible and therefore lack a rich deposit of the divine Word, you will come to the meeting empty
We have to thank the Lord that on this earth, two great gifts have been given to humankind and to God's chosen people
In this universe and on this earth, there is such a book which is called 'the Book,' Bible is a Latin word that means 'the Book'
Ephesians 4:30 says, 'And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption'
Today we are seeking after Him and we love Him, yet we mostly care for ourselves, not for the holy Word or for the Holy Spirit
When you come to the meeting it will be easy to receive some distribution from the Spirit either the word of wisdom or the word of knowledge
That would be like going to the gas station to get your tires pumped up, but leaving before the tires are filled
In this way you will spontaneously have the sensation, the assurance, that you are speaking the holy Word with the Holy Spirit
We speak the holy Word for these four things: to preach the gospel, to release the truth, to minister life, and to recover the weaker ones
You have to believe that when you speak, the Holy Spirit always follows your speaking and honors your speaking, and people will be saved
When you speak to your aunt, do not say, 'You have to believe in the Lord Jesus, otherwise you will go to hell'
From these two sources you can find the answers to all your questions and you can receive the living and rich word
Nearly all Christians know that our God is triune, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, yet that is all they know
They will enjoy the grace of Christ the Son and the love of God the Father and will have a share in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
It would be a pity if you have been with us for over five years, yet are still not so full of the riches of the holy Word
In back of you, in front of you, above and below you, there are many riches, but all the riches are not in you
We all need to realize the situation and pick up the riches of the holy Word that we may speak to people the living and rich word
Due to our shortage in the Word of God, when we try to help others, we just do not have the utterance to say anything
The most we could say might be, 'You have to love the Lord, and realize that the Lord loves you and is trustworthy'
We need to minister something new, something of our own experience, something that we have discovered, something that we have gone through
Prepare yourself with a lot of endurance, a lot of divine patience to take this way for at least three or four years
When you come to the meeting, whether or not you have the feeling that you are inspired or led, you will just speak
