<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>By the Members of the Body Holding to Truth<br>in Love That They May Grow Up<br>into the Head, Christ, in All Things</H2><P>Ephesians 4:15 says, "But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ." Because all the riches of the Head have been dispensed into us, we grow with these riches in all things into the Head. Then out from the Head all the Body, joined closely together through every joint of the rich supply and knit together (interwoven) through the operation of each part in its measure, causes the growth of the Body, through the dispensing of the riches of the processed Triune God, unto the organic building up of the Body itself in love (v. 16).</P><P>In Ephesians 4:16 there are two groups of believers or members. One group is the joints of the rich supply. These joints supply the Body. The second group includes the parts which function in their measure. Through these two groups, the Body is joined closely together and knit together. In a physical building of stones, there is also the joining and the knitting. The frames of the building need to be joined together. This corresponds to the work of the joints of the rich supply, who join together the members. Once the building is framed, the gaps are filled by interweaving pieces of stone between the frames. This is the knitting together. Eventually, all the parts of the building are made one. The Body of Christ is the organic building, the organism of the Triune God. By the joining closely together and knitting together, this organic building will not only be one but will also cause its own growth unto the building up of itself in love.</P><P>The intrinsic concept of verse 16 is the dispensing of the Triune God. This dispensing is through the Head, through the gifted persons, and through the perfected ones, that the Body may be built up. First, the Head initiates the dispensing to the gifted persons. Then this dispensing goes through the gifted persons to the perfected ones. Then the perfected ones, the functioning ones, will dispense to others. It is by this thorough step-by-step dispensing that the Body grows and builds itself up. This is the dispensing of the consummated Triune God, the pneumatic Christ as the life-giving Spirit. He is anointing, moving, feeding, nourishing, strengthening, comforting, encouraging, and working within us. Every day we have to come back to the Spirit and remain in Him all the time. We must be one with the moving One within us. Then we will experience His fine work of divine dispensing. The work of the divine dispensing will not be finalized until our body is saturated and permeated by the sealing Spirit to be glorified.</P>
