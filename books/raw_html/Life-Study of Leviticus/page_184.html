<h2 class=head3>1. The Feast of the Passover</h2><p>“These are the appointed seasons of Jehovah, the holy convocations, which you shall proclaim at their appointed times. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening is the passover to Jehovah” (vv. 4-5). The feast of the Passover signifies Christ (1 Cor. 5:7b) as our redemption to begin our enjoyment of God’s salvation with God.<h2 class=head4>a. In the First Month of the Year</h2><p>The Passover is in the first month of the year. This signifies the beginning of a course.<h2 class=head4>b. In the Denotation of a Passing Over</h2><p>The Passover is in the denotation of a passing over. This signifies that the judging God has passed over us, the sinners who are in our sins, so that we may enjoy Him as our feast. Today we have a feast, which is the redeeming God Himself, and we are enjoying Him for rest and for joy.<h2 class=head3>2. The Feast of Unleavened Bread</h2><p>“And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread to Jehovah; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work. For seven days you shall offer an offering by fire to Jehovah. On the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work” (Lev. 23:6-8). The feast of unleavened bread signifies the Christ who is without sin (2 Cor. 5:21) for our enjoyment as a feast in a life apart from sin.<p>The feast of unleavened bread, the second feast, begins immediately after the first feast, the Passover. The first feast is on the fourteenth day of the first month, and the second feast begins on the next day. Actually, these two feasts—the feast of Passover and the feast of unleavened bread—are put together. The first feast is the beginning, and the second is the continuation. Whereas the first feast is for just one day, the fourteenth day of the first month, the second feast lasts for seven days, from the fifteenth day through the twenty-first day.<p>In that the feast of unleavened bread lasts for seven days, it typifies, or signifies, the entire course of our Christian life. The course of our entire Christian life is a feast of unleavened bread, a feast without sin. We have been redeemed from sin, and now the Redeemer, who is without sin, is our feast for our entire Christian life. Today we are in a feast enjoying rest, enjoying God, and enjoying our Redeemer, apart from sin. As those who are enjoying this feast, we have nothing to do with sin.
