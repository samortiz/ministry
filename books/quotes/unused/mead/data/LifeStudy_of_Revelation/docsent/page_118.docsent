   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. The Need 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Great Tribulation Is Coming</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us firstly consider the need of the rapture of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew 24:21 reveals that the great tribulation is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Matthew 24:22 says, And except those days were cut short, no flesh at all would be saved; but because of the elect, those days shall be cut short.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The great tribulation will be so severe that its days must be shortened if any are to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A Snare on All the Earth s Dwellers Is Coming</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Another need for the rapture is that a snare on all the earth s dwellers is coming Luke 21:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just as a fisherman spreads a net to snare fish, so Satan is spreading his net to snare us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Luke 21:34 the Lord mentions three things related to the snare spoken of in verse 35: And take heed to yourselves lest at some time your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and anxieties of life, and that day come upon you suddenly as a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this verse the Lord mentions dissipation eating , drunkenness drinking , and the anxieties of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since World War II, nearly everyone on earth has been occupied with these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Industry, for example, is altogether for the cares of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The same is true of finance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the universities are for industry, industry is for money, and money is for the cares of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Consider the billions of people on the earth today: their only concern is the cares of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everything they are involved in education, industry, politics, warfare revolves around the cares of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eating, drinking, and the cares of this life are the three main elements of the devilish snare, the net used by Satan to trap everyone on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In these verses in Luke, the Lord Jesus is saying that the time will come when all the dwellers on earth will be snared.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have been alive for more than seventy years and I have been observing the world situation for nearly sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I know what human life is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have studied human history, I have read the newspapers, and I have observed the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have discovered that, especially since World War II, people care for nothing except their physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God did not create the earth in a haphazard way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No, His creation is beautiful and contains many fine things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if we are snared by any of these things, we shall be caught by them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For instance, it is necessary and proper to maintain a suitable dwelling place for ourselves, but we must be on the alert not to be snared by it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although there is the grave danger of being snared by eating, drinking, and the cares of this life, we still need to live a normal human life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The young people need to obtain a good education, for this is necessary in order to earn a living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not excuse yourself by saying, I don t care for this life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since I only love the Lord, I will give up studying and just praise the Lord all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you do this, you will be a burden to others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may be all right, but others will not be.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may claim to have faith, but your so-called faith will force others to labor for you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No, you must study diligently and do well in school.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, do not do this for the purpose of making a name for yourself or of becoming a person of renown.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although you must study, do not allow education to be your snare.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Still some may say, Because I don t want to be snared, I won t go to school.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It s better to spend all my time reading the Bible and fellowshipping with all my young colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Wouldn t this be wonderful?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many young people have this mistaken concept, saying, The Lord Jesus might come tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why then should we study so much?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a waste of time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although the Lord might come tomorrow, because of your laziness, He may tarry until you have learned to study and have graduated from school.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As fallen people, we are unbalanced.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Matthew 24:40 speaks of two being in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It does not say that two are sleeping, fellowshipping, or living wholly for the Lord without engaging in any work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some might say, Since the Lord might come back tomorrow, why must we work in the field?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If necessary, we could even fast for three meals until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I once heard a message in which the speaker said, How wonderful it would be if, when the Lord comes, my wife and I would be praising and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the Bible does not indicate that we shall be doing these things when He appears.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, Matthew 24:41 speaks of two women grinding at the mill. In ancient times, the most difficult work for women was grinding wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If I were one of the women in those days, I might have said, The young brothers have helped us to know that the Lord Jesus might come back tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What then is the need to labor at grinding wheat?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a waste of time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why must we still grind flour if the Lord is coming tonight?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let s just sit here and wait for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is an illustration of one extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the other extreme are those Christians who care for nothing except making money and spending it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They say, Oh, we shouldn t be so spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must be practical and take care of our wives and children.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I must support my family and care for many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I don t have the time to attend the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Can t we worship God at home?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To those at this extreme, the Lord may say, I will come as a thief.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I will come at the time when you least expect Me. Perhaps I ll come when you are engrossed with making money.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But to those on the other extreme, He may say, Because of you, I will delay My coming.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You are too earnest for My coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You are so earnest that you don t do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You don t even take care of your cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I will delay My coming until you learn to cook, make money, and take care of yourself and others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I mean what I am saying and I am serious about it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the poor situation among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We all must do our duty to earn a living, yet we must do it without being snared by it.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We may have many things, but we must never allow them to rule us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Learn to be balanced, falling neither into the extreme of idleness nor into the extreme of being occupied with the affairs of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>With this matter, as in so many other things, there are two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Consider the example of the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Was he not waiting for the Lord s coming back?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you examine his writings, you will see that all of them were for the long run.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He never said, Dear saints, because the Lord Jesus might come tomorrow, you don t need to do so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You should just sit around and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>No, in his epistles Paul seemed to be saying, While we are waiting for the Lord s coming back, we must still live in a normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Although we do not know when the Lord will come, we do know that as long as we are on earth, we must have a normal living to be the proper testimony of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must obtain the best education and have a balanced daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We also must maintain our houses and, in every respect, be normal people.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>As those who are waiting for the Lord s coming back, we must have a proper living without being snared by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Our heart is on nothing but the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>However, this does not mean that we do not study, conduct business, and take care of daily chores, such as cleaning.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Do not say, Why must I keep my clothes neat and clean?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is a waste of time and money to do the laundry.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Lord doesn t care for the flesh; He only cares for my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>As long as my spirit is clean, everything is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I have the assurance that many young people still have this attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They do not even make their beds in the morning, considering it to be a waste of their time.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>As long as they have a place to lie down, they are satisfied, thinking that they can spend their time reading the Bible or spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>They do not know why they must work to keep their room neat, clean, and orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Their sloppiness may delay the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The Lord may tell them, You must learn to make your bed early in the morning, comb your hair, and shine your shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Then you must arrange all your books in a good order.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Don t put the New Testament before the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>No elder who is careless can be useful in building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We must learn to be diligent, keeping everything in good order.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>However, we should not dream about those things at night.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Rather, when the Lord says, Behold, I come quickly, we must be able to forget everything.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Some keep their things in good order, but this becomes a snare to them.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This is a test to determine where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We are here as the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We are normal people living a normal life, but nothing of this life can touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We are not sloppy, idle, lazy, or careless.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Yet, nothing in this world has any control over us.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>These two sides of the matter will force us to be one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>What is the meaning of rapture?</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>It is to be taken into the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If you would be taken into His presence, you must be in His presence today.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Much of your praising and fellowshipping may not be in His presence, but may simply be according to your own choice.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>You are not in the presence of the Lord, but in your preference and taste.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>When you desire to fellowship, the Lord may say, Go to work or study.</S>
