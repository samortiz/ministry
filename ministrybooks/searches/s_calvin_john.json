In 1890 a committee of seven men was formed for the translation of the Bible. The chairman of the committee was Calvin Wilson Mateer, who founded Chilu University in Shantung Province. The seven men on the committee were usually in different places, each translating at his own pace. Every summer they would meet in Chefoo to work together. Because each verse had been translated in many different ways, they would put the different renderings side by side and consider which would be best for the final version. An elderly brother among us, Brother Chu, assisted Mr. Mateer by copying the translation of the Bible. The committee spent a total of [388] twenty-nine years on this translation of the Bible, finishing in 1919. The Chinese Union Version is the best Chinese translation of the Bible.

One story says that he learned Chinese in an idol temple. This illustrates the fact that when the missionaries first came to China, it was difficult for them to contact the Chinese people. It was not only difficult for them to find places to stay but also to find food to eat. When they went out to buy food, people were not necessarily willing to sell to them. Thus, in the beginning their situation was very difficult. The conservative, closed attitude among the Chinese was especially strong in the northern part of China; it is truly beyond description. But God is really God; He is over all things and controls all situations, causing all things to work together for His gospel. Regardless of how closed and conservative the Chinese were, God still opened the door for the gospel.

In the half century from 1850 to 1900, the Lord graced China with many good evangelists. When Robert Morrison came to China in 1807, he was hardly able to preach the gospel at all, so we cannot say that the gospel work in China began with him. It was not until Hudson Taylor came to China in the 1860s that the gospel work in China had a good start. Brother Hudson Taylor\u2019s biography shows that God sent him to preach the gospel to the Chinese. Others, like Hunter Corbett and Calvin Wilson Mateer, loved the Lord and suffered for the gospel, even to the extent of giving up their lives. They testified before both God and man.

Schwenckfeld focused on life and wrote about the tree of life, the New Jerusalem, and the spirit, but Calvin considered Schwenckfeld to be demon-possessed. This comforted me and caused me to realize that when we focus on the experience of life, it is easy to be accused of having contradicting doctrines.

Christian theology has at least four or more major schools. Catholic theology is one major school, and it may be called sacramental theology. Then there is reformed theology, mostly based upon the teachings of John Calvin. This kind of theology also had much to do with the Reformation, which was under the leadership of Martin Luther. Then later on we can see dispensational theology, which is the theology of the Brethren. The Brethren were very much for Calvin in the matter of predestination, but they would not go along completely with reformed theology. Then there is what I call secular theology. This is not taught in the theological seminaries or Bible institutes but in the secular universities that have schools of divinity. Their teaching of theology is what I would consider as a secular item. Even some theological schools are not so pure for theology itself but are more in the realm of studying the Bible as a type of literature. We may call this kind of theology academic theology. All the Christian publications on today\u2019s bookshelves have come out under these main schools of theology. Today in the United States we see all these kinds of theologies with their students.

One is the Calvinist school of predestination, which I call the revelation of God\u2019s predestination. Calvin saw that our salvation was not initiated by ourselves but rather that we have been selected and predestinated by God before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4-5). This predestination is eternal and unchangeable; therefore, the saved ones will never perish. On the other hand, those of the Arminian school believe that whether we are saved eternally or not depends upon ourselves, that is, that we are responsible for our salvation. Therefore, we must do our best to walk according to God\u2019s will, or else we may still perish. I call this \u201celevator salvation\u201d: when we are saved, we are up; [163] when we sin, we are down. The Baptist Church accepts Calvin\u2019s revelation of God\u2019s predestination, and so do the Presbyterians. The Pentecostals, holiness groups, and the Assemblies of God are mostly Arminian in that they emphasize human responsibility and ignore God\u2019s selection. This is heresy. Calvin saw the revelation of God\u2019s predestination, and this is right.

He asserted that God chose and predestinated us in eternity past to be saved once for all (Eph. 1:4-5). Although this revelation is correct, the Arminians oppose this view. They believe that even though our salvation is by God\u2019s grace, if we do not fulfill our responsibility after being saved, we will lose our salvation. Therefore, in their view salvation is not once for all; after being saved we still may perish. But if we repent, we can be saved again. This concept totally emphasizes man\u2019s responsibility, and it is therefore called the doctrine of human responsibility. Of these two schools, we accept the former totally and reject the latter entirely. Then how can we resolve the dispute between these two schools? How can they be balanced? According to the history of theology, after Calvin and Arminius, another group of theologians emerged, beginning from Govett, then Panton, and then Pember. Their school has formed a line concerning the truth of the kingdom in the New Testament. They saw that once a person is saved, he will not perish forever (John 10:28). However, in order to encourage those who follow Him faithfully after salvation, God has set up a kingdom full of requirements to be their reward. If one is faithful, he will be rewarded (Matt. 24:45-47; 25:19-23). If one is not faithful, he will be punished and will lose the kingdom, but he himself will still be saved [173] (24:48-51; 25:24-30; 1 Cor. 3:10, 12-15).

I have told you all this even though you may not understand immediately. Later, when you\u2014especially the young people\u2014read the books among us, you will discover that what we say is similar to the Brethren theology and similar to the life line of the mystics and that we also acknowledge absolutely Calvin\u2019s view of God\u2019s predestination. The problem pointed out by the Arminians is not concerning perdition but concerning being unable to receive the kingdom.

There are many Bible truths that have been misunderstood. In fact, not many today have learned the Bible in an orderly, orthodox, and step-by-step way. This was why in a previous chapter I showed you the way to understand the truth. We must understand it literally, and we also need to take care of the context, using the entire Bible to explain any one verse. Furthermore, we need to go beyond the letter to search for the revelation of life. Then we need to remember that the Brethren theology is the best and should be accepted. The things of the inner-life school and Calvin\u2019s vision of God\u2019s predestination should also be accepted. But the Arminian doctrine of human responsibility should not be accepted. Furthermore, the truth of the kingdom reward and punishment also should be accepted. If these are kept in mind, our Bible exposition will be more or less up to the standard.

But once there was the blessing of the Lord, men organized something to contain the blessing. Although the Lord\u2019s blessing is still there, the sphere remains only that big. The Protestant churches are like a cup. At the beginning of revival, people will go wherever there is living water. Wherever the Spirit of God is moving, people will go in that direction. Men used a cup with the hope of preserving the living water without loss. The advantage of doing this is that it keeps the grace, and the disadvantage is that there is just one cup of blessing. In the first generation the cup was full. By the second generation the cup was only half filled, and the nebulousness began. By the third or fifth generation, the water was gone and only an empty cup was left. Then they began to argue with other denominations as to whose cup was better, though all the cups were worthless for drinking. What was the result? God reacted again, and in came another Sardis. This is the whole history of revival. When the grace of God comes, men immediately set up an organization to keep it. The organization remains, but the content is lost. However, the cup cannot be broken; there are always those who are zealous to maintain the cup continuously. Here is a matter of principle: The students of Wesley could never be equal to Wesley, nor could the students of Calvin match Calvin. The schools of the prophets seldom produced prophets\u2014all the great prophets were chosen by God from the wilderness. The Spirit of God descends upon whomsoever He will. He is the Head of the church, not we. Men always think the living water is valuable and must be [58] kept by organization, but it gradually declines through the generations until it completely dries up.

There is no indication that Martin Luther or John Calvin ever spoke in tongues. Charles Spurgeon, the \u201cking\u201d of preachers from England, also never spoke in tongues; neither did D. L. Moody, the great evangelist from the United States. Today the famous American preacher, Billy Graham, has led millions of people to salvation through his preaching, but he has never spoken in tongues. John Nelson Darby knew the Bible and knew God quite well. Not only did he not speak in tongues, but he also said that the age of tongue-speaking has passed. He said this, but he was very much used by the Lord. Furthermore, Andrew Murray, who saw much concerning the indwelling Christ, never spoke in tongues. Jessie Penn-Lewis knew the cross quite well, but she never spoke in tongues. George M\u00fcller, the \u201cking\u201d of faith, never spoke in tongues either. Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission, was quite spiritual. He came to China to begin the mission work of the China Inland Mission and brought thousands of uneducated Chinese to the Lord. However, he never spoke in tongues, and he absolutely opposed the Pentecostal movement. Even T. Austin-Sparks, whom we know very well, has never spoken in tongues. He not only never speaks in tongues, but he is absolutely against it. Therefore, if not speaking in tongues means not having received the Holy Spirit, what can we say about these ones who were greatly used by the Lord? None of them spoke in tongues. How could it be that none of them were saved?

Rather, they are on the church and the government of the church. If in this aspect we would allow the Bible to speak instead of allowing the Protestant [491] churches to speak, the question of church government would be as clear as the gospel is. Whether or not we are willing to do it, we should allow the Bible to solve all problems. If we do this, we will see that neither the teachings of Luther, the teachings of Calvin, the Anglican Church, nor the Genevan Church have brought us back to the initial position of the church. The Body of Christ and the spiritual house built with living stones are the truths that they are ignorant of. We know that the churches then were all \u201cnational churches.\u201d This means that the churches had as their boundaries the national boundaries and were thus national churches. At the time of the Roman Catholic Church, all the nations had become Christianized already. Those who had left Jezebel were now taking Christianity as the state religion. All that the Reformation gave them was a new creed. It did not give them a new organization. Almost all the Protestant churches were national churches. This is, of course, an imitation of the work of the Roman Church. We cannot find such a method of church organization in the Bible. If believers take the Reformation as the standard of truth, they are fully wrong at least in the matter of church organization. When Luther stood up personally to oppose the pope, we see him fearless in power and bold to contend with the strong forces. We have to admit that this is God\u2019s work manifested in a weak human being. The Reformation is truly a work of faith. On the other hand, however, we have to admit that there were elements of politics in the Reformation. Those who rose up to support the Reformation probably did so more for the reason of opposing the domination of Rome than with a zeal for the Word of God. In the end, soldiers, politicians, nations, and believers were standing on the same ground and were engaging in the same struggle. After this period of history, there was, of course, no hope for the post-Reformation Protestant churches to be the same as the churches in the first century.

After he was raised up, he faced persecution everywhere, first in Switzerland and then in Germany. Wherever he went, he was met with persecution and exile. Finally, in Scotland he had a fresh beginning and established the Scottish Presbyterian Church.

The church which Paul was in is the same church that we are in. The church that we are in is the same church that the apostle John, Martin Luther, John Calvin, and all regenerated persons are in. The church in the Bible is not separated by time, locality, or race. There is only one church, which exists at all times and in all places. There are not two churches. The Bible only recognizes one Body of Christ and never recognizes two, because there is only one Head. Although there are many members in the Body, the Body is singular. Therefore, all saved persons past and present, here and elsewhere constitute one church and one Body. If this is the case, why are there \u201cchurches\u201d in different places? Since Ephesians mentions one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God, why does the Bible mention churches also? Is this not a contradiction? Why is it that, on the one hand, there is only one Body, but on the other hand, there are many churches? This shows us that there are different views in the Bible concerning the Body of Christ and the local churches. Strictly speaking, there is only one church, in the same way that there is only one Body of Christ. However, in each locality, there may be as many as three to five thousand believers, or there may be as few as two or three, as described in Matthew 18. As long as there is a group of believers meeting together in a city or a town, that group of believers constitutes the church in that city or town. Therefore, in the original language, the Bible clearly shows us that the church is \u201cthe church in such-and-such place.\u201d The word in indicates that there is only one church, which is scattered and sojourning in different places. The Bible calls the meeting [56] of those who sojourn and meet together in one place a local church; it serves as a miniature representation of the unique church.

This definition is generally found in all the well-known Greek lexicons and is commonly acknowledged by the reputable Bible scholars throughout the generations, Martin Luther said, \u201cI wish that whoever is to be baptized should be sunken entirely into the water, for this would be right according to the meaning of the word \u2018baptism.\u2019\u201d John Calvin, a great Bible expositor of the Reformation, also [76] said, \u201cThe word \u2018baptize\u2019 means to immerse, and it is clear that the rite of immersion was observed in the ancient church.\u201d Therefore, there is no doubt that the meaning of the word baptism is immersion.
