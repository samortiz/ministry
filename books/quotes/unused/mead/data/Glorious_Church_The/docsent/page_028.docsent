   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>John 6:63 says, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Did the Jews not have the logos of God?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yes, they did.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They were very familiar with it and could recite the Old Testament commandments very well, but it was of no use to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only the words which the Lord spoke to them were spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only rhema is spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mark 14:72 says, "And immediately a rooster crowed a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And Peter remembered the word, how Jesus had said to him, Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And thinking upon it, he wept."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Peter recalled the rhema that Jesus had spoken to him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The rhema was that which was brought to his remembrance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While Peter was telling a lie, suddenly rhema came.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The very sentence of the Lord came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rhema is the word which the Lord has spoken, and now He speaks it again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Luke 1:38 Mary said, "Behold, the slave of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>May it happen to me according to your word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And the angel departed from her."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this verse rhema is used.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was not just a word of prophecy in Isaiah 7:14, "Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son," but a word that was spoken specifically to Mary by the angel, "Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son" Luke 1:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because Mary heard this, she received strength and it was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Luke 2:29 Simeon said, "Now You release Your slave, Master, according to Your word, in peace."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Word" in this verse is rhema.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before the Lord Jesus came, God spoke His word to Simeon that he would not see death until he had seen the Lord's Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But on the day he saw the Lord Jesus, Simeon said, "Now You release Your slave, Master, according to Your word, in peace."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Simeon had rhema from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was not according to a certain chapter or a certain verse in the Bible, but it was according to the word spoken to him on that day by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Merely having the word from a certain chapter and verse in the Bible is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only the word which the Lord speaks to us is of any use.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The rhema reveals something to us personally and directly; it shows us what we need to deal with and what we need to be cleansed from.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must specifically seek after this very matter, because our Christian life is based on this rhema.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What word has God really spoken to us, and how has He spoken to us?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must remember that today's Christianity is still the Christianity of personal revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the Lord does not speak within man, it is not Christianity, nor is it the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Luke 3:2 says, "During the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zachariah in the wilderness."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Word" in this verse is also rhema.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Luke 5:5 says, "Simon answered and said, Master, through the whole night we toiled and caught nothing; but based on Your word I will let down the nets."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The "word" in this verse was something spoken by the Lord for that occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was the Lord speaking personally to Simon.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is rhema.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord did not speak in a certain chapter and verse of the Scripture that Simon should let down the net.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If someone attempted to walk on the sea because of Matthew 14:29, he would certainly sink.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not the word which the Lord is speaking today, though He did speak it on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is true that the word spoken by God in the past and the word He speaks today carry the same authority; they have never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the important thing is this: Is God speaking that very word to us today?</S>
