<h1 class="title">THE SALVATION OF THE SOUL</h1>
<p>In this message we shall cover the matter of the salvation of the soul. James 1:21 speaks of the saving of the soul, and 1 Corinthians 5:5 speaks of the saving of the spirit. Other verses also mention the saving of the soul. For example, 1 Peter 1:9 says, &ldquo;Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.&rdquo; James 1:21 tells us to receive in meekness the implanted word which is able to save our souls (Gk.). Some Christians consider the saving of the spirit the same as the saving of the soul. However, according to the New Testament, our spirit and soul are two different things. First Thessalonians 5:23 reveals clearly that we are a tripartite man composed of spirit and soul and body. Thus, these three parts are distinct from one another.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THREE ASPECTS OF GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION</h2>
<p>Because man is a tripartite being, God&rsquo;s salvation revealed in the Bible is of three aspects. Firstly, God saves our spirit by regeneration. Then He works to transform our soul so that our soul may be saved. Finally, Romans 8 says that our body will be redeemed, that is, transfigured. Therefore, God&rsquo;s salvation is a complete salvation for our entire being, spirit, soul, and body. With God&rsquo;s salvation there are three aspects, the aspects of the saving of our spirit, soul, and body.</p>
<p>Many Christians are clear that regeneration is the saving of the spirit. Furthermore, all genuine Christians believe that when the Lord Jesus comes back, our body will be changed. However, not many Christians have a clear understanding of the salvation of the soul or of the verses that refer to this matter (Matt. 16:25; Heb. 10:39; James 1:21). When I was young, I was troubled by these verses. I said to myself, &ldquo;I have received salvation already. Why must I wait to receive the salvation of the soul?&rdquo; According to the New Testament, we all have received salvation in our spirit. When we believed in the Lord Jesus and were washed in His blood, we were regenerated by the Holy Spirit and saved. Although the salvation in our spirit is ours already, there is another kind of salvation, the salvation of our soul, for which we must wait until the Lord comes back. This salvation is not obtained merely by believing; it must be accomplished by the implanted word. The living word of God is implanted into our being to work out something. As the years have passed, the light has shone brighter and brighter on the matter of the saving of the soul, and we were able to differentiate the three aspects of God&rsquo;s salvation corresponding to the three parts of our being. Our spirit is fallen. For this, we need salvation in our spirit. Our soul has been ruined. For this, we need salvation for our ruined soul. Furthermore, our body has been corrupted and is subject to death. Hence, we need salvation for our corrupted and dying body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING AND DIGESTING GOD</h2>
<p>The book of Genesis reveals that God created man with the purpose of expressing Himself through man. In order to fulfill this purpose, God created man with three parts, one of which is the human spirit, the organ by which we contact God and receive Him into us. Just as God created the stomach to receive and digest food, so He created our spirit to contact, receive, and even digest God. When the Lord Jesus, God incarnate, came, He said that He was the bread of life and that whoever ate Him would live by Him (John 6:48, 57). Thus, the very God incarnate likened Himself to the food supply. Food is not meant to be preserved in storage or in a refrigerator, but to be taken in and digested by us. The fact that the Lord Jesus likened Himself to the food supply, the bread of life, indicates that we need to eat Him and digest Him. Are you troubled by the thought that man can digest God? Digesting God is a very positive thing, because God&rsquo;s intention is to work Himself into our being. The only way something outside of us can be wrought into our being is through eating and digesting it. Therefore, God created us with a spirit as the organ to receive Him and digest Him, that is, to take Him as our life supply.</p>
<p>John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and that they who worship Him must worship Him in spirit. This means that we need to contact God. When we contact Him, He comes into us not only as our life, but also as our life supply. The Lord is both life and the bread of life. In John 11:25 the Lord said that He was life, and in John 6 He said that He was the bread of life. After we receive life, we must have the life supply. If a baby does not receive nourishment after it is born, it will die. Firstly, Christ becomes our life. Immediately after this, the very Christ who is our life becomes our life supply. This is not a matter in our mind, but in our spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
