<P>Now I would like to say a word of love, advice, and warning. We should not think that we will abandon the churches which are in the old way. That is absolutely wrong. We will not abandon anyone or any church. Rather, we would still take care of them and help them. It does not matter whether a church is high or low, living or not living; it is still the church. We still have to bear the burden to take care of that church. We should never criticize, despise, or form parties. We must maintain the present churches. Otherwise, the Lord's recovery is finished. If we lose the churches, we lose the recovery.</P><P>On the one hand, you elders must take care of the church and participate in the normal church life. On the other hand, you should practice the new way, the "computer way." The elders should take the lead to practice the "computer way" of contacting sinners. Then within a short time your practice will influence others. Others will rise up to follow you. You do not need to make an announcement. You do not need to promote this in the meeting. On the one hand, you should just go along with the church. On the other hand, you should practice the "computer way" to save sinners. Nobody will condemn you as long as you do not promote, criticize, despise, or form parties among the saints. Rather, all will appreciate what you are doing.</P><P>There are a number of saints who will not be able to take this way, but they will still appreciate your taking of the new way. I appreciate all the saints who are able to use a computer, even though I myself do not use one. We should sympathize with the saints who do not feel that they can take the new way. But at least we should expect that one-fifth of the saints will take the "computer way." If one-fifth take this way, the "computer age" will be brought in. Not everyone in the United States can use a computer, but many people can. The using of the computer is gradually spreading into all parts of society. At the initial stage, I only expect one-fifth of the saints in the church to know and practice the "computer way." I believe that this will issue in a thirty-percent increase yearly.</P><P>This fellowship is very crucial. We need to be the forerunners who take the new way, the God-ordained way. We all need the Lord's grace to have a change in our concept in shepherding the church. First, you have to release everything concerning the church out of your hand, and let the saints share in these things. You need to be revolutionized with this thought. It is hard to ask the saints to take the "computer way" if you do not take it first. You should take the lead to learn the "computer." Then the "computer age" will come into the Lord's recovery. Our way of contacting sinners is the most effective and quick way. This way will change the entire structure of the Lord's recovery.</P><P>There are some churches in the recovery that have had about the same number for over ten years. The saints merely come together in a routine way every week. There is no "new blood," no new element. Today we need the spreading and the increase. I hope that within the next few years there will be more local churches in the United States. I beg you elders to have a change in your concept, in your view. Then you should sacrifice something for the Lord to learn these two things&#151;the "computer way" of preaching the gospel and the "computer way" of prophesying. You do not need to promote these two things. You do not need to charge the saints or rebuke them for not prophesying in the meetings. You should take the lead to learn. Then others will follow you, and you can encourage them.</P><P>You must contact some of the saints meeting with you to shepherd them. Shepherd them into the proper morning revival and daily victory. On the one hand, you should practice this. On the other hand, you should go to tutor the saints one by one. We need to contact sinners one by one and tutor the saints one by one. Our work should be a one-by-one work. Gradually, you will gain someone to do what you are doing. If you elders expect the church to be revived in a general way, it will never happen. This has been an unfulfilled dream in Christianity for centuries. You should work on people one by one. Go to contact sinners one by one and go to tutor the saints one by one. You do not need to give messages in the meeting to encourage them, advise them, or rebuke them. Do not rebuke, charge, or impose things on them. Just do it yourself directly. Then you will see a change in your meeting every week. If you tutor the saints one by one, you will gradually gain a good number of saints to function in the meetings. This is how to shepherd the church in the God-ordained way.</P>
