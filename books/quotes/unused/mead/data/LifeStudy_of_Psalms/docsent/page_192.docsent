   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PSALMIST'S CONDEMNATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ON THE SONS OF MEN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND HIS PRAYER FOR THEIR DESTRUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Psalm 58 the psalmist first condemned the sons of men vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1-5 and then he prayed for their destruction vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>6-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. The Psalmist's Condemnation</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>on the Sons of Men</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In his condemnation of the sons of men, David says that in heart they perform injustice and that their hands "weigh out violence on earth" v. 2 . Then, writing very poetically, he goes on to liken them to a cobra, a most poisonous serpent vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. The Psalmist's Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>for the Destruction of the Wicked</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In his prayer for the destruction of the wicked, David says, "O God, break their teeth in their mouth;/Break off the fangs of the young lions, O Jehovah" v. 6 . He continues by likening the wicked to water that runs off, to a snail that melts and goes away, and to a woman's miscarriage vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then he declares, "The righteous man will rejoice when he sees vengeance;/He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked" v. 10 . Surely it is not a virtue to rejoice at seeing vengeance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>David concludes this psalm, saying, "Men will say, Indeed there is fruit for the righteous man;/Indeed there is a God who judges on earth" v. 11 . Here "fruit" signifies a good result or some kind of just compensation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How do you feel about the standard of spirituality in this psalm?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I cannot have a high appreciation for this psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is very little here that is good.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even the prayer and the praise are unpleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless, some Christians may love such a psalm and follow it blindly, something which I cannot do.</S>
