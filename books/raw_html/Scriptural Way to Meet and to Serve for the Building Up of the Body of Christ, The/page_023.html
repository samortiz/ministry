 <h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO PAY A PRICE</h2>
<p>The foregoing statistics prove that the way of preaching the gospel by knocking on people&rsquo;s doors is prevailing. We could not find another way so prevailing. However, our success depends on whether or not the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery would sacrifice and pay the price. We must pay a price, for this way is not easy. If you go out to visit people in a natural way, you may gain no one, even after knocking on two hundred doors. You must take the way of prayer. Before going out to knock on people&rsquo;s doors, you must pray to confess your sins, failures, and wrongdoings. Confess that for a long time you have not lived Christ, you have not lived to God. Make a thorough confession to receive the infilling of the Holy Spirit (Acts 13:52). Then exercise your faith to believe that the ascended Christ is with you as the One who has been given all authority in heaven and on earth. You will be able to tell the whole universe, &ldquo;I am going out, not by myself, but with Him who is sovereign over the heavens and the earth. Formerly, when I went without Him, my arms and legs were shaking with fear. Now I am different. I am coming to knock on this door with Christ, the Lord of lords. I have the boldness.&rdquo; When the occupant opens the door, you may say, &ldquo;I have a grace to pass on to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assure you that you will be successful. Formerly you might have knocked on two hundred doors without finding one son of peace (Luke 10:6). But if you go out in this way, you will find many sons of peace. To go out in this way makes a difference. However, you must be prepared to sacrifice yourself. Forget about your face. Some may scold you and slam the door on you. You must be prepared to joyfully receive all manner of persecution.</p>
<p>Do not criticize those who go out to knock on doors in this way. They are sacrificing much. They have paid a high price. If you do not go out to visit people by knocking on their doors, it may be that you are not so willing to sacrifice. Thank the Lord that some are willing. Stay at home to pray for them. Support them with your prayer and even with material things. I love these young saints who have paid such a price. I have watched them and have seen their sacrifice. Some young sisters have knocked on the door of university professors. On first meeting these sisters and the brothers who accompanied them, the professors somewhat despised them. But when the sisters opened their mouths, the professors were subdued and became as little lambs. When the sisters told them to change their clothes to be baptized, they did it. When the sisters told the professors&rsquo; wives to prepare the water for baptism, they did it. Within only fifteen minutes, the whole family was subdued.</p>
<p>Could you do this? It is conditional. Without such a dealing before the Lord, with the Lord, and in the Lord, we could never go out in such a strong way. Some in one denomination knocked on sixteen hundred doors but did not baptize one person. How we go out makes a big difference. If we pay the price and sacrifice much, we will surely go out with Christ, with the Triune God, and full of power, authority, and boldness. We will be afraid of nothing. This kind of boldness in a young sister will subdue everyone. This way of knocking on doors will not be in the common way. Rather, we will be desperate to knock on doors and tell people that we have a heavenly commission to pass on to them the Triune God. This way of presentation will shock people. They will surely invite us in and receive our word. The way in which we go out makes a great difference.</p>
