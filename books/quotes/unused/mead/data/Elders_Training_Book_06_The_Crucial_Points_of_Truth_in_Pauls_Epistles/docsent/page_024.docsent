   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE APOSTLE S PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE CHURCH REGARDING EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul s prayer in Ephesians 1 is a prayer for revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His prayer in chapter three is a prayer for experience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to experience Christ making His home in our heart, that is, Christ settling down within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The prayer in chapter one ends with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1:22 Christ is head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The prayer in chapter three also ends with the church as an issue of our experience of Christ making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are eventually filled unto all the fullness of God v. 19 . In chapter one the church is the fullness of the One Who fills all in all v. 23 and in chapter three the church is the fullness of God v. 19 . Both of Paul s prayers in chapters one and three of Ephesians are great crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul s prayer in chapter three may take three or four meetings to be covered adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is much material for you to study in the footnotes of the Recovery Version and in the Life-study Messages of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE BASE OF OUR ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 4:1-6 is the keeping of the oneness of the Spirit and the base of our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In exhorting us to safeguard the oneness 4:3 , the Apostle Paul points out seven things as the base, the very foundation, of our oneness: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These seven ones are of three groups.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first three can be grouped together, the Spirit with the Body as His expression, and the Body related to the one hope.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This Body, having been regenerated and being saturated with the Spirit as its essence, has the hope of being transfigured into the full likeness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The next three can also be grouped together, the Lord with faith and baptism, that we may be joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we have one God and Father, who is the Originator and Source of all.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit as the Executor of the Body, the Son as the Creator of the Body, and God the Father as the Originator of the Body all three of the Triune God are related to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The third of the Trinity is mentioned first because the main concern here is the Body, and the Spirit is the essence of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then the course is traced back to the Son and then to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>AND THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through His ascension, Christ gained many captives.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those were first the redeemed saints who were taken captive by Satan before they were saved by Christ s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In His ascension, Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan s captivity and took them to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that He has conquered and overcome Satan, who captured them by sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After rescuing them from Satan and death through His death and resurrection, Christ in His ascension made the rescued sinners themselves such gifts with His resurrection life and gave them to His Body for its building up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through Christ s ascension many captives were made gifted persons, whom Christ gave to His church as the gifts for the building up of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To fully enter into Paul s thought in this crucial point we need to study 4:7-16 with the help of the footnotes of the Recovery Version of Ephesians and the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For this crucial point we need to study Ephesians 4:22-24 and Colossians 3:10-11.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The new man has already been created and, by regeneration, has been born into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The need now is for our spirit to become the dominant part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that our spirit mingled with the Spirit of God must become the spirit of our mind 4:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If our spirit is the spirit of our mind, then all our living will be by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whatever we do will be according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This spirit of our mind will then become the renewing spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we are renewed by this spirit, we put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE SEALING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>UNTO THE REDEMPTION OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ephesians 4:30 says, And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The sealing of the Spirit has a goal, and this goal is the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From the day we receive the Spirit, the Spirit becomes not only a seal to us but a sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Spirit s indwelling is a sealing and this sealing is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It never stops because this sealing carries out a purpose to saturate our being with the divine element that we might be transformed and eventually conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then our body will be fully redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The transfiguration of our body will not be an accident but a result of our being saturated with the Spirit by His sealing of us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today the Holy Spirit is sealing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For this crucial point we also need to use the entire context of verse 30, namely, verses 25-32, to tell people what can grieve the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you grieve the Spirit, you frustrate His sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is now within us doing a sealing work, painting us with the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not do something to frustrate His painting of Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the negative things listed in verses 25-32 of chapter four are frustrations to the sealing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These frustrations are a grieving.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As long as your spirit does not feel happy about a situation, you have to realize that this is a grieving, and that grieving is a kind of frustration to the Spirit s sealing.</S>
