   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE VISION After a turn of time</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second portion begins with Matthew 17:1, "And after six days..."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the record of the same instance in Luke it says, "And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings..."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Luke 9:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Really there is no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was six full days.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But according to the Jewish calendar you may also say it was eight days, including the last part of the first day and the first part of the last day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In any case, the meaning here is a period of one week a week after the event referred to in chapter 16.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A week is a specific turn of time, just as a full day is also a turn of time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A month and also a year with its four seasons are other turns of time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To see something of the Lord, we all need a turn of time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It does not depend upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose that this morning you have missed the sun rising: you must wait for another turn of time, you must wait until the next morning before you will have another chance to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppose you have missed a sight of the full moon in these days: you cannot hope to see it within just a few days; you must wait until next month for another turn of time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose you have missed the sight of the cherry trees blossoming this spring: you cannot hope to see such a sight in the summer, nor in the fall or winter; you must wait for another year, for another turn in time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To see something of the Lord, we all need to take advantage of the turn of time; we must not miss the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If in one meeting you do not see something of Him, you will have to wait until another meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you miss the opportunity in one conference, you will have to wait for another conference.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You need a turn of time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The times and the seasons are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Be careful not to miss a day, a week, a month, or a year.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not miss any opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you miss them, you must wait for another turn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the mountain top</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Firstly the disciples saw the revelation, but they must wait a week, for another turn in time, before they could see something more.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was not up to them; it was up to the Creator of time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This time the Lord Jesus brought them to the mountain top, not only apart from all religious things and circumstances, but also apart from the earthly level.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To see the revelation you must be far away from all religious things, persons, and circumstances; but to see the vision you must be on the mountain top, the higher the better.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we are on the mountain top, we get a clear view, we see the whole vision.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was there, not only apart from the religious circle, but also apart from earthly things, that Jesus became another Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Jesus you see on the mountain is not the Jesus you see at sea level.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Jesus on the mountain top is a transfigured Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to be on the mountain top to see the vision, to see Jesus transfigured.</S>
