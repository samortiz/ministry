God first moved in man in incarnation. God was born into the womb of a virgin, and after nine months Jesus was born out of that virgin. A key verse concerning God's incarnation is Matthew 1:20, which says, "That which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit." Something was not only conceived in the virgin Mary but also born into her. That was the first step God took to move in man.</P><P>The second step of God's move in man was His human living on earth. People saw Jesus as a man living, walking, working, and ministering on this earth. No one can deny that in history there was such a man named Jesus. But while this man was living, walking, working, and ministering on this earth, another One lived there. In Jesus' living, God was living. In Jesus' walking, God was walking. In Jesus' working, God was working. In Jesus' ministering and serving, God was there. In the man Jesus was the very God. He was God manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16).</P><P>In this message we want to see the third major step of the move of God in man, and this step was His move in the crucifixion of Christ. Christ was crucified, but in His crucifixion God was moving. The previous messages concerning the move of God in man were entitled In His Incarnation and In His Human Living. But I want us to notice that I did not entitle this message In His Crucifixion but In the Crucifixion of Christ. We have to be careful by saying that God moved in the crucifixion of Christ. It is not safe to say directly In His Crucifixion, that is, In God's Crucifixion. When we say In the Crucifixion of Christ, we are very safe. When we fellowship about the crucifixion of Christ, we need to see who Christ is. First, we have to see that Christ is the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9). Since this is the case, He was the very God manifested in the flesh.</P><P>At the end of John 10 the opposing Jews confronted the Lord Jesus. Verse 31 says that they were about to stone Him. Jesus said to them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these works are you stoning Me?" (v. 32). Then the Jews answered Him, "We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, are making Yourself God" (v. 33). Throughout the centuries there have been great debates over the person of Christ. His person is related to the Divine Trinity because in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. This subject In the Crucifixion of Christ implies the Divine Trinity.</P><P>We should not say directly and initially that the crucifixion was God's crucifixion. Instead, we should say that this was Christ's crucifixion. When we are sharing the truth concerning the crucifixion, we need to take steps like that of a stairway. We should not jump from the top of a building to the ground floor. This is to commit suicide. Instead, we must have a stairway.</P><P>Without His Divine Trinity, God could not have moved in the crucifixion. Who can crucify God? Yet Charles Wesley said in one of his hymns: "Amazing love! how can it be/That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?" and "'Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies!" (Hymns, #296). Charles Wesley said that God died for him and that the Immortal One died. This means that He who cannot die, died for us. No one could crucify God if He remained in His divinity, but Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh was crucified. The Divine Trinity is involved here. The crucifixion of Christ was the death in which God moved in man. God moved in another's crucifixion, but this other One is the embodiment of God. The first One moved in the second One's death, and the second One is the embodiment of the first One. This is the stairway we need to understand the crucifixion.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Move of God in Man &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
