   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A THOUSAND YEARS AS ONE DAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here Peter skips over the millennium, the period of time from the Lord s coming to the judgment of the great white throne.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To Peter, as to the Lord, that one thousand years will be as one day v. 8 , a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Peter is dealing here with God s governmental judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The millennium will not be for this purpose in God s dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here Peter speaks concerning the mountain peaks of the Lord s coming and of God s final judgment, but not of the plain of the millennial kingdom that lies between the peak of the Lord s coming and that of the final judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this Epistle Peter is concerned with God s judgment, not with the peaceful kingdom of the thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason he passes over the matter of the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 8 Peter says, But do not let this one thing be hidden from you, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Literally, the Greek word rendered be hidden from you means escape you, that is, escape your notice.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With the Lord God, who is eternal, the sense of time is very different from what it is with man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, for the fulfillment of His word, especially the word of His promise, time is not the crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The crucial matter is the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whatever God has promised will eventually become a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not be troubled by the sense of delay according to our reckoning of time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 9 says, The Lord does not delay regarding the promise, as some count delay, but is longsuffering toward you, not intending any to perish, but all to come to repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here Peter says that the Lord does not delay, or is not tardy, regarding the promise, as some count delay, tardiness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The mockers must have been those who count the Lord s delay as tardiness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They may have accused Him of being idle, since tardiness is a delay that is related to idleness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 9 Peter says that the Lord is longsuffering toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord s heart is set not on the time of the fulfillment of His promise, but on His people, whom He possesses peculiarly as a treasure 1 Pet 2:9; Titus 2:14 , so that none of us, His precious redeemed ones, would be punished by His governmental judgment, but have a prolonged season to repent so that we may be spared from His punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The words to perish in verse 9 mean to be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since you in this verse refers to the believers in Christ, to perish refers not to the eternal perdition of the unbelievers, but to the punishment of God s governmental discipline of the believers 1 Pet 4:17-18; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1 Thes 5:3, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Likewise, the word all refers to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, repentance here is repentance unto salvation 2 Pet 3:15 , repentance for not being watchful for the day of the Lord s coming v. 10 and not living a life in a holy manner and in godliness v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to realize that the Lord s heart is not set on the time of the fulfillment of His promise, but is set on His people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If necessary, the Lord can wait for another day, another period of a thousand years, to fulfill His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today many Christians are saying that the Lord Jesus will come back soon.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, the Lord s coming may not be as soon as people think.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Revelation 22 the Lord said, I come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, nearly two thousand years have passed since the Lord spoke that word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To Him, this is only two days, for with the Lord a thousand years are as one day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not listen to those who set a time for the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the past some predicted the time of the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the last century one group of people believed that the Lord Jesus was coming on a particular day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They made themselves ready and even put on white robes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of course, nothing happened.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After World War I, a number of books were written on the prophecies concerning the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some Bible teachers claimed that, according to their view of the world situation, the Lord s coming was at hand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But more than fifty years have passed since those writings appeared, and the Lord Jesus still has not come.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to be reminded, therefore, of Peter s word concerning a thousand years being as one day to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will not only judge the negative things, but will also receive His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that He will come both as the Judge and as the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, in order for the Lord to come as the Bridegroom, the bride must be prepared for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Is the bride ready for the Bridegroom s coming?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Is it possible for the Lord to come today as the Bridegroom?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because the bride is not yet ready, we may say that it is possible that the Lord s coming will not be as soon as some figure.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The bride can be prepared only through growth in life, and this takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Higher forms of life require more time to develop than lower forms do.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The higher a certain life is, the longer it will take to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because the bride must be prepared for the Bridegroom and because this preparation is through the growth in life, a growth that requires time, it is not likely that the Lord Jesus will come back right now.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>My point here is that we should not be bothered or surprised by any delay concerning the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not blame the Lord and say, Lord, You said in Revelation 22 that You were coming quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Why, then, has it been so long?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead of blaming the Lord for delaying His coming, we should be diligent to prepare ourselves to meet Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should also minister life to others so that they may grow and be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the only way to hasten the Lord s coming back.</S>
