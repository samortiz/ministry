   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PLACE TO SEE THE VISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ezekiel did not see the vision concerning the building of God in the land of captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rather, he was brought back to the holy land, to a high mountain, and to Jerusalem itself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many brothers and sisters can testify that while they were in captivity in the denominations, they could not see the vision of the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But when they came back to the holy land, to the church life, they could see the vision of the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to see something properly, we need the right position, we need the right standing, and we need the right angle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are standing in the wrong position and the wrong standing, we can never see it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you want to see the city of Los Angeles, you must come to Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even if you were on the highest mountains in New Zealand, still you could not see Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You must have the proper position.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must come to Jerusalem so that we can see Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to come to the site of the temple so that we can see the building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need not only the position, but also the right angle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means we must be on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ezekiel was not the only person who saw God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Revelation, John told us that he was carried away in spirit to a high mountain to see the holy city, New Jerusalem Rev 21:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is because the building of God is something in the resurrection and ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must be in an elevated position in order to see the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some people have been offended because of my ministering on the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is because they are like little boys and girls who are playing with toys.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you touch their toys, surely you will offend them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you tell children that they need to grow up and to drop all their toys, they will surely be upset.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But may the Lord be merciful to us so that we may grow up and that we may go up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We not only need to grow up, but we also need to go up to the highest position with the highest angle to see the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If Ezekiel had remained in Babylon in the captivity, he would never have seen the building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, if he had been on a plain and not on the mountaintop, he would never have seen the building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we need to grow up, we need to go up, and we need to get to the mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There we can see the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE VISION OF A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before Ezekiel saw the vision of the building, he saw a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This man did not look like electrum as the man did in chapter one, but rather he looked like brass 40:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In chapter one, in the vision of the glory of the Lord, the Lord Jesus on the throne looked like electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But in chapter forty, He was not on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was at the gate of the building, measuring.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Bible, measuring means to judge and take possession.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When a sister goes to the store to buy some cloth, first she measures it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While she is measuring, she is judging whether or not that particular piece of cloth is the right one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In her measuring, she judges.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In chapter forty, the Lord Jesus was not on the throne in the appearance of the electrum; He was at the gate in the appearance of brass to measure and take possession.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the Lord Jesus comes to measure something, first He judges it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In typology brass or copper signifies judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He was likened to a serpent of brass John 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Exodus 38:1-7, the altar of burnt offering was overlaid with brass.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This shows that brass indicates judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Something is judged so that it can stand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once it is judged, it can stand any kind of test or examination.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It can stand any kind of further judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Jesus is such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He passed God's judgment, and now He has become a test to others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because He was able to stand all kinds of tests, examinations and judgments, He is fully qualified to measure everything, including the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By His judgment He measures what belongs to God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE HOLY BUILDING OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First, we will consider a general sketch, or plot plan, of the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You will find it very helpful to refer to the chart in order to understand the plot plan of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The whole building is square with four sides, each side being 500 cubits long.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although it has four sides, only three sides have an entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is a gate on the east, on the south, and on the north.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When you enter the gate you are immediately in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the outer court, around the walls, are six pavements made of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On each pavement are five chambers built as places for the people to eat and enjoy the sacrifices and offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means the chambers are the places to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thus, there are five chambers on each of six pavements, making a total of 30 chambers for the people to eat and enjoy the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Within the outer court there is an inner court which also has three gates.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This makes a total of six gates three to the outer court and three to the inner court.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The building has two walls, the wall of the outside court and the wall of the inner court.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>With every wall there are three gates.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The measurement and design of all the walls and gates are exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Within the inner court is the altar which is at the center of the whole compound of the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The altar is a type of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The cross of Christ is at the very center of God's economy, God's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this section on God's building, from Ezekiel 40 through 48, three main things are covered: the holy temple, the holy city, and the holy land.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All three of these items are holy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Ezekiel begins not from the outside, but from the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He begins with the temple, then the city, then the land.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God's economy always begins from within, not from without.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>According to 1 Thessalonians 5:23, we have a spirit and soul and body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There it also begins from within.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It does not start from the outside and say, "body and soul and spirit"; rather, it says, "spirit and soul and body."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God's economy is always from within, but men's movements are always from without.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must learn the lesson that in the church life we should not have anything from without.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the church life we must always have something from within first the temple, then the city, and then the land.</S>
