   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR PERFECTING THE SAINTS TO ARRIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AT A FULL-GROWN MAN AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO SUBMIT TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE HEAD THE CO-WORKERS ALWAYS PERFECTING THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Wherever the workers are, they must perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the workers replace the saints instead of perfecting them, the church will not be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To perfect the saints is to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to perfect the saints, we do not work by ourselves; instead, we work with the saints to teach them to do what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our goal is to perfect the saints until they can replace us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Initially, we work by ourselves, but after a while the saints are able to work with us and are even better than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the process of perfecting the saints, we pass responsibility to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Initially, we are responsible for the work, but after a while, the saints are responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the saints are responsible for the work, we can leave.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This sounds simple, but the principle is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The result of this type of work is the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE CO-WORKERS SERVING IN ONE PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to my observation our work is short in perfecting the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, the element of working with others to perfect them is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is another matter that we need to consider seriously before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we came to Taiwan, we took the way of a worker serving in a locality for a long time to take care of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We took this way because it was convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This may have been the right way for us to take in the past, but to continue the work in this way may create problems.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though it is beneficial for a worker to stay in one place for a long time, there are also disadvantages.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The longer a worker stays in one place, the more likely he is to replace the saints in their function.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, a greater part of his work will result in replacing the saints rather than perfecting them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, some workers tend to become isolated or even peculiar after they stay in a place for a long time, because they do things by themselves and are not balanced by others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They lack a balanced view of the churches and other workers because they have made decisions and have led and encouraged the saints by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, there may be some loss when a worker travels frequently, but on the other hand, there is much benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more a worker travels, the more he sees, and the broader his view becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A broader view is often a balancing factor and a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A worker who stays in one place is bound to become local, narrow, shallow, and peculiar in his view.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, it is easy for him not to be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A worker also becomes more subjective the longer he stays in a place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to our present practice, most places have one main worker.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It would not be good for this worker to become subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A person who is subjective becomes peculiar and has a narrow view.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In all the places that I have visited, I have rarely met a worker who has a very broad view.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we travel, our view is enlarged, and we are balanced by others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moreover, when a co-worker stays in one place, the local saints have less of an opportunity to receive fellowship from other gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the supply in a locality always comes from one gift, it is not easy for the saints to receive the supply from other gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In spite of these considerations, it is difficult for us to decide how to deal with this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not know how the Lord will lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It may be that instead of staying in one place, some of the workers should travel frequently to fellowship with and supply the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But there are still advantages for a worker to serve in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A worker who stays in one place will bear more responsibility and is more likely to carry out specific burdens in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In contrast, a worker who travels all the time may end up with no responsibility and no specific burden.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Both sides have their merits and disadvantages.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to evaluate every aspect of our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some workers might stay in one place for a long period, and others might spend more time to visit different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Regardless of whether we stay in one place or travel frequently, our goal must be to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some brothers may say that since they are workers, what they do perfects the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This may be true, but even the pastors and preachers in the denominations say that their work is to perfect the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Their perfecting, however, is different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we refer to perfecting the saints, we are referring to the perfecting in Ephesians 4:12 that enables the perfected saints to take part in the work of the ministry to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not what Christianity refers to when they speak of edification.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many believers in Christianity are edified by their pastors or preachers, but they are not perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The perfecting that we speak of is not merely to edify the believers; it is more than edification, because it has the element of building.</S>
