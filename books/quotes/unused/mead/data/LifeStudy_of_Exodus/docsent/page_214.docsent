   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SIXTY-FIVE THE VEIL OVER THE GLORY OF THE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF CONDEMNATION AND DEATH Scripture Reading: Exo 34:29-35; 2 Cor 3:7, 9a, 13-18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall continue to consider the night side of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 2 Corinthians 3:7 and 9 Paul used all the key words in the title of this message, The Veil over the Glory of the Ministry of Condemnation and Death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The words glory and ministry are positive; however, the words veil, condemnation, and death are negative.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul speaks first of the ministry of death v. 7 and then of the ministry of condemnation v. 9 . These certainly are extraordinary expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although these terms are in the Bible, not all Christians are familiar with them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE GLORY OF THE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>OF CONDEMNATION AND DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Paul s word in 2 Corinthians 3, the ministry of Moses was a ministry of condemnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul s ministry, however, was a ministry of righteousness and of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I wonder if Moses would have been happy with the way Paul contrasted the ministry of righteousness and of the Spirit with the ministry of condemnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In writing 2 Corinthians 3, Paul used much boldness v. 12 . He was bold to point out that his ministry was greater in glory than that of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul says, For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory v 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know from Exodus 34:29-35 that the skin of Moses face shone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although Paul s face did not shine in this way, he experienced an inward shining, a shining from within his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With Moses and Paul there were two different kinds of shining: the outward shining upon the face and the inward shining from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today all who believe in Christ may have the inward shining.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But one day, at the time of the Lord s coming, we shall be transfigured and shall have the outward shining also.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time, not only our face but also our whole body will shine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some systematic theologians do not appreciate the value of Moses ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though Paul speaks of the ministry of Moses as a ministry of condemnation and death, he acknowledges that there was glory with this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>More than three thousand years ago, there was a man on earth whose face shone with the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a very significant matter, and we should never despise it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Along with Paul, we need to recognize that the ministry of condemnation and death was truly glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not dispute the fact that this glory was wonderful and excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is possible to say in a rather careless way that we, the New Testament believers, have the inward glory, whereas Moses had merely the outward glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But some Christians actually have a glory only in doctrine, not in their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They may claim to be New Testament believers with the inward glory, but where is this glory actually?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Experientially speaking, they may have very little glory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yes, Moses glory was outward, but we should still appreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul s word in 2 Corinthians 3 may be regarded as an exposition of Exodus 34:29-35.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Exodus 34 we are simply told that the skin of Moses face shone, not that glory was shining from the face of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in 2 Corinthians 3 Paul interprets Exodus 34 by saying that the shining on Moses face was the glory of the ministry of condemnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Apart from the interpretation set forth by Paul, we would not have the wisdom to speak of the shining face of Moses as the glory of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, we would not have the boldness to say that the ministry of condemnation and death was glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But because Paul had been enlightened of the Lord, he was bold to speak plainly of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The shining on Moses face was the glory of a ministry which had been given by God and established by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moses had a ministry, and that ministry was glorious.</S>
