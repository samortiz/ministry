   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD'S REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thirdly, let us consider the redemption of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In His redemption, His thought is still only one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Speaking from the standpoint of our experience, some have been saved recently some scores of years ago, and some hundreds of years ago; some were baptized in the United States, and some in other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But though these events have taken place at different times and in different places, from God's standpoint, He never saves individually.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When He saves, He redeems the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A good example of this is the account of the Israelites coming out from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the entire house of Israel came out from Egypt, the lamb was eaten and the blood applied at the same place and at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then at the same time and at the same place they passed through the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From our limited viewpoint, some ate the meat and applied the blood at one place, while others ate the meat and applied the blood several hundred houses away.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When passing through the Red Sea, some were in the front of the procession, and others were in the rear of the procession; they may have been thousands of feet and many minutes apart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in God's view point, they ate the meat and applied the blood simultaneously in Rameses Exo 12:37 ; and their passage through the Red Sea Exo 14:29 was also a simultaneous act.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, when an ant transports its food from one corner of the room to another, he considers that he is traveling quite a distance, but from our viewpoint he is simply moving about in one room.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Similarly, in our understanding, salvation takes place earlier or later, here or there; but with God a thousand years is as one day 2 Pet 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, in the eternal view of God, we are all saved at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He did not save us one by one, individually; He saved us corporately, as one man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, in His redemption, as in His plan and in His creation, His thought is still one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not plan for His Son to have two bodies, but only one; nor did He create two persons for His Son, but only one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whether in God's plan, in His creation, or in His redemption, the thought is one and one alone, and this oneness is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After we were redeemed into Christ, our position in Christ is still one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In ourselves we are many, but in Christ we are only one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Christ there is only one Church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Christ there is one mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This mystical Body of Christ is one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The spiritual meaning of the Body is one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever we as Christians are not one, we are not in the Body, and we demonstrate that we have not seen what the Body is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Epistle to the Ephesians speaks especially about the Church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It states that the Church is the mystical Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Epistle to the Ephesians is also a book that mentions the matter of "one" the most.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It mentions seven "ones": the body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God Eph 4:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Seven is the perfect number.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>So this perfect "one" is in the Body, and this perfect "one" is the mystical Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>V. IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Christ we are one; moreover, in the Holy Spirit we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This oneness in the Holy Spirit is what we commonly call fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we live in the Holy Spirit, we have this fellowship, and we have this oneness, which is the reality of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we lose this fellowship in the Holy Spirit, we do not have this oneness, and we do not have the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In life we are still one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have mentioned elsewhere that the life within us is not a divided life, but a complete life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because of the fellowship in the Holy Spirit, the life in each one of us is complete and undivided.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The life in me is the life in you and also the life in God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, His life in all of us is one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are all one in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Not only the good Christians are one with us in life, but also the failures, the weak ones, and the poor ones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This oneness in life is the mystical Body of Christ.</S>
