   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE SEED OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Gen 1:11, 12, 29; Luke 8:5-8a, 11-15; Matt 13:4-8, 19-23, 24, 31, 33, 37-38, 44-46; 1 Cor 3:6-9, 10-12; 1 Pet 1:23; James 1:18; Rev 14:4b, 15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thus far, we have covered three aspects of life: the tree of life, the river of life, and the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The tree of life is for eating, the river of life is for drinking, and the breath of life is for breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To maintain life we need air, water, and food.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Air is the first item of importance in the maintenance of life, water is second, and food is third.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A person can fast without eating or drinking, but not without breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we graduate from breathing, we graduate from life and die.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have seen that food comes from water, and water comes from the air.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, the air is the most basic item for maintaining life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this chapter, we want to see the fourth aspect of life, the aspect of the seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This aspect is much deeper than the other three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to be those who know what life is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many so-called Bible teachers cannot give any practical help in the matter of life because they themselves are not clear about what life is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They may have many teachings, but they have never been impressed with the things of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible shows us the tree of life, the river of life, the breath of life, and the seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The tree is food to eat, the river is water to drink, the breath is air to breathe, and the seed is a container of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The life essence, or germ, the begetting power of life, the growth of life, the transformation of life, and the resurrection life are all included in the seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word seed has an all-inclusive meaning since it is the embodiment of life and includes all things related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE HERB YIELDING SEED AND THE TREE YIELDING SEED BEING MAN'S FOOD</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have seen that Genesis 1 is not merely a record of creation, but a record absolutely of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Genesis 1:11-12 tells us that the earth brought forth "herb yielding seed," and verse 29 refers to "tree yielding seed."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to God's original arrangement, He gave only the herb yielding seed and the tree yielding seed to man for food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Anything that did not yield seed, God did not give to man for food.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whatever God gave to man for food before the fall was something yielding seed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is because in God's intention, in God's economy, man should be taking in, receiving, and enjoying life all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man should not eat, or take in, anything that does not yield seed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever man touches, whatever man takes in, whatever man eats, must be something of life and something producing life something yielding seed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has no intention for man to eat anything that is not of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God has no intention for man to contact anything that does not yield seed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever man contacts, whatever man takes into himself, whatever man eats for his maintenance, must be something yielding seed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many books that we may read do not yield seed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But many of us who have read the book entitled The Economy of God can testify that it yields seed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to Genesis, what man eats must be something yielding seed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Anything that does not yield seed, he should not eat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The tree of life is a tree yielding seed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the seed, the main thing is life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The life essence, the life germ, is in the seed, and this life in the seed is for producing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may also say that the life in the seed is for resurrection, for spreading, for transforming, and for growth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Life is in the seed, and the seed is food to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, life is in Christ, and Christ is food to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE LORD JESUS BEING THE SEED OF THE WOMAN, THE SEED OF DAVID, AND THE SEED OF ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In both the Old and New Testaments the Lord Jesus has many titles.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Among His many titles, He has the title of "the seed."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Genesis 3:15 He is the seed of the woman who will bruise the head of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 2 Samuel 7, He is the seed of David v. 12 . In Genesis 12 He is the seed of Abraham v. 7 . In the New Testament, Galatians 3 tells us that the seed of Abraham is the Lord Jesus v. 16 . Abraham had two sons, Ishmael and Isaac, but only one seed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ishmael was a son of Abraham, but he was not the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Galatians 3 tells us that the unique seed of Abraham is Christ, of whom Isaac was a type.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Isaac was a type of Christ as the seed of Abraham.</S>
