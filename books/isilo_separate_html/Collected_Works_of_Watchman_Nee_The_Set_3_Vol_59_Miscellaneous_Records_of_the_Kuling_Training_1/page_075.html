Those who do not know authority revile, and this reviling comes from reasoning. Man reviles because he reasons within himself. For example, Aaron and Miriam reviled Moses because Moses married a Cushite. They said, "Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?" (Num. 12:2). Our words always follow our reasons. Aaron and Miriam first reasoned in their mind. Perhaps they thought, "All three of us are servants of God, and God has spoken to all of us. Miriam is the first prophetess, and Aaron is the high priest. All of us are appointed by God. Does God speak to Moses only and not to us as well?" Apparently, nothing was wrong with such a thought; it seemed reasonable enough. Reasons are hidden in the heart, and words are uttered through the mouth. Words of rebellion occur because there are reasons within one's heart. The first cause of rebellion is reasons within one's heart. Unless one deals thoroughly with his reasons, he cannot stop his speaking.</p><p>In the Bible God never reasons with man. Where reasoning abounds, authority is absent. God's decisions are beyond the consent or dissent of human mentality or reasoning. All we need to ask is whether or not there is the presence of authority. Under God's authority, reason has no ground to assert itself whatsoever. Outwardly rebellion is expressed through our speaking. Before we open our mouth, however, we first have reasons within our heart. Unless we first are delivered from reasons, we will never find deliverance in our speaking. The speaking of Korah's company and the two hundred fifty leaders was reasonable enough in its own way. They said, "For all the assembly is holy, every one of them, and Jehovah is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?" (Num. 16:3). This was not simply rebellious speaking; it was backed up by reasons. If the whole congregation was short in holiness, perhaps God's exclusive communication with Moses and Aaron was justified. But if the whole congregation was holy, how could Moses and Aaron claim that God was speaking to them alone? They judged the two leaders with their words, and their words were fully backed up by reasons and arguments. Their heart was full of reasons. As soon as we have reasons in our heart, we have words in our mouth. All revilings come from reasons. Therefore, the first expression of rebellion is reasons.</p><p>In addition to the words of Korah's company and the two hundred fifty leaders, there were also the words of Dathan and Abiram. Their words were of a cruder nature. Outwardly speaking, the words of Korah's company were more reasonable and convincing than Dathan and Abiram's. Dathan and Abiram's words implied that they were being cheated. They were sarcastic. In a mocking way they implied, "God was going to lead us into the land flowing with milk and honey, but you have brought us into the wilderness. We have not seen any land flowing with milk and honey; instead, we were led out of a land flowing with milk and honey." They thought that there were plenty of fields, meat, and vineyards in Egypt, and they thought they had none of these in the wilderness. They indeed had many reasons. A person who is under authority would never say, "Moses and Aaron said this." They would only consider what God had said. Everyone who places himself under authority does not reason; he only acts according to God's word. What the hand touches, the eyes see, and the heart feels mean nothing to him. According to human eyes, the wilderness was much inferior to Egypt, but those who walk by faith are satisfied with God's will. They walk according to God's word. The rebellious ones said, "You have brought us to a barren land to kill us. Are you going to make yourself a ruler over us? You have not led us to the land flowing with milk and honey, and have not given us fields and vineyards for our inheritance." Their words were cruder than those of Korah's company. Korah's company spoke in spiritual terms, but Dathan and Abiram spoke in material terms. We cannot help but marvel at the reasons and tongues of the rebellious ones!</p><p>Dathan and Abiram continued, "Will you put out the eyes of these men?" (v. 14). It was as if they were saying, "Are you trying to cover the eyes of everyone with your two hands? This is the wilderness. Where are the fields and the vineyards that you have promised?" Their eyes could only see the wilderness; they could not see any land flowing with milk and honey. God's promised land was not yet in sight; they could only regard the place they had left behind as being better. They thought they were very clear and that they had reasons to back up their words. Similarly, those whose eyes are on the earth are like Dathan and Abiram. Moses was not blind, but he was not acting by sight. It seems as if he was void of sight, reason, or argument. He only had God. He did what he did because God had told him to do it. Do not think that these rebellious ones were altogether wrong. In terms of human reason, they were, in fact, quite right. Human thoughts and reasons indeed have their place. Yet they do not count in the eyes of God. In our pursuit of the knowledge and the things of God, we often have to "cut out" our fleshly eyes. We have to ignore reasons and consider what God has said. Those who take the way of obedience and subject themselves to God's authority do not have anything to say. In fact, they do not have any reasons to give. Once we cast all reasons aside, our speaking stops.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_074.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_076.html">Next</a> </body></html>
