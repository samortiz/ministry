   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A SHORT INTRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN MEMORY OF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BROTHER WATCHMAN NEE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the revelation of the Bible and the confirmation in history, in every age God has had His special work on earth among His created people, and for the accomplishment of this special work, He has raised up special men, chosen and perfected by Him to meet this special need.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During this century, as the gospel of God went to the East along with Western culture, hundreds and thousands of Western missionaries responded to God's commission and went to China, a land of ancient culture, and gave everything they had for the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not a few among them excelled in achievements, spiritually as well as literarily, yet not many were able to proclaim the economy of God and the mystery of Christ clearly and fully.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Against this background, at the turn of this century, while China was being transformed from a nation under imperialistic control to a democratic nation, from among the young generation infused with Western culture and literature, God suddenly raised up one person by the name of Nee Shu-tsu called Watchman Nee after his conversion to fulfill His mission of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After Brother Nee was saved, he was cared for and nurtured by the Lord Himself and became, even in his youth, exceptional and outstanding in biblical exposition and spiritual teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These teachings were warmly welcomed by the lovers and seekers of the Lord in China and produced a heartfelt response and following among many young believers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet at the same time, they startled many Chinese and Western leaders in Chinese Christianity and stirred up some antagonism and opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Nee diligently studied the Bible and received help from the important biblical expositional writings of the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was acquainted with the letter of the scriptural doctrines, but much more, he was familiar with the principles, the spiritual significances, the very life within the scriptural truths, and the spirit of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason, his exposition and preaching, whether verbal or written, all conveyed the divine visions and spiritual revelations which he received from the Bible and were full of truth, light, life, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They were living and vibrant and full of power from God, so that his audiences as well as his readers were easily touched by what he preached and expounded and easily received grace and responded to such words.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of all that Brother Nee preached and expounded during his lifetime, we can summarize the main points into twelve items:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I. CONCERNING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He pointed out that God is eternal, self-existing, ever- existing, having no beginning or ending, and complete and perfect in every sense.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is triune; in His Godhead, He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the application.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God the Son is the embodiment of God the Father, while God the Spirit is the reality of God the Son, applying the Triune God to those who believe into God the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is also holy and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Holiness refers to God's inward nature, while righteousness refers to God's outward acts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Love is the element of His inward nature, while light is the element of His outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This God possesses extraordinary wisdom and accomplishes superlative works.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE ETERNAL PLAN ECONOMY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He pointed out that this God who possesses extraordinary wisdom and accomplishes superlative works has a good pleasure according to His heart's desire, which is to gain a group of men who would become one with Him, sharing the same life, the same living, the same move, and the same work as His, that He may express Himself in glory through them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, in eternity past He purposed in Himself an eternal plan economy .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this plan God the Son was to be the centrality and universality that He would have the preeminence in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For this reason He also created the universe, with all the myriads of items therein, in order that He might create in it a tripartite man composed of a spirit, a soul, and a body as a vessel to receive Him and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God would enter into man's spirit as the Spirit and regenerate man, thus producing His many sons, who share His life and nature, and the many members of Christ the Son, who constitute His organic Body as His corporate expression, so that the Triune God through this expression would have an ultimate expression in fullness for eternity.</S>
