   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Who among us today is still a sinner?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Please ask yourself if there is something wrong between you and God?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Can you face God?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is your relationship with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Will you perish?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Perhaps you think that you are physically well neither your heart nor lungs are sick and will not perish.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But you have to realize that this is only your appearance before men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You have to consider what you are before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible pays much attention to only one sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All of us have to deal with this one sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to ask: What is our relationship with God?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is there a problem between us and God?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Scripture says, "There is none righteous, not even one" Rom 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everyone is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because men do not seek after God, they have turned aside and together they have become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The cause of sin is the failure to seek after God and understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" v. 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has revealed Himself and come down to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was incarnated on the earth, and He revealed Himself to the world through Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has lived on the earth and been manifested among us for the last two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is preached among us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today He is asking what kind of relationship we have with Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the past we did not know what kind of God our God was; He appeared to be mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But thank the Lord that He has come to the world and is now living among us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is not only God, but He is also a man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was incarnated and crucified on the cross to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today this Jesus of Nazareth is asking: What is your relationship with God?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This man from Nazareth is still living on the earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to make a decision today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is our attitude toward Him?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our attitude toward this man from Nazareth becomes our attitude toward God, because Jesus of Nazareth is the Word becoming flesh; He is God coming to the world in the form of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the way men treat Him is the way they treat God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here is a precious thing for all of us!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From now on, men will go to hell not for the many miscellaneous sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For what reason then will men go to hell?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the future many will go to hell without knowing why.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Men will go to hell not because they have lied, murdered, or committed arson.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whoever is in hell is there because they have committed only one sin, the sin of not believing in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God" John 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A man is condemned not because he has murdered or committed arson.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is condemned for only one thing: not believing in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not believing in the name of the Son of God is having an improper relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the Bible's logic: Unbelievers are condemned because they do not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the sin that God emphasizes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How do you treat Christ today?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is your attitude toward Him?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God cares for your attitude toward Christ, because He is the way that bridges the barrier between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is God as well as man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today God in Christ is living among us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The way men treat Christ is the way they treat God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once I shook hands with a friend.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He said, "Let me take off my gloves first."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I said, "There is no need.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am shaking your hand anyway; I am not shaking your glove."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The same is true with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is God, and He has merely put on a human body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The hand is there; the only addition is a glove.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, the way you treat Christ is the way you treat God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord said, "He who has seen Me has seen the Father...I am in the Father and the Father is in Me" 14:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He also said, "I and the Father are one" 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Bible shows us that since the time the Lord was born, the Holy Spirit has been convicting men for only one sin, the sin of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"And when He the Holy Spirit comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me" 16:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Holy Spirit convicts the world concerning sin because they do not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Not believing is failing to have a proper relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Holy Spirit convicts men not for their murder, arson, pride, or jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Holy Spirit convicts men because they do not have a proper relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Friends, I have to mention one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I am speaking especially to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the church today, there are many wrong teachings: They not only teach concerning the Savior in a wrong way, they teach redemption in a wrong way; not only do they teach salvation in a wrong way, they teach sin in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Men have preached sin in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is not my teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Man has no authority to invent a teaching; he can only discover a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is only one sin that man has committed for which he deserves to be in hell.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This one sin is his failure to have a proper relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Most people prove man's sinfulness by pointing out the murder, arson, fornication, pride, lying, and jealousy, etc. Of course, we need to deal with these sins.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once we confess these sins before God, they are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But even if all these sins were forgiven, if we did not deal with God concerning the one unique sin, we could not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Unfortunately, we do not pay attention to the one sin that the Holy Spirit emphasizes.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The unique sin that the work of the Spirit is convicting us of is the very sin that is neglected by us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is true that murder, arson, pride, jealousy, etc., are sins, but the root of sin is unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Bible tells us that the most important sin is unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, when we preach the gospel, we should not merely exhort others to refrain from murder, arson, pride, or jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Even if a man has not committed murder or arson, and is not proud or jealous, he cannot be saved from perdition and receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There are many like him who will eventually go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must repeatedly ask whether or not there is a problem between you and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If there is not a proper relationship between you and Christ, you are still a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Friends, I know what I am talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Satan wants to destroy the work of Christ by changing the focus of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Our focus is on the many miscellaneous sins; we do not pay attention to the root of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If a man only pays attention to miscellaneous sins without paying attention to the root of sin, he is overturning the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>His salvation is merely a mental salvation and moral improvement; it is not a change in life or the gaining of life.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>A wrong emphasis on sin will not save men.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Sin is a wrong relationship between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The prodigal son was prodigal because there was a problem between him and God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Once there is a problem between you and God, you have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I hope none of us would be wrong with God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Acts 2:36 through 38 says, "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>And when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, What should we do, brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>And Peter said to them, Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The first time the Holy Spirit worked at Pentecost, those who heard the words were pricked in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>What did they hear?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>They heard that "God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified."</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This means that there was a problem between them and Christ; they did not have a proper relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>There was a problem between them and God.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Christ was appointed by God, yet they killed Him and came into conflict with God.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When the people heard this, they were pricked in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>They were pricked in their heart not because they did not make peace with their brothers, or because they gambled, fought, murdered, or committed arson.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>They were pricked because their relationship with Christ was not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>They were pricked in their heart, and they asked Peter and the other apostles, "What should we do?"</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We should pay attention to Peter's answer: "Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Peter told them to first repent and then be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>What is the meaning of repentance?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Some have said, "Should we not repent?"</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>It is true that we should repent, but we must ask, What is the reason for our repentance?</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Should we repent because we have murdered and do not want to murder anymore?</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Should we repent because we have committed arson and do not want to commit arson anymore?</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Should we repent because we have lied and do not want to lie anymore?</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Should we repent because we were proud and do not want to be proud anymore?</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Does repentance mean only repentance from these sins?</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>No, repentance is to repent of our relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We should repent for only one thing: our relationship with God was wrong, and now we repent of it.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This is why the apostle said, "Repentance unto God" 20:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Being baptized means coming out of everything; it means coming out of the world and coming out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>How can we come out of the world and Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The only way is by death.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Once we die, everything is over.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Yesterday I read in the newspaper of a man who requested a change in his nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>He has to be approved by the Department of the Interior before he can be exempt from taxes and before his name can be removed from the census.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>However, once a man is dead, he is free from these things.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>When a man has died, he will not be drafted into the army, and he will not be taxed.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>When a census is taken, his name will not be included.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Being baptized is overturning our former position; it is acknowledging that when Christ died, we were brought to the cross as well.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Crucifixion is Christ's work, whereas baptism is a testimony of this work.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Baptism is the final chapter of our history.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Death is not the end; burial is the end. Man comes out of dust and must return to dust before he reaches his end. Burial terminates everything in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>It is the last page in a man's history, and it concludes the history of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>At the end of a book, the words "The End" are often present.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Baptism is "The End" of a man's history.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Friends, please remember that the Bible only emphasizes the sin of not believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>If you have not dealt with this sin, that is, if you have not received Christ as your Savior, you have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>If a man will deal with this sin, it will be easy for him to deal with all the other miscellaneous sins.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>But if he does not deal with this sin, he will go to hell even if he deals with all the other miscellaneous sins.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>May God grant us a proper relationship with Christ, and may God lead us to properly deal with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>We thank the Lord that His view concerning sin is different from the world's view.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>May we also have the same proper emphasis on sin.</S>
