   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING NOT TO TEACH DIFFERENTLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Furthermore, in the church life we all need to learn not to teach differently 1 Tim 6:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Anything that causes dissension or division or creates differing opinions must be avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to go on according to healthy teaching and not be sick about "questions and strifes of words" 1 Tim 6:4, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>. Because we are all for the recovery, we should not teach differently.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are not for doctrines that may stir up opinions about things such as the rapture or the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although I teach regarding these things, I do not encourage you to argue with others about them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If anyone wants to argue, you should simply say, "Brother, you just believe according to your way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is not a problem to me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, I have a different belief about the rapture."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no need to argue with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Be at peace with others and do not create an atmosphere that leads to debate or controversy regarding doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we have pointed out, we should not insist on pray-reading or calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some may come who love the church and have seen something concerning the church, but who may not feel positively about pray-reading or calling on the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, you should not force them to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Wait until they feel the need for it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, I may have a gold watch and someone else, a toy watch.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My grandchildren may prefer a toy watch to a gold watch.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If I take their toy watch away from them, they will be very unhappy and cry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have learned to wait until they grow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, when they have grown, they will appreciate my gold watch.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not argue with others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, wait, keep quiet, and let them grow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let them play with their toy watch until they are ready for a different kind of watch.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>NO NEED FOR UNIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no need for unification in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps one church may practice pray-reading and another church may not.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not endeavor to make the churches the same.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church life is not like an army or school; it is like a family.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some churches may be like the children in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But there is no need to argue with a childish church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, we should treasure such a church, for it is so new and so fresh, yet so childish.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not try to make other churches the same as yours.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To do that is to pluck up a tender sprout and cause it to die.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Leave the sprout in the earth and let it grow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps the church in your locality has been growing for a number of years and has reached a high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, another church may not have come to that standard.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Other churches may be rather sickly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, whatever the case, do not uproot it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, you should nourish it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Any attempt to unify the churches is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, in any particular church we should not try to unify the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you do this, you will get into difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The fleshly mentality wants everyone and everything the same.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It does not like to see the naughty young ones jumping and making noise.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But a healthy family is a noisy family.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In a normal family the children are playing and making noise.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some of the children may be crying and some of the naughty boys may even be fighting with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a normal, healthy situation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A number of times in the churches certain ones came to me and accused each other in my presence.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, I justified everyone and said, "I justify you because you are at the age for fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you do not fight, then you must be sick."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have learned this lesson from my grandchildren.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If they are not naughty, it must be that they are ill.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever they are too quiet, I wonder what is wrong with them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The elders need to learn not to take sides.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, they should justify all those who are fighting and leave them alone.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more they fight, the more they will eat; the more they eat, the more they will grow; and the more they grow, the more they will fight.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a cycle.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The fighting helps the eating, the eating helps the growing, and the growing in turn helps the fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All the young ones grow in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This may frighten some of the older ones, but this is the way the young people grow.</S>
