   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brothers, God requires that our spirit be released, and the church also requires that our spirit be released.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have a very great and crucial need: Our outer man must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the outer man is not broken, our spirit will not be released, and the impression we give to others will not be an impression of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A brother once was speaking on the subject of the Holy Spirit, but all his words, attitude, and stories exposed him as a man full of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While others were listening, they were uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Holy Spirit was in his mouth, but the self was in his being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His words were on the Holy Spirit, but the impression he gave to others was of his self.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What purpose does this serve?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must not pay attention to doctrines alone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The important thing is what comes out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If what comes out of us is the self, others will only touch the self.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even though our subject may be wonderful and our message excellent, what good will it serve?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has no intention for us to make progress in doctrine alone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He has to deal with the person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If our person is not dealt with, we will be of little use to God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will only be able to give others spiritual teachings; we will not be able to give others spiritual impressions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a great pity if our teachings are spiritual but the impressions we give to others are of the self!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the reason we repeatedly have spoken of the need for God to break our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Time after time, God has been arranging our circumstances to break our strong spot.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It may be so strong that one blow is not enough to take it away.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, a second blow comes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If our strong spot is still unyielding, a third blow will come.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God will not let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He has to break our strong spot.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He will never stop His work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What the Holy Spirit accomplishes in us through His disciplining work is different from what we receive through ordinary preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In receiving a message, we generally understand the doctrine in our mind and then wait for months and even years before God leads us into the truth subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We receive the message, and then we enter into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the discipline of the Holy Spirit works differently.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is characterized by the fact that the instant we see the truth, we receive the content of that truth itself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These two things occur at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not see the doctrine and then receive the content later.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are foolish men; we understand doctrines quickly, but we learn from the discipline slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can remember many teachings after hearing them once.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet the discipline of the Holy Spirit may come to us ten times, and we still may be bewildered and astonished as to what we are being disciplined for.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the Lord cannot break us with one blow, He will do it again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we experience the discipline of the Holy Spirit once, twice, ten times, or even a hundred times, the Lord will wrought something into us, and in that same moment we will see the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The moment we see the truth is the moment we acquire the thing itself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, the discipline of the Holy Spirit equals both the breaking down and the building up of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After a man passes through the Spirit's discipline, he will be edified as well as see the truth; he will be built up as well as torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When he has experienced so much discipline from the Holy Spirit, he will see and touch something real before the Lord, and he will say, "Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now I know that the Lord has used the past five or ten years to deal with me just for the purpose of getting rid of this one thing."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thank the Lord that He removes our obstacles through repeated dealings.</S>
