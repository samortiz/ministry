   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE WAY TO KNOW THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord has raised up His recovery upon the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Over the past years, the Lord in His recovery has completed the life-study of the entire New Testament and the life-studies of Genesis and Exodus in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the precious inheritance that the Lord has given to His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should enter into all the truths of the Bible by means of the life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not merely obtain some enjoyment from them; rather, we should gain some practical knowledge and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>HOW TO USE THE LIFE-STUDIES</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible is a special work of literature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although it does not focus on any particular topic, it has a central theme that is comprehensive, encompassing many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Over the ages, the greatest difficulty for Bible readers has been the difficulty of seeing the Bible s central light and the comprehensiveness of its light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, their understanding of the Bible has been fragmented and peripheral.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They may have understood a point here and a point there, but they have not been able to gain a complete understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we want to have a complete understanding of the Bible, we must see that the Bible has only one center and that this center encompasses many matters; it is comprehensive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Under this principle the life-studies have a center.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They also contain explanations and definitions of various matters, so they are comprehensive as well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, when we study the life-studies, we are always able to obtain the life nourishment from them, and we are also able to gain some knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, because they are comprehensive and are not focused on one specific topic, it is difficult for people to see the center.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why when we study the life-studies with people, we must point out the central theme and present the main points to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Pointing Out the Central Theme</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>and All of Its Aspects</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Let us take the Life-study of Exodus as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All Bible students know that Exodus speaks of Christ and that Christ is the center of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, to know this in such a simple way is insufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, we must point out which aspects of Christ are spoken of in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we should point out how Exodus presents all these aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some people say that Exodus speaks about matters such as the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This kind of answer is very general and does not reveal to us in a practical way the reality we see and enjoy in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, someone may ask you what you had for dinner, and you may answer in a definite way that you ate fish, shrimp, meat, tofu, and fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same way, we must be able to point out how Exodus speaks about the death of Christ and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only by doing this will we be able to show forth all the aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The central theme of Exodus is how Christ becomes everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, He became our Passover Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The blood of the Passover lamb typifies the precious blood of Christ shed for the forgiveness of our sins Matt 26:28; John 19:34; 1 Pet 1:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is also the meat which typifies the generating life of Christ as our supply John 6:53, 55 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then there is the unleavened bread that typifies Christ Jesus who is our nourishment of life and who takes away all our sinful and evil things 1 Cor 5:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Finally there are the bitter herbs that indicate that we need to regret and repent, to experience bitterness in the matter of sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we consider this picture, we can see that there is a relationship between eating and living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we want to live, we must eat; if we do not eat, we cannot live.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus said, He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first meal presented to us in Exodus is the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This meal indicates that Christ shed His precious blood for the forgiveness of sins and that His life enters into us as our supply and nourishment to enable us to give up all sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, when we sin, we experience a bitter feeling that causes us to repent of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then, when the Israelites left Egypt, God gave them the heavenly food manna, which typifies Christ as the heavenly life supply to be our daily nourishment and satisfaction that causes us to live by Him John 6:31-35, 48-51, 57-58 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later, God led the Israelites to experience the water flowing from the cleft rock.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul said that the Israelites all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ 1 Cor 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This living water typifies the Spirit who flows from the crucified and resurrected Christ as the all-inclusive water to supply us John 7:37-39; 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is also the tabernacle of God, that is, the dwelling place of God and the dwelling place of us, the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can abide in Him, enjoying the inward supply of the golden lampstand, the table of the bread of the Presence, and the golden incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These are all types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Checking These Types</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>with Our Practical Experience and</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Applying Them to Our Daily Living</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These items added together are comprehensive and not limited to one aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, they can be checked with our Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First, we have the precious blood of Christ that washes us from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The New Testament clearly says that the blood of Jesus, God s Son, cleanses us from every sin 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Next, Christ dispenses His life into us; in a sense, this is for us to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The meat of the lamb was distributed to all the people, and if anyone did not eat, he did not partake of the rich supply of Christ the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The matter of eating the Lord is truly a great gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Unfortunately, today s Christians almost never speak of eating the Lord, and they even oppose this matter because they think, How can we eat the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Bible, however, clearly says that the Lord wants us to eat Him John 6:53-57 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Old Testament is a picture in which God did not want the Israelites just to eat the meat of the lamb but also to eat the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs with it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This signifies that when we eat the Lord as our enjoyment, we must get rid of all our sinful things; this is the experience of the unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Simultaneously, He joins Himself to us inwardly, causing us to feel that we are corrupted and to become inwardly sorrowful; this is the experience of the bitter herbs.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These are all practical matters of enjoyment to us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we only read about the types and study the doctrines without comparing them to our own experiences, it will not be easy to understand Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, if we compare our experiences to these types, they are very easy to understand because they are descriptions of our normal Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For example, when we Christians get up early in the morning to read the Bible and pray, this is our eating the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, the manna cannot be eaten carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The picture in the Old Testament shows us that there are definite rules for gathering the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>First, the manna had to be gathered every morning Exo 16:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some people might have been lazy and reluctant to rise early in the morning, so they did not gather the manna and were hungry all day.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Second, the manna could not be kept until the next day v. 19 . Some people were greedy and gathered large piles of manna which they were unable to finish eating, and the next day the manna bred worms and stank v. 20 . According to our experience, the matter of gathering the manna indicates first of all that we must spend time every morning to read the Lord s Word and to draw near to Him; otherwise, we will not be able to obtain each day s supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Second, it indicates that the supply of life is for our enjoyment for one day only and cannot be kept over to the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Through the principle of gathering the manna we see God s balancing hand.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even though God did not allow the people to gather a double portion of manna each day, He gave them two days worth of manna on the sixth day of the week in order to enable them to keep the Sabbath on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>That extra portion did not breed worms but provided them with fresh enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This indicates that the enjoyment of Christ is not according to our method or calculation; rather, it is according to God s ordination and arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Let us also check the type of the tabernacle with our experience of abiding in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Christ is the tabernacle of God, the dwelling place of God, and He is also our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the tabernacle are the golden lampstand, the bread of the Presence, and the golden incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When we abide in the Lord, we obtain the supply of the bread of the Presence, receive the enlightening of the golden lampstand, and enjoy Him as our acceptable incense offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Apprehending and Experiencing</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>All the Aspects of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Exodus does not use any clear terms referring to Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>However, with the help of the life-study messages we can clearly see that although Exodus does not use the word death to talk about Christ s death, it does use the killing of the Passover lamb to describe Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In addition, while the Passover lamb does not directly show the resurrection of Christ, the lamb actually implies the reality of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The meat of the lamb eventually entered into its eaters to be their life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This implies the process of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Christ can be received into us to supply us inwardly and to live in us; this implies that He has gone through the process of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Therefore, the precious blood refers to the aspect of Christ s death, and the meat of the lamb entering into the Israelites refers to the aspect of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The blood was spread on the doorposts and on the lintel, signifying the crucified Christ as our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The meat was eaten to get into the people, signifying the resurrected Christ entering into us as our spiritual supply.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is our experience of the crucified and resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Moreover, Exodus does not use the specific term ascension to refer to the ascension of Christ, nor does it tell us where Christ went after He ascended, but this matter is implied in the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Manna came down from heaven to the Israelites, signifying Christ coming down from heaven as food for God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Moreover, manna came from God and descended from heaven, implying that when Christ ascended, He ascended to God, that is, to the Father John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Passover is a very clear picture showing the killing of the Passover lamb as a type of Christ s death and the shedding of His precious blood that washes us of all our sins and becomes our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It also shows the Israelites eating the meat of the lamb and taking it into them as a type of the resurrected Christ as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Finally, it shows the manna coming down from heaven as a type of Christ s ascending to the highest heaven and descending again to be our daily life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is our experience of the ascended Christ.</S>
