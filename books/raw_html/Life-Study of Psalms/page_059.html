<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. In His Death</H2><P>In Psalm 16:9-10 we see the revelation of the God-man, Christ, in His death (Acts 2:26-27).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. His Heart Rejoicing and<br>His Spirit with His Tongue Exulting</H2><P>Psalm 16:9a says that Christ's heart was rejoicing and His glory was exulting. This means His heart was rejoicing in Hades. The Hebrew word for glory in verse 9 can be interpreted as spirit or tongue. The Hebrew word means glory, but the Greek Septuagint translated the Hebrew word for glory into tongue. When Peter quoted Psalm 16:9 from the Septuagint in Acts 2, he said, "My tongue exulted" (v. 26). Some other versions translate the Hebrew word for glory as mouth. Thus, three things are referred to by the word glory: our spirit, our tongue, and our mouth. In Christ's death His heart was rejoicing, and His spirit with His tongue was exulting.</P><P>We have to exercise our spirit, our mouth, and our tongue in the meetings. This is the way to prophesy. Many saints come to the meetings and sit quietly. They are like the "marble Mary" outside some Catholic cathedrals. I would like to ask them, "Where is your spirit? Where is your mouth? Where is your tongue?" In the meetings their spirit is not exercised, their mouth is not exercised, and their tongue is not exercised. When we are in the meetings, we should exercise our spirit, our mouth, and our tongue to speak for the Lord. Then we will be glorious; we will be in glory. When we do not exercise in such a way, we are in a low condition. We need to exercise our spirit, our mouth, and our tongue to speak Christ to one another in the meetings. Then we are glorious because we are exercising the three parts of our glory: the spirit, the mouth, and the tongue.</P><P>Christ's heart rejoicing and His glory, His spirit with His tongue, exulting indicate that Christ was obedient to God even unto death, and that the death of a cross (Phil. 2:8). He was obedient unto death, not an ordinary death but a particular death, the death of the cross. This also indicates that Christ was willing and happy to die for the accomplishment of God's economy. He told us in John 10:17-18 that no one took His life away, but He laid it down. He also had the authority to take His life back. He died for the accomplishment of God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. His Flesh (His Physical Body) Dwelling Securely</H2><P>In His death, Christ's flesh (His physical body) dwelt securely (Psa. 16:9b). This indicates that Christ's body was buried in a secured tomb (Matt. 27:59-60). This also indicates that Christ was resting physically in His burial waiting to be resurrected.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. His Soul Having Gone to Sheol (Hades)<br>and Remaining There for Three Days</H2><P>His soul went to Sheol (Hades) and remained there for three days (Psa. 16:10a; Eph. 4:9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Not to See Corruption (Decay) in His Physical Body</H2><P>He did not see corruption (decay) in His physical body (Psa. 16:10b). This indicates His death and burial.</P>
