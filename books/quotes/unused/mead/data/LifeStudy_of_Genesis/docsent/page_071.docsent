   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In message ten I said that it is not wrong to allegorize the Bible, for even the apostle Paul allegorized Sarah and Hagar Gal 4:22-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, we need to allegorize Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Bible "eastward" signifies the direction of shining glory because the rising of the glorious sunshine occurs in the east Ezek.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God put man in Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word Eden in Hebrew means pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, Eden is a place of pleasure, enjoyment, and amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not think that having amusements is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today's sinful, worldly entertainments are certainly wrong, but amusement in God is undoubtedly right.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>a Lovely and Pleasant Place</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God set man in a garden, not in a factory, school, or cathedral.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He put him in a garden, a place that is not only lovely and pleasant, but also a place for growing things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A garden is not a playground where people play, a factory where they work, a school where they study, a hospital where they are cured, or a cathedral where they worship: a garden is a place for growing things, a place to produce life.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1 Corinthians 3:9 Paul says, "You are God's farm."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul's thought in 1 Corinthians 3 is the same as God's thought in Genesis 2, for a farm is a place for growth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because it produces life, a garden displays many beautiful things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the contrary, it is difficult to find beauty in a factory.</S>
