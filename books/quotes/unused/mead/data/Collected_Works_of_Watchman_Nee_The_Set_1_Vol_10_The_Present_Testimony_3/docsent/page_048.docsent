   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the first two centuries, believers greeted each other by saying, "The Lord is coming soon," or, "In Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Indeed, once we see that we are in Christ, everything is sweet and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the same time, the Spirit within us will put to death the deeds of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today Christians pay too much attention to either the objective truth or the subjective truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When one pays too much attention to the subjective truth, he suppresses himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is like an anchor that is not cast into the water; it is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then there are others who think that because Christ has died, they do not need to care for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ has indeed died on the cross; but if you do not believe this, you will still perish.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, if you believe that Christ has died on the cross and are willing to believe in Him, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Likewise, when the Spirit says to you that your temper, pride, and jealousy have been crucified, if you are willing and have the desire, the Spirit will give you the power to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you believe the objective truth, the Spirit will simultaneously make the objective truth your subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit will fulfill the outward truth you believe in you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit will fulfill what you believe has been accomplished on the cross in you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not only the case with the truth of our death with Christ, but it also applies to the truth of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians 2:6 says, "And raised us up together...in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How are we resurrected?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is of Christ and is an objective truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Resurrection is not only spoken of in Ephesians; Peter also said, "God...has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, the time when a Christian is regenerated is the time when he is resurrected together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, every regenerated Christian has been resurrected with the Lord, and every Christian who has been resurrected with the Lord has been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have been resurrected with Him, and He has raised us up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is the meaning of resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus died in His body; all the blood in His body was shed; He suffered numerous wounds on His head from the crown of thorns; He had wounds on His hands and feet and a gash on His side from a spear.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the power of death that took hold of His body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When God's life came into His body, He became alive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the meaning of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This life overcame all the effects of death in His body; it healed all the wounds and did away with all the pain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Formerly, the eyes could not see, the ears could not hear, and the hands could not move; now they are all able to function.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be dead, according to the Bible, is to be absolutely powerless and utterly weak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Death is spiritual inability and impossibility.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Formerly, the Lord was bound by numerous burial cloths.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But what happened at the time of resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The resurrection of the Lord was vastly different from that of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Lazarus came out of the tomb, his hands and feet were bound with cloth, and his face was bound with a handkerchief.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He needed someone else to set him free.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the contrary, regarding the Lord's resurrection, the Bible says, "He beheld the linen cloths lying there and the handkerchief which had been over His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in one place apart" John 20:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord did not slowly cut His cloths loose.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's power and life entered in and loosened every lawful or unlawful bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What was a corpse became a moving and liberated being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was the resurrection of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I remember, when I first began to work for the Lord, I would ask the Lord to resurrect me together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I thought that if the Lord would resurrect me together with Him, then I would have the power to do God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I was wrong in praying that way because it was something initiated by me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible says I have been resurrected together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is an accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please remember that the more we turn to ourselves, the worse we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not that we should not have subjective experiences, but we should first believe the objective truth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I can now say, "Lord, I thank You; You have resurrected, and I have been resurrected together with You."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must first believe the fact that we have been resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How were we resurrected?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do we feel like we have resurrected?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No, it is Christ who resurrected us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can ask how we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>While we were yet sinners, we heard the gospel that the Lord Jesus died for us and cleansed us from our sins with His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We believed and were immediately saved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We did not look at ourselves to see whether we were qualified, but we looked away to what the Lord accomplished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once we lay hold of this fact, we will be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, if we only pay attention to the objective truth and not to the subjective truth, we are like one-winged birds trying to fly.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not emphasize one half and neglect the other.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Ephesians 2:6 tells us that we have been raised up together with Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the other hand, Ephesians 1:19-20 says, "And what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although the believers in Ephesus were resurrected with Christ, the apostle Paul still wanted them to know the exceeding greatness of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 19 tells us the greatness of this power; verse 20 tells us that this power is the resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In other words, although we have been resurrected, we still need to know the greatness of this power.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the objective side we have resurrection; on the subjective side we still need to know the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>One cannot say, "My temper has been crucified, but I still can lose my temper."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>On the objective side his temper has been crucified, but on the subjective side he should still put his temper to death by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>On the subjective side he still needs to be empowered by the Spirit to deny the world and obey God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>With the reality of the objective aspect, one still needs to have the subjective experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>One very bad phenomenon is that some people do not believe the objective facts but only focus their efforts on subjective experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Other people only believe the objective facts and ignore the subjective experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>According to the Bible, if one lacks faith, he will never experience spiritual deliverance, and if he lacks obedience, he will also not experience spiritual deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Faith is toward what Christ has accomplished, while obedience is specifically toward what the Spirit will accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Faith is toward Christ, and obedience is toward the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Therefore, it is very crucial to believe and obey.</S>
