The other three categories are ordinances, the old man, and the spots and wrinkles. Because in our natural, religious concept, doctrine is positive and is viewed positively by most Christians, it is difficult to speak about doctrine in a negative way. Doctrine, however, can frustrate the building up of the Body of Christ. In 4:14 Paul speaks of the negative effect of doctrine: &ldquo;That we may be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.&rdquo; Not many Christians have paid adequate attention to this verse, a verse which indicates that doctrine can damage the Body of Christ.</p><p>According to the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus had a difficult time with those religious people who were steeped in doctrine. The scribes, Pharisees, elders, and chief priests argued with Him over doctrine. Little did they realize that they were actually arguing with God, the One who inspired the Old Testament on which their doctrines were based. In their blindness they used the Scriptures to argue with the One who inspired the Scriptures and whose coming the Scriptures foretold. Those who were occupied with doctrine missed the opportunity to gain Christ. They did not realize that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, God was not concerned for doctrine, but for Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">DAMAGED BY DOCTRINE AND PHILOSOPHY</h2><p>After the church had been established and had begun to spread, problems in the churches were caused by doctrine. Romans 14 indicates this. The doctrines concerning eating and observing days were derived from Judaism, not from heathen philosophy. Although the Roman Empire did persecute the church, this persecution did not damage the church life. However, damage was caused by religious doctrine. The situation that made it necessary to call the conference described in Acts 15 was caused by doctrine. Just as doctrine caused damage to the church life in the first century, it can damage the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today.</p><p>The church life has also been damaged by philosophy, especially by Gnosticism with all its concepts. If we bring in concepts derived from our cultural background, we shall cause problems in the church life. The church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery can still be damaged by doctrine and philosophy.</p><p>Most Christians appreciate those who are knowledgeable in the Scriptures. But, in a sense, it may be a dreadful thing to acquire a vast knowledge of the Bible, if our Bible knowledge causes us to miss Christ. Remember that it was those who knew the Scriptures&mdash;the Pharisees and the scribes&mdash;who persecuted the Lord Jesus and the apostles. The principle is the same today. The ones who are most opposed to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are those with a certain amount of Bible knowledge.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S CONCERN</h2><p>God&rsquo;s concern is with Christ and the church, not with doctrine or Bible knowledge. However, many Christians care more for doctrine than for Christ and the church. God&rsquo;s economy is not to have a group of people who know the Bible. It is to work Christ into His chosen people for the building up of the Body. We must condemn any doctrine that distracts us from Christ or that hinders us from being built up in the Body. Even doctrines that are scriptural or fundamental may be used by the enemy to distract us from Christ and the church. Satan hates to see God&rsquo;s people built up in the Body. Although God&rsquo;s goal is to produce the Body by working Christ into us, most of His people have been distracted from God&rsquo;s economy and from His eternal purpose. Doctrines are among the good things utilized by Satan in his subtlety to distract God&rsquo;s people from God&rsquo;s will. The reason God has put His seal upon the recovery of the church is that in the recovery we are pursuing God&rsquo;s goal, not mere doctrinal knowledge.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_260.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_262.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Ephesians &nbsp; pg 261</div><br></body></html>
