   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>George Whitefield</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This extraordinary evangelist, who is as famous as John Wesley, when he was dying, said:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Oh, may I be able to lie down and die in the labor of my Lord, for I consider it worthwhile to die for this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If I have a thousand bodies, every one of these bodies will be a wandering evangelist for Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The last time he retired to rest, holding a candle, there was a big flock of people surrounding his doorway, asking him to preach to them once more.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He knew that he was dying that day, yet he preached to them until the candle burned out, and then he went upstairs to die.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When this man talked about himself, he said:</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the fulfilling of all our responsibilities there is always corruption mixed within it; therefore, after our repentance, if Jesus Christ would only receive us according to our deeds; then our deeds would surely condemn us because we cannot offer a prayer which is as perfect as that required by the moral law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not know how you might think; but I can say that I cannot pray, I can only sin; I cannot preach to you or to others, I can only sin; I can only say this: even my repentance needs repenting again; even my tears need to be washed in the precious blood of my Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The best deeds we have are but sins with spectacles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Augustus Toplady</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This very godly person, when he counted his sins, considered that every second he committed at least one sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That is to say that in ten years, there were more than three hundred million sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, he wrote that glorious hymn which caused millions of people, who were tired and oppressed by sin, to find rest "Rock of Ages, cleft for me, / Let me hide myself in Thee"!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He wrote:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Oh, is there one as pitiable as I in this world!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Besides weakness and sin I have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In my flesh there is no good thing, and how surprising that I could be tempted to view myself so high.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The best work I have done in my life only qualifies me to be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when he was dying of tuberculosis in London, he leaned his sinful head on the breast of the Savior and said, "I am the happiest man in this world."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jonathan Edwards</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was a very spiritual man who was greatly used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever he preached, countless people wept for their sins, as if pricked in their hearts, and asked forgiveness of the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was a most honest man, so he wrote the following very humbly:</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I often feel most deeply how I myself am filled with sins and filth; very often because this feeling is too strong, I cannot help but cry aloud.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes I cry for so long, so that I have no alternative but to lock myself up often.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now I feel very deeply the wickedness of myself and the corruption of my heart, even more severely than before my conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Speaking of myself, I have long felt that my wickedness is completely incurable; it fills my thoughts and imaginations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet at the same time I feel that my sensitivity toward sins is too little and too slight; I am surprised that I actually cannot have more sensitivity toward sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What I most hope for now is to be able to have a contrite heart and to most humbly prostrate myself before God.</S>
