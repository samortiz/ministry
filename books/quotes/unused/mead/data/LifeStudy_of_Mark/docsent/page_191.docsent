   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE SIXTY-SIX A LIFE FULLY ACCORDING TO AND FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 15 Scripture Reading: Mark 1:14-18; 4:26; 9:1-8; 10:23-25; Rom 14:17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the two preceding messages we considered four important matters: the background of the Lord s ministry, the Lord as the Sower sowing Himself into God s people, the condition of the disciples as soil, and the Lord s healing of this soil through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We saw that through this healing the one hundred twenty became the good ground for the Lord s sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, we saw that in Acts 10 and 21 and Galatians 2 there are strong indications that the weeds of things that replace Christ had begun to grow again.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We concluded the last message with a word concerning the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We pointed out that, according to the New Testament, the kingdom of God is a Person, the Lord Jesus Christ, sown into us in order to be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In His ministry, the Lord came to sow Himself as the seed of the kingdom into God s chosen people so that this seed might develop into God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE KINGDOM AS THE TRANSFIGURATION OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We see another aspect of the kingdom in 9:1-8.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 9:1 the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I tell you, there are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the kingdom of God come in power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse is immediately followed by the record of the Lord s transfiguration on the mount.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verses 2 and 3 go on to say, And after six days Jesus takes with Him Peter and James and John, and brings them up into a high mountain by themselves alone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And He was transformed before them; and His garments became brilliant, exceedingly white, such as no fuller on earth could whiten them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we put these verses together, we see that the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus was the coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This proves that the kingdom is not a material realm.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, these verses indicate that the kingdom is a Person transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord Jesus was transfigured, that was the coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What, then, is the kingdom of God?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The kingdom of God is the Lord Jesus Himself transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>EXPERIENCING THE LORD BLOSSOMING WITHIN US The Lord Being Transfigured in Us</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to consider this understanding of the kingdom as the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus in the light of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him, you received a Jesus who was not transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as the seed received by the soil is a seed that has not yet been transfigured, so in our experience the Christ we received was a Christ not transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The transfiguration of a seed requires the growth of that seed into a mature plant and the blossoming of that plant.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we may say that the transfiguration of a seed requires growth and blossoming.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In a similar way, the Lord Jesus we received needs to grow in us until He blossoms from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are the soil, and the Lord Jesus is the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we received Him into us, we received Him as the One who had not yet been transfigured in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Have you received the Lord Jesus, and is He now in you?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all can testify strongly that we have received the Lord and that He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But has the Lord been transfigured in you?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the Lord who is in you has not yet been transfigured, others will not be able to see the kingdom of God in you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since we have not yet experienced this kind of transfiguration, we need the Lord to grow in us until He blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That blossoming will be the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus in us in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a transfiguration is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Enjoyment and Ruling</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The transfiguration of the Lord Jesus within us becomes not only our enjoyment but also God s ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord Jesus is transfigured in us in a practical way in our daily living, that transfiguration becomes the kingdom of God ruling everything in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This kingdom rules us and also gives us the full enjoyment of God.</S>
