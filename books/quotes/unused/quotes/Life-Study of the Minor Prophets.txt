2) The Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights for the salvation of God to all the sinners
4) Christ will dwell in the holy mountain of Zion, to be a shelter and a stronghold to Israel, and rule among them from Jerusalem
Christ is the eternal One, but in His incarnation He became a man in time by being born in the small town of Bethlehem
It was a surprise to the Jewish prophet Jonah that God would care for the Gentiles and send him to Nineveh, an evil city built by Nimrod
Malachi 4:2a declares, 'Unto you who fear My name will the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in His wings'
In this introductory word, let us now go on to consider the composition, the contents, and the central thought of the Minor Prophets
The book of the prophets' mentioned by Stephen in Acts 7:42, in his quoting of Amos 5:25-27, might refer to this collective book
We have pointed out that Micah 5:2c says that Christ's 'goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity'
Jonah was swallowed by a great fish and was vomited out of it for the spreading of God's salvation to the Gentile Ninevites
As we have seen, according to Malachi 4:2 Christ will arise as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings
Hosea 6:3b says, 'His going forth is as sure as the dawn, / And He will come to us as the rain, / As the latter rain which waters the earth'
In Joel 3:11 Christ is unveiled in His coming as the mighty One with His overcomers to defeat Antichrist and his army
In the Minor Prophets Christ is unveiled in His reigning in Zion as Israel's King, the Ruler in Israel, in the millennium
The matter of the righteous one, or the just one, living by his faith was not initiated by Paul but was prophesied in the Minor Prophets
Even in the Minor Prophets it is prophesied that God would be light to us, His people, and would bring us into the light
He will arise as the Sun of righteousness and come as the Angel of the covenant to reign in Zion and shepherd Israel
In this way God and His chosen people become a couple, a compound person, just as Adam and Eve became a couple
God's desire is to be united with His chosen people to be a universal couple, which in Revelation 22:17 is called 'the Spirit and the bride'
Israel has been under Babylon MedoPersia the MacedonianGrecian Empire and the Roman Empire which continues to influence the entire world
In this message we will first give an introductory word and then begin to consider the symbol of a wife of harlotries
By the time of Hosea's ministry, Israel had been divided into two kingdoms: the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah
The subject of the book of Hosea is Jehovah as the salvation to the adulterous and apostate Israel in receiving her back and restoring her
Israel was given up by God at the time of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and also later when Titus destroyed Jerusalem in A
Although they have been somewhat established in the land of Palestine, God still has not received them back or restored them
In His first coming Christ would be in union with Israel as the Son of God fleeing to Egypt and being called out of Egypt
In His second coming Christ will go forth as the dawn and come to Israel as the rain, as the latter rain which waters the earth
The book of Hosea has three sections: a wife of harlotries ; a people of apostasy ; and the restoration of Israel
In the restoration the number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or numbered
In the place where it will be said to them, You are not My people, / It will be said to them, You are the sons of the living God'
Eventually, the Lord will charge the children of Israel to say to their brothers, 'Ammi' , and to their sisters, 'Ruhamah'
On the one hand, His dealing with us is a matter of His chastisement; on the other hand, it is a matter of His love
The harlotries of Gomer as the wife to the prophet Hosea symbolize the adulteries of Israel as the unchaste wife to Jehovah
Quite often the great God would do many small things in order to frustrate us for the purpose of dealing with us
Hosea 2:7a goes on to say, 'She will pursue her lovers / But will not overtake them; / And she will seek them but not find them'
Israel did not know that it was Jehovah who gave her the grain, the new wine, and the fresh oil and who multiplied to her silver and gold
God does such things in order to correct us, to adjust us, to perfect us, and to make us according to His intention
He will bring all her mirth to an end, her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her appointed assemblies
He will desolate her vine and her fig tree, of which she said, 'These are my payments / That my lovers have given me'
She will respond there as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt
For Jehovah will take away the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they will no longer be remembered by their name
Jehovah will make a covenant for Israel in that day with the beasts of the field, the birds of heaven, and the creeping things of the earth
In that day Jehovah will answer the heavens, and the heavens will answer the earth with rain to enable the earth to grow things
The earth will answer the grain, the fresh wine, and the oil, and they will answer Jezreel, which symbolizes sowing
Apparently, God stopped loving Israel when Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem and again when Titus the prince of Rome destroyed Jerusalem
To this day Israel has been left alone, apparently without God's love, yet God still cares for Israel in His own way
Later, as a symbol of His intention to love the children of Israel again, Jehovah told Hosea to love Gomer again, and Hosea did so
From that time, Israel has been without king, without prince, and without their worship by offering sacrifices to God
What Hosea did in obedience to God's command regarding Gomer was a confirmation of what God promised to do regarding Israel
Hosea 4-6 covers the sins of the apostate people, the punishments of Jehovah, and the return of the apostate people
Of truth, kindness, and the knowledge of God, there were false swearing, deceiving , murder, stealing, and adultery
Because of this the land mourned, and the inhabitants of the land languished with the beasts of the field and with the birds of heaven
Verse 5 says that the priest would stumble in the day and that the prophet would stumble with the priest in the night
Verse 6a tells us that God's people-the priests-would be destroyed because of a lack of that knowledge of God mentioned in verse 1
Referring to the priests, verses 8 and 9 say, 'They feed on the sin of My people, / And their soul desires their iniquity
Hosea 4:11-14 is a word concerning three things that were prevailing among the Israelites-fornication, wine, and harlotries
Of praying to God and inquiring of Him, God's people inquired at their wooden post , considering that their rod informed them of things
Verse 5 says that the pride of Israel testifies to his face and that Ephraim and Israel would stumble in their iniquity
In the Bible God is usually likened to positive things, but here He is likened to negative things, things that consume
Like bands of robbers lying in wait for a man, the company of priests murdered on the way to Shechem, committing wickedness
In the house of Israel Jehovah had seen a horrid thing: the harlotry of Ephraim was there; Israel had defiled itself
According to 5:15a Jehovah will go away and return to His place, until the apostate people acknowledge their offense and seek His face
Hosea 6:2 says, 'He will enliven us after two days; / On the third day He will raise us up, / And we will live in His presence'
According to this principle, the two days here might signify the first two periods of a thousand years each, counting from A
70 when the Roman prince Titus destroyed Jerusalem and the temple cruelly killed thousands of Jews and scattered the Jews among the nations
From that time the Jews have been without king without prince without sacrifice and without the temple fulfilling Hoseas prophecy in 34
In Hosea 6:3 there is a word concerning knowing Jehovah and concerning Christ's going forth as the dawn and His coming as the rain
In the restoration time the earth will be restored to its original condition and will be rich, fertile, and productive
The first is God's loving chastisement over His dear elect Israel, and the second is God's punishment on all the nations
It was through the Roman Empire that Christ was born in a way that fulfilled the prophecy in Micah 5:2 concerning the place of His birth
With the help of the Roman Empire, the apostles, especially the apostle Paul, spread the gospel in Asia and Europe
Later, the Lord used imperialism to spread the gospel to Africa, Central and South America, Asia, and Australia
Our going to Russia today to minister the proper spiritual food is the spreading of the manifestation of Christ
On the feast day of the king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine, and the king stretched out his hand with scorners
Verses 11 and 12 say, 'Ephraim has become like a silly dove / Without understanding: / They call to Egypt; / They go to Assyria
Israel's being likened to a silly dove symbolizes that they were lacking the proper knowledge of God in His economy
Hosea was asking when they would lose their capacity to make idols, when they would no longer be able to make idols
Human beings may not be capable of understanding the Bible or of knowing God, but they are very capable in making many things their idols
Today there is a little nation in Palestine with Jerusalem as its center, but what nation takes pleasure in Israel?
As for the sacrifices of Jehovah's offerings, they sacrificed flesh and ate it, but Jehovah had no delight in them
Their sacrifices would be to them as the bread of mourning, the bread eaten by a family who had lost a relative
All who ate such sacrifices would be unclean, for their bread would be for themselves and would not come into the house of Jehovah
Verse 5 indicates that they would not participate in the day of assembly and in the day of the feast of Jehovah
The prophet was a fool and the inspired man was mad because of the greatness of Israels iniquity and because of the greatness of the enmity
Verse 8b continues, 'As for the prophet, a fowler's trap / Is in all his ways; / Enmity is in the house of his God'
The corruption of Ephraim was so great that it matched the corruption in the days of Gibeah described in Judges 19:15-30
Jehovah found Israel like grapes in the wilderness, and saw their fathers as the first ripe fruit on the fig tree at its beginning
Verse 3 says, 'For now they will say, / We have no king, / For we did not fear Jehovah; / And the king, what can he do for us'?
In verses 4 through 8 we have further details concerning the idolatry of Israel against Jehovah and the punishments of Jehovah upon Israel
Its people would mourn over it, and its idol priests would tremble for it, for its glory, because it had departed from it
Samaria would be cut off with her king and would be like sticks, or small pieces of wood, on the surface of the water
Israel thought that the battle which took place in Gibeah against the children of iniquity could not overtake them
They were to break up the fallow ground; that is, they were to seek God until Christ came as righteousness to rain righteousness upon them
Thus Bethel will cause this to happen to you / Because of your great evil: / At dawn the king of Israel / Will be utterly cut off'
God sent the prophets to call Israel again and again, but the more the prophets called them, the farther they went away from the prophets
As they called them, / So they went from them; / To the Baals they sacrificed, / And to the idols they burned incense'
In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul charged us to desire earnestly to prophesy and said that we all can prophesy one by one
The Lord has shown us that in His recovery today He wants to recover 1 Corinthians 14 that is to recover the prophesying of every believer
Every Lord's Day, after remembering the Lord and worshipping the Father at the Lord's table, all the members of the church should prophesy
If we all, the young ones and the old ones, prophesy one by one, how rich, how high, how fresh, how living, and how powerful that would be!
They would not return to the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian would be their king, for they refused to return to Jehovah
The sword would whirl about in their cities, consume their bars, and devour them because of their own counsels
In Ephraim's hands were two kinds of balances: one that weighed light for buying and one that weighed heavy for selling
The king given by Jehovah in His anger might have been Saul, who was eventually taken away by Jehovah in His overflowing wrath
God used Hosea's marriage to Gomer and his family to demonstrate how Israel as a wife to Jehovah had become unfaithful to her Husband
When God's everlasting love is touched, Israel is called God's son , indicating that Israel has the Father's life
Hosea 11:1 also indicates that Christ joined Israel to be the Son of God and that He was called out of Egypt by God
God's love in teaching Ephraim to walk and in taking Ephraim in His arms shows us that God's love is divine but on a human level
At Bethel Jacob found Jehovah, and there Jehovah spoke with the children of Israel, even Jehovah, the God of hosts
The children of Israel should return there to their God, keep lovingkindness and justice, and wait on their God continually
In verses 4 through 8 we have a picture of Israel in the restoration , as revealed in Hosea 2:15-23; 3:5; 6:1-3; 10:12
His shoots will go forth ; his splendor will be like that of the olive tree ; and his fragrance will be like that of the trees of Lebanon
Instead of being an unturned cake or a silly dove or a deceitful bow we will be like lilies trees of Lebanon olive trees and budding vines
A husband who loves his wife in affection may spoil her, but a father who loves his son in life never spoils his son
Jehovah's being like a green fir tree and Ephraim's bearing fruit from Him indicates Ephraim's oneness with Jehovah
Today God is the evergreen tree, and we, the believers in Christ, are the branches of the tree, bearing fruit out of Him
The Lord Jesus lived among us on earth for thirty-three and a half years, and His human living is the second segment of these cords
From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven'
The cords of a man, therefore, involve Christ's humanity in His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
God's everlasting love, His unchanging, subduing love, is altogether in Christ, with Christ, by Christ, and for Christ
During the forty years the children of Israel were in the wilderness, God gently and patiently fed them with manna
Sometimes we may want to eat too much or eat in haste, but God wants us to eat slowly and gently with patience and endurance
The corporate Christ will come as a stone cut out without hands and will smite the human government into pieces
In the book of Joel Christ is revealed in His coming with His overcomers as the mighty ones to defeat Antichrist and his army
The time from the sixth seal to the beginning of the thousand-year kingdom will be a little more than three and a half years
There will be the natural calamities of the sixth seal upon the sun, the moon, the stars, the heavens, and the earth
Revelation 8712 speaks of the severer calamities of the first four trumpets upon the earth the sea the rivers and the sun moon and stars
The calamities of the sixth seal and the first four trumpets are a cluster related to the judgment of the universe
The first woe the fifth trumpet will be by the locusts from the abyss under Antichrist as their king who will also come out from the abyss
The second woe, the sixth trumpet, will be by the four angels released from the Euphrates with the two hundred million horsemen
The evil and malignant sore of the first bowl will be upon the men who have the mark of the beast and worship his image
In the second bowl the sea will become blood like that of a dead man, and every living soul that is in the sea will die
In the third bowl the rivers and springs will become blood to be the drink of those who pour out the blood of the saints and the prophets
In the sixth bowl there will be the war of Armageddon, in which Antichrist and his armies will fight against Christ with His overcomers
Christ will destroy Antichrist and all his evil armies, and Antichrist and the false prophet will be cast into the lake of fire
Probably at the beginning of the great tribulation the religious Babylon the Great the Roman Catholic Church will be destroyed by Antichrist
At the end of the great tribulation, the political Babylon the Great, the revived Roman Empire, will be destroyed by the Lord
Finally, the heavens and the earth will be renewed with intense burning heat to be the new heavens and the new earth for the New Jerusalem
The elders among the people should hear this message, and all the inhabitants of the land should give heed to it
They should tell their children about it, their children should tell their children, and their children should tell the next generation
The four horns, the four beasts, the four sections of the great image, and the four kinds of locusts all refer to the same four empires
Apparently, these four empires are human like the great human image representing the totality of human government
Today the world's culture is Roman, yet, being an accumulated culture, it contains the cultures of the Babylonians, Persians, and Greeks
In this way God is accomplishing whatever is needed for Christ to be manifested in full, that the entire universe may be fully restored
They should do this so that God would turn, repent, and leave a blessing behind Him-a meal offering and a drink offering
When Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem and the temple, Israel lost the place appointed by God where they could offer their offerings to God
Israel lost both the ground and the materials to offer the meal offering to feed God and the drink offering to cheer God
The Spirit poured out on the day of Pentecost was the Spirit of God compounded with Christ's humanity, death, resurrection, and ascension
By this outpouring all the disciples and saved ones on the day of Pentecost became parts of the corporate Christ
From what we have covered so far in this life-study of Joel, we can see that this book deals with world history
The purpose of Christ's judgment upon the living will be to recompense the nations' mistreatment of Israel during the great tribulation
According to verses 9 through 13, Christ with His overcomers as the mighty ones will defeat Antichrist and his armies at Armageddon
Joel 3:18a tells us that in the restoration the mountains will drop down fresh wine, and the hills will flow with milk
It is true to say that Daniel's prophecy is the controlling factor for us to understand and interpret the prophecies in the Bible
The controlling factors in Daniel are on the surface, whereas the factors in Joel are hidden, concealed, in a mysterious way
These four kinds of locusts denote the four sections of the entire human government on earth signified by the great human image in Daniel 2
God used the Roman Empire to keep the region around the Mediterranean Sea-the center of human habitation-in a peaceful order
Highways were built, shipping routes were established on the sea, and a common language, Greek, was spoken by all the peoples
It was at that time that God came to be incarnated by being born of a virgin in a small city, Bethlehem, and eventually lived in Nazareth
On the same day, in the morning of His resurrection, He ascended to the Father and descended again to the earth to meet with His disciples
From this we see that it was through the Roman locusts that both God's redemption and the preaching of the gospel were carried out
The gospel was spread throughout the Roman Empire and then, as a result of Roman imperialism, to other parts of the world
Today three things are taking place on earth: the consuming by the Roman locusts, the suffering of Israel, and the manifestation of Christ
We are joined neither to the consuming of the Roman locusts nor to the suffering of Israel but to the manifestation of Christ
Little of Christ is manifested in the Roman Catholic Church and in the denominations, but Christ is manifested in His recovery
The line of the manifestation of Christ will eventually bring us into the fuller manifestation of Christ in the age of restoration
We all need to have a clear view of the age in which we are living, of where we are, and of what our goal should be
He is working among the Jews and by the nations to perform His economy in the building up of the organism of the Body of Christ
These locusts denote the human government which has been existing for twenty-seven hundred years and which continues to exist
On the one hand, God allows this suffering to continue; on the other hand, He does not allow Israel to be utterly consumed
Many books have been written about world history, but these books do not touch these factors, these principles, as we are doing here
The suffering factor was the factor to consummate the divine incarnation the suffering of the Jews was the factor to produce the incarnation
We have seen that Israel was used by God through so much suffering for the purpose that God could be born out of man to be a God-man
The Roman Empire, the aggregate of the four empires, afforded everything necessary for the incarnated God to live and move and work on earth
Now we as the church are the manifestation of Christ produced by the outpouring of the processed and consummated Triune God upon all flesh
Because of the locusts we have such things as the telephone, the microphone, the recorder, the airplane, the computer, and the fax machine
Because of the locusts we in the United States enjoy the freedom of speech and the freedom to meet together as the church
The millions of locusts swarming on earth today are serving us so that we may be here for the manifestation of Christ
With the help of the Roman Empire, Christ lived on earth, was crucified, and was resurrected to be enlarged, to produce the church
In this universe there are two histories: the history of man, the human history, and the history of God, the divine history
We may liken the history of man to the shell of a walnut and the history of God to the kernel within the shell
If we would know the divine history that takes place within the human history, we first need to realize that the Triune God is eternal
God's intention in His economy is thus to have a corporate entity, composed of God and man, to be His expression for eternity
It is marvelous that God became a man named Jesus and that this man lived in Nazareth, working as a carpenter, until the age of thirty
Christ's incarnation and His human living both are parts of the divine history, the history of God within the history of man
His crucifixion was a vicarious death, an all-inclusive death which terminated the old creation and solved all problems
Through Christs resurrection millions were begotten regenerated by God to be sons of God and to be members of the Body of Christ the church
The church also is part of the divine history, the intrinsic history of the divine mystery within the outward, human history
The Figure in the divine history will defeat the figure in the human history and then cast him into the lake of fire
Now we need to ask ourselves this question: Are we living in the divine history, or are we living merely in the human history?
The Bible has much to say about God, Christ, Israel, and many other things, but what does the Bible actually talk about?
In Genesis, Exodus, the Psalms, and the entire Old Testament, God was with man but not yet in man and not yet one with man
Whereas in the past God was with man and His history was a history with man now God was in man and His history began to be a history in man
A verse which speaks of this involvement is Revelation 22:17a, which says, 'The Spirit and the bride say, Come'!
Although God had such a purpose in creating man, man has another, subtle, purpose, and these two purposes do not agree
Of these four kinds of locusts-Babylonian, Persian, Greek, and Roman-the Roman locusts are still with us today
Although God allows the locusts to cut, swarm, lick, and consume, He does not permit them to destroy His people utterly
The first rebellion was the rebellion of Satan and the angels who followed him; the second was the rebellion of man
These two rebellions-the angelic and the human-defiled and polluted the universe, so the God-created universe needs a restoration
The manifestation of Christ has been going on for a long time, and it will continue until the fallen universe has been fully restored
Eventually, in the consummation of the restoration, there will be the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center
Because we are a failure and because our situation is wretched, terrible, and miserable, we need God's chastisement
For this reason, our human life as Christians is a life of chastisement through the sufferings caused by different kinds of 'locusts'
The goal, the purpose, of this chastisement is that Christ would be manifested in us for the restoration of the universe
The subject of the book of Amos is Jehovah's judgments on Israel and the surrounding nations, with the issue of restoration
The words 'because of three transgressions of Damascus' and 'because of four' indicate repeated transgressions
Damascus was to be judged for its repeated transgressions-for its threshing Gilead with sharp threshing tools of iron
Also, he would break its bar and cut off the inhabitant and the one in power, and put the people into captivity
Israel also transgressed in that a man and his father went in unto the same woman, in order to profane Jehovah's holy name
Flight would perish from the swift; the strong would not strengthen his force, nor would the mighty deliver his soul
Finally, Jehovah declared that he who was stout-hearted among the mighty men would flee away naked in that day
Verse 2 says that since Israel was the only family of the earth whom Jehovah has known, He would visit upon them all their iniquities
Verses 9 through 12 go on to speak of the oppressions, violence, and devastation in Samaria and Jehovah's visitation
Those who went to the retreat houses for enjoyment were also those who worshipped idols at the altars of Bethel
Jehovah reproved Israel for oppressing the poor and crushing the needy and for saying to their lords, 'Bring, and let us drink'
Fallen and no more to rise / Is the virgin of Israel; / She has been cast down upon her land; / There is none to raise her up
The leaders did not care for justice and righteousness and did not care for the people according to the law of God
Eventually, the day of Jehovah will come upon them, a horrible day, and they will suffer woe, for it will be darkness to them and not light
All the Prophets are on the same subject, but each one gives a different picture from a different angle or with a different aspect
By reading all the Prophets we can realize how evil the children of Israel were and how loving God was toward them
He was poured out as the Spirit in His descension to be one with us to produce a corporate Christ, that is, the Body of Christ
The kernel is the mysterious things in the age of mystery, which began with Christ's incarnation and will end with Christ's second appearing
These are the governing principles that we should hold when we read the Old Testament, especially the Prophets
They boasted that they enjoyed everything and had everything by their own strength and through their own capability
Because of this, Jehovah's punishment would be meted out through the enemy's oppression, captivity, killing, and destruction
The Lord was holding a plumb line to measure Israel in order to determine what part had to be destroyed and what part had to be retained
Amos answered, 'Jehovah said to me, Go, prophesy to My people Israel' , and he prophesied against Amaziah and against Israel
Amos 7:14 says that the worshippers of the calf of Samaria and of the idols in Dan and Beer-sheba would fall and not rise up again
Verses 7 through 10 reveal that the Lord's destruction of Israel the sinful kingdom would not be an utter destruction of the house of Jacob
The restoration of the house of Israel with the rebuilding of the fallen tabernacle of David is covered in verses 11 through 15
In that day the kingdom of David and the family of David will be restored, and all the nations will be called by the name of Jehovah
When Christ comes back, in His last appearing He will be the real David to restore His kingdom and His royal family
Christ will come and restore the fallen kingdom of David to set up His kingdom for the restoration of the entire universe
Amos 9:13 says that days are coming when the plowman will overtake the reaper, and the grape treader, him who sows the seed
Because of its arrogance Jehovah will bring Edom from its dwelling in the lofty clefts of the rock to the ground
The people of Edom were proud of their lofty dwelling and thought that they were higher and more lofty than others
Jehovah dealt with Edom further by destroying its wise men, dismaying its mighty men, and cutting off each one from the mountain of Esau
Edom also entered the gate of Israel, looked on Israel's affliction, and sent forth his hands on their substance in their calamity
Edom stood at the crossroads to cut off those of Israel who escaped and delivered them to their enemy in their distress
The Maccabees, taking Mount Zion as their ground to judge Edom, gained a victory over Antiochus Epiphanes about 165 B
The victory of the Maccabees was a type of the victory Israel will gain immediately before the age of restoration
The Minor Prophets, including Obadiah, reveal that the nations used by God to chastise sinful Israel do something in excess
The central thought of the book of Jonah is that God cared for and saved even the most evil Gentiles in His pity on men and cattle
God intended to judge Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, but He also intended to extend His salvation of love to that evil Gentile city
Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah up, and he was in the stomach of the fish for three days and three nights
In his proclamation the king declared, 'Let man and beast be covered in sackcloth, and let them call to God strongly
Jehovah's turning from doing evil to Nineveh displeased Jonah greatly, and Jonah prayed to Jehovah in his anger
Jonah could not tolerate the fact that, after charging him to preach that the city of Nineveh would be overthrown, God changed His mind
Jonah went out from the city, made a booth for himself, and sat under it in the shade to see what would happen to the city
When God asked Jonah if he did well in being angry about the tree, Jonah said that he did well to be angry unto death
Because the Jews responded to God wrongly, the Gentiles, not the Jews, became the first to enjoy God in His salvation
The book of Jonah indicates particularly that God is not the God of only a certain people; He is the God of all peoples
After Christ's resurrection and ascension and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, in Acts 13 God told Paul and Barnabas to go to the Gentiles
They were not like Jonah; rather, they took God's commission and went and preached the gospel throughout Asia Minor
Gods economy to manifest Christ implies the extending of His salvation in Christ to reach even the distant great evil cities of the Gentiles
The consuming locusts are still consuming, the suffering Israel is still suffering, and the Lord is still going on in His recovery
In this message we will begin to consider the prophecy of Micah, covering the introductory word and Jehovah's reproof on Israel
In the Old Testament, the term Israel is used for two matters: the whole race of Israel and the northern kingdom of Israel
And the mountains will be melted under Him, / And the valleys will be cleft, / Like wax before fire, / Like water poured down a slope'
The prophet says, 'All this is because of the transgression of Jacob / And because of the sins of the house of Israel
For her wounds are incurable, / For it has come as far as Judah; / It reaches as far as the gate of my people, / As far as Jerusalem'
In the remainder of chapter one , we have an account of the terrors in Judah and Israel and the evils from Jehovah
The sun's shining seven times brighter indicates that the produce of the earth will be seven times richer than it is today
After man fell, God came in to curse the earth and to tell man that he would eat of the earth by the sweat of his brow
In the restoration there will be no merchants , no money , no buying and selling, no police stations, and no law courts
Christ will be there as the source of the rich supply, as the inner law of life, and as everything for us to enjoy
And the mountains will be melted under Him, / And the valleys will be cleft, / Like wax before fire, / Like water poured down a slope'
The next two chapters, part of Jehovah's reproof, are a description of the sinfulness of the house of Jacob and the house of Judah
From the days of eternity' means that in eternity, before the creation of the earth, Christ was preparing to come forth
In eternity Christ was concealed in His divinity, but through incarnation He came forth with His divinity into humanity
On the one hand, Israel is under God's chastisement; on the other hand, Israel is also under God's shepherding care
As our Ruler He keeps us as our Shepherd He nourishes and cherishes us and as our peace He controls our environment so that we may enjoy Him
When Assyria comes into our land And when he treads in our palaces We will raise up against him seven shepherds And eight princes of men
The coming Christ will take the full responsibility to deal with all of human government, represented by Assyria and Nimrod
Having collected his evil world powers, Antichrist will besiege the city of Jerusalem, with the intention of putting it to an end
After Christ deals with all the enemies, the remnant of Jacob will be blessed by Jehovah, and they also will be victorious among the nations
When they turned from Christ to their own observations regarding the condition and situation of God's people, they became small
In his prophecy concerning Christ, Micah says, 'His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity'
He goes on to say that this One, who is Israel's Ruler and Shepherd, will be the peace when Assyria comes into the land
Babel issued in Babylon, the height of human government and the first stage of the locusts, that is, the cutting locusts
It may be that before too long the locusts will be destroyed and, as Hosea 6:2 prophesies, dormant Israel will be raised up on the third day
On the one hand, they both prophesied concerning Christ; on the other hand, they both spoke about such a small thing as deceitful balances
Amos said that the corrupt people made the ephah small and the shekel large and falsified the balances for deceit
Concerning this, Micah said, 'Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, / And a scant measure that is abominable?
The word of Amos and Micah about such a small matter cannot compare with the greatness of their word concerning Christ
If He had only selected and predestinated us without preparing to come out of eternity, He could do nothing with us
After observing the poor situation of the people of Israel, the prophet took the lead to look for Jehovah and wait for God
Micah could not praise God that the condition and situation of His people were wonderful, for they had nothing that He could appreciate
The prophet said, 'Who is a God like You, / Pardoning iniquity / And passing over the transgression / Of the remnant of His inheritance?
In verse 19 the prophet continues, 'He will again have compassion on us; / He will tread our iniquities underfoot
Finally Micah says You will perform truth to Jacob And lovingkindness to Abraham Which You have sworn to our fathers From the days of old
In a sense, Micah's word in chapters six and seven is good, but it cannot compare with his revelation concerning Christ in chapter five
Jonah reveals that God in His salvation is the God of all the peoples of the earth, not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles
In Hebrew Nahum means comfort and avenge signifying that Jehovah God comforts His elect Israel and avenges Israel of her enemy Nineveh
The cities of Babel and Nineveh were built by Nimrod and became the capitals of the nations of Babylon and Assyria
The central thought of Nahum is that Jehovah judged Assyria, avenging Israel of her enemy to restore her for her comfort
The book of Nahum has three sections: the introductory word ; Jehovah as the majestic Judge ; and Jehovah's judgment on Nineveh
In verse 7 the prophet declares, 'Jehovah is good, / A stronghold in a day of distress; / And He knows those who take refuge in Him'
He rebukes the sea and makes it dry He dries up all the rivers the mountains quake because of Him and the earth is heaved up at His presence
The prophet asks, 'Who can stand before His indignation, / And who can maintain himself in the fierceness of His anger?
The Medes and the Babylonians came together to attack Nineveh, and they found a way to open the gates of the river and they flooded the city
God used Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar to defeat the Assyrians, and this became a kind of deliverance to Israel
Verse 15a goes on to say, 'Behold, upon the mountains / The feet of him who bears the glad news, / Who announces peace'!
Verses 8 through 13 record the Babylonian armies' plunder of the wealth of the people of Nineveh and their slaughter of the people
God used the Babylonians with the Medes to invade Assyria and thereby to save Israel from the tyranny of the Assyrians
Although this book does not say anything about Christ directly and does not refer to Christ, the goal is still the manifestation of Christ
Regarding this, all the minor prophets are one, and the book of Nahum is just one small link on the chain of their revelation
Everything else in Habakkuk is a background for the release of the revelation concerning God's eternal salvation of sinners
The name Habakkuk in Hebrew means 'embracing' or 'clinging to,' signifying that we need to seek God by embracing Him or clinging to Him
The subject of Habakkuks ministry is the righteous judgment of God first on Israel by the Chaldeans and then on the Chaldeans by the nations
The revelation in Habakkuk concerning God's eternal salvation to sinners was brought out by a conversation between the prophet and God
In His answer to the prophet , Jehovah said that He was doing a work in the prophet's days which he would not believe if it were told to him
According to Habakkuk the people of Israel were more righteous than the Babylonians yet they were suffering the violence of the Babylonians
He then concluded his inquiry by asking, 'Will they then empty their net / And continually slay the nations without sparing'?
In His answer to the prophet, Jehovah told him to write the vision and render it plainly upon tablets, so that he who reads it might run
Jehovah went on to say that the vision was yet for an appointed time and that it hastened toward the end and would not lie
God's eternal salvation is not merely to save our body from suffering but to save our whole being-spirit, soul, and body-for eternity
If we get into the intrinsic contents of these three books we will see that there is a linking factor and that this linking factor is Christ
Jonah 117 says Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah up and Jonah was in the stomach of the fish for three days and three nights
Jonah is a type of Christ, who died, who was in the heart of the earth three days and three nights, and who then was resurrected
In the book of Jonah, Jehovah's salvation was brought to the most evil city of the Gentiles through the preaching of the prophet
Whereas we can see Christ as the linking factor, the worldly people see only the consuming factor and the suffering factor
For twenty-seven centuries Israel has been suffering under the locusts with their cutting, swarming, licking, and consuming
We may compare His going forth to the movement of a train that makes various stops so that more goods can be loaded onto it
In the Old Testament the incarnation had not yet been accomplished; however, God knew that He intended to become a man
Unfortunately, not many Christians realize that genuine, living Christians are those who are actually and practically in Christ
In the Old Testament it is difficult to find a case which proves that God's people are those who have been transferred into the Triune God
In each of the prophets' books, wherever they speak concerning Christ, that is the great point, the strong accent, of that book
In order to grow, an orange needs not only its peel but also the whole tree with the roots, the trunk, the branches, and the leaves
The Bible is the divine speaking, but this divine speaking is not something that has come directly by God Himself
After the prophet's inquiry of Jehovah , Jehovah answered Habakkuk , revealing His judgment upon the Chaldeans
Because the Chaldeans had plundered many nations, the Chaldeans would be plundered and made booty to the nations
Jehovah judged the Chaldeans because of their taking evil gain for their houses by violence, sinning against their own soul
As a result of this judgment the stone would cry out from the wall of their houses and the rafter would answer from the timber of the houses
The Chaldeans would receive the righteous recompense for building cities by bloodshed and establishing towns by iniquity
All these verses seem very good, but for the most part they express Habakkuk's natural concept, without much revelation of Christ
When Paul was short of food, he did not 'trust' in the Lord in the way Habakkuk did; rather, he took the opportunity to fast
In a very real sense, he did not need to trust in the Lord, for he was in the Lord already, and the Lord was in him
Whereas many Christians appreciate verses such as Habakkuk 3:17-19a, we need to be brought into another realm, the realm of Christ
These verses are not according to the divine revelation concerning Christ but according to the prophets natural human and religious concept
If we are brought into the realm of Christ, we will not appreciate the natural, religious thought expressed in much of the Old Testament
The last part of verse 19 says that the song of the prophet is for the choir director, with the prophet's stringed instrument
In 1:1 we are told that Zephaniah was 'the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah'
The subject of Zephaniah's prophecy is Jehovah's judgment on Israel and on the nations and His salvation to the Gentiles and to Israel
Jehovah's judgment on Israel and on the nations and His salvation to the Gentiles and to Israel have a particular order
His judgment is first on Israel and then on the nations, but His salvation is first to the Gentiles and then to Israel
In this book the revelation concerning Christ is in His being the King of Israel in the midst of her in the restoration
The prophet said that before the burning anger of Jehovah came upon them, they should gather themselves together to repent to Jehovah
In His salvation to the Gentiles, Jehovah, in the time of restoration, will 'change the language of the peoples / Into a pure language'
The subject of the prophecy of Haggai is Jehovah's dealing with the returned captives for the building of His house
Thus says Jehovah of hosts, saying, This people says, The time has not come, the time for the house of Jehovah to be built'
In verses 5, 6, and 9 through 11 we have Jehovah's dealing with the self-caring and God-neglecting returned captives
When they brought it home, He blew on it because of His house which lay waste, and they each ran to their own house
It has been difficult for us to get the increase, not mainly because of our environment but because of our excuses
All the saints should be occupied by the Lord Jesus in preaching the gospel, feeding the new believers, and taking care of others
Haggai 2:1-23 is the prophecy concerning the house of Jehovah in the millennium and the promise of Messiah in the coming kingdom
All people desire to have life, light, peace, goodness, and righteousness, yet they do not realize that what they desire is really Christ
Just as a glove without a hand has no content, so the human virtues without the divine attributes have no reality
God intended therefore that the man created in His image would exercise his will to choose God signified by the tree of life as his content
To choose God in this way means that we receive God's life with His attributes into us to be expressed through us by our virtues
In verses 10 through 19 the prophet spoke about the people's uncleanness and Jehovah's dealing with them and then blessing them
Jehovah's making Zerubbabel as a signet ring indicates that Jehovah regarded him as His representative and that He loved him and trusted him
Jehovah goes on to say that Edom would be called the territory of wickedness and the people with whom Jehovah is indignant forever
Verse 5 says, 'Your eyes will see it, and you yourselves will say, Jehovah is magnified over the territory of Israel'
Jehovah said, 'Cursed be the deceiver who has in his flock a male, and when he makes a vow, he offers what is blemished to the Lord'
In verse 11 He said that His name would be great among the nations, and in verse 14b He declared that His name was feared among the nations
Because of this, Jehovah no longer regarded the sacrifices or received them with pleasure from the priests' hands
They wearied Him by saying Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of Jehovah and He delights in them or Where is the God of justice
Jehovah's dealing with the sons of Levi is to refine and purify the priests by His coming as the Messenger of Jehovah
In His first coming, Christ came as a Messenger and even as the message sent by God to adjust, refine, and purify the priests
Christ will come suddenly as the Angel of the covenant, whom the people of Israel seek and whom the people of Israel desire
Christ's coming suddenly as the Angel of the covenant will be to execute upon Israel the covenant that He enacted through His death
When Christ comes back, He will come as the Angel of the covenant to execute His covenant over the repentant and believing Jews
In the millennium the repentant Jews who are regenerated through the new covenant will be the priests to take care of all the nations
As the Messenger of God, Christ not only brings a word or a message from God to God's people; He Himself is the living message
In His second coming, Christ will be the Angel of the covenant, the Desire of nations , and the Sun of righteousness
We are the same as God our Father in life and nature, but we surely are not God in His Godhead or the Father in His fatherhood
In His first coming, Christ healed the degraded priesthood, but in His second coming, He will heal the remnant of the people of Israel
Jehovah instructed the sons of Jacob to return to Him so that He would return to them that they might be blessed by Him
God's food, the divine food, is the offerings, especially the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering
They worshipped and served God, but they did it mournfully, not at all happy that they were required to do these things
Verse 16b tells us that a book of remembrance was written before Jehovah of those who feared Him and considered His name
We may not remember our fellowship concerning Christ and the church, but God keeps a record of this fellowship in His book of remembrance
They will be a personal treasure in the day that He prepares , and He will spare them, as a man spares his son who serves him
The day of Jehovah comes, burning like a furnace, and all the proud ones and all the ones who act wickedly will be stubble
Unto those who fear Jehovah's name the Sun of righteousness-the healing Christ-will arise with healing in His wings
They will trample the wicked; for the wicked will be ashes under the soles of their feet in the day that Jehovah prepares
Finally, in verses 5 and 6, God promised to send Elijah the prophet to them before the great and terrible day of Jehovah comes
Although we may not realize it, such an aspiration has been within us through all the years of our Christian life
We are living here for the spreading of the Lord Jesus, not merely to our neighborhood but to the entire world
Eventually, there will be the 'third day'-the thousand years of the millennial kingdom-when Israel will be raised up, that is, restored
After the two days of desolation, there is the third day, which signifies the pneumatic Christ in resurrection
Every day we need the outpouring of the all-inclusive, consummated, compound, life-giving Spirit as the processed and consummated Triune God
In the Minor Prophets there are both the divine Spirit the consummated Spirit of God and the human spirit the stirredup spirit of Gods elect
In the new covenant, God is imparted into us as life and as our life supply, and we have the forgiveness of sins
According to Acts 26:18b, we have received not only the forgiveness of sins but also 'an inheritance among those who have been sanctified'
The Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ, who is 'the allotted portion of the saints' as their inheritance
Just as the shining of the sunlight enables plants to grow, Christ's shining as the Sun of righteousness is for our growth in life
As the Sun of righteousness, Christ is our enjoyment also for healing in life, in the effacing of unrighteousness
Christ was resurrected on the third day, and as the pneumatic Christ in resurrection, He is the reality of the third day
The way to have the revival we need is to contact Christ, repenting and confessing our sins, failures, and darkness
We need to come to the third day, and the third day is nothing other than the person of the resurrected Christ with the reality of revival
Through this covenant God has been allotted to us as our legal portion in Christ, who is the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings
