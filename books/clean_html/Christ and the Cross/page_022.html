<h2 class="head1">THE KINGDOM BEING FOREORDAINED FOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>The kingdom, like the church, was foreordained by God for Christ. The church is mainly for the expression of Christ&rsquo;s life and glory, but the kingdom is mainly for the expression of Christ&rsquo;s dominion and glory. In eternity past God foreordained that the church would express Christ&rsquo;s life and glory. Similarly, God prepared the kingdom to express Christ&rsquo;s dominion and glory. Although the church is not mentioned in the Old Testament, God prophesied in many portions and in many ways concerning the kingdom that He has prepared for Christ.</p>
<p>Beginning with the patriarchs, God brought up the matter of the kingdom. When He called Abraham in Genesis 12, He promised to make Abraham a great nation (vv. 1-2). This promise was for the preparation of a kingdom for Christ. Hence, in the Gospel of Matthew, which is a record of Christ as the King, Christ&rsquo;s genealogy begins with Abraham (1:1-2). When the inhabitants on the earth rejected God&rsquo;s rule and dominion and followed the operation of Satan to establish different nations, God called Abraham out from their midst to form another nation that would receive His rule and submit to His dominion. Thus, God enabled Christ to obtain a kingdom on the earth as the sphere for the expression of His dominion.</p>
<p>In Genesis 26 God confirmed His promise to Abraham with Isaac, saying, &ldquo;To you and to your seed I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father&rdquo; (v. 3). When Isaac&rsquo;s son, Jacob, was on his deathbed blessing his sons, God prophesied through him that Shiloh, the Peace bringer, Christ, would come out of Judah to be Ruler of the kingdom, and all the peoples would submit to His authority (49:10).</p>
<p>In Exodus God through Moses led the children of Israel out of Egypt and brought them to the foot of Mount Sinai. There God told them, &ldquo;You shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&rdquo; (19:6). This indicates that God wanted the children of Israel to be His kingdom. In Numbers 24 God prophesied through Balaam, a Gentile prophet who had been hired to curse the children of Israel, that a Star would come forth out of Jacob and that a Scepter would rise out of Israel (v. 17). Both the Star and the Scepter signify the reigning Christ, the King of the kingdom, who would come forth out of Israel and have dominion to subdue the nations (v. 19).</p>
<p>During the reign of David, God obtained a kingdom that could express Christ&rsquo;s dominion on the earth. Hence, God promised David, &ldquo;When your days are fulfilled and you sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your seed after you, which will come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. It is he who will build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever&rdquo; (2 Sam. 7:12-13). This reveals God&rsquo;s intention for Christ, the seed of David, to continue the throne of David. God promised to establish the kingdom and the throne of David&rsquo;s seed, Christ, forever. For this reason, the Gospel of Matthew refers to Christ as the Son of David (1:1; 9:27; 12:23; 15:22; 21:9).</p>
<p>In other portions of the Old Testament, God prophesied concerning Christ as the King and concerning the kingdom of Christ. In the Psalms David prophesied that Christ would sit at God&rsquo;s right hand until God made Christ&rsquo;s enemies His footstool (110:1). In Psalm 2:6 God declares to the kings of the earth, &ldquo;I have installed My King [Christ] / Upon Zion, My holy mountain.&rdquo; David also prophesied that Christ would send forth the scepter of His strength from Zion to rule in the midst of His enemies and would shatter kings in the day of His anger (110:2, 5). In Psalm 89:27 Ethan the Ezrahite prophesied that God would make Christ &ldquo;the highest of the kings of the earth.&rdquo; Isaiah prophesied that the Mighty God and the Eternal Father would become a child and Son as the Prince of Peace and that the government would be upon His shoulder (Isa. 9:6). Furthermore, there would be no end to the increase of His government and to His peace upon the throne of David and over His kingdom, which He would establish and uphold in justice and righteousness for eternity (v. 7). Jeremiah prophesied that God would raise up to David a righteous Shoot, Christ, to reign as King, act prudently, and execute justice and righteousness in the land (Jer. 23:5). Daniel prophesied that Christ would receive dominion, glory, and a kingdom from God and that all peoples, nations, and languages would serve Him (Dan. 7:13-14). Daniel also prophesied that at the end of the age Christ would come forth from the heavens, as the stone cut out without hands, to crush the kingdoms of the earth and set up His kingdom (2:34-35, 44-45). His dominion will be an eternal dominion that will not pass away, and His kingdom will not be destroyed (7:14). Micah prophesied that Christ would be born in Bethlehem of Judah to be Ruler in Israel and that His goings forth are from ancient times (Micah 5:2).</p>
<p>The prophecies in the Old Testament concerning Christ as King and concerning the kingdom of Christ prove that God foreordained that Christ would have the kingdom, that the kingdom would express Christ&rsquo;s dominion and glory, and that Christ would be glorified through His reign in the kingdom.</p>
