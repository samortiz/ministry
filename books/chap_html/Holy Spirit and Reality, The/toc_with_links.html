With concrete examples, it demonstrates that behind everything spiritual there is the reality. This reality is in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit leads men into the knowledge of this reality. The appendix after the message deals with one type of Christian sickness: obsession. It points out the phenomenon and causes of obsession as well as the way to divine deliverance.</p></td></tr></table></div>
