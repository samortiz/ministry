<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE WASHING OF FEET</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 13:1-14</h1><p>The Gospel of John shows us clearly that water signifies life. John 4 tells us how, after we have received life, it will become a spring in us welling up into eternal life. Chapter seven, in addition, shows us how this water will be like rivers of living water flowing out of man's innermost being. In chapter thirteen water has another function. Water is not just a spring welling up from within us to satisfy us; it does not just add strength to us to flow into others as rivers of living waters; it can also give us refreshment, new feeling, and new help. According to man's mind there seems to be no need for chapter thirteen. Chapters four and seven seem to be sufficient. There are springs within and rivers without. What else do we need? It seems that there is no other need. But let us stop and think for a moment. We have been born again, but do we sometimes still feel as if we were not born again? In theory we know that the water the Lord gives us will become in us a spring welling up into eternal life, but have we not felt that this spring of living water is not welling up constantly? Are we saying with our mouth that we are satisfied and have no more need, yet at times feeling dissatisfied within? Have we not felt some lack, some need, and some dissatisfaction within, and nothing seemed to be welling up or flowing into others? Brothers and sisters, because our spiritual condition inevitably becomes dry and depressed at times, there is need for the water of chapter thirteen.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF THE FOOT-WASHING</h2><p>John 13:1 says, "Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the uttermost." Verse 5 then says that the Lord washed the disciples' feet with water. It is clear that the motivation of the Lord Jesus' washing the disciples' feet was not because of their sin but because He loved His own, and this love was not an initial love but a consummate love. "Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the uttermost." Eventually, with the addition of washing, this love was made perfect. Therefore, foot-washing is necessary. If we want to have a proper walk before the Lord, we must know how to receive foot-washing from others and how to wash others' feet. Foot-washing is the expression of the Lord's consummate love and the work of the Lord's lasting love; it is related to the consummation of our Christian life. In other words, we must have the experience of receiving foot-washing from others as well as the experience of washing others' feet.</p><p>The Lord said to Peter, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me." Does this mean that if the Lord had not washed Peter's feet that day, He would have had nothing to do with Peter at all? No. Peter had taken his bath already; the Lord already had something to do with Peter. For eternity the Lord will have something to do with Peter. But if the Lord had not washed Peter's feet, Peter would have had no part with Him in His fellowship and would have been detached from Him. We should remember that the foot-washing in John 13 has nothing to do with sin but with life and power; it is a question of freshness of life. In Asia Minor, people rarely wore socks; they wore sandals. Whenever they walked, they would inevitably collect some dust on their feet. After they finished their work and went home to rest, they would go and wash their feet. Their feet became dirty not because of sin but because they had touched the ground; it was inevitable that their feet would be defiled by the dust. The Lord Jesus did not rebuke the disciples for having defiled their feet. On the contrary, He washed their feet because He loved them to the uttermost. The defiling of their feet was not a question of sin. If it had been a question of sin, the Lord Jesus would not have dealt with them this way. He cannot deal with sin so loosely. Those who know God know that Christians should not sin. Yet they also admit that it is impossible for Christians not to defile their feet while walking on this earth. Until we can walk on the golden street in the New Jerusalem, our feet will always be defiled by the dust no matter how carefully we walk or how hard we try to remain undefiled. When our feet are defiled, our spiritual condition becomes dim and not so fresh. Therefore, our feet need to be washed in order for our spiritual condition to be restored. The Lord's washing of the disciples' feet was just to deal with their dimness and lack of freshness; it was not to deal with the problem of sin. In order to deal with sin, it takes the washing by the blood. We must have the blood before we can have the boldness to go before God. But the blood alone is not enough. Although we are under the cleansing of the blood, we do not necessarily have the spiritual freshness; we still need the cleansing of the water. After we are washed with water, we feel refreshed and pleasant, and spontaneously our being is restored. The washing of the blood enables us to stand before God, but the washing of the water refreshes us and makes us feel pleasant and energized.</p><p>Satan's power is based on sin and death. Hebrews 2 shows us that Satan's power is with death. Satan attacks God's children by causing them either to sin or feel deadened. Therefore, we must not only be kept clean but must also be full of life. This does not mean that the life we received at regeneration will die and that we need another one. It means that the life in us may become deadened, as if it were not there. One of our common but serious mistakes is to think that keeping ourselves from sin on the negative side is sufficient. Little do we realize that we fall far short if we have not manifested life on the positive side. Satan's work is either to make us sin or to make us gloomy. He will make us feel as if nothing is meaningful, as if we are cold, far from God, and have a separating veil between us and God. Sometimes we may feel that we have not committed any specific sin, yet inwardly we feel cold, stale, and debilitated. This is death. Many Christians lack spiritual vitality. They do not have any particular weakness or sin, but they always feel apathetic, cold, and debilitated. We need to remember that no gloomy Christian can fight against Satan. Not only will sin disable us from the battle, but gloom will also disable us. Therefore, we need to keep ourselves not only from sin but also from gloom. We can mention some concrete examples of this gloom. How many times do we come to the meetings with life, and how many times are we void of spiritual vitality? In other words, how many times do we come in an active way, and how many times do we come in a passive way? Anything that is not active is death. In the meetings, the listeners as well as the speakers need life. Many people come to the meetings in a gloomy, tired, and weary mood; they have no spiritual vitality at all. If too many people are this way in the meetings, the burden of the meeting will become heavy, and no one will be able to bear it. Hence, whenever there is a meeting, everyone who comes to the meeting should supply the church with life, not just the speaking ones. We cannot be passive for one day. Whenever we are passive in the meeting, we burden the church. Satan's special tool in the church is death. His purpose is just to consume our life and to infect us with death. But the Lord will preserve us and keep us from death.</p><p>Once our spiritual condition becomes sullen, we need to be washed with water. Therefore, the Lord Jesus not only wants us bathed, but He also wants our feet washed again and again. The one-time "bath" enables us to have life. The foot-washing recovers the freshness of life. Once a man is bathed, he has life. Hallelujah! We have all been bathed. If we have not been bathed, we are not Christians yet. One day, the Lord washed me not only with the blood but also with water. I received God's life, I touched God, and I touched the Lord. At that time, a spiritual world opened to me, and I touched spiritual reality. I felt that the Lord's death was not something that happened two thousand years ago; it was something for today. I felt that the Lord's death did not take place only at Golgotha but right where I was. The limitations of time and space were broken, and spiritual reality was present. This is what it means to be bathed. But how many Christians have a continual sense of the freshness of this bathing? Many people say that they will be content as long as they can keep their first love. Many people aspire to return to the condition of their initial salvation. This means that they are not as fresh as when they were first bathed. This is the reason there is the need of foot-washing. Foot-washing brings us back to the condition of being bathed. Foot-washing brings us the freshness of life; it brings us new feelings, new strength, and spiritual revival. These are the things foot-washing brings us. Foot-washing not only cleanses a person but also refreshes him. After a man has his feet washed, he is refreshed and revived. Foot-washing recovers our spiritual freshness and causes us to be full of life. Brothers and sisters, foot-washing is a crucial thing. It is crucial to be recovered in life and in spiritual vitality.</p>
