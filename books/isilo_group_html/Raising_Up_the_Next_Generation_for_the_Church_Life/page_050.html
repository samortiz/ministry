<h1 class="msg">LESSON TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE IMPORTANCE OF<br />
THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK IN THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Deut. 6:7-9; Prov. 22:6; 2 Tim. 3:15; Acts 16:31; 1:14; Rom. 12:12</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>In the past we did not focus on the children&rsquo;s work; however, if children&rsquo;s education is not developed, it will be difficult to have a healthy society&mdash;Deut. 6:7-9; 11:18-20; Prov. 22:6; Eph. 6:4; 2 Tim. 3:15.</li>
<li>At the beginning, children&rsquo;s meeting was mainly to care for the saints who brought their children to the meeting; it was simply a child-care service; gradually, the matter of preparing teachers came in, and we compiled material:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>From our experience we feel that the children&rsquo;s work is very important; the children&rsquo;s work should not simply be babysitting in order for the saints to come to the meetings.</li>
	<li>However, the children&rsquo;s work has another function, that is, to cultivate and nurture our next generation; this is worthy of our careful consideration and examination.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The children&rsquo;s work has an additional function, which is to gain the families of the children&mdash;Acts 16:31; cf. Exo. 12:3-4; Gen. 7:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Children like to make friends; it is particularly easy for children between the ages of six and twelve to make friends, and they listen to their friends:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It is therefore easy for a child to lead another child; when the children sing hymns together, the gospel is operating and spreads from one child to another child.</li>
		<li>Our purpose, however, is not focused only on the children, but even more, through the children, we want to reach their parents and siblings.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>From this we can see the importance of the children&rsquo;s work; the children&rsquo;s work is greatly related to the growth of the church.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>There is not a definite way to take care of the children&rsquo;s work; there should not be only one aspect to the children&rsquo;s work:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>There should be many locations for the children&rsquo;s work, meetings can be held at different times, and we can use different methods to conduct the children&rsquo;s meetings; there should also be many goals, and the teaching material should also cover many aspects:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Having many locations&mdash;their meetings must have many locations; every saint should open his home and have a children&rsquo;s meeting in his home.</li>
		<li>Having material&mdash;we have considered using videotaped material, which some localities use; we want to produce a video that shows children from various countries wearing their traditional dress and singing the hymns.</li>
		<li>Having many purposes&mdash;we can also contact the children&rsquo;s parents and preach the gospel to them and to their relatives; this is the principle of our gospel work; the more people we contact, the better.</li>
		<li>Having many ways&mdash;the households with children can take the initiative to open their homes and ask their children to invite other children in the neighborhood; the children can watch the children&rsquo;s videotapes, sing children&rsquo;s songs, or listen to a story; this is the way to have a children&rsquo;s meeting once a week.</li>
		<li>Having different times&mdash;it is best to have different meeting times for the children&rsquo;s meetings; the schedule should be flexible; we need to utilize the time when the children are out of school to have children&rsquo;s meetings.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The way to carry out the children&rsquo;s work depends on the brothers taking the lead in the children&rsquo;s work:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We should not make any special arrangements to get teachers for the children&rsquo;s meetings in the meeting halls; rather, we should find a number of younger brothers and sisters who meet regularly to be the teachers; this kind of service does not require much manpower.</li>
		<li>We need to prepare material for the children&rsquo;s meeting; we should not have children&rsquo;s meetings without preparation:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The brothers taking the lead in the children&rsquo;s work need to write and compile material; but the saints can decide the best way to use it.</li>
			<li>If some saints are designated to prepare teaching material, the saints will not need to labor that much; we can give only some principles related to the children&rsquo;s work; it is up to the saints to carry them out.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The children&rsquo;s meetings should be in many locations, at different times, and use different methods; we hope that all the saints will pray concerning this matter and not take it lightly; this requires everyone&rsquo;s cooperation&mdash;Acts 1:14; Col. 4:2; Rom. 12:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
