   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Following the above six main items of the Lord's recovery, I would like to add two more items, that is, the recovery of the church ground and the recovery of the practice of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. The Definition of the Church Ground 1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not the Foundation but the Site</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word ground that we use in reference to the church ground does not carry the denotation of a foundation, like the foundation of a building; it bears the denotation of a site, like the site on which the foundation of a building is laid.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Three Crucial Elements</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>of the Church Ground</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the divine revelation of the New Testament, the church ground is constituted of three crucial elements, as follows:</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>a. The Unique Oneness of the Universal Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first element of the constitution of the church ground is the unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ, which is called "the oneness of the Spirit" Eph 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the oneness that the Lord prayed for in John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is a oneness of the mingling of the processed Triune God with all the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This oneness is in the name of the Father John 17:6, 11 , denoting the Father's person, in which is the Father's life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This oneness is even in the Triune God through sanctification by His holy word as the truth John 17:14-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This oneness is ultimately in the divine glory for the expression of the Triune God John 17:22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a oneness was imparted into the spirit of all the believers in Christ, in their regeneration by the Spirit of life with Christ as the divine life; this oneness has become the basic element of the church ground.</S>
