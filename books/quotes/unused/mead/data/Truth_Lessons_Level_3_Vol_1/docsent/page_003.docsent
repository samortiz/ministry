   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A picture or portrait is better than a thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In particular, since the revelation in the holy Word concerning the mystery of Christ and the church is spiritual and abstract in nature, it cannot be thoroughly made clear by words; it needs to be portrayed and indicated by figures.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among the types in the divine revelation, the first are the light and the tree of life, which typify Christ as light and life; the significance revealed in these types must be high and great.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is the true light of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings Mal 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is also the bright morning star Rev 22:16b , appearing privately to His lovers before the darkest hour, prior to dawn.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, He is the great light that dispels the death and shadow in man Matt 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. Christ as the Source of All Lights</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Psalm 36:9b says, In Your light we see light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can see light only in the light of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Christ comes to us, He brings light to us that we may know ourselves thoroughly, see our true condition, and realize the corruption of our flesh.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the light of the world, Christ enables us not to remain in darkness but to walk in the day that we may not stumble John 11:9 or lose our direction, not knowing where we are going John 12:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We were once darkness Eph 5:8a , but now we have become sons of light by believing into Christ as the light John 12:36b .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We even are the light Matt 5:14 ; that is, we are luminaries holding forth the word of life Phil 2:15-16 , shining forth Christ to enlighten this dark world.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the life we received then was a life in its initial stage, which is neither solid nor shaped.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the fourth day God commanded the sun, the moon, and the stars to shine forth with a light that is more definite and concrete than the light of the first day.</S>
