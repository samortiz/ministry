<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In the entire Bible God made eight covenants with man: seven in the Old Testament and one in the New Testament. In this lesson we will begin with the first covenant that God made with man (Gen. 2:8-9, 15-17), that is, the covenant that God made with the created man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE ONE WHO MADE THE COVENANT&mdash;JEHOVAH GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah</h2>
<p>The One who made this covenant was Jehovah God. The name Jehovah stresses God&rsquo;s relationship with man. Therefore, speaking concerning God&rsquo;s relationship with man, in Genesis 2 the Bible begins to use the name Jehovah. This name means &ldquo;He who was, who is, and who will be,&rdquo; or &ldquo;He who existed, who exists, and who will exist.&rdquo; This means that He always is and never changes, He always exists and never passes away, and He is self-existing and ever-existing (Exo. 3:14-15; Rev. 1:8). He is the &ldquo;I Am,&rdquo; the One who always is; He is always everything to man. Whatever man needs, He is. He is well able to meet all of man&rsquo;s needs. Such a One who always is, who is without beginning and without end, and who always exists and never passes away, came to make a covenant with the created man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. God</h2>
<p>The One who made this covenant was God. The Hebrew word for God is Elohim, which means the mighty One who is faithful. This shows that God is a mighty One, even a mighty One who is faithful to keep His word. His faithfulness is the guarantee of the covenant that He made with man; His might enables Him to fulfill His covenant with man. It is such a mighty and faithful One who came to make a covenant with man. Furthermore, the word God here in Genesis 2 is plural, indicating that although He is the only God, He has the aspect of three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). Such a Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, came to make a covenant with the man whom He created, that He might dispense Himself into the created man to be his life and life supply for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE ONE WITH WHOM THE COVENANT WAS MADE&mdash;<br />
THE CREATED MAN</h2>
<p>The one with whom the covenant was made, the created man, was created by God in His image and after His likeness to express God and represent God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being without God&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>When man was created, although he had the image and likeness of God (Gen. 1:26), he did not have God&rsquo;s life in him. God did not put His uncreated life into man; therefore, what man had was but the created life. Hence, the created man still needed to receive the uncreated divine life from God that God&rsquo;s eternal purpose might be accomplished in man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being without Sin</h2>
<p>Although man did not have God&rsquo;s life, neither did he have sin&mdash;he was upright (Eccl. 7:29). When man first came out of God&rsquo;s creating hand, he was not crooked, evil, or defiled, but upright, good, and clean. At that time he was without sin, without corruption, and without defect; hence, God considered man very good (Gen. 1:31).</p>
