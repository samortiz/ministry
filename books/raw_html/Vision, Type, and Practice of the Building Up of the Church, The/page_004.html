        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">BUILDING AND BLESSING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:11-13, 15-16; 1 Cor. 12:13-14, 22-25; Rom. 12:1-8</h1>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-13 says, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; According to the original language, the phrase <em>a full-grown man</em> refers to a perfect, complete, and mature man. This full-grown man is the Body of Christ in the preceding verse. Hence, the growth implied in the word <em>full-grown</em> is the building up in verse 12.</p>
<p>Verses 15 and 16 say, &ldquo;Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; The word <em>itself</em> refers to the Body, the church. The church must endeavor to build itself up in love.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:13-14 says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit. For the body is not one member but many.&rdquo; Ephesians 4:16 says that the Body builds itself up in love, whereas 1 Corinthians 12:13 says that we become the Body by being baptized in one Spirit.</p>
<p>Verses 22 through 25 say, &ldquo;The members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. And those members of the body which we consider to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely members come to have more abundant comeliness, but our comely members have no need. But God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked, that there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same care for one another.&rdquo; These verses say that God has blended, coordinated, the Body together.</p>
<p>Romans 12:1-8 says, &ldquo;I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service. And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect. For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think so as to be sober-minded, as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith. For just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another. And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or service, let us be faithful in that service; or he who teaches, in that teaching; or he who exhorts, in that exhortation; he who gives, in simplicity; he who leads, in diligence; he who shows mercy, in cheerfulness.&rdquo; Our consecration and functioning in the church are for the building up of the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S CHILDREN LACKING<br />
THE CONCEPT OF BUILDING</h2>
<p>These portions of Scripture show that the goal of God&rsquo;s work in this age is the building. God gives the church various gifts, such as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers for this building up (Eph. 4:11-12). He pours out the Holy Spirit upon the saints also for this building up. Even His giving some saints the small service of having the heart and the ability to give to the needy in the church is for the building up of the Body (Rom. 12:8; 1 Cor. 12:28). In other words, not only the work done by the gifts&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers&mdash;is for God&rsquo;s building, but even the activities in our ordinary spiritual life, including exhorting, giving, showing mercy, and helping, are for the building up of the Body.</p>
<p>For a long time I have had the feeling before the Lord that although God&rsquo;s children are touching many spiritual things, they do not have any consciousness related to building. For example, many people zealously preach the gospel, but they do not have a consciousness of the need for building up the Body of Christ. They simply feel that they must preach salvation in order to save sinners, who are destined to be in the lake of fire. These believers do not sense that God wants them to preach the gospel in order to prepare materials for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>In the book of Haggai God commanded the people of Israel to &ldquo;go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house&rdquo; (1:8). Hence, when the Israelites cut down trees, they were clear within that what they were doing was for the building of the holy temple. Likewise, Ephesians 4 shows that the various God-given gifts are for the building up of the Body of Christ. The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers all work to build up the Body of Christ. Hence, if someone were to ask why we are preaching the gospel, we should reply, &ldquo;We are finding materials for God. Through preaching the gospel, we are gathering stones and cedars as material for God&rsquo;s building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All God&rsquo;s children should have such a vision. We should not consider this to be a small matter. We are not merely disputing over certain terms and expressions. Saving sinners is not the same as gathering materials; it is not merely a matter of saving people. A person&rsquo;s work is controlled by his concepts. If we have the realization that obtaining materials for God&rsquo;s building is the goal of preaching the gospel, we will not be satisfied merely with seeing a person get saved. We will understand that it is not sufficient for him to merely be saved; he must become material for God&rsquo;s building. We will know that God saves persons for the purpose of building them into the church. Being built into the church is the primary matter, and all other matters are secondary. Hence, our purpose in preaching the gospel should not be merely for people to be blessed but for materials to be collected for God&rsquo;s building. As long as we have this concept, we will focus on making those whom we lead to salvation into building material for the church. The concept of building is a great matter.</p>
<p>People do not have the concept of building up the Body of Christ when they preach the gospel or do the work of edification; they aim only at making believers proper. This is a shortcoming. The saints who serve are willing to help others, but do they have the concept that they are doing a building work? I am afraid that most of us do not have such a realization. Perhaps some feel that a brother needs to be visited because he has not been meeting for a few weeks, and his condition is poor. Such a concept is merely to make the brother a &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; Christian by bringing him back to the meetings. However, we should have the concept that this brother has not yet been built up. He is a stone that is still lying by the wayside and has not been built up into God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Hence, we should spend the time and the effort to bring him back so that he may be built together with all the saints in the church. We need to have the understanding that edification and visitation are related to building.</p>
<p>We should have such an understanding of building not only when we preach the gospel and visit the saints but also when we give messages for the edification of the saints. Our purpose in giving a message concerning the cross is not merely because the saints do not know the flesh. Our purpose is not for the saints to be edified and willing to receive the dealing of the cross. Rather, we should give such a message with the thought of building up, hoping that the fleshly saints would know the cross and receive the breaking of the cross so that they may be built into the church.</p>
<p>If we are enlightened by God to see the vision of the church, we will also have the goal of building when we offer something for the needy saints. The reason we help a brother, love him, and make up his lack with a material offering is not merely that he would be a good believer but that he would be built up in the church and be a functioning member in the Body of Christ. In this way our service will help the saints to see that although believers are members of the Body of Christ, there is a difference between being a believer and being a member. A believer can do a number of things on his own, but a member cannot do anything individualistically. Every member must be built up into the Body and coordinated together with others.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-12 is of great significance in the Scriptures. &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints...unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; When I saw the light in this portion, I wrote the following sentence in my Bible: &ldquo;May the Lord have mercy on me that henceforth all my work would be for the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; May the Lord cause all of us to see this light. God desires that our gospel preaching and messages would be for the building up of the Body of Christ. It is also for the building up of the Body of Christ that He pours out the Holy Spirit and gives various ministries and gifts. We need to have God&rsquo;s concept. Everything is for His building, that is, for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
