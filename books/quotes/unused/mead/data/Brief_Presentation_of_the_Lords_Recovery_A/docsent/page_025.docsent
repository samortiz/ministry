   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The fellowship of the Body of Christ is very similar to the circulation of the blood in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have been enlightened to see that Christ has a Body and that we are members of His Body, that is, members of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Just as our physical body has many members, Christ's Body also has many members.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And just as a man has only one body this is a principle ordained in God's creation Christ also has only one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do not understand the church as the Body of Christ, we should simply look at our own body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can understand Christ's Body by knowing our own body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have learned a great deal concerning the Body of Christ by learning to know my own body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we learn to know our body, we will know the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The circulation of the blood is the fellowship of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fellowship of Christ's Body also is a kind of circulation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In our physical body we have the circulation of the blood, but Christ's mystical Body does not have blood.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fellowship in Christ's Body, then, is the circulation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit today is the "blood" in Christ's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If there were no blood in our body, our body would be dried up and would be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, if Christ's Body did not have the Spirit, it would be like a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, the fellowship of the Body of Christ is simply the circulation, the current, of the Spirit not the Holy Spirit or the Spirit of God, but the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the New Testament the Spirit denotes the consummated Spirit, the Spirit who has been consummated, compounded, and mingled, and who is now dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this Spirit there is divinity, that is, God's divine nature, and there is humanity, that is, man's human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is also Christ's person, Christ's wonderful, all-inclusive death, and Christ's empowering resurrection with His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All these elements have been compounded into this one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When this one Spirit is circulating within the Body of Christ, divinity, humanity, Christ's person, Christ's death, and Christ's resurrection all are circulating.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The circulation of the blood is very important to our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This circulation carries nourishment to every part of our body, and it also causes our body to be cherished.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At times we may need to do some physical exercises to improve the circulation in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This may cause us to be more healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans 10:12 says that whenever we call on the name of the Lord, the Lord becomes rich to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have discovered that the more we call on the Lord with a loud voice, the more our spirit is released and the more we are healed and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Such calling on the Lord will make us very healthy, because to call in this way is to exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are always quiet and shut up within ourselves, we will be very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if we call, "O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!" for ten minutes, the Lord will become rich to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We will have joy, and eventually we will have strength.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The joy of the Lord will be our strength Neh 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have learned the secret of calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord is rich to all who call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To call is not merely to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Greek word for call means to cry out, even loudly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In certain situations it would not be appropriate for us to call on the Lord loudly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, when we are in a proper situation to do so, we should call loudly, "O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Amen!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By calling on the Lord in this way, we will enjoy the riches of Christ, and we will be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is because our calling on the name of the Lord causes the Spirit to circulate within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This circulating Spirit is the compound Spirit, who includes divinity, humanity, Christ's person, Christ's death, and Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The riches in this compound Spirit are unsearchable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When this Spirit circulates within us, we enjoy all Christ's riches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This circulation is the fellowship of the Body of Christ.</S>
