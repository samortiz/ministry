   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE A CRUCIAL WORD AND TESTIMONIES Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:8-9; 4:1; Acts 20:24; 2 Tim 4:5; Col 4:17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for another meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We thank You for Your everlasting mercy, in which we live and in which You have come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lord, we thank You for Yourself, we thank You for being a Spirit, we thank You for Your living word, and we thank You for this present message.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We trust in the cleansing by Your precious blood that You shed for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, we thank You for Your anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You are the compound, all-inclusive, consummated Spirit who dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, we thank You for Your presence, and even now we enjoy Your presence and we sense Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, we worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We worship the Lord Jesus as the embodiment of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We thank You for Your speaking, for Your oracle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thank You that there is an oracle of Yourself today on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, we thank You for Your speaking that is fresh to all of us every day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We believe You will speak to us again in a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, let us be met by You, touched by You, nourished by You, strengthened by You, and supplied by You.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thank You for Your bountiful supply that meets all of our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Be with us and be one spirit with us in this speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thank You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A CRUCIAL WORD Concerning the Oracle of God</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This chapter is not a continuation of the foregoing chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have a burden in this chapter to meet the need of the present situation in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to see something concerning the oracle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some among us have said that it is wrong to listen to one man s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, our words are empty and are not worth listening to.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, in this universe we have One who is real, who is true, who is faithful and holy, who is our life and our light, and who is our love and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This One is our speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible tells us that God has spoken Heb 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He has been speaking from the Old Testament time and today in the New Testament time through all the dispensations and through all the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our God is a living God and a speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have a living God who is speaking every day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some of us can testify that we enjoy the real, practical, and genuine speaking of God to us morning by morning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All of us should be able to testify that we enjoy the practical speaking of God to us every week.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How does God speak to us?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have a spirit, and God as the Spirit speaks to us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our spirit is the organ through which God speaks to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God also speaks to us through some channel, and that channel is His word in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes when we read the Bible, we hear and receive God s speaking, but many times we do not.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word of God is printed in black and white and is available for everyone to read.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, not everyone at every time hears God s speaking through the channel of His word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have a sincere, seeking spirit and if we open to the Lord from the depths of our being as we read the Bible, it will be easy for us to hear God s speaking and receive God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God s word will reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may have heard God s speaking and received God s word, but can we speak something from the Bible in the way of new light?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To illustrate what I mean, let us look at 2 Corinthians 3:8-9: How shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit be in glory?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may read the phrase the ministry of the Spirit and the phrase the ministry of condemnation many times without receiving new light in God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Who can tell us what the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of condemnation are?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some of us may be able to answer this question based upon the help that we have received from the Life-study of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I told the saints in the 1988 Summer Training on Leviticus that a person could read Leviticus again and again without ever understanding all the significances of the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The messages in that training, however, helped us to understand the real significance of each offering.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many of us can testify that the Life-study Messages uncover us, take our veil away, and open up our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Life-studies help us to go further and see even more.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Bible is a rich, deep, and profound gold mine.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is much gold hidden deep in this mine, and the Life-study Messages open up this mine.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They open up the unsearchable Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we receive such an opener, we have to dig and dig to get the gold in the rich mine of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even though I have published Life-study Messages on the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, I am still digging in the rich mine of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is an inexhaustible supply of gold there.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In 2 Corinthians 4:1, Paul said that the apostles have this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A careful reader of the Bible can tell us that this ministry referred to in 4:1 is the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of righteousness in 3:8-9.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we do not have the light, all we can say is that this ministry is the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is not the oracle of God because this is only according to our learning from the letter of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Any good scholar of the Word can read these verses and understand them by his mind in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To merely see the facts in the Bible according to the black and white is not God s oracle.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God s speaking in His oracle is always with new light, new revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This ministry, which is the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of righteousness, is the New Testament ministry, the unique ministry of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This word is the oracle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is not something acquired merely by reading according to the understanding of the mind, but it is by God s enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The light regarding this ministry is that it is the New Testament ministry that enlivens people, giving people life and dispensing the very Triune God into man s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Second Corinthians 3:9 mentions the ministry of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The ministry of condemnation is the Old Testament ministry that always condemns people and kills people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This understanding is something from the oracle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>With God s oracle, there is always the enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we listen to the oracle of God, this does not mean that we are listening to a man.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We are listening to God in His oracle.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I have been ministering in the United States for approximately twenty-six years, and much of my speaking has been printed in books.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I would ask the saints who have been in the Lord s recovery for many years who they have been listening to.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you have been listening to a man for many years, you are the most foolish person.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Only a fool would listen to a man again and again for such a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If any of the saints in the Lord s recovery would say that he has been listening to a man, this saint is the most foolish person on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>To listen to a man is foolish, but to listen to God in His oracle is wise.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We come to the ministry meetings in order to listen to God in His oracle.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To listen to God in His oracle is to be blessed with the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I heard of someone who repented to God that for the past approximately twenty years he had been listening to a man.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If he did listen to a man, he has to confess this as a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we listen to a fallen man as a fallen descendant of Adam, this is surely a sin we have to confess and repent for.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>However, I think that many of us can testify that we have not been listening to a man but to God in His oracle.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We need to consider the main, new revelations that we have seen in the past twenty-five years through God s oracle.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We have seen that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, that the Lord is the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Before the Lord s recovery came to the United States, we had never seen this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Terms such as enjoying Christ, experiencing Christ, and exhibiting Christ were not used by us before the Lord s recovery came to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Based upon the biblical revelation, I invented these terms.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I even wrote a hymn on exhibiting Christ Let us exhibit Christ #864 in Hymns .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Another new revelation that we have seen in the past twenty-five years is the sevenfold Spirit of God Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We have also seen that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Lord has opened up to us the matter of pray-reading the Word Eph 6:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I invented the word pray-reading to convey the revelation of this fact in the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Furthermore, we never saw the real significance and the vital importance of calling on the Lord Rom 10:12; 2 Tim 2:22 until the Lord s recovery came to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Another main, new revelation that we have seen in the past twenty-five years is that the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ is the consummation of the processed Triune God Rom 8:9; Phil 1:19b; Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This revelation came from the very God in His oracle.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Does this mean that when you hear this speaking, you are listening to a man?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This means that you are listening to our dear, beloved God in His oracle.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If you have been listening to God in my speaking, you have been blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>My speaking of these main, new revelations in the past twenty-five years has been the oracle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Another revelation that we have seen is the dispensing of the processed Triune God into the transformed, tripartite man Rom 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I am so happy that this point has been passed on to all the saints in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We have also seen the mingling of the processed God with the regenerated and transformed man John 6:57b; 15:5; 1 John 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Since the Lord s recovery came to the United States, we have seen the economy dispensation of God 1 Tim 1:4; Eph 1:10; 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>God in His oracle has also shown us the New Jerusalem as a corporate person composed of all the chosen and redeemed saints of God to be God s tabernacle, His dwelling, and the Lamb s wife, His counterpart Rev 21:2-3, 9b-10, 12, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Thank the Lord for the main, new revelations that we have seen in the past twenty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We received these revelations from God in His oracle through the speaking of His present ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Each one of the main, new revelations that we have seen in the past twenty-five years is the Word of God in the new light.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If someone does have the oracle of God, he must have the light.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Furthermore, whoever speaks for God in His oracle has a certain amount of divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>There is the deputy authority of God in His oracle.</S>
