<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is a translation of messages given in Chinese by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, Taiwan. These messages were not reviewed by the speaker.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY&mdash;EATING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 2:4, 7, 14-15, 17, 20, 24; 3:20; 22:14</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. A PROFOUND CONCEPT IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The Bible contains a very profound thought that cannot be fathomed or perceived without revelation: God wants to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life that He and man might have the same life, the same nature, and the living of the same kind of being&mdash;a God-man. This is neither a religious notion nor a moral concept.</p>
<p>God created man to be a vessel for Himself. Man is God&rsquo;s vessel to contain God. Regardless of how noble and excellent you may be, you are nevertheless just a vessel for God. Only God should be your content. If you do not have God&rsquo;s life and nature and if you are not filled with God, you are an empty vessel, and your human life, your living, your feeling, and your activities are all vain. They come to nothing. This is what God has planned and ordained for man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE WAY TO ACHIEVE GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE</h2>
<p>How can God achieve His purpose? Consider the physical symbols. In order for something, such as chicken, to come into us to be our element and to be one with us, we have to eat it, digest it, and assimilate it. This is the way it becomes our blood, our cells, and our essence.</p>
<p>With a view to this, the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life....He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (John 6:48, 57b). Only by eating the Lord can we receive God into us as our content. Not only do we need to understand, apprehend, know, love, believe, follow, and worship the Lord; even more we need to eat Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. CHRISTIANITY&rsquo;S LOSS AND TODAY&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Christianity tells people to believe in Jesus, love the Lord, follow Christ, and serve Christ; but it has lost the goal. We do these things for the purpose of receiving the Lord into us as our life. They are the procedures to reach the goal&mdash;eating Christ.</p>
<p>Today the Lord wants to recover the goal. To believe in the Lord is not just for our sins to be forgiven or for us to go to heaven; rather, it is for us to receive the Lord into us that He may be mingled with us as one essence. This is the goal. The apostle Paul said, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). He was even able to say, &ldquo;For to me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21), because Christ in him was his life and his essence and Christ had become one with him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE LINE OF EATING IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire for man is that man may eat Him. After God created man, He did not tell him to do anything. Instead, He placed Himself before man in the form of food to be received by man. God is edible for man to take Him in. He wants to enter into us, not only to be our life, but also to be our continuing life supply.</p>
<p>The line of eating is consistent throughout the whole Bible. From the first two chapters of Genesis to the last chapter of Revelation, the matter of eating is repeatedly referred to. When the children of Israel were leaving Egypt, they had to eat the lamb. In the wilderness they ate the manna. After they entered into Canaan, they ate the rich produce of the land. When they offered sacrifices in their worship to God, they ate the various offerings. When the Lord Jesus came, He said that He is the bread of life and that we have to eat Him and enjoy Him. Even in the Lord&rsquo;s table meetings when we remember the Lord, our emphasis should not be on meditation and worship but on eating. Concerning the bread, He told the disciples, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body&rdquo; (Matt. 26:26b). Moreover, He said, &ldquo;Do this in remembrance of Me&rdquo; (Luke 22:19b). Therefore, the true remembrance of the Lord is eating, which is for us to exercise our spirit to receive the Lord into us again and again. The more we eat and drink the Lord, the more real our worship to Him is. True worship is for us to open our inner being to the Lord for Him to fill and saturate us more.</p><h2 class="head1">V. MAN&rsquo;S FALL AND RELIGION&rsquo;S RESISTANCE</h2>
<p>Before man chose the way of eating the Lord, Satan came in. People usually say that man fell because of sin. Actually, man fell because he ate of things that were other than God. God wants man to eat God Himself, but Satan wants man to eat other things. The general term for all these other things is <em>knowledge,</em> which is represented by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Christ is not knowledge but life. Man fell because he turned away from life to knowledge and from God to many things other than God. These many things are not always apparently evil (they include both good and evil), yet they all belong to death. To give up God and draw near to the many things other than God is to give up life and draw near to death.</p>
<p>When the Lord was on earth, many religious people came to contact Him, and what they expressed were their old religious concepts. For example, Nicodemus called Him Rabbi and wanted Him to be a teacher. The Lord shocked him by answering that man needs to be born again. What man needs is not the teaching of doctrines but another life, which is Christ Himself.</p>
<p>The religious leaders were often in conflict with the Lord. They stressed religious regulations, but the Lord cared only to enter into man as life. For example, He healed a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath. The religionists stressed the keeping of the Sabbath, but the Lord was concerned for the sick to be healed and for the dead to be made alive.</p>
<p>What the Lord encountered when He was on earth was the old religion. Today it is the same. The Christianity we encounter has fallen into religion. For example, during the time of worship, Christianity requires people to be quiet and to behave somberly; there is even music to help people to be silent.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE LORD CALLING OVERCOMERS TO OVERCOME DEGRADED CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>The book of Revelation is neither for preaching the gospel nor for teaching doctrine. In Revelation the Lord gives a second call, a call to overcome. To overcome here is not to overcome our temper or to overcome sin and the world but to overcome degraded Christianity. The Lord&rsquo;s call is directed to the situation of fallen Christendom. The church in Ephesus was very good in that she labored for the Lord with zeal and diligence. Nevertheless, the Lord told her to repent, for although she labored for Him, she did not love Him enough; although she did many things for Him, she did not enjoy Him sufficiently. The overcomers must overcome these conditions. The Lord wants us to enjoy Him. He said, &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God&rdquo; (Rev. 2:7b). Right at the beginning this eating of the tree of life was there; it was the first thing, but it has been lost. Now the Lord is calling us to enjoy this matter of eating once again.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover what He ordained in the beginning. God ordained that man should eat Him, and this would become man&rsquo;s destiny. Our lot is not to do this or that but to eat the Lord. For forty years in the wilderness the Israelites did nothing but gather manna and eat it every day. Eating was their occupation. Likewise, today God wants us to eat and enjoy Christ every day. It is not how much we do for the Lord but rather how much we eat the Lord. This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Christianity is a religion with activities and works. There are many laboring Christians, but very few of them enjoy Christ in their spirit by eating Him. The whole church must enjoy Christ in this way. In Revelation 2 and 3, in the seven times the Lord calls for overcomers, the matter of eating is mentioned three times. The first time is with regard to eating the tree of life, the second time to eating the hidden manna, and the third time to eating the feast. These are like the three kinds of eating by the people of God in the Old Testament. Revelation 2 and 3 are for the recovery of the eating that was in the Old Testament. Christianity has lost this, and the Lord is calling us to overcome and to be recovered back to the beginning. When you eat Christ and are filled with Him, your temper is terminated, and the world is gone. Therefore, just take care of eating Christ.</p>
<p>One can never graduate from eating. Every day there is a repetition of eating. Hardships from husbands, problems from wives, and difficulties on the job can all be dealt with by eating Christ. When you eat Christ a little more, your problem will be solved. This way might seem to be too simple, but once you enter in, you will find that the more you eat Him the sweeter He is, and the more you enjoy Him the richer He becomes.</p>
<p>The Bible is a book on eating. Christians must be an eating people, and the churches must be eating churches. The brothers should eat and so should the sisters. The older ones should eat and so should the younger ones. Everyone should be eating.</p>
<p>At the end of the book of Revelation, it says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life&rdquo; (22:14). This blessing is for those who come to the tree of life. Thus, ultimately man is destined to eat the tree of life, that is, to eat the Lord. Man will eat the Lord for eternity.</p>
<p>To be sure, after a person is fed he will work. Well-fed children are very active and may even act like a destroying army. Therefore, we must first feed ourselves and then feed others. When everyone is fed, the church will be living. It is not a matter of doing things outwardly but of being alive inwardly. When we are filled by eating Christ, we become energetic. Today we do not need mere outward encouragement; we need only the inward supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. NOT TEACHING BUT LIFE</h2>
<p>In Revelation chapters two and three, eating is given as a promise in a positive way, while teaching is mentioned numerous times in a negative way. Eating is versus teaching. The Lord hates teaching. Perhaps you will say that the Lord does not hate correct teachings. However, how do you know which are the correct teachings? Every teaching is apparently correct. Counterfeit money appears the same as the real money; otherwise, no one would be fooled. Everyone who teaches wrong doctrine teaches it in a way so that it looks real. If you do not want to be a victim of counterfeit money, the best way is not to accept money but gold. Do not listen to any doctrine; only care for Christ. Doctrines may help us to comprehend and understand, but they cannot supply us.</p>
<p>Even biblical doctrines, without the Spirit in them and without Christ as their reality, are empty teachings. For example, concerning husbands loving their wives, you may have the doctrinal knowledge but not the ability to love. However, if you enjoy the living Christ by pray-reading, you can love your wife without exerting your own will. The words of the holy Scriptures are spirit and are life. Therefore, when we are reading the Scriptures, we must call on the Lord and touch the Spirit to receive the supply.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we must practice calling on the Lord. When we call on the Lord, our spirit is opened, and when we breathe the Spirit in as air, we are refreshed and enlightened within. In the New Jerusalem there is only one tree of life yielding fruit for us to eat; everyone there simply will be eating daily. The church in Ephesus became degraded because she neglected the eating and was devoted to working. The Lord told her to repent. The elders and co-workers should not consider too much about how to work; they should take the lead to eat. Let us all come to keep the feast, to come and dine together. What is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? Eating! What is the Lord&rsquo;s way? Eating! What is it to be overcoming? Eating! What is it to be spiritual? Eating! Eating! Eating! Eating!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ORGAN FOR EATING&mdash;THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:7; Zech. 12:1; Job 32:8; Prov. 20:27; Isa. 57:15; Ezek. 36:26-27; John 3:6; 4:24; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22; John 6:63</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. THREE GREAT THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE</h2>
<p>Zechariah 12:1 shows us that in the eyes of God there are three great things in this universe: the heavens, the earth, and man. In the universe God pays attention to the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man. Therefore, do not despise yourself. You have a spirit within you, and your spirit is ranked with the heavens and the earth. God needs the heavens and the earth, and even more He needs your spirit. If we see how important our human spirit is, we will be very excited.</p>
<p>Why does God consider the human spirit as important as the heavens and the earth? It is because the human spirit is a vessel to contain God. The heavens are for the earth. Without the heavens, the earth could not survive. The things we enjoy on earth, such as sunshine and rain, come from the heavens. Furthermore, the earth is for man. Things brought forth by the earth, such as crops, are suitable to meet man&rsquo;s needs for his survival. But the most precious thing in man is his spirit. The human spirit is for God; it is used to contain God. The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man is for God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. MAN HAVING A SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Man has a spirit. Many people, including even Christians, do not know that there is a spirit in them. We must pay attention to the spirit of man. To eat food, you cannot use your eyes, ears, or nose; you must use your mouth. The mouth is the organ for eating. In order for man to eat, God created the eating organ, the mouth, in a marvelous way: the lips for sucking, the teeth for grinding, the tongue for pushing, and the saliva for mixing; all are for eating food. The Lord Jesus said that He is the bread of life. By this we see that God Himself is our food. Then which organ do we use to eat the Lord? The spirit! The human spirit is the organ for us to eat the Lord. God created a spirit for us that we may eat Him, enjoy Him, and receive Him into us. Hallelujah! We have within us a stomach to contain physical food and a spirit to contain spiritual food, which is God Himself!</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. WHAT THE SPIRIT IS</h2>
<p>What is the spirit? Where is the spirit? This is hard to explain. It is even difficult to know our heart. How many hearts do we have? We have a biological heart and a psychological heart. Not only is God a mystery, but even you and I are mysteries. Some of the most precious things are very mysterious. For example, electricity, life, and atomic energy are mysterious and even invisible, yet they are real. Within us the most mysterious thing is the spirit.</p>
<p>What really is the spirit? It is hard for the mind to understand; we can know the spirit only by experience. For instance, many times our mind reasons out a certain matter and our will is also in agreement, but deep within us there is something troubling us. That something is a mysterious thing, which is unexplainable, and that is the story of the spirit. Take another case: When a man is poor, all he needs is clothing, food, and shelter, and all he thinks about is how to make money. After he becomes rich and all these material necessities are fully supplied, then he feels the need for recreation and amusement, such as music and sports. Yet after all these needs have been met, he still feels an emptiness deep within him. Then one day he calls, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; It is then that he is satisfied within. This deepest need is neither physical nor psychological but spiritual. Only God can satisfy this need. This need is evidence that we have a spirit within us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. TWO KINDS OF PRAYER</h2>
<p>Now let us talk about prayer. There are at least two kinds of prayer. The first kind is to pray with the intellect or the mind. The words of your prayer may be correct, but because you pray with the wrong organ, your prayer is not effective. If you ask a professor of psychology to pray, he might pray and pray, going round and round in his mind; eventually he may even pray God away. This is because the human mind cannot contact God, just as a piece of wood cannot make electrical contact. If one is willing to call, &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; then the Spirit will come, and he will touch God. Therefore, the second kind of prayer is to pray with the spirit. We all must exercise to make our spirit strong.</p>
<p>Christianity teaches people to pray to an objective God, a God who is high above on the throne, begging Him to have pity on them and to do things for them. This kind of religious prayer by religious teaching is altogether in the mind. True prayer is to pray with your spirit in order to contact the subjective Lord, who is in you and with your spirit. Today He is not only sitting high above on the throne, but He is also dwelling in your spirit in a lowly way. Therefore, when you pray to Him, you should not only make requests of Him, but you should touch and contact Him. This kind of prayer for contacting Him is to pray not with the mind but with the spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord said that He is the bread of life and that we have to eat Him. How do we eat Him? It is not by considering Him with our mind but by calling &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; with our spirit. Suppose your husband or your wife or a brother or a sister insults you, provoking you to anger. This will stir up your mind to think, &ldquo;How unreasonable this is! How can he do this to me?&rdquo; Then your whole being will be usurped by the mind, and even though you pray, you will not be able to touch the Lord. Therefore, we must learn how to contact the Lord with our spirit. The Lord is Spirit. To contact Him, who is Spirit, we must use our spirit. He as the Spirit is in our spirit. In our spirit there is a mutual fellowship and a mingling of the two spirits.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE SPIRIT BEING DIFFERENT<br />
FROM THE MIND AND THE EMOTION</h2>
<p>Brothers and sisters, it is a fact that we have a spirit within us. Our spirit is different from our mind, our emotion, and our heart. The Bible does not tell us to walk according to the heart; instead, it tells us to walk according to the spirit. We need to follow the spirit, to walk according to the spirit.</p>
<p>I often tell people that today you may love a person but in the future you may hate him. Those whom you hate are usually those whom you have loved. Without marriage there cannot be divorce. Why is it that love can turn into hate? It is because this love was from the emotion, or at most it was only from the heart. The heart is so unreliable; it changes faster than the weather in Taipei. Therefore, all the wives need to know that none of the husbands is trustworthy, and all the husbands need to know that none of the wives is truly gentle. She might be gentle in this hour, but in the next hour she will strongly lose her temper. This proves that the human heart is not trustworthy; it is capricious. But, praise the Lord, there is one thing that is constant, and that is our spirit. If you love someone with your spirit, your love will not change. Whether or not he loves in return or if he is good or bad, you will still love him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. RETURNING TO OUR SPIRIT<br />
TO GET OUT OF THE REALM OF SATAN</h2>
<p>Our spirit was created uniquely and especially for us by God. I would like to tell you something that we know from our experience, though it is not explicitly mentioned in the Scripture. The fact is that because man fell, his spirit is now influenced by his soul. However, it seems that God has drawn a line and said to Satan, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go beyond this point.&rdquo; It is as though God said, &ldquo;You can enter into man&rsquo;s body and usurp man&rsquo;s soul, but you cannot enter into man&rsquo;s spirit. His spirit is off limits to you.&rdquo; Therefore, whenever you return to your spirit, you get out of Satan&rsquo;s realm. If you remain in your mind instead of returning to your spirit, you will enter the kingdom of Satan and be under his control. Therefore, we must learn to turn to our spirit. Regardless of what people say to you, your mind should not dwell on what they say; regardless of how much people are angry with you and try to provoke you, you still must return to your spirit. Hallelujah, as long as you remain in your spirit, Satan cannot do anything to you!</p>
<p>Moreover, when you remain in your spirit, you are in fellowship with God. When you contact the Lord in this way, He will flow more abundantly into you to be your supply. In this way you can eat and enjoy the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. TWO WAYS OF READING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Now we will consider the matter of reading the Bible. We know that there are two ways to read the Bible. The first way is to read with our mind; this is the common way. The more we read with the mind, the more deadened we become. The more we read like this, the drier and emptier we are and the more depressed we become. Then what is the right way to read the Scriptures? It is by the second way, which is to read with our spirit. After reading a sentence, you call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; By calling on the Lord while reading, you receive all the words of the Scriptures into you as life.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (John 6:63). Therefore, we cannot receive the word with our mind; we must contact the word with our spirit. The word is spirit, and we touch the word by our spirit. When we pray with our spirit and read the word with our spirit, we absorb and receive the Lord abundantly into our spirit.</p>
<p>At the time of our believing, the Lord regenerated our spirit, changing our old spirit into a new spirit. From that time onward the Spirit of the Lord has been remaining in our spirit; that is, the two spirits have now become one spirit and witness together. Today this spirit in us is a mingled spirit, a wonderful spirit, and a rich spirit. You simply need to learn to turn to your spirit and to exercise your spirit moment by moment; then spontaneously you will touch the Lord Himself. As a result, you will enjoy the riches of the Lord. Hallelujah! You have a spirit! Exercise your spirit!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO EAT&mdash;<br />
CALLING UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:2, 9, 24, 30; 12:13, 3b; Acts 9:14; Rom. 10:12; Isa. 55:1-2, 6, 10-11; Lam. 3:55-57</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. CALLING UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD<br />
TO ENJOY CHRIST</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:2 tells us that the called saints are those who call upon the name of the Lord, and those who call upon the name of the Lord are the saints. The totality of these saints is the church. Therefore, our status and our position are that we are saints, those who call upon the name of the Lord. Paul said that Christ is &ldquo;theirs and ours.&rdquo; This means that Christ is the portion of all those who call upon His name. Then in verse 9 he said that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ, that is, into the enjoyment of Christ. God has called us that we may participate in the enjoyment of Christ, and the way to enjoy Christ is by calling upon His name.</p>
<p>Again I say that in reading the Bible our problem is that we often read our own concepts into the Bible. Therefore, it is very difficult for us to receive any revelations from the Bible. For example, normally we have some understanding of love. Therefore, when we read 1 Corinthians 13, it is easy for us to grasp what it says about love. Love is this or love is that. But when we read 1 Corinthians 1, it is difficult for us to see that we are the called saints and that we are those who should call upon the name of the Lord. We are called to call upon the name of the Lord. It is also difficult for us to see that Christ is theirs and ours. Furthermore, it is difficult for us to see that God has called us not that we may go to heaven but that we may enter into the fellowship of His Son.</p>
<p>God has called us into the fellowship of His Son. This is equivalent to God&rsquo;s inviting us to a feast to enjoy His Son, as referred to in Matthew 22. This Christ is God&rsquo;s wisdom and God&rsquo;s power. God has made this Christ to be our righteousness for the past, our sanctification for the present, and our redemption for the future. In the past we were full of unrighteousness, and we were a mess, but Christ is our righteousness to deal with our past. Through His death on the cross He satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement and solved the problems of our past. As to the present we are very weak and have many failures, but Christ is our sanctification. Then in the future He will transfigure our body that we may be redeemed. In other words, He entered into our spirit, He is transforming our soul, and He will transfigure our body. He takes care of all three parts of our being: spirit, soul, and body. Such a Christ is our enjoyment. God has called us that we may enjoy such a Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. BEING BAPTIZED INTO THE SPIRIT<br />
TO DRINK OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Up to this point what we have covered is merely doctrine. It is as if I told you that we have a feast here which is truly rich and very good, but you have not as yet tasted a bit of it. Therefore, in 1 Corinthians, after the objective truths are presented in chapters one and two, chapter twelve tells us how to experience such a Christ. First, it tells us that all the believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, were baptized into one Spirit (v. 13). The rich Christ today is the Spirit. Like electricity, the Spirit is hard to describe; thus, God uses water to signify the Spirit. When we were baptized, we were put into the water; this signifies that we were put into the Spirit. Christ is the Spirit; when we were baptized into Christ, we were baptized into the Spirit. After we were baptized into the Spirit, we obtained the position to drink this Spirit. This verse in the original language means that we were put in the position for us to drink this Spirit. How do we drink this Spirit? Verse 3 of the same chapter says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In other words, once you say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus!&rdquo;, immediately you are in the Holy Spirit, and you are drinking the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE NAME OF THE LORD AND<br />
THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>There is one matter that is very important, yet it is not clear to many Christians. It concerns two things: the name of the Lord and the Spirit of the Lord. The name of the Lord is Jesus, and the Spirit of the Lord is the Lord Himself, the person of the Lord. Everyone has a name, and every name denotes a person, who is the person himself. If there were no such person but only a name, then that name would equal nothing. Jesus is the name of the Lord, and the Spirit is the person of the Lord. When I call the Lord&rsquo;s name, the Spirit comes. Brothers and sisters, do you think that the Lord Jesus is merely an empty name? The Lord Jesus is real; therefore, when you call, He comes, and the One who comes is the Spirit. Do not think that calling upon the name of the Lord is a small matter; you cannot call upon the name of the Lord Jesus without any result. When you call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo;, He comes.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us to pray, but in addition to praying, it also tells us to call upon the name of the Lord. When you say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; the Spirit is here. The Spirit is the living Jesus; the Spirit is the realized Jesus; the Spirit is the Jesus who comes to you. When you call on the name of an idol, nothing happens because it has an empty name. No matter how much you call on Buddha, Buddha will not come. However, our Lord Jesus is the true and living God; He is the true and living Spirit. Christ as such a Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit. Do you need redemption? Redemption is in Him. Do you need power? Power is in Him. Do you need life? Life is in Him. Do you need holiness and patience? Holiness and patience are in Him. He can supply whatever you need.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE EARLY BELIEVERS BEING<br />
THOSE WHO CALLED UPON THE LORD&rsquo;S NAME</h2>
<p>We see that at the time of Pentecost the saints were those who called upon the Lord&rsquo;s name. You remember that before Paul was saved, he went to Damascus to arrest the Lord&rsquo;s disciples, and the Lord appeared to Ananias. Ananias did not at that time report to the Lord that Saul had authority to bind all who believed and trusted in the Lord; rather, Ananias said that Saul had authority to bind all who called upon the Lord&rsquo;s name. This tells us that there was something particular with those believers in the first century; that is, they all called upon the Lord&rsquo;s name. They were the callers of the Lord&rsquo;s name. A genuine Christian does not need to wear a mark. As long as we are those who call upon the Lord&rsquo;s name, our neighbors and colleagues will know that we are believers. Therefore, when Saul went to Damascus, there was no need for him to investigate house after house, because the Christians were all callers of Jesus, and they were known as such. If you live in a place and you have not called on the Lord&rsquo;s name to such an extent that all your neighbors know that you are a believer in Jesus, you are a defeated Christian.</p>
<p>According to Romans 10:12, to whom is the Lord rich? He is rich to all who call upon His name. When you call upon His name, you enjoy His riches. Why? Because when you call upon the Lord, the Spirit comes. The Spirit is rich and bountiful; when you are in spirit, you enjoy His riches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. CALLING UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD AND PRAY-READING THE WORD OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>Isaiah 55:1 says, &ldquo;Come to the waters.&rdquo; This water is the Lord Himself; the Lord is the living water. All those who thirst may come and drink, without money and without price. Then Isaiah said, &ldquo;Seek Jehovah while He may be found; / Call upon Him while He is near&rdquo; (v. 6). How do we seek the Lord? It is by calling upon Him. Also when we call and pray, we use not only our words but also the words of God. Isaiah said, &ldquo;Hear Me attentively, and eat what is good, / And let your soul delight itself in fatness&rdquo; (v. 2b). Therefore, besides calling upon the Lord&rsquo;s name, we also need to pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s word. The Lord Himself is in His word. His word is the rain and the snow that do not return to heaven in vain but water the earth that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater. We have seeds for sowing and bread for feeding ourselves and others. This is the result of eating the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. TO CALL UPON THE LORD&rsquo;S NAME<br />
BEING TO BREATHE THE LORD</h2>
<p>Jeremiah&rsquo;s word in Lamentations 3 is very precious. He said, &ldquo;I called upon Your name, O Jehovah, / From the lowest pit&rdquo; (v. 55). When he was in a low pit, in an abased condition, in difficulty, under oppression, he called upon the name of the Lord. Then he said, &ldquo;Do not hide / Your ear at my breathing&rdquo; (v. 56). Our calling before the Lord is a spiritual breathing, even a deep breathing. A certain medical doctor in the United States Air Force found out through experiments that the most beneficial practice to human health is deep breathing. If we practice deep breathing every day, our body will be healthy. It is the same spiritually. Deep breathing in our spirit makes us strong, burning, and beside ourselves.</p>
<p>Our calling on the Lord is our breathing the Lord. However, our breathing includes drinking, and our drinking includes eating. When you call upon the Lord, at first it is like breathing. Then after you breathe for a while, you feel that there is living water in you springing up; thus, you drink the living water. As you continue to call, you also eat and are satisfied.</p>
<p>Hallelujah! The Lord has given us such a simple and direct way, that is, to call upon the Lord&rsquo;s name and to pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s word. In this way we enjoy all that the Lord is. I hope that all of us will really practice this.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">BUILDING UP A LIFE OF CALLING<br />
UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Deut. 4:7; Psa. 99:6; Isa. 12:2-6; Acts 7:59; 22:16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. CALLING ON THE LORD<br />
BEING THE WAY TO ENJOY THE LORD</h2>
<p>We have already seen clearly that eating the Lord is the way to enjoy the Lord. Eating the Lord, which is a spiritual expression, is really calling on the Lord. Calling on the Lord is our way to enjoy the Lord. This light, this wonderful fact, was buried for many years among the Christians. For many generations, although many were seeking God, they did not see definitely that calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name is the way to enjoy the Lord. If you read the whole Bible carefully, you will see that this matter of calling on the Lord was already there in the Old Testament; it began with Enosh, the third generation of mankind (Gen. 4:26). We have seen also in Lamentations 3:55-56 that our calling on the Lord is a heavenly breathing. When we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, we begin to exhale, and with the exhaling there is the inhaling. In this way of breathing, we take in the fresh air.</p>
<p>We can often use physical things as illustrations of spiritual matters. To enjoy the Lord in our spirit is like breathing the air physically. Just as your body takes in fresh air by breathing, so also your spirit inhales the Lord when you call on His name. I believe that all of us have had this experience. Whenever we truly open to the Lord and call on His name, we have the sense of the Lord&rsquo;s presence within us. The more you call, the more you receive the supply of the Lord; the more you call, the more you are watered by Him; the more you call, the more you are filled with Him. The Lord is the Lord of all! When the Lord comes into us, whatever we need, He is. He is all that we need, and He supplies all of our needs.</p>
<p>In Deuteronomy Moses told the people of God that our God Jehovah is near all those who call on Him (4:7). Do you want God to be near to you? Do you want to have the presence of God? Then you must call on Him. Try it. Whether you are sitting at home, walking on the way, riding in a car, eating a meal, or even talking with people, when you call, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; the Lord is right in front of you. This is neither superstition nor imagination. You must practice calling on the Lord!</p>
<p>The translation in the Chinese Bible of <em>call on</em> is <em>pray</em>. Actually, <em>call on</em> is closer to the meaning in the original language than <em>pray</em>. To call is not only to pray but also to call out with a loud voice. For example, if my house is on fire and I come to you to tell you about it and to ask for your help, this would be what it is like to pray. But if I call out loudly, &ldquo;Fire! Fire! Come quickly!&rdquo;, this is what it is like to call. Those who have the experience can testify that calling is more practical than praying. For instance, when a sister&rsquo;s child is disobedient, she brings the child&rsquo;s name before the Lord by calling. After thus calling on the Lord, whether or not the Lord answers her prayer is a secondary matter; the most important thing is that she has inhaled the Lord. In this way she is touched by the Lord from within, and she receives His supply. Every one of us must practice calling on the Lord!</p>
<p>I know that to this day many Christians can only pray but cannot call on the Lord. It is easy for them to pray silently, but it is very hard for them to call out audibly. I am concerned that even some of the brothers and sisters here at this time do not agree with calling. One time after I had spoken on the matter of calling in a certain locality, several sisters came to me, saying, &ldquo;Brother Lee, is our God deaf that we have to call by shouting?&rdquo; I told them, &ldquo;Sisters, I don&rsquo;t like to refute your argument, but I can tell you a fact: Call on the Lord and you will sense sweetness; call on the Lord and you will be watered; call on the Lord and you will touch Him! Would you like to try?&rdquo; I also said to them, &ldquo;If I argue on the ground of your way of reasoning, you will not win, because the Bible tells us that God knows our needs before we ask Him (Matt. 6:8). Shall we then not even pray? Therefore, we call loudly not because God is deaf but because it is profitable to us.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Lamentations 3:55 says, &ldquo;I called upon Your name, O Jehovah, / From the lowest pit.&rdquo; When your wife gives you trouble at home, you get into a low pit. At such a time praying is of no avail; you need to call. If you call out loud a few times when you are pressed, you will be able to break through and rise above your feeling. Often your calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name is for the demons to hear so that they can be driven off. When you are about to lose your temper, you have no time to pray, but you can quickly call on the Lord. Calling on the Lord is the best way to chase away the temper-losing demon and the trouble-making demon.</p><h2 class="head1">II. HELPING PEOPLE TO CALL ON THE LORD<br />
IN GOSPEL PREACHING</h2>
<p>There is another matter to which many can testify. When you preach the gospel to someone, you may think that if you can make the message logical and clear to him, he will then believe in the Lord. In actuality, however, you may speak one sentence, and he will argue back with three sentences; you may speak five more sentences, and he will argue with ten. You will not win the argument. On your part you wish to make him clear by speaking to him. Yet the more you speak, the more confused he gets and the more disturbed you get. But, praise the Lord, we have now found a secret. When we preach the gospel, it is better to speak just a few words; the less we speak, the better. If someone has a demon in him, when you speak, you rouse up the demon. The best way is to help him open his mouth to call on the Lord.</p>
<p>There is a brother who truly knows how to preach the gospel in this way. One day he met someone on the street and greeted that person with a smile, saying, &ldquo;Sir, let me tell you, I have Jesus! You also need Jesus! Will you please call with me? Call, &lsquo;O Lord Jesus!&rsquo;&rdquo; Unexplainably that person began to call with him. Then the brother asked him to call &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; a little louder. This was the way this brother preached the gospel, and many were saved. What is the reason? The reason is that when you call on the Lord, the demons are chased away. Do not think that this is superstition. The demons particularly usurp the human mind. When you call on the Lord, the demon in your mind is chased away. Moreover, when others call on the Lord with you, their spirit is unconsciously opened to the Lord. When their spirit is opened, the Lord, who is the living Spirit, enters into their spirit, and they are saved. Many brothers and sisters can testify to the fact that the quickest and most effective way to preach the gospel is to help people call on the Lord Jesus. When they call on the Lord Jesus, their reasonings are gone, and they cease their arguing.</p>
<p>Amazingly, when a person calls on the Lord Jesus, his speaking is changed. Before he called, he said there was no God; but after he calls, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; he confesses that there is God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. CALLING ON THE LORD<br />
WHILE THANKING AND PRAISING THE LORD</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the Bible shows us that when we are offering sacrifices to God, that is, when we are giving thanks to God, we must also call on the Lord. Whenever your heart is touched by the Lord&rsquo;s grace and you give thanks to the Lord, you must call on the Lord from deep within. The thing that most glorifies the Lord and gives Him the utmost thanks and praises is our calling on the Lord. When you call on the Lord, the Lord truly gets the praises and thanks.</p>
<p>Let us look at Isaiah chapter twelve, which is a very sweet chapter. It begins with, &ldquo;God is now my salvation&rdquo; (v. 2). It does not say, &ldquo;God has saved me&rdquo;; rather, it says that God is my salvation. God Himself is the salvation. Therefore, if you want to receive the salvation of God, you have to receive God Himself. &ldquo;God is now my salvation; / I will trust and not dread; / For Jah Jehovah is my strength and song, / And He has become my salvation&rdquo; (v. 2). I am convinced that these words were uttered in exclamation and were cried out from deep within the spirit of the writer. Because he cried out in this way, he enjoyed the riches of the Lord in his spirit.</p>
<p>Thus, he went on, &ldquo;Therefore you will draw water with rejoicing / From the springs of salvation&rdquo; (v. 3). How do we draw this water? The well of salvation is God Himself, and we come to draw water from this well by calling, &ldquo;O Lord! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; When you call on the Lord in this way, you are drawing water with joy from within. In other words, you are drinking again the water from the springs of salvation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will say in that day, / Give thanks to Jehovah; call upon His name!&rdquo; (v. 4a). We should not only give thanks but also call. &ldquo;Make His deeds known among the peoples; / Remind them that His name is exalted. / Sing psalms to Jehovah&rdquo; (vv. 4b-5a). In the original language, the last sentence means to shout loudly unto Jehovah. Therefore, do not consider that to shout is not refined; this concept is wrong. To be sure, in the Bible there are phrases such as &ldquo;shout with joy,&rdquo; &ldquo;cry out and shout,&rdquo; &ldquo;sing,&rdquo; &ldquo;cried with a loud voice,&rdquo; and &ldquo;call on the Lord!&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">IV. CALLING ON THE LORD WHILE<br />
READING THE WORD</h2>
<p>Regrettably, some Christians today like to read the Bible with their mind. They read the Word but will not call on the Lord. As a result, they contact the Bible but not the Lord. Please remember that if you do not call on the Lord, the Scriptures will be merely letters and not spirit. The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. If you read the Bible with your mind, every word and sentence of the Bible will kill you. Everyone who &ldquo;researches&rdquo; the Bible is deadened. You have to believe me. Before you researched the Bible, you might have been a little alive; but after you search and research, you become dead in your spirit, because this is the wrong way.</p>
<p>This is not to say you should not study the Bible. However, it is not the biblical doctrines that can edify you, save you, supply you, or be life to you. No! Only the Lord Himself can be your life, and only He can save you. For your difficulties you must touch the Lord Himself; for your lacks you must receive the Lord Himself. The words of the Bible are the means. In your reading you must call on the Lord with your spirit: &ldquo;O Lord! In the beginning was the Word. O Lord! In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. O Lord! You created the heavens. O Lord! You created the earth.&rdquo; Immediately you will see that the words of the Bible are living. As a result, what you gain is not a doctrine but a living Lord. This is what we need today.</p>
<p>Although many brothers and sisters have heard this teaching, the practice among us is not adequate. We are too accustomed to using our mind to understand the Scriptures, but we are not in the habit of using our spirit to call on the Lord and touch the Word simultaneously. We definitely have to build up this habit of calling on the Lord whenever we open the Bible. If we call on the Lord and pray while we read the Word, the words of the Bible will become alive. Then our darkness will be dissipated and our weakness will be turned to strength. The Lord will supply us within in many ways. This is the right way.</p>
<p>Sometimes you may not remember the verses you pray-read. But, praise the Lord, whether or not you remember them, by praying and reading the Word, exhaling and inhaling, you will receive the Lord into you. To remember the words of the Bible, you need to exercise your memory, but memorizing is not necessary for you to receive the Lord. As long as you breathe in the Lord, He will operate in you to water, enlighten, comfort, and support you; He will even carry out the work of transformation in you, not to correct you from without but to change you from within.</p>
<p>Therefore, brothers and sisters, you must learn to call on the Lord, and you also must learn to mingle your calling on the Lord with your pray-reading of the Word. If you practice these two ways every day, you will not need to listen to the teachings concerning holiness, victorious living, or life, but you surely will be holy, overcoming, and full of life. To be sure, your entire being will be saturated with the Lord. The Lord is really the true and living Spirit. He does not care whether you understand and comprehend the doctrines; He cares only to operate in you. For the Lord to operate in us, we must learn to call on the Lord until this becomes a natural habit in our living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. CALLING ON THE LORD<br />
NEEDING TO BECOME OUR LIVING</h2>
<p>Now we come to the book of Acts. When Stephen was being persecuted and before being stoned to death, he was not praying but calling upon the Lord. He called upon the Lord and said, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!&rdquo; (7:59). As a result, many saw that his face was shining like the face of an angel. Why? Because when he called, the Lord filled him within, and the Lord was expressed out from him.</p>
<p>Then Acts 22 tells us how Saul of Tarsus went from Jerusalem to Damascus to arrest all those who called on the name of the Lord. On the way, however, after his encounter with the Lord, he repented. He was saved but no one knew about it. Therefore, the Lord Himself went to Ananias and told him to go see Saul. What did Ananias say to Saul? Verse 16 says, &ldquo;Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name.&rdquo; Ananias did not say that to be baptized is to wash away sins; rather, he said that to call on His name is to wash away sins. In effect Ananias was telling Saul, &ldquo;Saul, previously you committed sins for which the saints cannot forgive you; that is, you went everywhere to arrest those who called on the name of the Lord. You arrested anyone who called, &lsquo;O Lord.&rsquo; You persecuted the church and opposed the saints. Now for you to wash away your sins, the best way is for you yourself to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. You also should call, &lsquo;O Lord Jesus!&rsquo; When you call, your sins of murdering those who called on the Lord&rsquo;s name will be washed away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, this shows us that in the first century all the proper Christians lived a life of calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name. I do not doubt at all that they called on the Lord every day. They called on the Lord at home, and they called on the Lord while walking on the street. I hope that all of you also will build up such a practice.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles we more or less have a taste of this. At least three hundred of us live in the neighborhood surrounding meeting hall number one, so when we go out, we frequently run into some saints, especially when we go to the supermarkets. When we see one another, we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; This one will call, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; and the other will answer, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; Many are always calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo;, and they truly have the enjoyment of calling on the name of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. ALL THE THINGS OF LIFE BEING SIMPLE</h2>
<p>Let us apply this a little. For instance, when you are oppressed, you must call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; After calling upon the name of the Lord three to five times, you will not be oppressed anymore. Another example is that when you are void of light within and are not clear about what to do concerning a certain matter, you say, &ldquo;O Lord! Amen!&rdquo;, and you are enlightened within. Furthermore, when you are depressed, and you feel that you are being burdened beyond your strength, you should call, &ldquo;O Lord! O Lord!&rdquo; Your inner strength will then rise up from within you.</p>
<p>You may say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, this is too simple.&rdquo; I tell you, the more necessary a thing is for life, the simpler it is. For example, breathing, drinking, and eating are all very simple practices. Breathing in the Lord is as simple as breathing in the air. The way of the Lord is a simple way.</p>
<p>Life is simple. A seed of grain planted in the soil will grow to yield more grains; a flower seed buried in the ground will grow and blossom. It is very simple. You simply dig a hole in the ground, put the seed in, bury it, and water it, and then you go home and sleep in peace. After a while, it will sprout. It is very simple. We thank and praise the Lord that all the matters of life are simple.</p>
<p>O brothers and sisters, today we are in the last days. The Lord wants to recover the church back to the beginning. That which was in the beginning was so simple. There was a tree of life for man to eat. Today, due to man&rsquo;s weakness and failure, the church has become degraded, but it was not so in the beginning. In the beginning it was all very simple. We thank and praise the Lord for this. We all have to learn to be simple. Today is not the age of doctrines but the age of the spirit. Today is the age of eating the Lord, drinking the Lord, and enjoying the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEED FOR THE PRACTICAL EXERCISE<br />
OF OUR SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22; 2 Cor. 3:6; Gal. 5:25; Rom. 8:4-6</h1>
<h2 class="head1">I. GOD BEING A MYSTERY</h2>
<p>God is a mystery, and this mystery is in His being Spirit. The Spirit is truly mysterious. We may illustrate this with electricity. Today we use many electrical appliances. Electricity is something practical; without it, we would not have electric lighting or microphones, so we would not be able to hold a meeting here tonight. Although electricity is really practical and useful, we cannot see it, nor can we show it. Where is electricity? It seems that since electricity is in a lightbulb, as long as we do not remove the lightbulb, the electricity is here, but once you remove the lightbulb, it is gone. This is a wonderful thing. We can see by this that electricity is a mystery.</p>
<p>Another illustration is the life in our human body. I can speak, move, and show expressions because there is life in me. If I die, however, I will not be able to move even though my head and hands are still here. Why is this? It is because life is no longer in me. Life is something real, but no one can place life before our eyes. Even until today physiologists and medical doctors cannot give us an adequate explanation of life. We can see the expressions of life, but we cannot see life itself. Yet life is very real.</p>
<p>These examples show us that there is a God in the universe. When you consider the universe, you see that it is truly wonderful, yet it is a puzzle. This puzzle can be explained only by tracing back to God. The entire universe depends and rests on God. However, God is invisible, indescribable, and unexplainable; hence, God is a mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. FOUR GREAT MATTERS CONCERNING GOD</h2>
<p>The Bible mentions four great matters concerning God. First, God created. God created all things, and He created man. Second, God was incarnated. People in the world can see all the things created by God, but very few know how God became a man. We know that the name of this Man is Jesus. All would agree that Jesus is a wonderful One, the most special One. Jesus is extraordinary, and He is also common. Jesus is God. He is God, yet He became a man. In the beginning was the Word, the Word was God, and the Word became flesh.</p>
<p>The first great act of God was His creating of all things, and the second great act was His becoming a man. God entered into human flesh, put on human nature, and became a man named Jesus. When He came out for His ministry, people saw in Him a mystery; that is, although He obviously was a man, He did things that other men could not do, and He spoke words that others could not speak. The words that He spoke were apparently simple, yet they were extraordinary. For instance, He said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life.&rdquo; He also said, &ldquo;I am the light of the world.&rdquo; And again, &ldquo;I am the way, the reality, and the life.&rdquo; These words are simple, yet they are extraordinarily great. I do not believe that anyone in the whole world could have spoken such words as Jesus did. None of the philosophers and wise men ever spoke such words. No one is as wonderful as Jesus. Jesus is wonderful because He is God.</p>
<p>The third great thing concerning God is that in the flesh He became our Redeemer. Every one of us is fallen and corrupt. The Lord Jesus came to save us by bearing our sins through His death on the cross. The cross is excellent and special.</p>
<p>Creation, incarnation, and crucifixion are three great things that God did. However, these three great things are for the fourth great thing&mdash;His becoming the life-giving Spirit. The reason for His creation, His incarnation, and His redemption is to give life. His purpose in all this is to give life to man.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THREE KINDS OF LIFE<br />
AND THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>What is life? Life is God Himself. There are three different words for life in the Greek language. The first word is <em>bios,</em> denoting our physical life. The second word is <em>psuche,</em> denoting our soul-life. In the Gospels the Lord Jesus used this word many times. The soul-life is the natural life, the human ego. The third word is <em>zoe.</em> This is the life of God, the eternal life. John 3:16 says that every one who believes into the Son would not perish but would have eternal life. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life&rdquo; (10:10). The word <em>life</em> in these passages is <em>zoe</em>. Therefore, in summary, our physical life is <em>bios,</em> our natural life is <em>psuche,</em> and the divine life is <em>zoe.</em></p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, before you were saved or before you loved the Lord, your living and outward actions depended on your inward determination. Moreover, your inward feelings, your thoughts, and your emotions, including your joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, depended on the <em>psuche.</em> Whatever the <em>psuche</em> decided within you was expressed by your <em>bios</em> outwardly. You were living by your natural life and by your physical life. But one day you were saved, and you began to love the Lord. In the depths of your being, that is, in your spirit, you received another life. Since the time you believed in the Lord Jesus by calling on Him, there has been something mysterious within you. This mysterious thing is God Himself as your life. This life in you supplies you, supports you, and directs you, and it wants to live out from within you. You may rightly say that this is to be touched by the Holy Spirit; you may also say that this is God&rsquo;s moving; or you may say that this is Christ living in you. These are different expressions referring to the same thing, that the eternal God entered into us to be our life. This God, who is our life, is the life-giving Spirit. The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b).</p>
<p>God created all things, became a man, died on the cross to accomplish redemption, and became a Spirit. Hence, this Spirit is the God who created all things, who became a man, and who died on the cross to accomplish redemption. Today He has entered into us to be our life and everything. This is the most central item in the Bible. You may say that this life-giving Spirit is God, that He is the Lord, and that He is Christ. You may also say that He is Jesus. They all refer to this same One.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. NOT UNDERSTANDING WITH THE MIND<br />
BUT ENJOYING WITH THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Do not be influenced by the traditional teachings of Christianity. I know that among Christians the doctrine of the Trinity is very popular. Many talk about the Holy Father, the Holy Son, and the Holy Spirit, and they talk about Them as three Persons. I am not saying that there is no proper doctrine concerning the Trinity, but you should not try to deal with this truth as a doctrine, because your mind will not be able to understand it fully. After the summer conference last year, I visited the churches in various localities, and my unique burden was to show people that they cannot be clear concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Some of you may think that you are very clear about the Triune God, but I tell you that you cannot be clear. We cannot be clear even about ourselves, let alone about the Triune God. If you do not believe me, let me ask you a few questions. Do you have a soul? Do you have a heart? Do you have a spirit? Do you have a mind? Do you have a conscience? You say that you have them all. Then please tell me, where is your soul? Where is your heart, and how many hearts do you have? Where is your spirit? Are you trying to understand God thoroughly? You cannot understand even yourself thoroughly.</p>
<p>Now I will read to you a few passages from the Bible that will puzzle you. Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;For a child is born to us, / A son is given to us;...and His name will be called...Mighty God, / Eternal Father.&rdquo; He was a child and a son, yet His name was called Mighty God, Eternal Father. Please tell me, was He the Son or the Father? He was the Son and He was also the Father. This is very puzzling to us. Previously I thought that I was very clear about the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;but after I read Isaiah 9:6 again and again, I became puzzled.</p>
<p>Let us also read John 1:1: &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; First it says that the Word was with God, so there must be two; the word <em>with</em> would indicate this. But then it says, &ldquo;The Word was God&rdquo;; by this we say that They are one. Then, are the Word and God two or one? Here then is another verse that is puzzling.</p>
<p>Let us now look at 2 Corinthians 3:17: &ldquo;And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is....&rdquo; The first part of this verse says that the Lord is the Spirit, so the Lord and the Spirit are one. But then it goes on to refer to the Spirit of the Lord, so the Spirit and the Lord are obviously two entities. Please tell me, are the Spirit and the Lord one or two? This is yet another verse that puzzles us.</p>
<p>Therefore, you should not expect to have a clear understanding concerning God and concerning the person of our Lord Jesus. If you think you are clear, you will be in trouble. It is better not to be so clear. This is the same as not being able to explain your heart, soul, spirit, mind, emotion, will, and conscience as clearly as you can slice tofu into neat pieces. The Triune God is a mystery. Do not try to understand this with your own understanding. Do not think that the Father is one person, the Son is another person, and the Spirit is yet another person. When you begin to view Them in this way, eventually you will end up with three separate persons, and the result will be heresy.</p>
<p>God had already created; He became a man; He died on the cross. This &ldquo;He,&rdquo; whether He be the Father, the Son, or the Spirit, is now a life-giving Spirit; He is altogether a story of the Spirit. I say this according to the Bible and according to our experiences.</p>
<p>I remember when I was young, whenever I prayed, I did not know whether to address God as the Father or as the Lord. In my experience, when I prayed I had a sense that the Lord was the Father, and the Father was the Lord. This is really so. You cannot make a clear distinction. You may pray, &ldquo;O Father in heaven,&rdquo; &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; or &ldquo;O God.&rdquo; Sometimes you may pray, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; In actuality, how many are there? I do not say how many, but I do know that He is the Father, He is God, He is the Lord, He is the Spirit, and He is Jesus. Hallelujah! Sometimes you need to call, &ldquo;O Lord&rdquo;; another time it is appropriate to call, &ldquo;O Father&rdquo;; and still another time you may call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Therefore, do not try to understand, because you cannot understand. However, whether or not we are clear, we can truly have the experience. &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; &ldquo;O Father God!&rdquo; &ldquo;Abba Father!&rdquo; &ldquo;O God!&rdquo; When you call in these different ways, you are filled with sweetness within.</p>
<p>Our God is a mystery. We cannot understand Him with our mind, nor can we explain Him in an accurate way with our human language. Our mind is limited. I have tried this test on people: Is it right to say that we are on the globe and the globe is beneath our feet? You may say yes. Now if you were to ask those who live in the opposite hemisphere of the globe, they also would say that the globe is beneath their feet. Who then is above, and who is below? Therefore, do not trust your mind too much. Your mind is limited. Neither should you care too much about your feelings, which are even less dependable. You just need to enjoy God in simplicity.</p>
<p>How I wish that all of us would no longer take the old way of Christianity, which is the way of doctrines. Today we want to follow the new way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, which is the way of the Spirit. We may not understand the doctrines, but we can still enjoy God every day. The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. The Lord is the Spirit. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. Today every one of us is being transformed into the image of the Lord, even by the Lord Spirit. Not only so, today the Spirit of the Lord dwells in our spirit. The Lord is with our spirit. Therefore, the Lord and we are one spirit. Do not care too much about the feeling of your flesh or the thoughts of your mind. You need to realize that the most precious item in you is the Lord Jesus as the Spirit. The Spirit of the Lord is in your spirit. Moreover, these two spirits&mdash;your spirit and the Spirit of the Lord&mdash;are mingled into one spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. NEEDING TO EXERCISE THE SPIRIT<br />
IN OUR DAILY LIFE</h2>
<p>I know that, at least for about eleven or twelve years here in Taipei, I have been speaking concerning the Spirit, but to this day I have not spoken enough about this. Although I have spoken so much, I am concerned that the brothers and sisters still spend too little time in their spirit in their daily life. You all know that it is common for spouses to quarrel with each other. Why do they quarrel? It is because they are not in their spirit; rather, they live in their soul. When you live in your soul, you will quarrel. If every one of us lived in our spirit from morning to evening, there would be no quarreling among us. Those who quarrel are soulish; they are in their mind.</p>
<p>The problem today is that we merely know the doctrine, but we lack the practice. We even turn the truth concerning the Spirit into mere doctrine; we do not have the reality of the Spirit, the experience of the Spirit, and the exercise of the spirit. The Word says, &ldquo;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit&rdquo; (Gal. 5:25). When you speak, speak in the Spirit; when you do things, do them in the Spirit. Whatever you do, you have to do it in the Spirit.</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, I beg you that from now on you try your best to exercise your spirit every day. In order to exercise your spirit you have to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Moreover, you must also pray-read. On the one hand, you call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo;, and on the other hand, you pray-read the Word. To be sure, if you touch the Spirit daily in these two ways, you will be filled with the Spirit. Then the Bible to you will not be a book to be understood; instead, it will be a living and shining book. Whenever you read the Bible, you will taste its sweetness and you will receive the supply of the Lord. This is the real eating of the Lord.</p>
<p>Today the Lord is the Spirit. Not only so, He is the Word, and He is in His words. Your spirit must be opened to the Lord and to the Bible. If you use your spirit to pray-read the Bible, this will be effective and will be much richer than just listening to a message. You will receive more supply from this practice than from listening to a message. You will experience the Lord as the Spirit, and you will also experience the Lord in His words. As a result, you will be fully satisfied in your enjoyment of Him. All your difficulties will vanish, your death will be swallowed up, your darkness will be dissipated, and your weakness will be turned into strength. As a result, in your daily life, you will be practically joined to the Lord.</p>
<p>Moreover, at such times you will surely be living in the Body, because the life of this Spirit is corporate and not individual. The more you enjoy the Lord and live in the Spirit, the more you will desire to have the church life and to coordinate with others for the testimony of the Body. May the Lord have mercy on us that in these last days we may be in the flow of His recovery more and more.</p></body></html>
