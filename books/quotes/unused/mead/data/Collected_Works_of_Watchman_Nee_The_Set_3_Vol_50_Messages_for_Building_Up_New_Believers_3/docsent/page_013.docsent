   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Mark of Self-control Being Seen</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in One's Words</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 2 says, "For in many things we all stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If anyone does not stumble in word, this one is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether or not a person can bridle himself depends on whether he can bridle his words.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whether or not a person has self-control a fruit of the Spirit depends on whether he can bridle his words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many brothers and sisters misunderstand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They think that self-control is moderation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Please keep in mind that self-control is self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The teaching of moderation has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christians should exercise self-control, which means that they should control themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Self-control is a fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Galatians 5 shows us what the fruit of the Spirit is, while James tells us what the mark of the fruit of the Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>James says a person who is able to bridle his whole body is surely able to bridle his words.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who are loose in their words are loose in their living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who speak foolishly conduct themselves foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A person who is indiscreet with words is surely indiscreet in everything he does.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A person who has many words is bound to be a careless person before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whether or not a person can bridle his whole body depends on whether he can bridle his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I hope that from now on all the new believers will learn to bridle their words before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many brothers and sisters pray for God to deal with them and to grant them mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I will say a word to them: If God can deal with your speaking, He can deal with you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are many people whose speaking constitutes the very life of their being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Their speaking represents their strength, the very hollow of their thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If God can deal with their speaking, He can deal with their whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many people have not been defeated by God in their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a result, their very being has not been defeated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a man has no self-control over himself, he may act in certain ways.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But once others talk to him for half an hour, they realize the kind of person he is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As soon as a man opens his mouth, his very being is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nothing exposes a person more than his words.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As soon as a man speaks, his very being is fully exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you want to see whether a man can control himself, simply ask if he can control his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>C. The Smallest Affecting the Greatest</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 3 takes a bridle for an illustration, while verse 4 takes a rudder for an illustration.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 6 shows us that the tongue is a world of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The tongue is a world of its own, a world of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many people are redeemed; they have experienced God's mercy, yet their tongues have never been bridled.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everywhere they go, they ignite the fire of Gehenna with this world of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a strong word: The tongue can set on fire the wheel of nature v. 6, ASV . Life is like a wheel; it is turning all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The tongue is like a fire that can set the wheel of life on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that it can stir up all kinds of fleshly activities.</S>

   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The more lessons a person has learned before God, the more steadfast he is and the fewer words he has.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>D. The Tongue Being a Restless Evil</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>James 3:7 says that every living thing can be tamed, while verse 8 says that no man can tame the tongue.</S>
