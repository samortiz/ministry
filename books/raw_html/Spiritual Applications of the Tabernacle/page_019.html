 <h2 class="head1">THE NUMBER OF THE BOARDS</h2>
<p>On the south side of the tabernacle there were twenty boards (36:23), and on the north side there were twenty more (v. 25). There were two sets of twenty, again signifying a testimony. Furthermore, twenty itself is two times ten, signifying the testimony of completeness. Twenty may also be figured as four times five. Four is the number of the creatures in God&rsquo;s creation. Man as a created being takes up the responsibility to have a testimony by being regenerated, by having God added to him.</p>
<p>Exodus 36:27 through 29 say, &ldquo;And for the rear of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. And two boards he made for the corners of the tabernacle in the rear. And they were double below, and at its top they were completely joined to a single ring; thus he did to both of them for the two corners.&rdquo; At the rear of the tabernacle there were six boards, totaling nine cubits in width (v. 27). These may be divided into three pairs, each pair being three cubits wide. At the two corners of the west side were another two boards (vv. 27-29). These two boards were made in a peculiar and special way&mdash;they were &ldquo;double below&rdquo; for strength. According to the Scriptures, the corner is crucial for God&rsquo;s building (Matt. 21:42). The corner joins the two sides of the wall. It stands to meet all kinds of situations and to withstand all kinds of attacks. Therefore, the corners must be strengthened. In the church some are like the boards at the corner. If you took away such ones, the church would be weakened. The church could be joined together and stand strongly because of these &ldquo;corner boards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The six boards plus the two corner boards totaled to eight. Without the corner boards, the other boards would number to six. By itself, six does not have a positive connotation. The number six is the number of the created and unregenerated man, for man was made on the sixth day. With these two corner boards, however, the number comes to eight. Eight signifies resurrection. The strengthening power of the church is the resurrection power.</p>
<p>The total of all the boards of the tabernacle was forty-eight. Forty-eight is composed of six times eight. All the created men typified by the boards are now in resurrection. The boards signify men, who were created on the sixth day but are now in Christ, that is, in resurrection. Their number has become eight.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BARS AND THE RINGS</h2>
<p>Verses 31 through 34 speak of the bars for the boards of the tabernacle. The bars were made of the same material as the boards, that is, of acacia wood overlaid with gold. They signify the Holy Spirit as the uniting Spirit, who joins all the members of the Body into one (Eph. 4:3). The revelation of the Spirit as acacia wood overlaid with gold is very deep. With the Spirit, there is the divine nature and there is also the human nature. The Spirit of God before the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation was different from the Spirit after the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation. Before the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, the Spirit was mainly the Spirit of God (Gen. 1:2). With the Spirit of God, there was only the divine nature. But after the incarnation, the resurrection, and the ascension of Christ, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, is now the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9). Christ has not only the divine nature but also the human nature. Therefore, the Spirit of this Christ is the Spirit with two natures, the divine nature and the human nature mingled together.</p>
<p>John 7:38-39 says, &ldquo;He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; At the time the Lord spoke this word, the Spirit had not yet come. On the one hand, the Spirit in the Old Testament had come already. Many times the Spirit of Jehovah came to visit people (Judg. 6:34; 14:5-6, 19; 1 Sam. 11:6; 16:13; 2 Chron. 24:20). But the Spirit of Christ, at the time when the Lord Jesus spoke this word, had not yet come. The Spirit of Jehovah was the Spirit with the divine nature, but without the human nature. But after the resurrection, the Spirit of Christ comes with two natures, the divine nature and the human nature. As a type of the Spirit, the bars in the tabernacle were of two materials, wood overlaid with gold.</p>
<p>Exodus 36:31 and 32 say that the bars were divided into three groups of five, one on the south side, one on the north side, and one on the rear side. Verse 33 goes on to say, &ldquo;And he made the middle bar to pass through in the center of the boards from end to end.&rdquo; By these three verses we may infer that there were five bars in three lines on each side. On each side, the middle bar reached from end to end in one line. The lines of bars above and below the middle bar each were made of two bars, two pieces. Two bars formed the first line, one bar from end to end was the second line, and two bars formed the last line. Three lines were composed of five bars. The middle bar was twice the length of the other bars, providing balance. If the middle bar had been in two pieces, there would have been a weakness at the center of the wall and the two halves of each side would have been without balance.</p>
<p>Here again are the numbers three and five, with the three groups of five bars signifying the Spirit of the Triune God to take the responsibility for God&rsquo;s building. The Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit with the two natures&mdash;the divine nature and the human nature&mdash;bears the responsibility for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>Verse 34 says, &ldquo;And he overlaid the boards with gold and made their rings of gold as holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.&rdquo; The golden rings represent the joining strength of the Holy Spirit (Eph. 4:3). The forty-eight boards were joined together not by themselves but absolutely by the gold. If the gold were to be removed from the forty-eight standing boards, they would all be separated from each other. They were joined together in the gold. Each board was overlaid with gold, on the gold there were the golden rings, and within the golden rings there were the golden bars. The oneness of all the believers in the Body is in the divine nature. If we are not living in the divine nature and life of Christ, we are separated from one another. We can be one only in Christ, in the divine nature and in the divine life. Without the gold, the boards would have been separated from each other, but in the gold they were joined together.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PILLARS, THE VEIL, AND THE SCREEN</h2>
<p>Exodus 36:35-38 speaks concerning the pillars in the tabernacle which supported the veil and the screen. The inner veil separated the Holy of Holies from the Holy Place. The screen, or the outer veil, on the other hand, was at the door of the tabernacle separating the outer court from the Holy Place. The veil was upon four pillars, made with the same materials as the boards and the bars, acacia wood overlaid with gold, and were based on four silver sockets. The screen was upon five pillars of acacia wood overlaid with gold, but was based on bronze sockets. The inner entrance to God&rsquo;s building was based on the redemption which Christ accomplished, while the judgments, trials, tests, and temptations suffered by Christ formed the base of the outer entrance.</p>
<p>At the screen, there were four entrances formed by five pillars. Four refers to man as the leading one of the creatures. The entrance of the tabernacle, the dwelling place and building of God, is toward man. All men as redeemed creatures may enter in through this entrance. At the veil, the inner entrance, four pillars formed three entrances. The inner entrance represents the Triune God, signified by the number three. By passing through the screen and the veil, the creatures come into the Triune God. The numbers four and three may be added to form seven. They may also be multiplied to form twelve. These two numbers, seven and twelve, are the main numbers of the book of Revelation. In chapter 1 of Revelation there are the seven churches (vv. 12, 20), and in chapter 21 there is the number twelve, the number of the New Jerusalem (vv. 12-21). Those who enter the tabernacle are according to the number seven, but in the New Jerusalem they will be according to the number twelve.</p>
<p>The first entrance into the tabernacle is characterized by the number four, and the second entrance, by the number three. The building of God is open to man as a redeemed creature. When he comes into the tabernacle, he meets the three inner entrances, signifying the Triune God, so that he may enter into the Triune God.</p>
<p>Upon the inner veil were sown the cherubim (36:35), signifying the glory of God (Heb. 9:5). However, the screen did not have the cherubim. The glory of God within the church is always concealed. It is something inward, not outward. The glory of God with His people is always concealed and can be seen only from within God&rsquo;s building.</p>
