   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CROSS-BEARING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another point about Christ which we must see is that He saved others, but He would not save Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him Matt 27:41-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be qualified for the church life we must have such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Never save yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When others put you on the cross, you must remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the right place for you to be.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let others say that you can do so many things to save others, but you cannot save yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have to say, Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the cross-bearing life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can save others, but we cannot save ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the life that bears the cross all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many times God would allow circumstances to put us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not try to escape; we should stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This cross-bearing life is the life that is good for the church building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So many husbands are just the cross to the wives, and the wives are the emotional crosses to the husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many times the husbands are crucified by the wives emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But thank the Lord we have so many crosses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The husbands are the crosses to the wives, and the wives are crosses to the husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We don t need to buy a cross; the Lord has prepared a lot of crosses for us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let others say that we can save others, but we cannot save ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is right.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The life of Jesus is such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By His life we can save others, but we cannot save ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But, praise the Lord, the cross brings in the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is on the other side of the cross, not on this side.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we stay on this side of the cross, we will miss Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we would reach Christ, surely we must pass through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the other side of the cross, we have the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE PROCESSED GOD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To reach the resurrected Christ, we have traveled from chapter one to chapter twenty-eight of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before the incarnation in chapter one, the promise of the seed of the woman traveled four thousand years from Genesis 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then the seed of woman came in chapter one and from chapter one to twenty-eight, He was fully processed to become the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now He is no longer just God, but the God who has traveled through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, burial, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is God, plus so many items.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is God, who after being made flesh took a further step by death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The resurrected Christ is the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before the incarnation He was the raw God, but now He has been fully processed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For God to be incarnated was a real process.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For Him to live thirty-three and a half years on this earth, raised by a poor family, persecuted by religion, and finally crucified on a cross was also a real process.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then He passed through death and went into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By resurrection He was fully processed to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After He had been fully processed, the Lord came to the disciples and said, All authority is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit Matt 28:18-19, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>. Today we must preach the gospel with such an authorization.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have been authorized to disciple the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we must baptize them into the name of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Galatians 3:27, Paul says that as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we compare this verse with Matthew 28:19, we can see that to be baptized into the Triune God is to be baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This Christ into Whom we have been baptized is the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit is just the processed God for us to participate in. We all have been baptized into such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When I was young I tried to discover how I could get into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Bible told me that I was baptized into Christ and that I was in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But I was also taught that after His resurrection, Christ ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He was there, and I was here.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How could I be in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I was told that it was through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But what does that mean?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then after years of studying the Word and experiencing Christ as life, we found the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yes, Jesus is in the heavens, but both Ephesians 1:23 and 4:10 tell us that Christ today is filling all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The resurrected Christ fills the heavens and the surface of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now He is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>So we must be baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is why baptism should not be a formality, but a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we baptize others, we must exercise our faith to realize that we are putting them into Christ, the life-giving Spirit, the Triune God.</S>
