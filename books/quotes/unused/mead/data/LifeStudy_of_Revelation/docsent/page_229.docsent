   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. No More Sea</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 1 also says, And the sea is no more.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The sea is the result of the waters of judgment, the waters which God used to judge the pre-Adamic world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>See Life-study of Genesis, Message Two.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The work of God s re-creation was to recover the land by restricting the waters which were the result of this judgment Gen 1:9-10; Jer 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The living creatures of the pre-Adamic world, after being judged by the waters, became the inhabitants of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After they are dealt with by Christ and His believers Matt 8:29-32; Luke 10:17; Acts 16:16-18; 19:12 and the sea has given them up to the judgment of the great white throne 20:13 , there will be no more need of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From the time of God s work of re-creation, God has intended to abolish the sea by dealing with Satan and his demons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, to say the sea is no more indicates that Satan and his evil followers have all been dealt with and will not be found in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>FORMER THINGS BEING NOT REMEMBERED</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Isaiah 65:17 says, For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we see that the former things will not be remembered.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God has a great ability to forget.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>REMAINING FOREVER</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The new heaven and the new earth will remain before the eternal God, that is, remain forever Isa 66:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To remain forever means to remain for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>V. RIGHTEOUSNESS DWELLING</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>IN THE NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second Peter 3:13 says, But according to His promise we are expecting new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we see that righteousness will dwell in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that everything will be right, proper, and fitting and that there will be no more friction.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>COMING DOWN TO THE NEW EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 2 says, And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The New Jerusalem will come down to the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After all God s redeemed saints have been raptured to the heavens, they will be in the New Jerusalem, which will come down out of heaven from God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that our dwelling place for eternity will not be heaven, but will be the New Jerusalem on the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The New Jerusalem will come down as the Bride for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that the New Jerusalem is not a material city; she is a corporate person, the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This city will also be the tabernacle of God for His dwelling with man v. 3 . To Christ, this new city will be the Bride for His satisfaction; to God, it will be the tabernacle in which He will dwell and through which He will express Himself.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 3 says, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be His peoples, and God Himself shall be with them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The peoples in this verse will be the nations in verse 24.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There will be several peoples, and each corporate people will be a nation on the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These nations which will surround the New Jerusalem will be restored, but they will not be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that time, their rebellious nature will have been purged away.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the restored and purged nations, they will live outside the New Jerusalem and they will enjoy the common blessings in the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These common blessings are mentioned in verse 4: And He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more; nor sorrow, nor crying, nor pain they shall be no more; for the former things have passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the new heaven and new earth there will be no tears, no death, no sorrow, no crying, and no pain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the new heaven and new earth there will be full satisfaction and rest; there will be no more cause for tears.</S>
