	 <h2 class="head2">Taking Heed to the Help That We Receive<br />
and the Words That We Preach</h2>
<p>The brothers who minister the word need to see that the word as the utterance of God is spirit and life and that God enters into man to be man&rsquo;s life. The messages that we preach have to be controlled by this vision. We should not give messages that draw out people&rsquo;s curiosity. We should also consider the kind of help that we receive from reference books. Do they help us give messages along the line of God being life to man? Or do they merely help us give messages on how to improve our outward behavior? If our messages only sustain the second kind of help, we should reject them because they are from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, not the tree of life.</p>
<p>In the Gospels a Canaanite woman asked the Lord for the crumbs that fell from the table (Matt. 15:21-28; Mark 7:24-30). A book that was based on the Canaanite woman said that the Lord Jesus and His salvation are not only for the Jews but also for the Gentiles and that Jesus cared for the Canaanite woman even though He is the Son of David. This book included references to verses in the Old Testament that speak of the Gentiles and verses from the New Testament that speak of the salvation of the Gentiles. The author gave a logical presentation to prove that the Lord Jesus is the Savior not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles. He used the story concerning the Canaanite woman to develop a great truth in the Bible. A message that merely repeats everything from this book, however, is from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. It will not have the controlling factor of the tree of life.</p>
<p>What type of response does this book produce in us? We should never think that simply because a message refers to content in the Bible that it is related to life. Some brothers respond to whatever they read, even if it belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. We have to respond in a discerning way.</p>
<p>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil indicates that good and evil cannot be separated from knowledge. What we minister must be controlled by a vision of the tree of life. A message that does not have this vision is in the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If we have a vision of the tree of life, we will know that the focal point of the incident with the Canaanite woman is related to the Lord as the bread of life for man to eat and have life. It is not about His caring for the Gentiles. The book I previously spoke of said that the Lord Jesus as the Son of David had become the light of the Gentiles. It also explained from the Old Testament and the New Testament that the Lord is the Savior of the Jews and the Gentiles. However, it did not say that He is bread for us to take in as our life.</p>
<p>The brothers who minister the word must be able to discern. We may have the desire to feed the saints, but if our messages lack life, they will poison the saints. According to my observation many of the brothers&rsquo; preaching is similar to the situation described in 2 Kings 4. There was a famine in the land and no food was available. An attendant of the prophet Elisha went out into the field to gather herbs, and he found a wild vine and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and he cut them up into the pot of stew. The disciples of the prophet ate and were poisoned (vv. 38-40). I am always concerned that when we are short of messages of life and the brothers and sisters are hungry, some &ldquo;attendants of the prophet&rdquo; will go out and find some &ldquo;wild gourds.&rdquo; These wild gourds do not necessarily look dangerous. There is nothing seemingly wrong with a message about the Lord Jesus being the Savior of the Jews and the Gentiles, but it can be compared to the wild gourds in 2 Kings 4:38-40. It does not give life. The story of the Canaanite woman does not focus on the Lord being the Savior of the Jews or the Savior of the Gentiles. People called the Lord the Son of David, but He said that He is the children&rsquo;s bread (Matt. 15:26). He did not come to be a king. He wants to be man&rsquo;s food; He wants to enter into man in order to be man&rsquo;s salvation. The purpose of the incident with the Canaanite woman is to reveal that the Lord is the bread of life.</p>
<p>I once gave a message during the Sino-Japanese War based on the Canaanite woman. I said that the woman received grace because she took the position of a dog to eat the crumbs that fell from the table. The saints were touched and saw that they should take the position of a dog. Looking back on that message, I must condemn myself. The Lord did not want me to speak concerning taking the position of a dog but to speak concerning His being bread. That message did not give the saints the divine life.</p>
<p>I could speak such a word twenty years ago because I did not have this vision. Many saints responded to that message and understood the matter of being in the position of a dog. The Canaanite woman stood on the Lord&rsquo;s word concerning being a dog; therefore, the Lord had to save her and heal her daughter. He was bound by His word. However, in that portion the Lord Jesus revealed that He is bread for us to eat. A message based on the Canaanite woman should focus on the Lord as bread. This is the word of life that will supply the saints. The brothers who minister the word must learn to discern whether a message or a book is from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil or whether it is from the tree of life. Then we will not give the saints wild gourds to eat.</p>
<p>Some may feel that they are unique in their expounding of the Bible, that their way of expounding cannot even be found in our books. However, this new speaking will be harmful to the saints because it does not have life. Every message must be God and focus on God as man&rsquo;s life. Every message should be controlled and measured by this principle. Someone may use Romans 12:11 to give a message about being fervent for the Lord. However, Romans 12 is the issue of the preceding eleven chapters. In 7:18 Paul said, &ldquo;To will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.&rdquo; This shows that it is of no use to exhort the saints to be fervent, because we cannot determine to be fervent. Chapter 8 shows the Spirit of life in verse 2, and it says that those who are &ldquo;led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God&rdquo; (v. 14). This is a matter of being led by the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot say that the saints need to be fervent based only on Romans 12. This is based on the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The tree of life must be our controlling factor, whether we speak concerning prayer, our daily walk, or working zealously for the Lord. We must speak from the tree of life and say that God enters into us to be our life. This is the way to minister the word. Anything that is not out of life is from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. We need to see this controlling factor.</p>
<p>The only thing that matters in the universe is that God wants to be man&rsquo;s food. This is the source of everything in our Christian life. All our activities are the result of this. God is in us to be our food and our life. We must see this vision.</p>
<p>We often say that God is life and that He enters into us to be our life. However, because we do not see this vision, we do not speak concerning this in our messages, nor do we help the saints to see this. Those who minister the word must see that the church needs the supply of life, words of life, not the interpretation of doctrines. The ministry of the word is to supply the saints with God as the Spirit of life. The word that is spoken must be spirit and life. This causes the saints to touch God. This is the urgent need in the churches today. The churches are weak because there is a lack in the word of life.</p>
