   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD ENTERING INTO HIS BELIEVERS AS THEIR LIFE AFTER HIS RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the day of the Lord Jesus' resurrection, the eleven disciples were in a house, and the doors were shut.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suddenly, the Lord Jesus appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After His resurrection He intentionally appeared to the disciples to show them that He was no longer limited by time or space.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The disciples were in the house, and the doors were shut, but He was not limited by those things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was because He had already transcended all those things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the one hand, He is over all, while on the other hand, He is in all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever someone believes into His name and calls upon His name, He enters into him to be his life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Acts, when we see Paul, Peter, John, and Stephen, we cannot but worship the Lord, because He as the only grain had died and already borne much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is Christ, the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through His death and resurrection, everyone who believes in Him receives His life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, everyone who believes in Him is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul, Peter, John, and Stephen were all Christ because His life was in them, and He Himself was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE MULTIPLICATION OF CHRISTIANS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose that in the beginning there was only one seed of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After this seed is sown into the ground, it dies, yet some time later it grows up and becomes thirty seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then, after these thirty seeds are sown into the ground, they also die and later grow into nine hundred seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way after many decades the whole earth is eventually filled with wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is like the multiplication of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Christian life is afraid of ease and of being complimented.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To prevent Christians from multiplying and spreading, all that is necessary is to pay them a high compliment, offer them a high position, cause them to enjoy happiness, and make them feel at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, the more Christians are persecuted and opposed, the more they flourish.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christians do not fear men's opposition; rather, Christians fear men's praises.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Two thousand years of history show us that the more Christians are killed, the more Christians there are.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the second century, the Roman emperor gave the order to kill all the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One day a Roman official presented a letter to the emperor, saying that there would be no more people in the city of Rome if the killing continued.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why was this?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was because everyone believed in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What was the process that God's life went through to enter into man and be released out of man?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The life of God was in Christ originally, but there was only one Christ in the flesh Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Jesus the Nazarene was in Galilee, He could not be in the land of Judea; when He was in the land of Judea, He could not be in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was One who was restricted in the flesh, but one day He died.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From the human perspective death is pitiful, yet in the eyes of Christ death was glorious, because after His death He transcended time, space, and every kind of bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, from the day of His resurrection, His life entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Acts, Peter and the other apostles testified for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their testimony was the testimony of the Lord's resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At that time Roman politics, Greek philosophy, and Jewish religion had no way to deal with Peter and the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They testified, saying, "The God of our fathers has raised Jesus, whom you slew by hanging Him on a tree" 5:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After the Lord's resurrection they brought three thousand people to be saved on one day 2:41 , and five thousand on another day 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Sanhedrin wanted to arrest them, but they said, "It is necessary to obey God rather than men" 5:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the life of the Lord Jesus entered into them, the entire Roman Empire, Greek philosophy, plus the Jewish religion were not able to put them down.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the immensity of the power brought forth through the resurrection life of Christ.</S>
