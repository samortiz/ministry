<h2 class="head1">ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The General Meeting on Lord&rsquo;s Day Mornings</h2>
<p>Even though we changed the system, we still consider the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meetings to be important. We hope that all the churches will have a general meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. In this general meeting a particular and weighty message should be given for the benefit of all and to attract people. We emphasize this matter because some of the older brothers and sisters, who have been meeting with us for a long time, cannot get used to the district meetings or even to the small groups, and we cannot force them to like these meetings. For the sake of these brothers and sisters we need a meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. However, this meeting must not become a routine; it must be proper and weighty. We should look to the Lord concerning how to conduct this meeting. Even though the carrying out of this meeting will depend on the situation and capacity of each locality, we should continue to hold it on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. We cannot stop the general big meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day simply because we changed the system.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Meetings for <em>Truth Lessons</em></h2>
<p>The church is the pillar and base of the truth (1 Tim. 3:15); hence, every believer should pursue the truth. Every believer should also know the truth because God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth (2:4). According to the teaching of the Bible, we are obligated to teach the truth to the brothers and sisters. In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord charged us, saying, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age&rdquo; (28:19-20). Therefore, teaching the truth is a crucial matter. We must confess that in the past we did not teach the truth sufficiently. Even though we paid attention to this matter, we were not detailed or focused in our emphasis. After many years of experience, we confess that we have lost much grace and blessing in this matter.</p>
<p>In order to aid the change in the system, we have published <em>Truth Lessons.</em> These lessons should not be spoken as ordinary messages; rather, they should be presented in the way of education, because they contain biblical truths. These lessons should be taught to the saints in sequence. After a few lessons, the saints will get a taste for the lessons. The special feature of <em>Truth Lessons</em> is that they do not touch one topic here and then mention another topic. Rather, they are like an educational course compiled in a systematic way to be taught to the saints step by step.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Revelation of the Truth Being Progressive</h2>
<p>When we read <em>Truth Lessons,</em> there are some matters concerning the revelation of the truth that we must know. When the Roman emperor Constantine called the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325, only twenty books of the New Testament had been recognized as authoritative. The remaining seven books&mdash;Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, and Revelation&mdash;were recognized seventy-two years later at the Council of Carthage in A.D. 397. In this council the leaders of the churches gathered together and recognized these books as being authoritative. Hence, we have the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. Many people have been Christians for many years, but they still do not know that the New Testament has twenty-seven books.</p>
<p>Christians, including those in the Catholic Church and in major Protestant denominations, believe in a creed as well as the Bible. A creed is a set of religious beliefs. The use of the word <em>creed</em> was determined at the Council of Nicaea. Constantine the Great wanted to use Christianity to unite the Roman Empire because it was difficult for him to exercise his authority over His vast empire in which the people held many different concepts. However, even the Bible expositors and theologians were not united because of their opinions. Hence, Constantine used his position as emperor to make a decree ordering all the great theologians and Bible teachers to hold a council in Nicaea in A.D. 325. Constantine himself was the moderator of this council in which the theologians and Bible teachers researched and debated the truth. As a result, under the authority of the Roman Empire all the theologians and Bible teachers came to an agreement in their beliefs. This agreement was written down and became the Nicene Creed. The Nicene Creed was written before the entire New Testament was recognized in A.D. 397.</p>
<p>Catholics, Anglicans, and other Christian groups recite the Nicene Creed every Lord&rsquo;s Day. This creed, however, does not speak of the seven Spirits. The most important part of any book is its conclusion, regardless of what the book expounds or reveals. The Bible also has a conclusion. It begins with the book of Genesis and concludes with the book of Revelation. The book of Revelation speaks of the seven Spirits; hence, without the book of Revelation the other sixty-five books of the Bible do not have a conclusion.</p>
