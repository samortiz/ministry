   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN EXAMPLES OF REBELLION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE OLD TESTAMENT Date:June 21, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Kuling Mountain</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading:Lev 10:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Watchman Nee: Lord, You are God from eternity to eternity, and it is foolish for man to boast and exalt himself before You.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Vain men will bow down at Your feet one day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We acknowledge our human finitude and worthlessness, but if You will stretch forth Your hand, all of our problems will be solved, and You will have a way through us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are unclean, and we dwell among those who are unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are too weak to climb up by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Unless You move Your hand, everything we do is in vain, and our building is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>May You lead us to a fuller knowledge of Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Grant us the light and the revelation to see You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The evening before last we saw that sin is lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Greek the word is anomia, which means to be without law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To sin is to be without law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today I hope you will see the significance of this definition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word lawlessness is used in the Bible seventeen or eighteen times.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is, for example, used in 1 John 3:4.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In studying the Bible it is sometimes convenient to coin a single definition for a word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, we can give definitions to each of the words light, life, death, etc. First John 3:4 gives "lawlessness" as the definition of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To sin is to trespass against the law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we tell this to others, they may not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They may not agree that sin is lawlessness or a trespass against the law, but Romans 2:12 says, "For as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who sin without the law anomos shall also perish without the law anomos .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word lawlessness in 1 John 3:4 comes from the same word as the expression without the law in Romans 2:12 in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both are anomia.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The prefix a- means to be without, and nomos means the law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Together the word means to be lawless.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Most people think that a person sins when he breaks the law and that he has not sinned if he has not broken the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But this is not according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible says that to sin is to be without the law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Romans 2 says that those who sin without the law shall perish without the law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the meaning of sin is lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A man sins when he walks according to his self-will and rebels against God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many brothers and sisters have heard this word from us for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must, however, repeat it again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who do good according to their own flesh do not please God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even if a man's conduct is approved, his very person is condemned as long as he acts according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people do not see the reason for this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Man is condemned for doing good because this good is not performed under God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sin means to act presumptuously.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a man does not come under authority, he sins even when his conduct is good.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In God's eyes all goodness performed by self-will is lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God is not concerned with the number of sheep and cattle and the amount of fat that man offers to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He demands obedience and submission.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Obedience and submission are man's responses to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sacrifice, however, can be a response to the Lord, or it can be a response to self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Submission is denying the self and setting it aside.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Submission is absolute, but sacrifice is not.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A man may want to offer a sacrifice, but this desire may be a resolution of the self for the satisfaction of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to see what sin is.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sin is man acting according to his own nature and deliberation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sin has nothing to do with whether or not this nature and deliberation are evil.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In God's eyes a man sins when he acts according to his own nature and deliberation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This principle has underlined all human action throughout the six thousand years of human history.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many people say that they are acting out of good intention, but they do not realize how much lawlessness is behind these acts.</S>
