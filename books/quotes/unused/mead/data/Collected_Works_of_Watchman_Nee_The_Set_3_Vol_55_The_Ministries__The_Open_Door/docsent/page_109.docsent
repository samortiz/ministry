   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Recently some outside publications have criticized our testimony and attacked our co-worker, Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have remained silent about these publications because we do not like to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the one hand, we wanted to learn the lessons before the Lord, and on the other hand, we wanted to allow the Lord Himself to vindicate us.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would always fear Him!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With respect to the person of Brother Watchman Nee, however, we can testify in one accord before the Lord that he is one of God's faithful servants.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although he engages in some form of business, his goal has never been to gain anything for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are all in one accord with him in the matter of the truth, in the matter of the service, and in the matter of his business.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The editor of the former Last Days Magazine it is now called The Christian Digest has always been a pastor in a denomination, so he naturally carries the tendencies of his background.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The article entitled "Hastening the Lord's Coming," which appeared in the fourth issue of that magazine, was written by me as a favor to a friend.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have always condemned sectarianism according to God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am writing this explanation because the brothers and sisters from many places have written to inquire about the matter.</S>
