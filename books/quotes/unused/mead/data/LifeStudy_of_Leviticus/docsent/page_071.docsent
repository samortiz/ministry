   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE EFFICACY OF THE SIN OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The efficacy of the sin offering is not just in the fact that it deals with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The result is far greater.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the sin offering, the fallen man, the old man, included in the flesh of Christ, is dealt with Rom 6:6 ; sin in the nature of fallen man is condemned Rom 8:3 ; Satan, sin itself, is destroyed Heb 2:14 ; the world is judged; and the prince of the world is cast out John 12:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the revelation in the holy Word concerning the efficacy of the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we see this revelation, we will see that taking Christ as our sin offering is not simply a matter of confessing our sin and having it dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Taking Christ as our sin offering also means that our old man, Satan, the world, and the struggle for power are dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since all these things are included in the sin offering, taking Christ as our sin offering is not a simple matter but a matter that involves the fallen man, sin in the nature of fallen man, Satan, the world, and the struggle for power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>III.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This signifies that Christ as the sin offering is experienced by different people in different degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Himself as the sin offering, Christ does not differ in size.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is always the same.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, our realization, presentation, and application of Christ as the sin offering may differ in degree.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The size of Christ as our sin offering depends on the degree to which we take Christ as our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may take Christ as our sin offering to a lower degree or to a higher degree.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One brother may take Christ as his sin offering to deal only with his sin, not realizing that sin implies the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A second brother may realize that the sin offering implies the flesh but may not realize that it also implies dealing with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we see that as long as sin dwells in us, the flesh, Satan, the world, and the struggle for power are also present, we can offer Christ as a large bull.</S>
