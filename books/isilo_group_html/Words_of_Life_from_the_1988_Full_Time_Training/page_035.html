STANDING BY AND RELYING ON THE LORD</h2>
<p>The Lord sent us to Taiwan in 1949, and we formally began the work in August of that year. We were as one man in the first few years. The gospel was prevailing everywhere we went. The number of saints was multiplied a hundredfold. However, this wonderful situation lasted only six to seven years. Problems soon came. In the ten years between 1956 and 1966, there was a big storm among us, bringing in no small difficulty and frustration. Then three years of peace came in 1968 through 1970. By then the Lord&rsquo;s recovery had already spread to the Western world. For more than ten years, the churches in both the East and West were quite stable and were in one accord. But the storms have come again in the last two years. This may be considered as the second set of waves since the Lord&rsquo;s recovery moved from mainland China to overseas.</p>
<p>We know that the Lord Jesus and the apostles met storms while fulfilling their ministry on the earth. Furthermore, all who were used by the Lord throughout the ages also had storms along their path. According to history, there is no storm in which the Lord is not in its midst. From what I saw in Brother Nee&rsquo;s life and from my own experience, I realize one thing: everything is under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign control, and there is nothing to fear. None of these storms can defeat our Lord. Hence, we can say to the enemy who stirs up the wind and waves, &ldquo;All these have been tried on our Pioneer, the Lord Jesus, and they have failed to defeat Him. Now they will not defeat us either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young brothers and sisters, if the Lord delays His coming, your way of serving the Lord is still very long. You are being trained here, so I feel that I should give you this training lesson. You should know that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and the Lord&rsquo;s new way are God&rsquo;s ordained way according to the Bible. Our Lord has passed through it. All the Lord&rsquo;s followers throughout the generations have also walked in it. No one who follows the Lord and who is used by Him to release His ministry can avoid the same storms. &ldquo;A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his lord&rdquo; (Matt. 10:24). From the beginning I have prepared myself this way in my heart. You too should prepare yourselves.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT OF THE FAITH</h2>
<p>I believe that although my words are not so perfect, they can give you a good inoculation. You should be able to apprehend and receive them. I hope that this light will establish the goal in your way and will shine brighter as the days go by. Hence, you should pray more and go onward positively. Paul urged Timothy in 1 Timothy 6:12 to fight the good fight of the faith. Even up to the time of his death, he still charged Timothy&mdash;one he had raised up&mdash;by the Lord&rsquo;s appearing and kingdom to be faithful to fulfill his ministry of the word (2 Tim. 4:1-2, 5). The Lord&rsquo;s appearing is for judgment, to reward every one of us (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12). The Lord&rsquo;s kingdom is for Him to rule with all His overcomers (Rev. 20:4, 6). These two should be our warning, our encouragement, and the aim of our living and work.</p>
<p>Later Paul declared, &ldquo;For I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:6, 7). And again, &ldquo;The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto His heavenly kingdom&rdquo; (v. 18). This was the reward that Paul gained. It was also the testimony and encouragement he gave to Timothy. I would likewise encourage and equip you with these words. May you be one spirit and one soul, striving together in this way of warfare.</p>
