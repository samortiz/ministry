   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ Is the Creator</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is the Creator of all things Gen 1:1; 2:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since Christ is God, He surely is also the Creator of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is clearly revealed in the Scripture: O my God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of old didst thou lay the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands Psa 102:24-25, ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have seen that this word refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is God who created heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being John 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through whom are all things, and we through Him 1 Cor 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because in Him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him Col 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through whom the Son also He God made the universe Heb 1:2 .</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ Is a Creature</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man is a creature Gen 1:27; Acts 17:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since Christ is man, surely He is also a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is revealed in the following two verses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Colossians 1:15 says the Son is Firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This tells us in plain words that Christ is created.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is the Firstborn of the creation, the First of all creatures.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In some translations, the above two passages do not match the meaning in the original Greek text the Chinese Version is an example of this .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some do not understand these two passages properly; hence, they deny that Christ is created.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the original text, this translation is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Based on the proper translation, the firstborn of all creation, in 1934 Brother Watchman Nee delivered the following word: In creation the Son is the Firstborn of all creation Col 1:15 , and the beginning of the creation of God Rev 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to His eternal plan and before the foundation of the world, God ordained that the Son become flesh and accomplish redemption 1 Pet 1:20 .</S>
