<p class="bold">WEEK 4 — DAY 6</p><h2 class="uhead1">Scripture Reading</h2><p class="bold">Rom. 6:13 &nbsp;…Present yourselves to God…</p><p class="bold">Lev. 1:9 &nbsp;…Then the priest shall burn the whole [offering] on the altar, as a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.</p><h2 class="head1">The Result of Consecration</h2><p>We need to consider this matter…in the light of the offerings of the Old Testament. When a bullock was taken for sacrifice and offered upon the altar, he was immediately cut off from all his previous relationships. He was severed from his master, his companions, and his corral. After he was consumed by fire, he even lost his original form and stature. All his choicest parts were changed to a sweet-smelling savor to God, and all that was left was a heap of ashes. Everything was cut off, and everything was finished. This was the result of the bullock being offered to God. Since our consecration is also an offering to God, the result must also be the same. There must be the giving up of everything to be burned to ashes by God to the point where all is finished.…Some brothers and sisters still have hopes after their consecration of becoming such and such a person. This proves that their future has not been given up.</p><p>The future we are speaking about includes not only our future in this world, but also our future in the so-called Christian world. We all know how the world naturally attracts us and offers the hope of a future in it, but even the so-called Christian world holds an attraction to us and offers a hope of a future in it.…All these hopes, however, never exist in a consecrated person. A truly consecrated man is a man who has given up his future. He abandons not only his future in the world, but also his so-called spiritual future. He no longer has hopes for himself in anything; all his hope is in God. He lives purely and simply in the hand of God; he is what God wants him to be and does what God wants him to do. Whatever the outcome may be, he does not know and does not care. He only knows that he is a sacrifice, wholly belonging to God. The altar is forever the place where he stands, and a heap of ashes is forever the result. His future has been utterly abandoned.</p><p>This giving up of the future is not a reluctant act after something has already occurred to wreck your future hopes; it is a willing surrender before such an event.…If our consecration is not sound, sooner or later problems will arise in our service and in our spiritual condition.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, this result of abandoning all our future prospects always needs to be kept fresh within us. Never let our consecration become old. If it grows old, it is the same as if we had never consecrated ourselves. We should always be as ashes on the altar, always entirely for God to enjoy, always without any future.<sup>100</sup></p><h2 class="head1">A Concluding Word</h2><p>We must realize that it is not possible to hit the climax of any experience of life by experiencing it just once. We need to pursue continuously, so that our experience will increase gradually and become fuller, until it reaches the stage of maturity.</p><p>When we first consecrate ourselves, our experience is similar to an embryo in the mother’s womb—one cannot distinguish the ear, the eye, the mouth, and the nose. As we grow in life, however, these five points related to the experience of consecration gradually become formed in us. Then we really have a feeling that we have been bought by God and that all our rights are in His hand. We become a prisoner of His love because His love has pierced our hearts. We become a sacrifice indeed, laid on the altar for God’s enjoyment and satisfaction. We will be those who have been thoroughly worked over by God and are then able to work for Him. Our future will truly be as a handful of ashes. All our ways of escape outside of God’s will shall have been cut off; God only will be our future and our way. At that time the experience of our consecration will indeed have become matured. May we all, by the grace of the Lord, pursue and go on together.<sup>101</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
