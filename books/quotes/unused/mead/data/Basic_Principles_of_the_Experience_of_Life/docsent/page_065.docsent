   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN TRANSFORMATION 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 10:5; Eph 1:18; 4:22-24; 1 Cor 2:16; 1 Pet 1:23; 2:2, 4-5; James 1:21; Matt 16:25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we saw in the previous chapter, we experience three matters as part of a process.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are release from sin, sanctification, and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people call release from sin "victory over sin."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, we cannot find such a term in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead, Romans 6:18 and 22 speak of release, or freedom, from sin and the slavery of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After we are regenerated, we must experience the release, the freedom, from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 6 also tells us that sanctification follows our release from sin vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>19, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One aspect of sanctification is separation from the world, from all things other than God unto God, while another aspect of sanctification involves a transformation in disposition, which is more subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we pointed out before, we may be released from sin yet still not experience our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In relation to many things we still may be in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our experience we may not have been separated from the worldly things unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be set free from sin is one thing, but to be separated from the world is another.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must deal with sin, and we must deal with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To deal with sin is to be set free from it, while to deal with the world is to be separated from it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may illustrate this with a cup which is dirty and is sitting under a table.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before we use the cup, we must cleanse it and free it from all the dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, in addition to being dirty, it is also in the wrong position.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Besides cleansing the cup, we must move it from its old position to a new position so that it can be used.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a picture of positional sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Matthew 23:17 and 19 say that gold is sanctified by the temple and the offerings are sanctified by the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When gold is outside the temple, it is common and worldly, but if the gold is separated and brought into the temple, it is sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, when cattle remain in the herd, they are common and worldly, but if we separate one of the cattle and put it on the altar, it is sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a change of position.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sanctification, in this sense, is positional; it is a separation from the world unto God, but we experience our change of position by dealing with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>TRANSFORMATION BEING A CHANGE IN NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, we may be separated from the world but not transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The cup in the prior illustration has been cleansed and moved to a new position.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, it has no change in its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The cup may be made of opaque clay, but if it is transformed into glass, it will be transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The gold and the precious stones in the New Jerusalem are transparent, like clear glass Rev 21:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the New Jerusalem, God is the light, and the Lord Jesus as the Lamb is the lamp v. 23 . If the materials of the city were not transparent, how could the light shine through them? This indicates the need of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Transformation is not a matter of a change in position.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a matter of a change in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After sanctification, we need transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is regrettable that in Christianity very little has been taught about transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is hard to find an article or message dealing with transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the Scriptures clearly and definitely speak about it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, "But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord is the Spirit v. 17 , and the Spirit is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is by the Lord as the Spirit that we are being transformed from glory to glory into the Lord's image.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>TRANSFORMATION TAKING PLACE IN OUR SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we know, man is of three parts spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We were regenerated, born of God, in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our spirit was renewed and became a new spirit at the time we believed in the Lord Jesus Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>36:26 , but from that time, the work of God's salvation is to transform our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After being regenerated, we must be transformed in the three parts of our soul the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then when the Lord comes back, our body will be redeemed, changed, transfigured, from a body of humiliation to a body of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, regeneration is in our spirit, transformation is in our soul, and transfiguration is in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the time we believe into Christ, we are regenerated, and at the time the Lord comes back, we will be transfigured in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Between these two, there is the process of transformation, which is accomplished in our soul.</S>
