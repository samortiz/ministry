Business was suspended because of the air raids. In the middle of the month, most of the people moved out because of the rumors. Six of my colleagues and I went to take refuge in Ning-Po for a week. I left for Shanghai on the twenty-fifth and arrived on the twenty-sixth. I have been here for ten days. I met with Sister Miao and Sister Tso and learned that you, your wife, and Sister Jing-huai had gone to live in Hong Kong temporarily. This comforted me. Miss Tso tried to get me a job in the business management section of Dr. Stearn's new Paralytic Hospital. I heard that Dr. Stearn said I can do it for a short time, so I now have a temporary job. I am sending you this quick letter because I have to rely on the Lord more, not because I have lost my job. You do not need to worry about me. The future of the oil industry is up in the air. If this continues for a long time, it will be difficult to keep a job. I hope you will pray for me. I do not know how long I will stay here. All the brothers in Shaohsin have lost their jobs. Some in Shanghai have lost theirs as well. May the Lord provide. The brothers and sisters left in Hangchow are Ruan Chi-yu, Mrs. Ruan and their baby, Brother and Sister Ah-lai, Brother Lee Kwei-sien, Brother Huang Tsai-ching, and his old mother. May the Lord protect us. Brother Ma entrusted the utensils used for the table meeting to Brother Ruan before he left. The second time I returned to Hangchow, I also broke bread at the Ruan's house. Brothers Chiu, Ma, Ming-jing, Lin, Kwei, and Shih were in Jin-Hwa on the seventh of last month. Brother Jun-dao and Hao-ran are in Lan-Si. I do not know where the elderly Brother Hu from Lan-Si is. I do not know whether my family has left Lan-Si. Brother Kuang-hua and his wife have arrived in Shanghai. There was a fellowship meeting for brothers and sisters at Wen-teh Lane on January 1 which I also attended. There was a children's meeting last night. The Lord showed me His glory in the little boys and girls, and I was very delighted. Brother Chao Shih-guang preaches the gospel on the sixth floor of the Da-Sin Company. I went with Brother Kwang-rong yesterday afternoon to attend. There were two thousand people in the audience. The message was full of the power of the Holy Spirit. I also attended a Bible study yesterday with Brother Kwang-rong. I have already tracked down Miss Tso's younger sister. I sent her news in another letter, but I knew that you would worry. Therefore, I thought I should mention it. Health and peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Yang-teh<br />January 4</p><p>(I am temporarily staying in the Fang's home at 87 Ai Lai Ke Road in the French Concession. Although there is no work to do, I still go to the Mei Fu Company Headquarters at 94 Canton Road every day.)</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>I left Hong Kong on the twenty-third and was led by the Lord the entire way. I arrived safely in Shanghai on the twenty-eighth. Yesterday I received your letter of the twenty-fourth which was forwarded from Hong Kong. Thank you for your care in the Lord. I really beg the Lord that I may know Him more, that I may learn to spend my remaining time more watchfully, and that I may be more godly in my living. Please pray for me. I ask the Lord to guide me as to which road I should take in my future so that I might remain in His ordained will and never veer from His will. I do not want to choose the broad way of my own will. I only want the Lord to gain something and the Lord's will to be done. I also deeply believe that the Lord will accomplish my heart's desire for Him. Sister Li Li-ying has an intestinal infection. It is very serious. Please pray for her. She almost died a few days ago. God has heard my prayer recently, and she is somewhat better. However, she is still unconscious. Sister Shen Shi-hua's mother had a stroke, but she is better now. Peace in the Lord. Please greet Sister Chang, Sister Wang, and Mrs. Yuan. Greet Brother Yu-chih also.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Fu-ru<br />January 6</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
