<h2 class="head1">METHODS AND TEACHINGS BEING REGULATIONS WITHOUT THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Without the Spirit&rsquo;s entering into us, any method or teaching is an empty and dead regulation. Thirty years ago in Chefoo some sisters who loved the Lord read <em>Sweet Smelling Myrrh,</em> an autobiography of Madame Guyon, and wanted to be like her. Some of them learned to do things slowly, such as walking, sitting down, and talking. Some brothers also followed them. Their laborious and poor imitation was only a picture.</p>
<p>Some people say that the book <em>The Imitation of Christ</em> by Thomas &#224; Kempis is helpful. However, an imitation of Christ is an imitation; seventy percent of this book consists of human effort. The Lord said, &ldquo;You search the Scriptures...Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life&rdquo; (John 5:39-40). If man only imitates and does not contact Christ, the writings of Madame Guyon and Thomas &#224; Kempis or even the Bible will not help.</p>
<p>For many years I wondered why the words of the Bible often seem ineffective. The prophecies of the Bible were effective and fulfilled in history, but most of the words concerning sanctification and overcoming sin seem to be ineffective. For example, the Bible says, &ldquo;If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:17). However, in our experience there are not too many days in which the old creation has passed away and everything has become new. The seeming ineffectiveness of the Bible was puzzling to me. This &ldquo;ineffectiveness,&rdquo; however, was not related to the Bible itself but to my receiving of the Bible as regulations.</p>
<p>From a young age I have loved to read the Bible and spiritual publications. I did my best to buy and read every good spiritual publication, such as publications on how to pray and how to be holy. Even though I thought that these publications were quite good, what I learned was ineffective after several days. The Bible says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). About three months after I was saved, I read a spiritual publication on our co-crucifixion with Christ, but I could not die. Therefore, I read more publications until I read an article by Brother Nee. At that time, Brother Nee and other believers said that we must &ldquo;reckon&rdquo; ourselves to be dead (Rom. 6:11). Brother Nee even translated into Chinese a hymn by A. B. Simpson: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little word that the Lord has giv&rsquo;n... / Let us reckon ourselves to be dead to sin... / Let us reckon... / Let us reckon, rather than feel; / Let us be true to the reck&rsquo;ning, / And He will make it real&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #692). According to this article, I reckoned for a long time without any result. This shows that methods do not work. Methods can be compared to pictures. Even the reckoning taught by A. B. Simpson is a picture.</p>
<p>The content of the Bible is just a picture, but the Triune God has passed through many processes to become the Spirit. When the Spirit comes, there is reality. Without the Spirit everything is a picture with no reality. In some trainings in 1953 and 1954 I spoke on many topics concerning the spiritual life. Afterward, we published two books, <em>The Knowledge of Life</em> and <em>The Experience of Life.</em> Many saints treasure these two books; however, if we live according to these two books without contacting the Spirit, we will still have only a picture. Understanding the Bible is not life. Imitating Madame Guyon is not life. Closely following the book <em>The Experience of Life</em> is not life. Life is the Spirit; hence, we must touch, contact, the Spirit. Theory, doctrines, and pictures cannot replace the Spirit.</p>
<p>We cannot boast of seniority in spiritual matters. I cannot say that because I have seventy-five years of breathing experience, I can therefore take a break from breathing. No one can take a break from breathing. In regard to breathing, a seventy-five-year-old man is like a newborn babe; if he does not breathe, he will expire. An elderly, experienced man and a newborn babe must breathe, that is, contact fresh air with their breathing organ; otherwise, they will not have life. This also applies to exercising our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BELIEVERS SELDOM LIVING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We had a problem in the United States that affected some people. Later the Lord showed me the cause of the problem. The Lord told me, &ldquo;You have the Word, but you do not have Me. You have light, but you do not have the Spirit. You have revelation, but you do not have life.&rdquo; We may defend ourselves and say that we are living. However, we may merely have a way of being living to which we are accustomed. In the church we have a set way of having the church life, but this way is not the living out of life. In the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we do not go to movie theaters, yet we do not live in the spirit and contact the Lord every moment to be one spirit with the Lord. </p>
<p>We may say that the Lord is our life, but we are probably far away from life for twenty-two hours every day. There are twenty-four hours in a day. If we subtract eight hours for sleep, we have sixteen hours. We would be top Christians if we would live in the Lord and be one with Him for one and a half hours out of the sixteen hours. The saints in the churches love the Lord and have a pure heart to pursue Him. But we must ask ourselves, How often are we joined to the Lord as one spirit in our eating, grooming, speaking, interacting with others, and handling of our affairs? Based on my calculation, we should bow our heads and say, &ldquo;Lord, our church life is but a routine; it is a picture without reality.&rdquo;</p>
