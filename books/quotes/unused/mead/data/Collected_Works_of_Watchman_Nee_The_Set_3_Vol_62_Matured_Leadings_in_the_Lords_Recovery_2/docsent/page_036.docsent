   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE 5 Date:Morning, February 25 ?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee THE NEED OF HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AND THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THESE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Watchman Nee: I would like to say something about the meetings of the church in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suitable homes should be located within each district for conducting these meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Meeting in the homes is a practice recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Peter was in prison, the church prayed earnestly for him Acts 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time the number in the entire church in Jerusalem was very big.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They did not gather in one place to pray but prayed in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Peter came out of prison, he had to "consider" 12:12, KJV which home he should go to before proceeding to the house of Mary the mother of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many were gathered together to pray there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shows that there were many homes that he could go to at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the reason Peter had to consider before deciding which house to go to.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At Pentecost over three thousand people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Day by day, they continued steadfastly with one accord in the temple and broke bread from house to house Acts 2:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Due to their great number, the believers met regularly from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They met in the temple only when they all needed to gather together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Other than these times, the brothers and sisters assembled in different homes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of course, we have to be on the alert that our next generation does not make the district subdivision a tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When this happens, it will be difficult to change things around again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the brothers have to act according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There should not be any set form.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A district meeting can have fifty people or a hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a division is convenient, but this is not a legal number.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are merely saying that fifty or a hundred is a convenient number.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord did not feed the multitude by dividing them all into groups of fifty or all into groups of a hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, there were groups of fifty and there were groups of a hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This shows us that the Lord was merely supplying a convenient number.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Based on this principle we should have some arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the number becomes big, we should subdivide into districts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There can be fifty to a district or a hundred to a district.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such meetings are very convenient because the number is small, and it is easy to care for and visit everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It affords more opportunities for everyone to function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The advantage of the home meetings is that they give more opportunities for the brothers and sisters to open their mouths to speak cf.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>1 Cor 14:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A few days ago we announced that the bread-breaking meeting would be conducted in five districts or "homes" Translator's Note: home is another term for "district" in the usage at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now we want to increase that to six districts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The main responsibility of the elders is to oversee.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They should all be headed up by Brother Witness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Together they should oversee the entire church in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The leadership in the various districts is: Chu Zhi-yuen for the Jordan Road meeting hall, Hsu Jin-ching for Hsu's home, Cheng Him-yuen for Bao's home, Chan Shi-re for Chan's home, and K. H. Weigh for Shen's home.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>FOR ALL THE "HOME" RESPONSIBLE ONES</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Witness Lee: I have a word of fellowship for all the "home" responsible ones.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Concerning the practical affairs in the districts, such as the preparation for the meeting facilities, the arrangements before and after the meetings, the supply of drinks, etc., we should not overburden the hosts of the homes where the meetings are held.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead, we should share the work by assigning different brothers and sisters to do the various jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to identify the various responsibilities and come up with proper ways to discharge them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not wait for the hosts to ask about them and do not overburden them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From today forward, the works in the "homes" are officially passed on to the various districts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to write down everything we need to do and should not allow anything to slip through our fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not try to be too spiritual in conducting the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not try to be non-spiritual either.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the one hand, we have to function aggressively and positively.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the other hand, we have to touch the flow of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Conduct everything in an orderly way in spirit, following the Spirit's leading in such a way as if being borne on the wings of the Spirit.</S>
