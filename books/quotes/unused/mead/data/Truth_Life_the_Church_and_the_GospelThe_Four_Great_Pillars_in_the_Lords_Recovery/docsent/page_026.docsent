   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE KEY TO THE REVIVAL OF THE CHURCH THE LEARNING AND SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE FULL-TIME SERVING ONES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some who have served in the church for many years do not know how to lead or help the new full-time serving ones to have a proper equipping and learning before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, the following three points can be regarded as directions on how to lead the young people in their service.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Learning to Know the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a young person graduates from college and desires to learn to serve full-time, the first thing he should learn is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every morning the full-time serving ones should spend much time on the matter of learning the truth through the use of the Recovery Version of the New Testament with its footnotes and references and with the help of the life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If they spend four hours every morning to do this, they will be able to study the New Testament once in two years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a necessary equipping.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Learning to Preach the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, the full-timers must learn to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only should they know how to preach the gospel, but they should also help the saints to open their homes for the preaching of the gospel, even to the extent that they would force all the saints to open their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To do this in a proper way requires the full-timers to exercise wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to think of a way to help the saints to open their homes, whether they are strong, weak, or have stopped meeting for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we have to help them to invite their relatives, neighbors, colleagues, and classmates, and we also have to lead them in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They should not ask the elders and co-workers to preach the gospel; rather, they should do the preaching themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once they speak, they will be vitalized and will have the heart to pursue, learn, and be equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The best way to recover the saints, especially those who have stopped meeting for a while, is to ask them to preach the gospel to other people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once they speak, their cold hearts will be rekindled, and they will spontaneously come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Learning to Hold Group Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Third, full-timers must learn how to have small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church has to divide into small groups with eight to twelve people in each group.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The full-timers must learn to lead a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The secret of leading a small group is that you should not be the one doing everything, but you should only help the saints to form the group.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then you should discuss with them how to take care of the group meeting and how to take care of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As to the principle of grouping, do not group the saints according to their spiritual conditions; instead, group them according to geographical boundaries.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, if there are eight saints living in a brother s neighborhood, you can arrange for them to come together to form a group.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As for the meeting location, they can rotate among their homes after discussing among themselves and agreeing to a proper sequence in rotation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is best not to have the title of group responsible one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not ask any particular person to take the lead either.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead, let everyone in the group take the lead and bear the responsibility of the group.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although it is the full-timer who helps the small group, he is neither the one who calls the meeting nor the one who takes the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the members of the group must take care of and bear the responsibility of all the matters and decisions related to the group.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are at least one thousand saints in metropolitan Manila.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These one thousand saints should establish one hundred small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, you have to take a proper census by locating all the saints according to their information cards.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then, no matter what their spiritual situations are, you have to arrange groups for them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The content of the small group living may consist of gospel preaching, feeding, and edification.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the number of people in a group increases, they can divide into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way the church will spontaneously multiply and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>LEARNING TO FEED AND TO SHEPHERD</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, the full-timers mainly have to do these three things: learn the truth, preach the gospel, and lead the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To lead the small groups is actually to feed the lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In John 21 when the Lord spoke of feeding the lambs, He used different words, indicating that different kinds of edification should be rendered to different kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In verse 15 He said, Feed My lambs ; in verse 16 He said, Shepherd My sheep ; and in verse 17 He summed everything up by saying, Feed My sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Lambs denotes little lambs, referring specifically to individual lambs whereas sheep denotes a flock, referring to the church John 10:14, 16; Acts 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Feeding means to render the life supply to others, nourishing them with the riches of life; shepherding, on the other hand, is related to the building.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We shepherd the saints by feeding them unto the building up of the church Matt 16:18; 1 Pet 2:2-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today in the church there are many lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In particular, all the brothers and sisters who are not meeting regularly are lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are also some who have been meeting for twenty years but are not grown up; these are the old lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the full-timers must learn to shepherd these lambs, recover them, and supply them with the guileless milk of the word that they may gradually grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then the full-timers must continue to shepherd them that they may be built up into a dwelling place of God in spirit Eph 2:22 .</S>
