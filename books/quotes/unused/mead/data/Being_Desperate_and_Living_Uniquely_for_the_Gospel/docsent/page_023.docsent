   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PREACHING THE HIGH GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO LEAD PEOPLE TO BELIEVE AND BE BAPTIZED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to go to preach the high gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The booklet we have published entitled The Mystery of Human Life really works.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thousands have been saved through this booklet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In it is the central way to present people the high gospel starting from God's creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The parts of man are presented with a diagram of three circles showing man's spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It unveils God's intention to come into man's spirit so that man as a container, a vessel, may contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This high gospel of God's economy captures the thoughtful, educated people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After being educated, nearly every human being begins to think about the meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before the trainees presented the booklet, many said they were not interested.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the trainees said, "Just give us thirty seconds to read to you from The Mystery of Human Life."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This subject attracts people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After listening to the reading of the first page, many will say it is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you hear "very good," that means that person is a son of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When he says "very good" or "not bad," that is the time for you to say, "Let's pray."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then you can turn to the back of the booklet and lead him to pray and call upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Following this, read the portion in the back of the booklet on baptism and show him Mark 16:16 believe and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then lead him to be baptized in his bathtub.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Exercise the authority in heaven and on earth that has been given to you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Regardless of this person's status, he will be a little lamb, going along with you to get changed and get into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In baptism we have a very prevailing prayer: "Lord, we place this one into You.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We baptize him into the Triune God."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the way to get people baptized within fifteen minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I met a brother who is a sales manager over a region covering half of the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Under his management are one thousand five hundred salesmen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He told me that the way to make sales is exactly the same as our instructions to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was happy to hear this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He even said that there were probably some points that they could learn of us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In his training of people to sell door to-door, the first point is the proper dress and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said you should neither dress too casually nor too extravagantly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We instructed the trainees in Taipei in the same way related to their appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The second point with his salesmen is to have a preparation time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even their salesmen before going out have a time to come together to have a little conference to get themselves prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We shared that we need to get ourselves prepared by prayer before going out.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then they advise to keep the approach short.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not have a long talk.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A long talk will annul the deal.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have shared the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then this brother advises his salesmen to follow the training they offer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is specific and it works.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we have pointed out, this means not to speak your own words, but to speak every word according to the training's instructions.</S>
