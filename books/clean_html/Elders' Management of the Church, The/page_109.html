<P>Brothers, do not expect an angel to come to your place to have a week's conference, and the church where you are will be revived. Do not cherish such a hope. Be subdued to do a slow work. Touch everyone. Help the saints to live before the Lord and to enjoy Christ. When there are practical needs, help them. I would like to say that even when they have financial needs, and you are able, share what you have with them. You do not need to call it a consecration or a supply. As long as a brother has nothing to eat, and as long as you have a meal, you should take half of it, and share the other half with him. This is not so much a matter of consecration as it is a mutual sharing in life to serve the Lord. In this way, you will have something to eat, and he will have something to eat. This is wonderful. If you are able to do so, you should earn some money for his use. This is the principle of Paul's making tents. Paul said that he worked with his two hands to supply the need of himself and those with him. You have to bear the burden of the brothers and sisters who are your members. If you can bear the burden to such an extent, you will find out if God will bless your work or not! If you are willing to do this, you will see the blessing coming; it is useless for you to invite others to preach.</P><P>The building of the church is a slow work. It requires strength. You cannot count on luck, and you cannot put your hope in others. I believe all the sisters who are housewives can testify. You know how much work there is in the house. You can never expect another one to replace you. Only by laboring, striving, working away at your own home can you expect your house to be in order. The house of God, the church, has been entrusted to the elders' care. The elders are the housewives; they can only labor and strive. The building up of the church depends on the laboring of the elders. It will not work to merely have revival meetings. You must put yourselves into the hard work. Only after you have worked hard will you see the harvest, just as a farmer sees his crop.</P><P>I hope that the elders in all the churches would grasp this principle and would invest their energy in all the places. To be good at preaching may not yield a good result. In some places, this may even make things worse. The fewer conferences there are, the better it is. Save the time to contact the people one by one. Spend time to deal with them one by one and help them to learn.</P>
