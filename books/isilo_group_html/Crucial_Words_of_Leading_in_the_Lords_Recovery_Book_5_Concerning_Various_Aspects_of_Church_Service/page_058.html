Praying Before the Meeting</h2>
<p>If we desire the small group meeting to be enjoyable, we need to be faithful to use the Life-studies. Whenever we come to a crucial point in the Life-study message, we should repeat it. Every one of us should learn to lead the small group and should focus on the crucial points in each Life-study message. Do not worry that others will not understand. We should continue to speak. We should speak on the second message of the <em>Life-study of Galatians</em> until everyone can say that the crucial points of Paul&rsquo;s gospel are Christ is in us as the hope of glory, Christ is living in us, Christ is being formed in us, Christ is making His home in us, and we are being filled with Christ to become the fullness of God.</p>
<p>The key to the success of the small group meeting depends on whether we follow this method. As long as we have no doubts, we will see the riches in the Lord&rsquo;s word and understand that this is the right way. In both the small group meeting and the time after the table meeting, we can read half a Life-study message. In one year every saint will be supplied, be clear in the truth, grow in life, bear fruit, and multiply. We must focus on this way. Heaven and earth may pass away, but the small group meeting must never be forsaken. Not only should we be diligent to go to the small group meetings, but we should bring others to the small group. We should try our best to recover those who have not been meeting for a long time, and we should bring our unbelieving relatives and friends. We can use the Life-study message that we are reading to speak a simple gospel. We should believe that the Holy Spirit will operate through our speaking.</p>
<p>Every week, beginning from Monday, we should read a portion of the Life-study message every day. Then by the time of the small group meeting we will be very familiar with the content of each section in the message. However, before the meeting we need to pray in order to prepare our spirit by asking the Lord to fill our spirit, strengthen our spirit, and make our spirit strong and bright. We should also ask the Lord for utterance and pray for the meeting. If we can all exercise in this way, the small group meeting will be strong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR SPEAKING NOT BEING LONG AND<br />
UNRELATED TO THE MEETING</h2>
<p>Furthermore, in the small group meeting our speaking should not be long. Speaking for a long time kills the meeting. A long testimony kills the meeting, and a long prayer kills the meeting. A small group is a &ldquo;small&rdquo; group in which everything should be simple and short. A young person is usually not verbose and long-winded. It is often the older ones who cannot stop speaking even though they speak out of concern and love and want to explain things so that others understand. Please remember not to be long-winded. When we are long-winded, it is difficult for others to tolerate it, and their interest is killed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE LIFE-STUDY<br />
AS THE CENTRAL LINE, THE CENTER</h2>
<p>In the small group meeting we should take the Life-study messages as the central line. We should not bring in any other things, speak of unrelated matters, or repeat the old stories of our salvation. We do not need to speak about other subjects. Other people want to hear words that are concerning Christ being revealed in us, living in us, making His home in us, filling us, and making us the fullness of God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the small group meeting the &ldquo;ball&rdquo; should be passed around, and everyone should learn to pick up the ball and pass it. If everyone does not bear the responsibility to participate, we should not blame a person who speaks too long. Some saints speak too long because we do not open our mouths. We all must be diligent to learn how to have a good small group meeting. This is our only way.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 5: Concerning Various Aspects of Church Service &nbsp; pg 58</div><br></body></html>
