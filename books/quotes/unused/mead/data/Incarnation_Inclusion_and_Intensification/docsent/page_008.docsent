   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ in the First Stage</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Producing a Group of Redeemed Persons and Christ in the Second Stage Producing the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the first stage, the stage of Christ in the flesh, Christ produced a group of redeemed persons, such as Peter and all the other disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although a redeemed people had been produced, the church had not yet been produced.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church was produced by Christ in the second stage.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this stage Christ is the pneumatic Christ, the compound, life-giving Spirit who produced the church on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The redeemed saints, who were produced by Christ in the flesh, became the church produced by Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Third Stage Intensification the Stage</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>of Christ as the Sevenfold Intensified Spirit To Deal with the Degradation of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Shortly after the church was produced, it began to become degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is clearly seen in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In chapter five Ananias and Sapphira lied to the Holy Spirit; in chapter six there was a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews regarding the daily dispensing; and in chapter fifteen there was trouble concerning circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The separation of Barnabas from Paul 15:35-39 should also be regarded as a part of the degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually the church degraded to such an extent that the Lord could no longer tolerate it, and He reacted by intensifying Himself sevenfold to become the sevenfold intensified Spirit Rev 1:4; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He became intensified sevenfold to deal with the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To Produce the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>to Consummate the New Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In his Epistles Paul spoke about the Body Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 12:12, 27; Eph 1:23; 4:4, 16; Col 2:19 , but I do not believe that Paul saw the actual building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul could see the church expressed in various localities, but he could not see, in actuality, the church as the Body in a perfect and complete way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order for the Body to be produced in a full and complete way, there is the need of the third stage of Christ, the stage of intensification in which Christ becomes the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After Paul died, the Lord waited more than twenty years until John wrote the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Revelation is an Epistle, but it is very different in character from all the other Epistles in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this book Christ, who became the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, has become the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Revelation 1:4 the third of the Divine Trinity, the Spirit, becomes the seven Spirits and is ranked as the second of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have pointed out that in His second stage, the stage of His being the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, Christ has produced the churches, but not much of the Body was produced and built up in an actual and practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this reason, Christ has become the sevenfold intensified Spirit to overcome the degradation of the church that the overcomers may be produced to bring forth the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The issue of Christ in the flesh was a group of redeemed persons, and the issue of Christ as the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit was the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For the Body to be produced there is the need for the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit to be intensified sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This sevenfold intensification deals with the sevenfold situation of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Brethren and those who followed their teaching saw something concerning the prophetic significance of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From their study of these chapters, they discovered that the church is in seven conditions, in seven stages, and in seven periods of time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, they did not see the matter of overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jessie Penn-Lewis saw this matter and published a paper called The Overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although Mrs. Penn-Lewis wrote something concerning the seven churches producing the overcomers, the light she received was not full, and thus she did not see that the overcomers are for the building up of the Body to consummate the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The stage of incarnation produced a group of redeemed people, and the stage of inclusion produced the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The stage of intensification will build up the Body to consummate the New Jerusalem.</S>
