<h2 class=head2>Our Need for a Detailed Experience of Christ in Our Daily Life</h2><p>The basic principle in Colossians is that God has given Christ to us. According to Colossians, the will of God is to make Christ everything to us, to give us Christ as our portion, our life, and our everything. By the mercy and grace of God we have received Christ as the all-inclusive One. Therefore, after we receive Him, we must walk in Him as our sphere and by Him as our means. We must learn to know Christ in this way.<p>We should not think that since we have heard this word and read Colossians, that we know everything. What we are speaking here may be considered as instructions telling us that we need to know Christ and walk in Him. Now we must learn these things through our daily experience. I am saddened by the fact that not many Christians have learned how to experience Christ in a detailed way in their daily life. I have heard certain teachings about this, but I have not met many Christians who practice the real experience of Christ in their daily life. Today what we need is not more good teachings but to learn to live by Him in a practical way. All the good teachings other than Christ should be put aside. We must spend more time to know Christ, not merely by our understanding but by the wisdom in our spirit.<h2 class=head2>Knowing Christ in All Spiritual Wisdom and Understanding</h2><p>The apostle Paul gives us the secret and the way to walk in Christ in 1:9-11. Verse 9 says, “Therefore we also, since the day we heard of it, do not cease praying and asking on your behalf that you may be filled with the full knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding.” In order to experience Christ and walk in Christ, we must have all spiritual wisdom and understanding. We need the wisdom in our spirit to realize Christ. First of all, we must realize that in God’s purpose, His will is to make Christ everything to us. We must have a clear understanding of this. To be sure, in order to experience Christ, we have to know Him. The more we know and realize Him, the more we sense that we need Him, and the more we are willing to experience Him. Therefore, we need spiritual wisdom and understanding, that is, the revelation and vision concerning Christ. Hence, we need to read the Scriptures to gain the knowledge of Christ. However, we should not read merely in the way of mental understanding in letter. Rather, whenever we read the things concerning Christ in the record of the Scriptures, we must pray much.<h2 class=head2>Knowing Christ by Exercising Our Spirit in the Word</h2><p>We should not merely exercise our mentality to understand the Bible in its black and white letters. Of course, we need understanding. If we do not understand English, for example, we can never understand an English version of the Bible. We must know the words and understand them with our mind. However, this is not all. After we understand the words, we must immediately exercise our spirit. This requires much prayer. We may illustrate this by eating. When we eat, it is important to thoroughly chew our food. The more time we spend to chew the food, the more we get the nourishment and the easier it is to digest it. Chewing food illustrates the way to read the Word with the exercise of the spirit. After we see the words, read the words, and understand them, we need to “chew” them. This is done not by our understanding but by our prayer.<p>For this reason we need to exercise our spirit. When we read, we need to exercise our mind to understand the words, and we may even need to go to a dictionary. However, after we understand the words, we need to exercise our spirit and pray from the spirit: “Lord, I open my mouth. I wish to sense Your word from the depths of my spirit.” In this way the secrets of the Word will be opened to us. We will pass through the surface of the black and white letters and find the depths. Then we will see something different and living. At this time we will know Christ not merely according to the letter but according to spiritual understanding and realization. We will receive the vision and revelation of Christ from the Word. We all need to read the Word in this way.<p>We may illustrate the way to eat the Word with Colossians 2:16-17. In the previous chapter we saw that eating, drinking, the feasts, and the Sabbath are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ. In reading these verses, we must first know the meaning of the words in black and white. Following this, we need to pray in order to exercise our spirit to realize the spiritual matters, the spiritual content in this word. Then something will be opened to us, not only something of the Word but something of Christ Himself. We will realize that what we need is Christ as the reality. We all need to have the spiritual wisdom and understanding so that we may realize Christ. Then we will be able to experience Him.
