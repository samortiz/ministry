   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After we save people, we should go back to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do this as a common thing, without any advertisement, promotion, or imposing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then we can do the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We also help them to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must do these four things as common things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, we must bring these new people into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not tell them that the church is old, but we are new.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not say that the church is not up-to-date or not up-to-standard.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do believe that all the churches in the Lord's recovery practice meeting in a way that is open to all the saints to pray, to give a word of exhortation, and to speak something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must encourage the new ones to pray in the meeting and to speak something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should encourage them to function in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the churches desire to see the attendants in their meeting function because that strengthens, enriches, and uplifts the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>So, in this way we can bring many benefits to the church, and the elders will be happy with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Gradually, the saints will see the fruit in our life and living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since we are the ones who are gaining the sinners, feeding the young believers, perfecting the saints, and helping the saints to function in the meetings, no elders would be unhappy with us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then, gradually, in five to ten years, the Lord may use us to turn the church around.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So, we can still work out something.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not have any choice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Go on according to the Lord's sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We were produced and raised up by the church in a certain locality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were also sent by that church and have been supported by them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a kind of sovereign arrangement of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to this sovereign arrangement, we should go back without making any choice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should go back to that church to serve in the way we have mentioned, until the Lord has a second arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That will not be our choice but His sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we may go to another place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this way, we will not damage any church but rather help it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is better not to have a helper go with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To have a companion go with us does help in a sense, but it does not help in all cases.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only our adequate transformation helps in every case.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may say that a certain church is too small or too weak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But no church is so small that it is not worthy of our serving.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must go back to fulfill our duty in the way that we have fellowshipped.</S>
