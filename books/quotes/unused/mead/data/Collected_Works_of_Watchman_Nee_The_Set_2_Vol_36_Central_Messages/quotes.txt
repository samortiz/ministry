[1]  "The Lord burdened and commissioned Watchman Nee with a specific testimony of Christ in His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, return, and kingdom.
[2]  His ministry, therefore, was focused on Christ's death and resurrection for the producing of the church in life to experience the victory of Christ that His kingdom might by ushered in. For this reason, he considered messages on these matters as the central messages.
[3]  Last Lord's Day, we saw that it is possible for every Christian to have a life that is perfect see "The Extent of the Believer's Salvation," Collected Works, Volume 8 .
[4]  Every Christian can reach the point where he can say that he is crucified with Christ and that it is no longer he who lives, but Christ who lives in him.
[5]  Philippians 1:21 says, "To me, to live is Christ."
[6]  Does it say that to live is to be like Christ?
[7]  No. Does it say that to live is to imitate Christ? No. Does it say that to live is to make Christ our pattern and example, and to follow Christ? No. It says, "To me, to live is Christ." It is absolutely useless to imitate or to do good.
[8]  Even if we can read the Bible, pray, live a good life, and pursue diligently, as long as we have a wrong life, we will still end up with a wrong living.
[9]  We may yearn, weep, repent, and pray to God, "God, I really want to obey You," but there is something basically wrong with us we have a wrong life.
[10]  God has not merely put Christ on the cross to die for us; He has made Christ our life.
[11]  When we see a person giving himself to the Lord, turning his back on the world, and turning to God to obey Him, we think how wonderful it would be if we could do the same.
[12]  Philippians 2:12-13 says, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure."
[13]  These two verses tell us what every Christian can experience.
[14]  But they fail because they have forgotten the words in verse 13 which say, "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure."
[15]  This verse does not say that we should will and work; it says that God is operating in our hearts until we are able to will and work.
[16]  It is wrong if anyone says that, even though we have believed in the Lord, we do not have Christ within, and therefore, need to receive Christ again.
[17]  We know that only Christ can overcome, we know that Christ lives in us, and we know that when we believe in the Lord we have Christ, but day after day we still remain the same.
[18]  God does not worry how great our sin is and how corrupted we are; God is only concerned that we do not put our heart into His hand.
[19]  After we have surrendered, we must believe that God can surely save us from our love, our unwillingness, and our inabilities.
[20]  We cannot do anything except commit ourselves to God and believe that the indwelling Lord will accomplish His purpose.
[21]  The Bible says, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death" v. 2 . I asked, "Are you free?" He said, "The Bible says I am free from the law of sin and of death, but I dare not say it." Then I said, "Where is your faith?"
[22]  But if our will does not cooperate to commit ourselves to God and if we do not allow Christ to live through us, God will not force us to do anything.
[23]  A TWO-SIDED TRUTH Scripture Reading: Phil 2:12-18
[24]  We know that the Epistle to the Philippians was written by Paul in a prison in Rome.
[25]  While he was in prison, Paul wrote not only the Epistle to the Philippians but also the Epistles to the Ephesians and the Colossians.
[26]  We praise and thank the Lord that we are saved!
[27]  On the other hand, there seem to be many promises of God which promise that God is doing this and that for us; everything seems to be according to His grace and everything seems to be His work; it seems as if we have nothing to do.
[28]  Chapman first began his work for the Lord, those who gathered to hear him grew in number day by day, and a great building was erected at the place where he preached.
[29]  "If you have faith like a mustard seed, you would have said to this sycamine tree, Be uprooted and be planted in the sea; and it would have obeyed you" v. 6 . What does this have to do with forgiveness? When we have faith within, we can say to the hatred within our heart, "Hatred, go away." When we have such a faith, we can forgive others when they come to ask for forgiveness.
[30]  Philippians 2:14 says, "Do all things without murmurings and reasonings."
[31]  The apostle told us that it is God who operates within us to will and to work.
[32]  The result of such operation is obvious: the saints will be in harmony with one another, and there will not be murmurings and reasonings.
[33]  The goal of God's redemption is to work Himself into us until we become mingled with Him, possessing His life and nature, and are transformed to become the same as He.
[34]  God has put His very own being, with all that His nature possesses, into Christ, His Son, and through the Son, He has given everything to us.
[35]  When God gives us Christ, He gives us everything related to Himself and His nature.
[36]  Through His death on the cross, Christ completed in His flesh all the steps that were necessary for us to receive God and all that His nature possesses.
[37]  God in Christ has accomplished everything concerning our salvation, and in the Holy Spirit, He has wrought these things into us.
[38]  Everything concerning God and His nature is in Christ, and everything has come into us through the Holy Spirit.
[39]  When we receive the Holy Spirit, we receive Christ, and when we receive Christ, we receive everything concerning God and His nature.
[40]  A PRAYER FOR REVELATION Scripture Reading: Eph 1:3-23
[41]  As we begin to know God, His work, and His eternal plan which He purposed in eternity, we begin to realize that the light in the book of Ephesians is abundant, high, and special.
[42]  We need to realize one thing before the Lord: in the book of Ephesians, God caused Paul to pray two prayers.
[43]  In verse 17 Paul prayed, "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him."
[44]  While the Athenians did not know God at all, this prayer reveals that a Christian, who has received eternal life and who has known God initially, may still not have a sufficient knowledge of God.
[45]  Immediately after we believe in the Lord, or a few years after we believe in Him, we cannot say that we do not know something about God.
[46]  Not only does God want us to know Him; He wants us to know His calling.
[47]  He wants us to know what our calling is and what is His inheritance in the saints.
[48]  This tells us that when a man truly understands God's eternal plan, and when he sees what God is doing from eternity to eternity, he will realize that God's eternal plan is related to everyone who is called.
[49]  God has predestinated us unto sonship, and He has also predestinated us to be His inheritance.
[50]  This glory is to be the same as God is and to glorify God.
[51]  Ephesians deals with something that spans from eternity to eternity.
[52]  They think that they can put aside the knowledge of God and His eternal will, and make it their first priority to acquire power from God for themselves, so that they can be more holy, more victorious, and more spiritual in themselves.
[53]  Verse 19 says, "And what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe."
[54]  It is so great that they could not fathom it by themselves; they needed Paul to pray for them, so that God would grant them a spirit of wisdom and revelation and open the eyes of their heart.
[55]  Now let us consider what this power has done.
[56]  Paul said, "According to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead."
[57]  This power enabled Christ to be raised from the dead.
[58]  We have seen something concerning Paul's prayer for the saints in Ephesians 1.
[59]  There is one main point to this prayer: he hoped that they would receive a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that their eyes would be opened to see some things.
[60]  We do not need God to do more works, but we need to have the revelation concerning the works that He has completed.
[61]  The apostle prayed that God would grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him who already "is," that we would have a full knowledge of His predetermined plan and have a knowledge of His accomplished works.
[62]  He prayed that God would give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, and that He would enlighten the eyes of our heart to see and know the hope of our calling, the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and the surpassing greatness of His power toward us.
[63]  THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE CHAPTER ONE CHRIST IS THE WAY,
[64]  We need to see that not only do we have to come to God through the Lord Jesus when we are saved, but that the Lord Jesus is still the way any time we go to God; there is not some method outside of the Lord Jesus.
[65]  Brothers and sisters, if we do not have the Lord living within us, and if it is not the Lord who is our truth, a teaching that guides our action is nothing but dead works; it is not life, and it is not living.
[66]  We have mentioned briefly what it is for Christ to be the way and the truth.
[67]  AND THE LIFE Scripture Reading: John 11:25 WHAT HE DOES VERSUS WHAT HE IS
[68]  Chapter eleven of the Gospel of John shows us how the Lord Jesus gave life to a dead person; it shows us how the Lord Jesus resurrected a person from among the dead.
[69]  The Lord can resurrect man, but He did not say, "I will resurrect the dead."
[70]  She said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died" v. 21 . Martha believed in God's power, and she also believed in the Lord Jesus' power, but she did not see that the Lord Himself is the resurrection and the life.
[71]  God placed the man whom He had created in the garden of Eden.
[72]  Many brothers and sisters often ask, "How do I know whether I am dead or not?
[73]  How do I know that the Lord has done something within me through the cross?"
[74]  If the Lord has done something within, you should have lost many things.
[75]  But if you have been the same since the day you were saved, and if you are still as full as you were before, the cross has not done anything within you.
[76]  If the cross has truly done something within, you will find that a great elimination work has been done; you will find that the Lord has done a thorough cleanup job in you.
[77]  AND THE LIGHT OF LIFE Scripture Reading: John 6:35; 8:12
[78]  We have already briefly seen that all the spiritual things and all spiritual matters are Christ.
[79]  God gives us Christ to be our spiritual things and matters.
[80]  We say with our mouth that Christ is the centrality of all things, but in our living we still keep many things other than Christ, as if these things could help us live our Christian life.
[81]  If we wrongly presume that what the Lord Jesus gives is different from the Lord Jesus Himself, and if we wrongly presume that grace and the One who gives grace are separate, these mistakes will cause us to suffer great spiritual damage.
[82]  Some brothers say, "I have been busily working for more than one year, running here and there.
[83]  I have been so busy that my whole being is drained.
[84]  I am hungry, and I hope to go some place for a spiritual retreat."
[85]  But when we read John 4, we realize that there is something wrong with these words.
[86]  The Lord Jesus Christ was wearied from His journey and sat by the well of Jacob.
[87]  When the disciples came back with the food they had bought, they invited the Lord to eat, but the Lord said, "I have food to eat that you do not know about" v. 32 . The disciples thought that someone else had given Him something to eat.
[88]  The Lord not only said that He is the bread of life, but He also said that He is the light of life.
[89]  Hence, when a man meets the Lord, he sees.
[90]  When a man meets the Lord, he falls and becomes weak as though he were dead.
[91]  May the Lord have mercy on us so that His light may take away our self-assurance and so that we will not be so confident that we are right, that we are not wrong, and that we know so much.
[92]  CHAPTER FOUR CHRIST IS THE "I AM" Scripture Reading: Exo 3:13-14a; John 8:28a
[93]  He is not limited by time and space, because He is from eternity to eternity.
[94]  First, we want to see how God is not limited by time.
[95]  The psalmist once prayed to God, "Teach us to number our days,/That we may gain a heart of wisdom" Psa 90:12 .
[96]  We have to realize that this has much to do with our life.
[97]  If we truly see this, we will be led to know God more.
[98]  Romans 6:6 says, "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves."
[99]  This shows us that God not only caused the Lord Jesus to shed His blood on the cross so that we could be forgiven, but He also put us in Christ.
[100]  We do not have enough words to describe this kind of thing, but when the Lord's Spirit works in us and brings us into a union with Christ, we will see that all the facts in Christ are now; nothing is past, because we are joined to the Lord.
[101]  Mark 11:24 says, "For this reason I say to you, All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them."
[102]  From man's point of view, prayer and petition are things of the present, and "you will have them" is a thing of the future.
[103]  When I pray to God for the healing of a disease, for the salvation of a sinner, or for the accomplishment of a work, I do not know when the disease will be healed, when the person will be saved, or when the work will be accomplished.
[104]  CHAPTER FIVE CHRIST IS THE ROCK OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 16:13-19 "WHO DO YOU SAY THAT I AM?"
[105]  "Who do men say that the Son of Man is?"
[106]  Simon Peter answered the Lord and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" v. 16 . Peter's word was clear: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." Peter acknowledged two things about the Lord.
[107]  The Rock Being Christ, the Son of the Living God
[108]  As far as His own person is concerned, He is the Son of God.
[109]  Our knowledge of the Lord does not depend on what the Gospels say that He has done; our knowledge of Him depends on our knowledge of Him as the Son of God.
[110]  The Bible says, "And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ" John 17:3 .
[111]  "That you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, you may have life in His name" 20:31 .
[112]  If a man does not know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, he does not know God.
[113]  Those who have seen miracles can confess the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, but those who have not seen miracles can still confess the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, because the Father in the heavens grants men this revelation.
[114]  We need revelation from the Father who is in the heavens in order to know that the Lord Jesus is the Christ of God and the anointed One, that Christ is the Head of the church, that the church is the Body of Christ, and that it shares in the anointing of Christ.
[115]  Brothers and sisters, we have to confess that the Lord Jesus is the Christ, and we have to confess that we are Christians who belong to Christ and who share in the anointing.
[116]  If we only know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God without knowing Him as the Christ of God, we will not understand God's purpose in creating us and His purpose in saving us; we will not understand what God wants to gain from the church.
[117]  We need God Himself to open our eyes to see how great the Lord Jesus is.
[118]  Therefore, we need to remember that the church is not only built upon Christ, but upon the Christ whom God has revealed.
[119]  A Christ that is produced by our own imagination cannot help us, and a Christ that others tell us about cannot help us either.
[120]  A big problem in the church is that many people receive their Christ from others' teaching; they say something because others are saying it.
[121]  If we do not have light from the Father who is in the heavens, and if all the light we have is handed down to us through others, we will be shaken when others are shaken.
[122]  We have to remember that the doctrine of Christ will not save us; we stand because God has revealed this Christ to us and we have received Him.
[123]  After Peter answered the Lord, saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God," the Lord said that Peter was blessed, because his declaration was not the result of revelation by flesh and blood, but from a revelation of the Father who is in the heavens.
[124]  The church is built upon this rock, and this rock is Christ, the Son of God.
[125]  The rock is also the revelation which God has given to man.
[126]  When we speak out and confess this revelation from God, and when we confess that Jesus is the Son of God and the Christ, we have the church.
[127]  The first three chapters of this book are the same as the first three chapters of the book Christ Is the Way, the Truth, and the Life published in this volume.
[128]  According to God's desire, plan, and redemption, He has ordained that His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, be all spiritual matters and things.
[129]  CHAPTER FOUR CHRIST IS GOD'S MATTERS AND THINGS Scripture Reading: John 1:29; 6:53; 8:12, 24, 28; 11:25; 14:6; 1 Cor 1:30; Col 3:4; 1 Tim 1:1; Psa 27:1 GOD'S GOAL AND MEANS CHRIST
[130]  God's goal is Christ, and Christ is also God's means.
[131]  God uses Christ as the means to reach the goal, which is Christ.
[132]  There is one difference between these two books: Ephesians shows us that according to the economy of the fullness of the times, God wants to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth 1:10 ; Colossians shows us that God has not only made Christ to be Head over all things, but God has made Him all and in all 1:18; 3:11b .
[133]  Colossians shows us that God's goal is Christ, and His means is also Christ.
[134]  I would like to point out that not only does the Lord Jesus' own word testify to this, but Paul said the same thing.
[135]  He knew the Lord, and he showed us one very interesting thing.
[136]  You may ask, "Brother, why do you have to spend so much time on all this?"
[137]  But we constantly ask for one thing after another; we ask for one, two, three, ten, fifty, a hundred, ten thousand, a million, and ten million things.
[138]  We can find one fact in our spiritual experience.
[139]  I may say that knowing Christ is to know Him through matters and things.
[140]  It means knowing that Christ is our matters and Christ is our things.
[141]  Some people can say that they know Christ as their patience, Christ as their love, or Christ as their humility; this is knowing Christ.
[142]  Many people know Christ as the Lord of justification, but they still fear God and do not know that Christ is their righteousness.
[143]  The problem is that although many of us know that Christ is our Lord, we do not know that Christ is our matters and things.
[144]  CHAPTER FIVE CHRIST ONLY NOT MATTERS OR THINGS Scripture Reading: John 8:28; Col 3:3-4; 1:16-20 MAN'S THOUGHTS AND DEMANDS
[145]  But different people have different degrees of knowledge of God.
[146]  Among God's children, some know the Lord Jesus as one of the many gifts of God, while others know Him as God's unique gift.
[147]  Many people confess that the Lord Jesus is God's gift, which means that they recognize Him as God's unique gift.
[148]  Many Christians have not seen that there are not many things in the spiritual world; there is only Christ.
[149]  There is no patience in the spiritual world; there is only Christ.
[150]  There is no humility, sanctification, or light in the spiritual world; there is only Christ.
[151]  Those who serve the Lord want to serve Him more.
[152]  But the strange thing is that when we do these things, we often do not touch life.
[153]  What does it mean for Christ to be our matters and things?
[154]  What is the significance of having Christ as our matters and things?
[155]  God is living, and he wants God to be his Healer, to touch him with His power, to be his Physician and demonstrate His healing power and healing ability.
[156]  The only thing you can say about certain persons is that they are very good, that they are nice men.
[157]  You can only see good and evil in them; you cannot see anything spiritual in them.
[158]  You can only say that some brothers are good, that they are nice men, that they have a good temper, that they are patient, and that they can suffer and deny themselves.
[159]  If patience, suffering, self-denial, humility, and love are only things, you may love them, but the minute you touch them, you are deadened within, and something collapses within you.
[160]  Do not allow us to deceive ourselves, to think that we have seen it when we have not seen it, to think that we have touched the right way when we really have not touched it, to think that we are full of life when we are full of behavior, and to think that we are full of Christ when we are full of things.
[161]  CHRIST BECOMING OUR WISDOM Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:30
[162]  The Bible speaks of Christ as our life in many ways.
[163]  But the meaning of the words "Christ is our life" is not that simple.
[164]  His purpose is not for Him to be our teacher or a pattern that we follow, but for us to take Him as our life, so that His life can be manifested through us.
[165]  If we have the life of Christ but do not know how this life has become our life, we cannot be a proper Christian and readily manifest His life.
[166]  What does it mean for us to be in Christ?
[167]  The church announces to men this earth-shaking fact, that God has put men into Christ; when the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, God judged Him, and men were also judged in Him.
[168]  In other words, God has put us into Christ, but we have to do something to show others that we are in Christ.
[169]  Now we will speak on Christ being in us.
[170]  Because the Lord Jesus has resurrected and because He is now in the Holy Spirit He is not merely a man, but a man in the Spirit , He can be in us.
[171]  If the Lord Jesus were not a resurrected Lord, if He were only a Lord who once lived on the earth, He could only be Himself forever, while I could only be myself forever.
[172]  God has not given us Christ so that He could just die for us on the cross; He has given Christ to us to be our life.
[173]  After understanding the meaning of Christ being our life, we now come to the question of Christ becoming our wisdom from God.
[174]  Brothers and sisters, you have been a Christian for many years.
[175]  It does not say that we understand and know how to speak or act, even though we were once foolish, because God has given us wisdom.
[176]  God has not changed foolish men into wise; rather, He has made Christ our wisdom; Christ has become wisdom to us from God.
[177]  But this does not mean that we do not have to care for our conduct while we live on earth.
[178]  God must show us that Christ does not come to help us to become holy; He does not give us the strength to be sanctified.
[179]  Not only has Christ become righteousness to us from God, and not only has He become sanctification to us from God, but He has become redemption to us from God.
[180]  When a man comes to God through Christ, God will no longer condemn him, because Christ has satisfied God's righteous requirement on man's behalf.
[181]  We have to learn to know Christ as our righteousness, we have to learn to know Christ as our sanctification, and we have to learn to know Christ as our redemption.
[182]  CHRIST IS OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS CHAPTER ONE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD Scripture Reading: Rom 3:21-28, 31
[183]  Every time we consider our salvation, we realize that it comes to us because God loves us.
[184]  At the same time, we should remember that it was not an easy thing for God to prepare such a salvation for us.
[185]  This is because God has His nature and His ways, just as man has his nature and his ways.
[186]  For this reason, God needs a way which would forgive us and still conform to His righteousness.
[187]  Through God's grace He can forgive us, keep His own law, and execute it.
[188]  The grace of salvation tells us that sinners are saved and that God is still righteous.
[189]  God would not do one thing that would make a sinner criticize Him in his heart, while keeping silent in his mouth.
[190]  Whether or not a person can be a proper Christian depends on whether he understands God's righteousness.
[191]  Many people cannot live a proper Christian life because they think that their forgiveness is the result of God's mercy.
[192]  They think that God forgives them because He sees that they are hopeless.
[193]  Consequently, sometimes they feel that God has forgiven them, and at other times, they feel that God has not forgiven them.
[194]  But we have to remember that God has given us His Son, who has borne the punishment of sin for us.
[195]  Since He has given us Christ Jesus, when we come to Him through Christ, God has to forgive us whether or not He likes it.
[196]  We have previously seen how God's salvation is based on righteousness.
[197]  If we do not intend to come to God, nothing more needs to be said.
[198]  Once a man hears God's voice, even if he has not seen His face, he will immediately feel his nakedness; he will feel that he cannot see God without a covering Gen 3:7-8 .
[199]  But we have to pay attention to one question: since the day we belonged to Christ, what has been the means by which we come to God?
[200]  But if we have righteousness, and if our righteousness is such that even God can say nothing, we will have boldness to come to Him, and we will dare to pray to Him.
[201]  This is a very basic lesson for us as Christians.
[202]  We have to realize that in giving us salvation, God not only solved the problem of sin, but the problem of righteousness as well.
[203]  God gave us righteousness in order to live before Him, that is, so that we can see God.
[204]  Before speaking on Christ being our righteousness, we have to mention the difference between the righteousness of Christ and Christ being our righteousness.
[205]  We have to ask, "Does God's Word say that He has given us the Lord Jesus' robe of righteousness, or does it say that God has given the Lord Jesus to us as a robe of righteousness?"
[206]  If our righteousness before God is our conduct, we can never be secure, because our conduct can be good at times and bad at other times.
[207]  Even if our conduct is good, this goodness is limited and can never come up to God's standard.
[208]  But thank the Lord that our righteousness before God is not our conduct, but Christ.
[209]  Satan will come and say that we are worth nothing and that God does not want us.
[210]  We should say, "Satan, you have forgotten that my righteousness before God is not my good conduct yesterday; neither is it my not-so-good conduct today.
[211]  We lose our boldness in coming to God because we have looked at ourselves.
[212]  We are afraid of seeing God because we have not looked at Christ.
[213]  If we see only Christ, not ourselves, we will be bold every time we come to God.
[214]  Christ will never fail; therefore, we can never be wrong before God.
[215]  First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became...to us from God...righteousness."
[216]  When the Lord resurrected to become the Christ, God put us in Him so that He became our righteousness, and we put Him on as our righteousness.
[217]  First, God saves us according to His own righteousness.
[218]  We are not saved by our own righteousness; we are saved by God's righteousness.
[219]  God did not save us according to our righteousness, but according to His own righteousness.
[220]  Thank the Lord that God cannot be unrighteous toward us, because He cannot betray Himself.
[221]  God's Word shows us that it is possible for our conduct to fluctuate, but it is impossible for our righteousness before God to fluctuate, because our righteousness is Christ.
[222]  When God opens our eyes to see that our righteousness before God is Christ and not our conduct, we are liberated, we can pray and fellowship with God, and we can be bold before God.
[223]  Now we come to the third point, which is covered in 2 Corinthians 5:21: "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."
[224]  We had our entrance through the way of righteousness; this is the way we were saved.
[225]  The result of this is that as Christians, we should learn righteousness.
[226]  We can learn one lesson immediately: anything unrighteous does not resemble God, any violation of others' rights does not resemble God, and any neglect of our own duty does not resemble God.
[227]  The thing that touches us the most is money.
[228]  Hence, we must first learn righteousness in the way we deal with money.
[229]  If God has shown you that you owe others anything, that you have stolen from others, or that you have extorted from others, you have to deal with it.
[230]  There are many other things of a similar nature, and we cannot enumerate them all.
[231]  If we are willing to be enlightened by the Lord, He will show us many unrighteous things.
[232]  Once we see that we are wrong, we should not be afraid of confessing our wrong.
[233]  The message in this book touches a great matter in the Christian life the Holy Spirit and reality.
[234]  With concrete examples, it demonstrates that behind everything spiritual there is the reality.
[235]  THE HOLY SPIRIT AND REALITY Scripture Reading: John 4:24; 16:13; 1 John 5:6
[236]  God's children must realize that in God's eyes, every spiritual thing and matter has its reality.
[237]  If we merely touch the outward appearance without touching the reality, what we touch has no spiritual value.
[238]  The same is true with the breaking of bread.
[239]  On the night the Lord Jesus was betrayed, "Jesus took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body.
[240]  And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
[241]  John 4 tells us that "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness" v. 24 . We have pointed out previously that the word "truthfulness" can be translated as "reality." The emphasis is the spirit, but it also mentions reality.
[242]  When the spirit touches God, there is reality; when the spirit does not touch God, there is no reality.
[243]  Those who know Christ according to outward appearance do not really know Him.
[244]  When the Lord Jesus was on earth, men seemed to touch Him, but actually they did not touch Him.
[245]  If a man does not have the revelation, even if he can eat, drink, walk, and dwell together with the Lord Jesus, he will still not know who He is.
[246]  A knowledge that is void of revelation is a knowledge of an outward Christ, a historical Christ.
[247]  The only kind of knowledge of Christ that is real and inward is the one that Peter acquired through revelation.
[248]  Paul said, "So then we, from now on, know no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer" 2 Cor 5:16 .
[249]  In the eyes of God, if a man does not have the Holy Spirit, he has not touched the reality of the Lord Jesus even if he has memorized the Lord's history and even if he has pressed upon Him, heard His voice, knelt before Him, and prayed to Him.
[250]  But sometimes we find a brother forgiving someone who has offended him in a very loud, forceful, and deliberate way.
[251]  He has forgiven generously, but we inwardly feel that something is not right; it seems that the forgiveness is too deliberate; it does not feel like the real thing.
[252]  We must remember that in God's eyes, there is something called reality.
[253]  The problem with many Christians is that they try to do something to make things real.
[254]  But God does not require us to imitate; He only wants the reality, the real thing, to be manifested through us.
[255]  Once we are touched and dealt with by God in a certain matter, once we touch something real, and once we know the way God's Spirit moves within, we will know immediately when we touch a person whether he acts by himself or by the Spirit of God.
[256]  Second Corinthians 4 shows us clearly that where there is reality, there is the supply.
[257]  Paul said, "Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body" v. 10 . This shows us that when the death of Jesus is manifested, His life is also manifested.
[258]  In other words, the life of Jesus is seen in us because the death of Jesus is seen in us.
[259]  If we do not see any spiritual reality, we will have many questions.
[260]  Suppose you have heard a great deal about a person but have never seen him.
[261]  David said, "O God of my righteousness;/You made room for me when I was in straits" Psa 4:1 .
[262]  God allowed David to fall into straits in order that he would be enlarged.
[263]  James 2:5 says, "Listen, my beloved brothers: Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him?"
[264]  God chose the poor of this world in order that they could be rich in faith.
[265]  APPENDIX OBSESSION AND GOD'S LIGHT Scripture Reading: Isa 50:10-11; Psa 36:9
[266]  In the Old Testament, there is one book which shows us what obsessed people are like.
[267]  It is a pitiful and tragic thing to be obsessed.
[268]  There are always reasons for Christians to be obsessed.
[269]  Isaiah 50:10-11 says, "Who among you fears Jehovah;/Who hears the voice of His servant;/Who walks in darkness/ And has no light?/Let him trust in the name of Jehovah,/And rely on his God./Behold, all of you who kindle a fire,/Who surround yourselves with firebrands,/Walk into the light of your fire/And into the firebrands which you have lit./You will have this from My hand:/You will lie down in torment."
