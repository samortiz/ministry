It Being Right to Destroy<br />the Oneness of the Sects</h2><p>We ask God to open their eyes to see that the Body of Christ is one and that the sects are divided. In 1934 there were one thousand five hundred major denominations in the world. There are so many groups who call themselves the church. They have reduced the boundary of the Body of Christ. One is a leg, and the other is a hand. They have divided the Body of Christ. Today some brothers and sisters desire to return to the boundary of the Body and have fellowship in the Body. Others rise up immediately and say that they are destroying the oneness. If someone tells you that you have broken the oneness, you should answer by saying that you have broken the oneness of the divisions but you have not broken the oneness of the Body. It is right to say that we have broken the oneness of the divisions. You cannot join the larger oneness unless you first destroy the smaller oneness.</p><h2 class="head4">4. The Need to Come out of the Smaller Oneness<br />into the Larger Oneness</h2><p>The Christian oneness is as narrow as the Body. Anything foreign to the Body must not be brought in. Christian oneness is also as large as the Body. Any so-called oneness that is smaller than the Body cannot be considered Christian oneness. The more you maintain this so-called oneness, the more you are in division. The more intimacy you have built up with your brothers, the more you are sectarian and divisive. You need to come out of the smaller oneness into the larger oneness. If you want to be part of the larger oneness, you must forsake the smaller oneness. Do not think that oneness is good enough by itself; you must ask what kind of oneness it is. Do not say that any oneness is good enough. The only oneness that is good enough is the oneness of the Body. Whatever oneness is smaller than the oneness of the Body should not be endorsed by Christians. No oneness should be smaller than the Body. Anything that is smaller than the Body of Christ is not acceptable to God.</p><h2 class="head2">E. What Division Is</h2><p>The word division or sect is hairesis in Greek. It is used nine times in the Bible. It is used six times in Acts, and it is translated "sect," such as the sect of the Sadducees, the sect of the Pharisees, and the Nazarene sect. It is used three times in the Epistles. Let us consider the passages in the Epistles where this word is used.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Division Being Possible Only in the Church</h2><p>First Corinthians 11:18 says, "First of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and some part of it I believe." Here it says that the Corinthians were divided among themselves in their meeting. What does it mean to be divided? Division can only be possible in the church. Corinth was a church, and these believers were in the church in Corinth. One day someone said, "I am of Paul." Another person said, "I am of Cephas." A third one said, "I am of Apollos," and a fourth one said, "I am of Christ." The words were wrong, the tone was wrong, and the attitude in spirit was wrong. There were strife and jealousy, and the love of Christ was clearly missing. Whenever they met, those who said that they were of Paul met in one place and those who said that they were of Apollos met in another place. This was division.</p><p>Anyone who wants to accuse another person of being divisive can only raise such an accusation in the church. This accusation is not possible outside the church. A man can only commit the sin of division in the church; he cannot commit such a sin outside the church. A man can revolt only against a legitimate government; he cannot revolt against a government which is itself not legitimate. It is rebellion to separate oneself from a legitimate government, but it is not rebellion to separate oneself from a government that is not legitimate. Therefore, division is something that can only happen in the church. Such division is not well pleasing to God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_105.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_107.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 50: Messages for Building Up New Believers (3) &nbsp; pg 106</div><br></body></html>
