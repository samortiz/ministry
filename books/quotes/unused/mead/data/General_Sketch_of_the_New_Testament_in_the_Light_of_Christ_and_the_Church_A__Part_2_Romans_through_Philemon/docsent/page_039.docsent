   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Law Conducting Us to Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What then is the function of the law?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before the children arrive at the home of the schoolmaster, they need the care of a child-conductor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the same way, before we came to Christ, there was the need of the law to conduct us, to protect us, to keep us from going astray, and to bring us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the position and the function of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God has no intention to ask us to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He knows already that we cannot keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the contrary, God's intention in giving us the law is that we will break the law in order to prove that we are sinful and that we need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, even such a good thing as the law was utilized by the enemy, Satan, to frustrate God's people from contacting Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Parents used a child-conductor to lead the children to the schoolmaster, but the enemy used the child-conductor to keep the children away from the schoolmaster.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was exactly what Satan did in the early days of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Judaizers, those Jews who were so much for Judaism, stressed the law to such an extent that it substituted for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through the Judaizers Satan utilized the law to distract God's people from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the reason that the book of Galatians was written.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was written with the purpose to make us clear that the law is not God's ultimate intention, and it is not something of God's original plan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The law was something added on the way for a certain purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since the Christ of God has come, we are now in the schoolmaster's house, and we are even one with the schoolmaster.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we no longer need the law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The law is over; we must drop the law, forget about the law, give up the law, and put the law aside.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul wrote this book to the Galatians in order to tell them that they no longer needed the law, the child-conductor, because the schoolmaster is here, and we are one with the schoolmaster.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just as Hagar, the concubine, and her son had to be cast away, so the law has to be cast away 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What we need is to stay with Christ as the schoolmaster, enjoy what is in Him, and be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we understand this short word, we can understand the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>ENJOYING CHRIST BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After I was saved, I paid much attention to the books of Romans and Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I spent nearly all that I had to buy some books to help explain them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was told that the best exposition on Galatians was the one written by Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I obtained a copy, and I looked into it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, Luther's exposition on Galatians speaks mainly of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It says little about Christ as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I read the six chapters of Galatians again and again, but I could not understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I could recite nearly every verse in this book, but I could not understand what Paul was talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In recent years the Lord opened my eyes and showed me that Galatians can be summed up in five words: the law and Christ, the cross, and the flesh and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The law is versus Christ, substituting for Christ, and the flesh, the self, is versus the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's intention is that we enjoy Christ, have Christ, experience Christ, and live out Christ by and in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, our foolishness according to our concept causes us to try to keep the law by ourselves, that is, by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the law is contradictory to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same way, the flesh, the self, opposes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are in the Spirit, then Christ is everything to us, but if we are in our self, our flesh, we will try to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The flesh is related to the law, while the Spirit is the very element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now the cross of Christ has come in to put the flesh and self to death and to free us from the law 2:19-20; 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Negatively speaking, we are dead and have nothing to do with the law, and on the positive side, the cross brings us into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we are in the Spirit, we have Christ as our life, we enjoy Christ as everything, we experience Christ, and we live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This causes the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must keep in mind the five key terms of this book: the law, Christ, the flesh, the Spirit, and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everything that this book speaks about is contained within these five terms.</S>
