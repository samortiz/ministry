   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOOKS OF GOLD AND SOCKETS OF SILVER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 32 mentions that the pillars had hooks of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These golden hooks signify the holding and connecting strength of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only the divine nature can connect the pillars to the incarnated and crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only through the holding strength of the divine nature can we bear the testimony of Christ s incarnation and crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen that the four pillars stood upon four sockets of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These sockets indicate Christ s redemption for the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With the tabernacle there was a total of one hundred silver sockets, ninety-six for the boards and four for the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The number one hundred is composed of ten times ten.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ten is the number of human completion and perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ten times ten signifies the full and complete fulfillment of the requirements of the Ten Commandments according to what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The number ten is also seen in the Holy of Holies, a cube measuring ten cubits in each direction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to 38:27, the silver for the redemption of the lives of the children of Israel was a little more than a hundred talents.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the children of Israel were God s redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, each had to pay a piece of silver as a symbol of God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone had to pay the same amount.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From the silver collected from the people, one hundred talents were used to make the one hundred silver sockets for the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This no doubt signifies that as the boards for the building up of God s dwelling place, His redeemed people stand on the solid redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Each of the children of Israel paid a half-shekel of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since a shekel is twenty gerahs, a half-shekel is ten gerahs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, we once again have the number ten signifying human completion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God s commandments for man are also ten.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ten commandments signify a full and complete demand on man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because God s people must bear the complete responsibility and have a complete fulfillment of God s requirements, each must pay ten gerahs.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The total of so many gerahs of silver is a little over a hundred talents.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All these cases of the number ten, indicating complete demand, requirement, responsibility, and fulfillment, are related to Christ and to Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ s redemption is in the number ten.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ten is composed of two times five, with five being the number of responsibility and two the number of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, two times five signifies two times responsibility for a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is Christ with His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The veil covered the ark of the testimony Num 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who entered the Holy Place could see the table, the lampstand, and the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, they could not see the ark of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only did the veil separate the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies; it also covered the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This signifies the separation between man and God Gen 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we can answer the question we raised at the beginning of this message: Why was there the need of a separating veil within the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There had to be a separation because fallen man in his nature is separated from God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because we are still in our fallen nature, there is a separation between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Fallen human beings cannot come to the ark in the Holy of Holies to contact God, converse with God, or have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although God loves us and desires to have fellowship with us, our fallen nature does not allow Him to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are sinful, but He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are unjust, but He is just.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A just and righteous God cannot meet with unjust and unrighteous people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There must be a separation between Him and them, a separation signified by the veil within the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This veil was broken at the Lord s death Matt 27:51 to open a new and living way for us to contact God Heb 10:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because of the fall, we became sinful in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason, there had to be a separation of the ark in the inner chamber of the tabernacle from the outer chamber.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As a result of the fall, man has become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For the most part, in the Bible flesh is a negative term; it denotes the fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We fell and became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now this flesh is a veil separating us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The ark is of a different category of furniture from the table, the lampstand, and the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the table, the lampstand, and the incense altar, we have something of God, but we do not have God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God Himself is at the ark in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although fallen persons may receive God s supply and see His light, they cannot contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To receive supply and enlightenment from God is one thing; to have direct contact with Him is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Suppose, for example, that a son offends his father in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although the father still desires to give the son something to supply him, he cannot see him until the barrier, the separation, between them has been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The father may say, He is my son, and I want to supply him with my riches.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But I cannot see him until the barrier is removed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This illustrates the fact that God will not see us and have fellowship with us or speak with us face to face until our flesh is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God loves us, and He will supply us with His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Nevertheless, until our flesh is broken He will not speak to us face to face from the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is a veil separating us, and this veil is the flesh, our fallen being.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The problem of the flesh, our fallen being, is different from the problem of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is a matter of our being, of our person.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our sins have been forgiven, but we ourselves remain a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even though our sins have been washed away, we are still with the flesh, and the flesh may be unbroken.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This unbroken flesh is the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Exodus 26:33 and 34 say, And you shall put the veil under the clasps, and you shall bring in there, within the veil, the ark of the testimony; and the veil shall make a separation for you between the holy place and the holy of holies.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>And you shall put the propitiatory cover upon the ark of the testimony in the holy of holies.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The clasps under which the veil was put are the clasps on the first layer of the covering.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have seen that this layer, made of ten pieces, each four cubits wide, was forty cubits long.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Fifty clasps of gold connected the two main sections of the covering, each of which measured twenty cubits in length.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Twenty cubits of this layer covered the Holy Place, ten cubits covered the Holy of Holies, and ten cubits hung down over the back side.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Because the curtain, the veil, was under the line formed by the fifty clasps of the ceiling, we know that the Holy of Holies was a cube measuring ten cubits in each direction.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There were ten cubits of the first layer to cover the area from the veil to the standing boards at the rear of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Thus, the Holy of Holies measured ten cubits in length, width, and height.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The fact that the Holy of Holies was a cube measuring ten cubits in three directions signifies completion in completion.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Holy Place, measuring twenty cubits by ten cubits by ten cubits, was twice as large as the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Furthermore, the veil was a square, ten cubits by ten cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It was a square in full completion.</S>
