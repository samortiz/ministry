   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God uses sufferings only to perfect us.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we suffer, we should humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God, knowing that all sufferings are allowed by God, so that we would not rebel in the slightest way but cheerfully submit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the same time, we should resist the devil, knowing that God takes no pleasure in our suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should resist anything that God does not allow and ask God to save us from the sufferings imposed by the devil.</S>
