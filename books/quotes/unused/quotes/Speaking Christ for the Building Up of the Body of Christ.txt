We need to learn how to practice all kinds of meetings: the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the larger meetings of the church
In all of our meetings there should be four basic factors and elements: the word, the spirit, praying, and singing
If we handle these four elements in a proper and living way, there will be a rich display and expression of Christ in all of our meetings
The word of the Lord must have adequate room within us that it may operate and minister these riches into our being
When we refer to the spirit, we are following the Apostle Paul to denote our spirit indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit
Whenever we touch our spirit, use our spirit, exercise our spirit, the Spirit within our spirit immediately works
Before the incarnation, the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-was there, but He had not been cooked, or consummated
After His incarnation, the Triune God picked up humanity and passed through human living for thirty-three and a half years
Incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension are wonderful items that we should love and treasure
Paul wanted to know Christ and the power of His resurrection, and he was even desiring to be conformed to His death
Do you appreciate being conformed to the death of Christ, and have you asked the Lord to conform you to His death?
Of praying in this way, you may have prayed many religious prayers, asking the Lord to help you be holy and humble
We should tell the Lord that we want to know Him and the power of His resurrection, being conformed to His death
The Spirit as the consummation of the processed God is in our spirit, in our mouth, and in our heart , and He will never leave us
When Paul met the Lord on the road to Damascus, the Lord spoke to him, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me'?
He did not realize that the 'Me' he was persecuting was a corporate Me, comprising Jesus the Lord and all His believers
After the Apostle Paul had received the Lord, Ananias told him, 'Rise up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name'
When we call upon the Lord, we receive Him as the consummation of the Triune God, and this consummation is the Spirit
Some may consider that the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God is so marvelous that He is beyond our understanding and apprehension
Outside of the meeting hall we may be very talkative and loud, but the meeting hall is a place that silences people
Do we need to wait for somebody to speak something, to call a hymn, to name a verse, or to read to us in the meeting?
After so many years in the Lord's recovery, many of us still need a leading one to stand up and tell us to read the Scriptures
The strangest thing is this-we are supposed to be the speaking people of the speaking God, yet we do not speak
My intention and my burden is that the saints would learn how to speak forth Christ properly, to speak in the Spirit and with the Spirit
We do not need to wait for the Spirit to descend upon us because the Spirit is in our spirit, in our mouth, and in our heart
According to Romans 10:8, the Spirit as the word is even in the mouth and the heart of an unbeliever as he hears the gospel being preached
Vincent indicate in their writings that the spirit here is not merely the Holy Spirit but our spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit
Some saints have been in the Lord's recovery for many years, but they have never had any change in the meeting
It seems that they will never change because they have not only made up their mind but also their disposition not to change
Brothers and sisters should be 'crazy ones,' ones who are excited in the spirit about their Lord whom they love
A psalm such as Psalm 119, composed of one hundred seventy-six verses, would have to be spoken or sung in a very cultured way
According to Ephesians 5:19, when you are filled in your spirit, you speak in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs
These three verses-1 Corinthians 14:26, Ephesians 5:19, and Colossians 3:16-are printed in our New Testament in black and white
We should learn to use complete clauses, phrases, or expressions in our speaking and speak so that others can follow our speaking
A person who takes piano lessons from a teacher and who practices frequently will eventually be able to play the piano properly
The tragedy is this-when we come to the Word, we always like to pick up the things that fit our natural feeling or our natural thought
To have one speaker with all the others listening is not the biblical way or the Lord's ordained way for the Christian meetings
We also need to be those who sail on, who endeavor to enter into the scriptural way of meeting with all speaking in mutuality
If each of us goes out to visit people with the gospel four times a year, we can gain enough new ones for us to labor on year round
The way to keep people is to take care of our meeting, and the best way to take care of our meeting is by speaking
There will be the possibility for the Lord to build up His Body as an organism for the real expression of the Triune God
In addition to speaking these poems in our meetings, we also need to speak teachings, revelations , the gospel , and personal testimonies
We need to learn how to speak in all these ways in our meetings that they may be enriched, living, and attractive
In chapter one we have seen that the word spoken in our meetings includes poems such as psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs
The gospel for the unsaved and for the newly saved and personal testimonies should also be spoken in our meetings
What we speak should always be within the limit of the teaching of the apostles , avoiding anything other than God's economy
To speak too quickly will confuse the audience, whereas to speak too slowly will exhaust the audience's patience
Another important point is that when we speak a message, we must speak every point with every aspect so accurately
He not only takes care of the car he is driving but also is aware of the other cars around him so that he can avoid having an accident
In the New Testament, especially in 1 Corinthians 14, the apostle not only charged us to speak but also instructed us how to speak
If you read 1 Corinthians 14 carefully, you can see some instruction there concerning our speaking in the meetings
To have this kind of operation in measure of each one part and to have every joint of the supply, we surely need the meetings
Also, each one part has an equal chance to minister something to the entire Body according to his operation in his particular function
He has revealed to us His way to build up not just a so-called church as an organization but to build up a living Body, a living organism
What we have been fellowshipping concerning the scriptural way to meet and to serve is in the printed holy Word
If we make some mistake in the meeting by endeavoring to cooperate with the Lord in functioning, this is glorious
No one gets prepared to give a word in the meeting except for the clergy, the ones who have been appointed to speak
We say we have left the denominations, but the practice, the habit, of the denominations still follows us and even remains in us
The practice of Christianity has annulled the functions of the members of the Body of Christ and has choked them
The night is darker, and there is hardly any sign among the Lord's children that the day of His appearing is going to dawn
For us to have a full success in this new way may take five years, ten years, fifteen years, twenty years, thirty years, or even fifty years
If the way of everyone speaking is better, then we must desperately endeavor to build up a habit of speaking in every meeting
Gold is obviously better than copper, but our possessing of gold depends upon whether we would pay the price or not
It is much easier to establish a religious organization than it is to build up the church as a living organism
It is the way according to tradition, the way according to the customs of the nations, the way that fits man's fallen condition
To walk in the traditional way, the denominational way, there is no need for us to be persons who pray or who love the Lord
She was a young girl standing on the platform in a meeting place that was filled with about one thousand people
Because this young sister loved the Lord to the uttermost, she had the Lord's authority, and the impact was in her gospel preaching
According to the book of Revelation, both the church in Sardis and the church in Laodicea were backsliding churches
Because the saints of Laodicea were neither hot nor cold but lukewarm, the Lord was about to vomit them out of His mouth
We hardly had any sensation that we were so dormant, so lukewarm, so dying, and even so deadening toward others
Why should we remain in such a dormant situation without any sensation that we have to wake up, to rise up, and to be revived?
To have a local church in the Lord's recovery that is living and prevailing with everyone speaking, we all need to be revived
In each of the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the closing word is that we have to overcome
According to God's principle in His creation, He ordained to have a new year, a new month or a new moon, and a new day
Immediately after regenerating us, He stays with us as the Spirit to be one with us and even to mingle Himself with us as one spirit
Very few can avoid these problems because the husband and the wife are so close, and they know each other so well
They feel that they do not need to be careful, so there are always chances for them to get into the self or the flesh
We must live Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and this bountiful supply is right within us
When we have the speaking that utters and releases the holy word, the riches of God's word will be prevailing to touch all the attendants
In the previous chapter we saw eight points concerning the kind of persons we need to be so that we can be the proper speaking ones
During the day our hands get dirty, and they pick up many germs spontaneously, so we have to wash them many times
When exacting such a punishment, it was a safeguard to limit it to thirty-nine stripes, or forty stripes less one
Because of our limited facilities, we had to bring water in a basin from another place to our rooms so that we could wash ourselves
We must have such a clearance within us if we are going to speak in the meetings or even if we are going to speak the gospel to anyone
When we do not have a clearance within our conscience in our fellowship with the Lord, our speaking will be reluctant
When we have such a conscience, we can speak not only to the Lord but also to the unbelieving sinners with boldness
Regardless of whom we speak to, as long as we are speaking the word of God, Christ, or the gospel, we need a cleared conscience
In order for us to learn to speak in the meetings, we must get ourselves cleared up and preserved in a clear condition
The Spirit in its essential aspect, the Spirit of essence, the Spirit of life, is for our being, our life, our living, our existence
As long as a person opens his heart to the Lord in prayer, believing into Him and calling upon His name, he gets regenerated
When we open up our mouth to call on the name of the Lord and confess all of our sins to Him we are filled within spontaneously and normally
We may have a burden to speak, yet it may be hard for us to speak because we are short of the infilling of the Spirit
When we deal with the Lord properly and adequately, we will have the assurance, the faith, that the Spirit of power is upon us
When we speak in the meetings, however, we must learn in the same principle to release our spirit in a positive way
From Philippians 3:8-10 and 12-14, we can see that Paul was accumulating the experiences of Christ day after day
Many times when we come to the meetings, we do not have much experience of Christ as a base, or a foundation, for our speaking
We can speak the word, but our speaking of the word needs a backing, and this backing is our real experience of Christ
We have the same experience whenever we read the publications of the ministry that expound the Bible in the way of life
The best time is in the morning, and the best way is to pick up two to four verses from a specific book of the New Testament
When we come back to these verses in Philippians again with an open and empty spirit, we will receive more light
The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation
Thank the Lord that we have the Bible and also a hymnal with hymns that were composed according to the truths of the Bible
We composed our main hymnal with so many hymns to show others that we in the Lord's recovery have the knowledge of the truth
Among these one thousand and eighty hymns, there are at least over three hundred very good hymns which are good for singing and for speaking
We have discovered in the Word and in our experience that speaking a hymn is much more important and profitable than singing it
We do not have such a habit due to the background of Christianity, and our function has been killed because of this background
If we learn to build up a habit of speaking in any meeting, our children, the new ones, will spontaneously become speaking ones
If we spoke a Life-study Message together, this would make the best message full of the divine riches and the refreshing utterances
We should not merely read the message but speak it, and this speaking should not be an individual speaking but a corporate speaking
We should always have something to speak in all the meetings as a freewill offering to God and to the audience
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
Sometimes He held His meetings on the mountain top, and quite often He held meetings on the seashore, mostly around the Sea of Galilee
Hymn 1281 was written according to that light, but in our practice after 1972, it seems that much of this light disappeared from among us
When we come together we must speak well about our Triune God, about the Father, about the Son, and about the Spirit
The guard that keeps the gopher away is the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit who is the consummation of the processed Triune God
It is a well-speaking of the all-inclusive, compound, processed, consummated, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold intensified Spirit
We can bring any of these publications, such as the Truth Lessons or the Life-study Messages, and speak them to one another
What takes place in that meeting will be a long blessing out of our mouth to our Father, to His Son, and to His wonderful Spirit
Programs limit the function to certain attendants, thus robbing the other attendants of their opportunity to function
All the regular meetings of the church should be kept open and free for all the attendants to have an equal chance to function
If some of the saints have a burden to release a word of revelation or a word of vision, a special gathering will be needed
Corinthians 107 says Neither become idolaters as some of them as it is written The people sat down to eat and drink and stood up to play
In the past we have had some wonderful meetings, but some of the attendants were not well-speaking but were playing in their speaking
Within the three terms of our training there, about twenty-six thousand people were baptized, mostly through the trainees
Eventually, thirty-eight thousand people have been baptized in Taipei, but our manpower can only take care of about six thousand
Students of science must change their way in the laboratory many times in order to discover principles and rules
As a rule each gospel team that goes out should be composed of three persons of different ages a young one an old one and one in the middle
Ideally the youngest should be a sister, the middle one a brother, and the third one an older brother or sister
We have found on many occasions that the most prevailing ones to bring people into the faith were the young sisters
Up to the last door there may only be ten minutes left, but when you get into this door, everything is in the heavens
Saints from other localities or full-timers may be gone the following week, and the new babes would be left as orphans
We must be clear that when we knock on doors, we local saints are the nursing mothers of the new ones whom we bring to the Lord
At least one fourth of the church would do it, so out of one hundred meeting together, twenty-five will go out
Do not forget the Lord's word in John 15:16: 'I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain'
Twenty-five out of one hundred saints, each bringing in four persons, will yield a one hundred percent increase, a onefold increase
Tell him that the Lord Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit, that he has a spirit, and that this divine Spirit abides in his spirit
Continue to have home meetings with the new ones once every three days for the first month to raise them in the Lord
Also try during these two or three months to bring them into the bigger meetings, especially on the Lord's Day
At that time we can make it clear to them that they should serve the Lord in the church and do the things that we have been doing
We should instruct them and lead them to do what we are doing, hoping that within one year they will be raised up in the church life
In your discernment you may realize that another person would not like to have a guest stay longer than one hour
Rather, in everything you do in your contact with them, give them a very positive impression that would not bother them or spoil them
For this reason you must know the Life Lessons, the Truth Lessons, the Life-study Messages, and our other books
We have the best teachings and the healthy food, and everything is so excellent, but without new people, we are finished
We must come back to find the God-ordained way revealed in the holy Word, and we have found this way in the past three and a half years
What we have been speaking in this period of time is altogether biblical and according to God's heart and will
The two look very much alike in stature color and shape until they blossom the wheat with golden yellow fruit and the tares with black fruit
He says, 'He who believes and is baptized shall be saved' , and we do our duty to help people to believe and be baptized
We have seen that according to 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25, we need both speaking and singing in our meetings
The speaking is not only the speaking of the word of God or the speaking forth of Christ but also the speaking of the hymns
Many of the missionaries called us 'the little flock' fifty or sixty years ago because of the name of our hymnal
Nee announced a few times that the little flock was just the title of our hymnal and not a name that we adopted to denominate ourselves
As a result, Brother Nee made the decision to change the name of our hymnal to Hymns, which is also the name of our present hymnal
In the early forties, we felt that we had the need to collect these hymns in a small hymnal for the sake of the gospel work
In 1947 and 1948, many young people in Shanghai were brought into the church life through our work on the campus
At the time this hymn was written, the church was considered as a fold, but the fold in John 10 refers to the Jewish religion
The Lord's desire was to bring the Gentile and the Jewish believers together into one flock to form the church
In this delicate and difficult work, we departed from the meaning and words of the original author only where it was necessary
The word blessing is used here not to refer to the good things the Triune God has given us but to the praise, the blessing, we offer to Him
-and an example of a good hymn on the experience of the Triune God is 608-'What mystery, the Father, Son, and Spirit'
The Bible reveals that there are two aspects of the filling of the Spirit-the inward filling for life and the outward filling for power
Simpson cannot be found in today's hymnals of the Christian and Missionary Alliance churches, but we have included them in our hymnal
Hymn 948 and 949 are excellent hymns concerning Christ as the hope of glory, and 972 is a very good hymn on the ultimate manifestation
We can choose three hymns from our hymnal to illustrate what we mean by the standard of the hymns-70, 154, and 152
Some hymns are of a low standard, others are of a higher standard, and others are of the very highest standard
Tis not hard to die with Christ When His risen life we know; 'Tis not hard to share His suff'rings When our hearts with joy o'erflow
The Judaizers endeavored to bring the Galatians back to the shadow; the Apostle Paul struggled to keep them in the reality
When we select a hymn for a meeting, we must do it according to our sensation based on the thought of the hymn
Although the English version is very good, the Chinese version is more poetic since it is easier to rhyme words in Chinese than in English
When we compiled our hymnal, we picked up this important point of having the proper and uplifted melody for the hymns
We listened to the melodies that we selected to see whether they fit the thought and the sensation of the hymns with which they were matched
We must remember that the hymns are not only for singing, but they also are even more for speaking in the meetings
Question: We have been trying to write children's songs using the Scriptures to help the children memorize the Word
If we want to help the children remember some verses from the Bible, we can simply instruct them to read and recite the verses
When we published our hymnal, we had the intention to show others that we knew the truth and that we were all-inclusive
Hymn 310Glorious freedom wonderful freedomis another Pentecostal hymn that we included in our hymnal on the assurance and joy of salvation
Even though we do not sing this hymn often, it is an excellent song on God's faithfulness, so it should not be dropped from a revised hymnal
Although we might not use many of the remaining hymns in our meetings, we would have to keep them for the sake of the truth
In the past twenty-two years, we have received many higher visions from the Lord, but there are no hymns to match or express them
Can you fellowship with us about the use of the hymns in the Lords table meeting since it seems like that is where we use most of the hymns
We did not allow the saints in the Lord's table to choose hymns that were far away from the purpose of the table
We instructed the saints strictly that they should only choose hymns in the proper category for the Lord's table meeting
The spiritual songs and hymns are the cream of a person's writing, thought, learning, life experience, and spiritual experience
These portions of the Word need some melodies which help the saints get into the feeling of the New Testament economy
We can rewrite the verses to fit the meter and have the appropriate rhyme while maintaining the revelation and the truth that is there
If all the saints in the Lord's recovery practiced speaking the hymns in the meetings, the meetings would be living, refreshing, and rich
We need to hold a strong learning spirit to learn a 'new language,' that is, to learn how to meet in the new way
We need to practice all the points of fellowship in this book so that our meetings can reach the goal of Gods economy to build up the church
A praying person is one who not only prays but who also has a praying spirit with a desire and an aspiration to pray
Whenever we are intending to go to a meeting, we must spend some time to pray for at least five to ten minutes
Just before the game, the player participates in certain warm-up exercises so that he is fully prepared when the game begins
When we come to the meeting, we should come to the front as fighting soldiers to conquer the enemy and as prepared athletes to win the game
When we pray, the Lord will show us all of our faults, shortcomings, failures, defeats, wrongdoings, and mistakes
If we pray and make a thorough confession of all our sins, we will spontaneously enjoy the filling of the Holy Spirit
Once you have prayed and dealt with your sins to be filled with the Holy Spirit, you must learn to abide in the fellowship with the Lord
When you have prayed, dealt with your sins, and are ready to come to the meeting, it is best not to receive a phone call
The enemy tries to frustrate us either from coming to the meeting or from coming to the meeting in a prepared state
Your wife may have received the mail at noon, but she forgot to tell you about a letter for you until you are ready to go to the meeting
While we are on the way to the meeting place and when we arrive, we can continue to enjoy the Lord in this way
They assign certain saints to bring hot food, others to bring salad, others to bring bread, and others to bring potatoes
The goal of our meeting is to exhibit Christ, and the Christian meeting is an exhibition of the Christian daily life
The unscriptural, traditional way of meeting annuls, chokes, and deadens the living members of the Body of Christ
One can build an article of furniture by arranging and attaching pieces of wood to one another in an organizational way
The reason why the Lord has not come back yet is because there is not such a living organism on this earth to match Him
We cannot see the organic Body of Christ because the meetings in the traditional way cannot fulfill God's purpose to build up the Body
Question: Could you give a little more explanation regarding not needing a prearranged program for our meetings?
When we come together, an instant decision may come out, and we may decide to only cover the first part or the first few pages
To use something like the Life-studies is not wrong, but be careful that the saints do not build up a habit of relying on this too much
In particular, we want to cover some crucial points concerning our need to pay full attention to the way of speaking
If you have been a Christian for twenty years and have attended three meetings a week, you have been in about three thousand meetings
Over fifty years ago Brother Watchman Nee, the pioneer in the Lord's recovery among us, saw the light concerning the way to meet
Now we have been in the line of the recovery for over sixty years, and we have had much practice and experience
Whether the actual time for you to speak will come or not is another matter, but you must have the thought to speak
There should be no overlapping but rather a good continuation from one person's speaking to the next person's speaking
By your experience you know what it is to speak without the spirit, and you also know what it is to speak with the spirit
Sometimes the brothers may have to tell the person who is giving a sea story to stop and give time for others to share
Everyone should consider that there may only be an hour and a half for many people to speak, and a sea story takes too much time
Some Chinese families living in the United States may find it hard to drop their habit of eating with chopsticks
They would say that without chopsticks the flavor in eating is spoiled and that with them every course tastes so good
Some older brothers and sisters and even some young ones who have been with us for a few years may not feel so happy about it
We have studied and investigated and have seen that the Body of Christ cannot be built up in the old way of Christianity
According to the record of the New Testament, the church at the time of the apostles was not better than it is today
It was he who pioneered the way to bring the gospel to all of Asia Minor, and it was he who taught the saints there
By the time of his martyrdom, all who were in Asia forsook him with his ministry due mainly to different opinions
The reason He has tolerated the situation is that He would not do anything by Himself with His divine power alone
Question If something is spoken that is incorrect according to the truth should we let it go or should we correct the speaker in the meeting
If the mistake is serious and concerns basic truths, we should correct the error immediately in order to let people know what our faith is
In other cases in which an error is made in a person's testimony, the correction should not be made immediately after the testimony
In another meeting you may give a little message telling the saints to learn how to follow the trend in the meeting
The things of the world or our own history, the story concerning ourselves, may be the substance of our speaking instead of Christ
In the church we should always take Christ as the very constituting element, composing substance, and content of our speaking
We must learn to pick up some expressions and utterances, either from the Bible or from highly valued spiritual writings
Spontaneously we will accumulate a good vocabulary to express our knowledge concerning Christ and our experience of Christ
By telling a story in this way, he mingles his speaking with Christ and applies Christ as the element in his speaking
To take Christ as the center and element of our speaking does not mean simply to choose a topic concerning Christ
If we do not have the assurance that we have Christ as the center and element of our speaking, it is better not to speak
We are all members of the Body, and we are all priests in the church serving our Lord in a particular, separated, and sanctified way
We need to have the constant utterance as a base since our speaking should be built upon some constant understanding and knowledge
If we are going to stir up and inspire people, we must have the instant utterance, the utterance that comes to us at the moment
Andrew Murray once said that a powerful and unlimited speaker always has some instant utterance, something new
If we love Christ, love the church, and love the Christian experience, the scriptural practice will not be a hardship to us
If we have a heart for the Lord and the church, we will not feel that anything concerning God's economy is a hardship
At the end of the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus asked Peter three times if he loved Him because our life with the Lord needs such a love
At the end of the book of Ephesians, Paul said, 'Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption'
To those of us who have a heart for the Lord and the deep things of God, messages on these spiritual things are like beautiful melodies
Little children who do not realize the value of a diamond might treasure the box that contains the diamond more than the diamond itself
The experienced saints can sense that there is a treasure within my speaking, and that treasure is the Lord's speaking
If we learn these points concerning the way of speaking and practice them, the church meetings will be very much uplifted and enriched
We cannot take the traditional way of coming to the meetings unprepared without any consideration or sensation
All of us have to get ourselves prepared to speak in the meetings and look to the Lord for His speaking in our speaking
The Lord's inner anointing is the moving of the Holy Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God
We need to endeavor to speak everything in the meetings with a verse or a portion of the Scripture as its base
On the day of Pentecost, the Spirit was like a rushing violent wind that filled the room where the believers were
We do not want mere doctrines without some reality for the Christian experience and without the supply of life
Because we were raised up, educated, and instructed in many ways in human society, we have a tendency to speak secular things
Our speaking with wrong quotations from others' books may distract others and destroy our intention to build up the church
To bring in quotations from other books may even create dissension, so we have to be careful when we quote others' writings
If it is really needed, we may refer to negative stories, but it is altogether wrong to mention people's names
Whenever we speak in the meetings, we must avoid speaking a number of unrelated points without a substantial emphasis
By our practice we will learn how to speak the hymns or perhaps to speak something from the printed publications of the ministry
Christianity however has annulled the function of the members of Christ by building up one speaker as the coach to play ball by himself
To speak from the Bible is more than adequate for a meeting because the Bible was written in such a spiritual, economical, and rich way
According to 1 Corinthians 14:26, however, we should not need to have any printed material to use in the meetings to help us speak
We may temporarily use the Life Lessons, the Truth Lessons, the Life-study Messages, or some other spiritual books with weight
We should not use them in the way of one person speaking or some persons reading but in the way of everyone speaking
We may use a 'cane,' such as the Life Lessons, the Truth Lessons, or the Life-study Messages to help us at the present time
Whenever we attend a home meeting or a small group meeting, we should avoid the preaching or teaching of the pastor or preacher type
If we go into someone else's home and the family does not know how to cook, we must remember that the kitchen is not ours
The daughter of a mother who is an expert in cooking may not know how to cook well because she has been replaced by her mother
In the practical service of the church, the leader type may not allow anyone else to clean the restrooms or vacuum the floor
One concern is that you will go in the type of a leader, and the other concern is that you will go in the type of a manager
Whatever we have, whatever we are, whatever we can do, and whatever we have accomplished should all go to the cross
When we go to a home meeting or a small group meeting, we should hold an attitude that everything of us should be crossed out
Anything that is natural, that is not holy or separated, and anything that we do by our natural strength should be crossed out
We should not ask them to come to a meeting but we should bring a meeting to their homes and help them to carry out a meeting in their homes
Because there are only three to five people in a home meeting, it is easy to stop the meeting and talk a little bit
Otherwise we will make ourselves the pastors and the new ones in our home meetings will be our audience like a congregation in Christianity
Some of the brothers may not understand a certain revelation from the Word even after it is shared a number of times
It is amazing how little children are able to learn a language without formal instruction and without a dictionary
We need to be emptied and unloaded in our spirit to receive the new things, the things of the kingdom of the heavens
When we see them after a couple of days, we can informally check with them to see if they are reading the Bible
We may even check with them, 'Before you called on the name of the Lord, did you ever have this inward feeling'?
We can tell them that this is very good and that they now have the real experience of a Christian, but we should not teach them too much
In the home meetings, we need to help even the children to call, speak, or sing a hymn and to quote or speak the word of the Bible
You can tell her that it is easy for her to call a hymn in the meeting and that it is even easier to sing a hymn
Go to the meeting with a purpose and keep at least ten minutes of the meeting to fill the new ones with some riches of your purpose
Do not do anything to give people a bad feeling, but always do something in a pleasant way to arrive at your goal, to reach your destination
In the church we have been speaking to the dear saints for years, and not many have come to the full knowledge of the truth
We need to be brought into the full knowledge of the truth and we also need to bring the new ones into this full knowledge
We have pointed out that this kind of material can be considered as a 'cane' in the initial stage to help us in the meetings
Suppose you have been meeting in a certain home for fifty minutes and a little girl in the family turns on the television
We have to learn how to stand on the Lord's word and exercise our faith and even lay our hands on the sick ones to heal their sickness
We need to practice taking care of the new ones in the home meetings and small group meetings until we become experts
We have to practice and exercise in a regular way by caring for the new ones in the home meetings week after week
We need to practice constantly, week after week and year after year, to care for the new ones and to raise them up
Our old way of meeting was a deadening way because we met in a way that could not meet the needs of all attendants
You must tell the new ones how they should participate in the meeting by either praying, calling a hymn, or singing
By your training in meeting after meeting for a couple of months, they will eventually join you in speaking spontaneously
Some of the Chinesespeaking saints were able to understand English and translate for the English speakers during the preaching of the gospel
When we began to take care of the home meetings, the English speakers were not able to do much for the meeting
It was too difficult to translate for them, so we decided not to keep the English speakers in Taipei to help with the home meetings
It is possible that some might not be happy to preach the gospel in this way, but we should not impose this on them
You also need to endeavor to practice the new way as the Lord leads according to the limit of the circumstances
You may be in a local church which does not practice the preaching of the gospel by visiting people in their homes
In the old way, we were inviting the people, the 'fish,' to come to us, and they would not answer our invitation
As we take care of them they will grow, and after a year they will be raised up to do what we are doing in the gospel service to the Lord
If we take this way quietly without promoting it or imposing it on anyone, we will not offend anyone or stir up different opinions
If we are doing a good work to preach the gospel and raise up the home meetings, we should not have a proud spirit or attitude
Even if the church in your locality does not practice the new way, you still have to submit yourself to the church
You have to see what the atmosphere in the meeting is and know the attitude and the spirit of the entire church
If the atmosphere in the meeting and the spirit and attitude of the church is against this, do not give such a testimony
If the church in your locality does not like to practice according to the scriptural way, submit yourself to their present practice
If five saints are gathered together in a home and two or three of them are opposing, do not talk about the new way
How can there be harmony between a group of people, when some of them are positive for the scriptural way and some are not?
We are harmonious for the one purpose of having the Lord's recovery to keep the testimony of the oneness of the Body of Christ
You must endeavor to function, not according to your preference but according to the present flow in the meeting
We must realize that there is an old traditional way of meeting and serving existing on this earth among the Lord's children
The old way has been built up in Christianity for centuries, and we have it with us to some extent in the Lord's recovery
We have to expect that some will feel unhappy when we want to take away the old way and replace it with the new way
We need to pray that all the churches with all the saints would have the heavenly vision and the bountiful supply of the Spirit
The church in Chicago publishes a newsletter with testimonies concerning the effectiveness of the Lord's new way
