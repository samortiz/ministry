<h1 class="series">The Truth Concerning the Ultimate Goal of God&rsquo;s Economy</h1>
<h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Recently, someone who identified himself as &ldquo;J. S.&rdquo; published a false and slanderous article concerning Brother Witness Lee&rsquo;s teaching. The article was entitled, &ldquo;The Worst Blasphemous Words of Witness Lee against God.&rdquo; We feel that we must present something to refute what he has said. First, we would like to present clearly and briefly what Brother Lee has said concerning the high peak of the divine revelation of God&rsquo;s eternal economy, which this opposing one has slanderously distorted. Then we would specifically like to address how this opposing one misinterprets Brother Lee with an evil intent by omitting crucial points of what he has said, by distorting what he has said, and by loosely translating what he has said. Finally, we would like to present what some prominent teachers in the past have said concerning this high peak of God&rsquo;s divine revelation. Because what our brother is releasing in the Lord&rsquo;s present ministry is so crucial, the enemy, the deceiver, will do everything he can to fight against it with his lies and distortions. May the Lord grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see the depths of His eternal economy so that we can walk in the light of His divine revelation to arrive at a full-grown man.</p>
