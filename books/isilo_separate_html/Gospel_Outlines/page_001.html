<h2 class="head1">FOREWORD</h2> 

<p><em>Gospel Outlines</em> is a record of the messages given in a special training on service with the church in Taipei during October 1954. How we thank the Lord that in these days, as He is recovering the preaching of the gospel among us, He has seen fit to release this treasury of gospel material to His Body! These outlines abound with the riches of Christ, embodied in the gospel truths. Thus, our gracious Lord has freshly fortified us to &ldquo;preach the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This book is more than just a compilation of riches; it is also a practical training in gospel preaching. The outline style mingles the points of the gospel messages with valuable instruction on how to preach the gospel. The reader is helped, therefore, not only in what to preach, but also in how to do it most effectively. We can testify that as we have put this material to use we have been greatly helped in our preaching, and have experienced the Lord&rsquo;s rich blessing upon our meetings!</p>
<p><em>Part I</em> of this volume consists of sixty gospel messages taken from the Old Testament. <em>Part II</em> comprises one hundred fifty messages covering New Testament subjects. In addition, <em>Part III</em> consists of an eight part series of special topics for gospel preaching. An index has been included in which the messages are classified according to category. This allows the reader to cross-reference other messages in the same category.</p>
<p>Although much has been prepared for us in these outlines, still, on our part, much is required. The riches provided here by our brother must be applied with much prayer and in the spirit of gospel preaching. Many of the outlines are rich and lengthy, demanding less additional development. Others, particularly toward the end of this volume, are presented in a simpler outline form, and require more &ldquo;cooking.&rdquo; However, only a fresh burden from the living Lord and the anointing of the Spirit can assure that these outlines will fulfill the purpose for which they were intended. May the Lord provide all the gospel preachers the grace to labor together with Him to make His gospel so rich, so convincing, and so prevailing.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that these outlines have not been reviewed in translation or composition by the speaker and any inaccuracies are the sole responsibility of the editors. We gratefully acknowledge the joint effort of many in the production of this work. May the Lord use this book to gain His own glory in the church through the gospel.</p>
