Verse 4 says that Christ is the end of the law. If you desire to take in Christ, you surely have to realize this. Nearly all of us are under a certain law. The Jewish people are under the law given through Moses, but I am afraid that you are still under a certain law made by Christianity or made by yourself. There are the Moses-made law, the Christianity-made law, and the self-made law. I believe that we all have some self-made law.</P><P>You may wonder what I mean by a self-made law. Then I would ask you, "Don't you have the intention to work more for the Lord?" Surely this is very good, but this is a self-made law. A husband may pray, "O Lord, help me to love my wife." A wife may pray, "O Lord, help me to submit myself to my husband." These are self-made laws. Even you may have made up your mind that from now on you will call on the name of the Lord. Even this is a law made by yourself. Then you would say, "What shall we do?" Even this desire to do something is a self-made law. If you make up your mind that from today you will pray-read the Bible, this is a law. I assure you that all who have ever made such a law have had a failure. Trying to do anything is a law. Do not try to do anything. Just forget about doing something. But how can you forget about doing? Even if you try to forget about doing, that is still a law.</P><P>We need to see that when Christ comes to us, this is the end of our self-made laws. I cannot help you, but if Christ comes to you, you will be stopped. Christ is the end of the law. Saul of Tarsus is a good example for us. He was a man under the law made by Moses and by the Jewish religion. He was also under the law made by himself. He was trying to keep all the laws made by Moses, all the rules made by Judaism, and all the desires and intentions set up by himself. While he was trying his best to keep all the laws, the light and the voice came from the heavens, and he fell to the ground (Acts 9:3-4). That day on the way to Damascus the one who was trying his best to keep the law and persecute Jesus fell on the ground and called, "Lord!" He said, "Who are You, Lord?" (v. 5). Even before he came to know the Lord, he called on the Lord (cf. Rom. 10:13).</P><P>At that time the Lord Jesus came into Saul. We know this because his whole activity was stopped. He was stopped from the Moses-made law; he was stopped from the Judaism-made law; and he was stopped from his self-made law. Christ is the end of the law. Saul was so intelligent, clear, and strong, yet he was stopped and became blind. He lost his sight. He could not do anything, and he did not know where to go. Before that time, he was a leading one, one whom others followed. But after Jesus came into him, his sight was lost. He did not know what to do or where to go. He needed somebody else to lead him (v. 8). He was fully stopped. This is because Christ is the end of the law.</P><P>In the same way, if Jesus would grant you a gracious visitation, your whole activity would be stopped. We may pray, "From now on, Lord, help me to love my wife. From now on, Lord, help me to submit myself to my husband. From now on, Lord, help me to pray-read. From now on help me to do this or that." But as long as you have so many doings, this proves that you are short of the gracious visitation of the Lord Jesus. His visitation will stop all your activities because He is the end of the law.</P><P>I am afraid that many of you still have certain desires, certain intentions, and even certain schedules. All of these are your self-made laws. I cannot tell you to stop. If I did, this would also be a law. Do not promise me that from tonight you will stop your activity. This is another law. When Jesus came to Saul of Tarsus, he was fully puzzled. He said, "Who are You, Lord?" He lost his direction. Before that time he was so clear and bold in taking the lead. But after meeting Christ, he did not know where to go or what to do. I do not want this fellowship in this chapter to open your eyes. Instead, I hope that it will blind you. Have you lost your sight? Or are you still clear? Do you still know what to do? It is a real blessing to lose your sight. Saul of Tarsus lost his sight and his direction because Christ as the end of the law came into him.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
