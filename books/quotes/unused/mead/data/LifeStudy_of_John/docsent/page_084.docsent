   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Eternal Life, the Son s Hand,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Father s Hand</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>for the Security of the Sheep</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 10:28-29 the Lord says, And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The eternal life is for the believers living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both the Son s hand as the hand of power and the Father s hand as the hand of love are for the believers protection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eternal life shall never run out, and the hands of the Son and the Father shall never fail.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So the believers are eternally secured and shall never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I first began to work in this country, many dear saints asked me if I believed in eternal security.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I always answered, Why not?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After awhile everyone knew that I do believe in the wonderful, eternal security.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as we have eternal life, we have eternal security.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What can be more secure than eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have the real insurance policy in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not only do I have eternal life, but I have two hands the Son s hand of power and the Father s hand of love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These two hands embrace me, and Satan is unable to snatch me out.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am eternally secured by the divine life and by these two divine hands.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These hands are always on the alert, and no one can kidnap us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we shall never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have a divine living and an almighty protection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, we, the sheep, are secured forever.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not argue doctrinally about eternal security.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We enjoy the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you have eternal security?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not ask whether you believe in eternal security but whether you have it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regardless of whether or not we believe in the doctrine of eternal security, we are eternally secured.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>D. The Persecution of Religion</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verse 30 the Lord said, I and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here the Lord asserts His deity, that He is God 10:33; 5:18; 1:1; 20:28; 1 John 5:20; Phil 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Jews took up stones in order to stone Him, saying, We are not stoning you for a good work, but for blasphemy; and because you, being a man, are making yourself God 10:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Jews persecuted Christ because of His blasphemy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Religion claims that we preach heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Religion was trying to protect its belief.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, they had no belief.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They had unbelief and they were protecting vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, they persecuted the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>E. Life s Desertion of Religion</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>and Life s New Standing</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 10:40-42 we see life s desertion of religion and life s new standing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ deserted Judaism and went to the place where John the Baptist preached the New Testament gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord deserted Judaism and took a new standing for the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today we are here on this new standing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are following the shepherd, we are on the pasture, and we have a new standing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The hour finally came that the Lord gave up Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although the religionists sought to take Him again, He escaped out of their hands 10:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He went beyond Jordan into the place where John the Baptist earlier had baptized Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The religious Jews had used the law to form Judaism, which had confined the chosen people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, John the Baptist was absolutely separated out of Judaism because he lived in the wilderness, which was outside of Jerusalem beyond the Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>John the Baptist lived in the wilderness, always pointing to Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>John the Baptist pointed to Christ because the age of the sheepfold was over and a new age had begun.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All of the chosen people of God had to give up the fold and come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The testimony of John the Baptist was simply that of urging people to come out of the fold and to enter the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After John the Baptist s announcement of Christ, the Lord went into the fold in order to bring the sheep out of the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Of course, He was not stealing the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He went into Judaism in order that His sheep might hear His voice and come out of the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By coming out of the fold and by walking ahead of His sheep, He led His sheep out of the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After the Lord came out of Judaism, He went to the very place where John the Baptist had testified of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His going to the wilderness beyond Jordan was a sign of His coming out of Judaism and going to a place that was outside of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This chapter finally says that many people went to Him and believed in Him 10:41-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do you know the significance of this?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It simply means that many people followed Him as sheep follow a shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is the shepherd who went into the sheepfold to lead the sheep out.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When He came out of the sheepfold, all of the sheep followed Him to a place where the testimony was that of giving up the Old Testament and realizing the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The testimony of the Old Testament was the sheepfold, but the testimony of the New Testament is Christ as the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Are you a sheep?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do you prefer to remain in the fold when the pasture is ready?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do you still like to be confined and kept under the custody of the fold?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Or will you come out of the fold and go into the pasture to enjoy the riches of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today, the Lord Jesus is no longer in Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Good Shepherd is no longer in the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He is staying where the testimony of the New Testament is established.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He has given up the fold and is staying in the place where He is the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, you also must give up the fold and come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This means that you must give up Judaism and come to take Christ as your everything.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He is everything to you.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Just look at the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The pasture is everything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The sheep enjoy the pasture as the resting place, the food, the water, the life supply, and as everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You too must come out of the fold and go into the pasture that is, you must come out of Judaism and go to Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You have to come out of the law and go to the place where Christ is enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Where is Christ now?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Christ is outside of all the Judaistic types of groups and in the place where John the Baptist testified of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Now you know the right meaning of this chapter, which is the conclusion of the case concerning the blind man who was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Before Christ came, all of God s chosen people were in a sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Now, since Christ has come, the time of the sheepfold is over.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>You must leave the fold in order to come to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Now is the time for you to take Christ as your pasture and to enjoy Him as your everything.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You must live in Him and take Him as your all.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Consider this picture.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Look at the sheep and the pasture and see how much the pasture means to the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If you are truly a sheep, you will tell people how you long to be out of the fold, because in it there is too much bondage and confinement.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>There is simply no freedom because you are kept under the custody of a guardian.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Now you know where there is the pasture, the freedom, and the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Christ is the all-inclusive pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The fold is the law and Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Christ, the very exit out of the fold, is the shepherd who leads you out of the fold and brings you to Himself who can be everything to you.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He is now your pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Allow me to repeat once again.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Where is Christ now?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He is not in Judaism, but in the very place where the New Testament is testified.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Christ is in the place where John the Baptist testified of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This is very meaningful because the Lord is now out of the fold and is standing in a new position where He is everything to the chosen people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Therefore, you must come out of the old fold and go into the new pasture where Christ Himself is everything to you.</S>
