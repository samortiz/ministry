<h2 class="head1">IV. THE FOURTH CONFLICT</h2><h2 class="head2">A. On God&rsquo;s Side</h2><p>In the fourth conflict with Pharaoh, the Lord smote all the borders of Egypt with frogs (8:2). Frogs came up from the waters of the rivers, the streams, and the ponds. By coming upon Pharaoh, all his servants, and all the Egyptians, the frogs destroyed the enjoyment of the comfortable Egyptian living. How troublesome these frogs were! By sending the plague of the frogs upon the Egyptians, the Lord wanted the Egyptians to realize that their life in Egypt was not really a life of enjoyment, but a life of trouble. The Egyptians did not realize that, in the eyes of God, all their enjoyments were &ldquo;frogs.&rdquo; Everything they gathered from the Nile, the source of the world&rsquo;s supply, was a frog. The waters in Egypt that once produced fish now brought forth frogs.</p><p>In principle, we may experience the same thing today. Throughout the course of my life, I have gathered many things that turned out to be &ldquo;frogs.&rdquo; At first, I enjoyed these things. But one by one, they became &ldquo;frogs.&rdquo; What I thought was a &ldquo;fish&rdquo; was actually a &ldquo;frog.&rdquo; Sooner or later, everything you gain in this world will become a &ldquo;frog.&rdquo; This means that everything you gather up from the &ldquo;Nile,&rdquo; the source of supply for the world, will be a cause of trouble to you. Material possessions and even people dear to you can be &ldquo;frogs.&rdquo; When the things we treasure turn into &ldquo;frogs,&rdquo; then we realize that the enjoyment of the world is not the true enjoyment. On the contrary, it is very troublesome.</p><p>The frogs in Egypt did not kill anyone, but they were a nuisance to everyone. They were everywhere&mdash;in their houses, in their bedrooms, upon their beds, in their ovens, and in their kneading troughs. What a nuisance!</p><p>Whether the plague of the frogs was a form of punishment or a revelation depended upon the attitude of the people who were subject to the plague. If they had received the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, it would have been a revelation to them, an exposure of the fact that Egypt with its enjoyment is a land of frogs. This is the meaning of the living of the world. Every aspect of the world&rsquo;s enjoyment is a &ldquo;frog.&rdquo; Those who refused the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, however, had to endure the plague of the frogs as a punishment.</p><h2 class="head2">B. On Pharaoh&rsquo;s Side</h2><p>The Egyptian magicians were able to do three of the things that Aaron did with his rod: change the water into blood, change the rod to a serpent, and bring forth frogs. With their enchantments Pharaoh&rsquo;s magicians brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt (8:7). However, they could not take the frogs away.</p><p>A preacher of the gospel must be able to bring forth &ldquo;frogs.&rdquo; This means that he must cause people to realize that all the enjoyments and preoccupations of the world are &ldquo;frogs.&rdquo; However, certain philosophical teachers also are able to make people realize that the things of the world usurp them and damage them. Evangelists expose the real situation of living in the world, but some &ldquo;magicians&rdquo; or philosophers can do the same thing. As we preached the gospel in China, we frequently encountered such &ldquo;magicians,&rdquo; the philosophers of the world. We told the people that life in the world usurps them. Some of the philosophers taught the same thing. For example, Taoism teaches simplicity and selflessness. We also told people that the enjoyment of this world is actually a form of death. Some philosophers taught this also.</p><p>However, just as the Egyptian magicians were not able to take away the frogs, so today&rsquo;s &ldquo;magicians&rdquo; cannot take away the &ldquo;frogs&rdquo; that trouble people in our time. Those philosophers in China could bring forth the &ldquo;frogs,&rdquo; but they could not make them disappear. When Moses cried unto the Lord concerning the frogs, the Lord did according to Moses&rsquo; word (8:12-13), and the frogs died out. In the same principle, a proper evangelist not only brings forth &ldquo;frogs,&rdquo; but also causes them to be driven away.</p><p>Sometimes as we preached to certain of the wealthy people in China, we caused &ldquo;frogs&rdquo; to appear to them. This convinced them that the enjoyment of the world is really a nuisance, a cause of unending trouble. At their request, we prayed for them, and the &ldquo;frogs&rdquo; were taken away. But this only served to show us that their condition was the same as Pharaoh&rsquo;s after the frogs were taken away. When Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart and did not hearken to Moses and Aaron (8:15). In the same principle, when these rich people saw that the &ldquo;frogs&rdquo; were removed and that there was relief from their situation, they refused to repent and believe in the Lord.</p>
