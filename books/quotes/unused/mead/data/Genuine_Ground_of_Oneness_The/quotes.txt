[2]  Keeping Oneness Enjoying Christ with God on the Ground
[3]  CHAPTER ONE ONENESS IN THE FOUR GREAT ACTS OF GOD Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26; 2:8-9, 16-17, 22; 12:1-2; Matt 16:16-19; Eph 1:22-23; 3:9-11, 21; 4:4-6, 11-12; 5:25-27; Col 3:10-11; Rev 21:2-3; 22:1-2
[4]  Whenever we speak about the ground of the church, we find ourselves engaged in spiritual warfare.
[5]  Satan, the enemy of God, hates this matter of the church ground, which has been concealed from the Lord's people for centuries.
[6]  The ground of the church is directly related to the importance of the church.
[7]  In Ephesians, a book on the church, we see that the church was planned by God in eternity past.
[8]  In Ephesians 5:25 Paul says that Christ "loved the church and gave Himself up for her."
[9]  This indicates that when Christ died on the cross, He gave himself up for the church.
[10]  However, we also need to see that Christ loved us and died for us so that we could be part of the church.
[11]  Peter was blessed to see the revelation that Jesus is the One anointed to carry out God's commission and also the Son of God to produce the many sons of God to be members of the Body, the church.
[12]  As soon as Peter declared that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord went on to speak concerning the building up of His church: "And I say also to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church" v. 18 . This indicates that whatever Christ is, is for the building up of the church.
[13]  Not only is Christ's death for the church, but He Himself, His very Person with all His qualifications, titles, and offices, is also for the building up of the church.
[14]  In Revelation, as the last book of the New Testament, the importance of the church is stressed even more as the testimony of Jesus in each locality.
[15]  Every local church is a lampstand shining out Christ.
[16]  Having seen the importance of the church, we now come to the inward and outward aspects of the church.
[17]  The Bible reveals four great acts or activities of God: creation, election, the new creation, and the New Jerusalem.
[18]  In producing the church as the new creation, God also acted according to His nature of oneness.
[19]  CHAPTER TWO LIFE AND LIGHT THE ESSENCE OF ONENESS Scripture Reading: Gen 2:8-9; Lev 1:1-2a; Psa 36:8-9a; 133:1-3; Isa 2:3, 5; John 17:11, 17, 21-23; Eph 4:3-6; Rev 21:22-24; 22:1-2; Eph 1:10
[20]  In the previous chapter we pointed out that God's four great acts in the universe are related to creation, election, the new creation, and the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.
[21]  As we shall see, there is a progression downward from Babel to Babylon and from Babylon to the great Babylon.
[22]  Toward the beginning of the Old Testament, we have Babel, but toward the end, we have Babylon.
[23]  Because of Babel, God was forced to give up the created race and to initiate another action His selection of Abraham.
[24]  Many times Christians have asked where we get the light that is conveyed in our writings.
[25]  We have seen that life is related both to the corporate man of God's original creation and to Abraham and his descendants, the children of Israel.
[26]  Now we shall go on to consider how life and light are the essence of the oneness of the church as God's new creation.
[27]  It is crucial for us to see that the oneness among God's children is preserved by life and light.
[28]  ISSUES OF DIVISION Scripture Reading: Gen 2:9b, 17; 11:4, 9; 1 Kings 12:26-30; 15:34; 2 Chron 36:5-20; 1 Cor 1:11-13a; Rev 17:3-5 TWO LINES
[29]  Man had become flesh v. 3 , and "the wickedness of man was great in the earth" v. 5 . Furthermore, as verse 11 declares, "The earth also was corrupt before God; and the earth was filled with violence." When God looked upon the earth, He beheld its corruption, "for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth" v. 12 . As we all know, God judged that corrupt generation with the flood.
[30]  After this division was formed, idolatry came in. Jeroboam not only caused division; he also set up idols in Bethel and in Dan 1 Kings 12:29 . Having made two calves of gold, Jeroboam said to the people, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt" v. 28 . The source of these idols was Jeroboam's selfish ambition.
[31]  First Kings 12:26 and 27 say, "And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David: if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah."
[32]  We have pointed out that the genuine speaking of God was in the Holy of Holies in the temple.
[33]  Psalm 27:4 expresses the deep aspiration of God's people with respect to the house of God.
[34]  This verse says, "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple."
[35]  Furthermore, it is in the house that they enjoy the fountain of life and see light in the light of God v. 9 . Psalm 23 concludes with the words, "I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever" v. 6 . In Old Testament times the godly ones aspired to be in the temple where God's presence was.
[36]  By remaining in the oneness, we have the blessing commanded by God, life forevermore.
[37]  According to the record in the Old Testament, the sin of Jeroboam, the sin of division, opened the way for every kind of evil to come in. Eventually, the situation of God's people was so corrupt that God caused Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, to burn the house of God, to break down the wall of Jerusalem, and to carry away the people to Babylon.
[38]  For the children of Israel, the temple was the center of oneness.
[39]  Revelation 17 also indicates that evil is related to division.
[40]  In verse 5 Moses utters a very important word: "But unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put His name there, even unto His habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come."
[41]  After all the places of pagan worship had been destroyed, God's people were to go to the place chosen by God.
[42]  Before coming into the church life, most of us worshipped in places typified by the mountains, hills, and green trees Deut 12:2 .
[43]  DOING WHAT IS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF GOD
[44]  Deuteronomy 12:8 says, "Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes."
[45]  Deuteronomy 12:17 and 18 say, "Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thy hand: but thou must eat them before the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose."
[46]  When we go to the place of God's choice, we experience the Lord's most thorough dealing with us.
[47]  The second principle is that the unique place of God's choice must be God's habitation, God's dwelling place.
[48]  ON THE GROUND OF ONENESS Scripture Reading: Deut 12:5-7, 13-14, 17-18; 1 Tim 3:15b-16a; Heb 10:25; Psa 23:6; 27:4; 36:8-9; 42:4; 43:3-4; 66:13, 15; 84:1-8, 10-12; 92:10, 13-14; 133:1-3
[49]  In the place God had chosen the children of Israel were to eat before the Lord and rejoice Deut 12:7 .
[50]  Of course, they were expected to worship the Lord in the place He had chosen, but not to worship according to their concept of what worship is.
[51]  May we all be impressed with the fact that proper worship is a matter of eating the produce of the good land, that is, of enjoying with God and before God the riches of Christ in the unique place chosen by God.
[52]  Deuteronomy 12:7 also says, "Ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the Lord thy God hath blessed thee."
[53]  However, in the place chosen by God, the church, we have the Lord's name, His presence, the enjoyment of the riches of Christ, and the rejoicing in the Lord.
[54]  In the Psalms we see how the Old Testament saints enjoyed the Lord in the unique place of God's choice.
[55]  As we have pointed out elsewhere, in the Gospel of John we have grace and truth, but in the First Epistle of John we have love and light.
[56]  Many of us can testify that before we came into the church life, we received light and truth simply because we had begun to consider the church.
[57]  Furthermore, in the church life we go from strength to strength and appear before God v. 7 . In the church we realize that "a day in thy courts is better than a thousand." Those who enjoy the church life can say, "I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness" v. 10 .
[58]  In Psalm 92 we see even more aspects of the enjoyment in the house of God.
[59]  The last psalm we shall consider here is Psalm 133.
[60]  Verse 3 says, "For there the Lord commanded the blessing, life forevermore" v. 3, Heb . Note that this verse does not say, "The Lord gave the blessing"; it says, "The Lord commanded the blessing." In the church life as the house of God, we enjoy the commanded blessing of life.
[61]  In 3:16-21 Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen us through His Spirit into our inner man so that Christ may make His home in our hearts, that we may be rooted and grounded in love and be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth, length, height, and depth, that we may know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, and that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[62]  In verse 22 the Lord said that the glory which the Father had given Him He had given to His believers "that they may be one even as We are one."
[63]  In such a oneness it is not possible to have division, not even dissension.
[64]  In this oneness there is no room even for our opinion.
[65]  Although we need much more experience of the divine "painting" which brings us into oneness, we have had at least some experience of this in the church life.
[66]  The ointment is not for individuals; it is for the Body.
[67]  According to the New Testament, the oneness of the believers, or of the church, is mysterious, for it is intimately related to the processed Triune God.
[68]  We thank the Lord that for nearly all the spiritual things in the New Testament there are types in the Old Testament.
[69]  In the first chapter of the Gospel of John, we are told that the Word, which was in the beginning with God and which was God, became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and truth 1:1, 14 .
[70]  This oneness is made real and practical by means of the anointing that is upon Christ the Head and that spreads upon the Body.
[71]  However, concerning the church as the local mountains of Zion, we may have problems, for we may not be happy with the church in our locality, and we may desire to move elsewhere.
[72]  In typology Hermon signifies the heavens, the highest place in the universe, and the dew signifies the grace of life 1 Pet 3:7 .
[73]  Although many of us have experienced grace, we still do not know grace.
[74]  In the local churches we are daily under the dew, under the grace.
[75]  Whether we are married or single, old or young, we are under the dew that descends upon the mountains of Zion.
[76]  OF THE GROUND OF ONENESS Scripture Reading: 1 Kings 11:6-8; 12:26-32; 13:33-34; 14:22-24; 15:14, 34; 22:43; 2 Kings 12:2-3; 14:3-4; 15:3-4, 34-35; 17:5-12, 18-23; 23:29-35; 2 Chron 36:5-20; Psa 137:1-6; 1 Cor 1:10-13a; Rom 16:17-18; Titus 3:10
[77]  In Deuteronomy 12 Moses charged the children of Israel to "utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall dispossess serve their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree" v. 2, Heb . He also charged them to overthrow the altars, break their dedicated pillars, burn their wooden symbols with fire, hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place v. 3, Heb . Having destroyed all these things, they were to come to the unique place of God's choice.
[78]  According to the record in 1 Kings, two kings Solomon, a good king, and Jeroboam, an evil king took the lead to set up the high places.
[79]  Furthermore, Jeroboam made two calves of gold and said to the people, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt" v. 28 . He then "set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan" v. 29 . Furthermore, "Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah" v. 32 . The month of this feast was "devised of his own heart" v. 33 . Jeroboam even made "priests from among all sorts of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi" v. 31, Heb . What evil is associated with high places! The high places were related to lust, ambition, and idolatry.
[80]  When the children of Israel were about to cross the river Jordan and enter into the good land, Moses, out of his deep concern for them, charged them to destroy the heathen places of worship and to come to the unique place of God's choice.
[81]  He issued this charge because he realized that this matter of the unique place of God's choice and the destroying of the heathen places was closely related to their destiny before God.
[82]  If they were faithful to destroy the pagan centers of worship and to come to the place of God's choice, they would be doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord.
[83]  Nevertheless, in 1 Kings 11 we see that Solomon's "heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice, and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods" vv.
[84]  If we had been there at the time, we might have taken sides with those who sacrificed at the "high places."
[85]  According to Romans 14, there is no reason for Christians to be divided.
[86]  All the divisions in Christianity are elevations that involve either lust or ambition.
[87]  When the Lord stirred up the spirits of the people to return to Jerusalem, not only was there a recovery of the ground of oneness; there was also a spontaneous recovery of all the positive things that had been lost.
[88]  Nothing is more satisfying than the ground of oneness.
[89]  How we thank the Lord for recovering the genuine oneness, the oneness that has been lost by Christianity!
[90]  For this reason, we who believe in Christ cannot say that the revelation of God in the Old Testament is fully a revelation of our God, for it is actually only a partial and incomplete revelation of Him.
[91]  Then He went on to say, "You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it" v. 18 . What we have here is not Israel loved by God we have the church built by Christ.
[92]  Now we must proceed from the Acts through the book of Revelation.
[93]  This church is the unique, universal church typified by Zion.
[94]  In 1:11 the voice said to John, "What you see write in a book and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."
[95]  This shows clearly that the practice of the church life was that of one church for one city, one city with one church.
[96]  God's revelation began with God Himself and continued with Christ and the Spirit until it reached its goal in the local churches.
[97]  The Jews have God, most Christians have God and Christ, and the improved Christians also have the Spirit, but very few Christians have the proper church life in the local churches.
[98]  God is embodied in Christ, Christ is realized and experienced as the Spirit who imparts life to us, and the Spirit issues in the churches.
[99]  Furthermore, in these books we read of the church built by Christ and of the many brothers of the Son of God who are the church.
[100]  Although I love all the churches, I must be honest and testify that no church is as dear and lovable to me as the church in Anaheim because the church in Anaheim is my local church.
[101]  In Revelation 2 and 3 we are told again and again that the Spirit speaks to the churches.
[102]  Therefore, it is vital for us to be in one of the churches, in a church that we can designate as our local church.
[103]  We have seen that the lampstand implies the significance of the Triune God; it symbolizes the Triune God embodied and expressed.
[104]  God the Father as the divine gold is embodied in Christ the Son and then is fully expressed through the Spirit.
[105]  The church is not only universally one, but also expressed locally in many cities.
[106]  In the whole universe there is only one Christ, one Spirit, and one church.
[107]  The ground of oneness about which we have been speaking is the ground of locality.
[108]  Although he heard me deliver thirty messages concerning the ground of the church, he told me one day that he simply was not able to understand this matter of the ground of locality.
[109]  This local oneness was damaged and altogether lost by the time the Catholic Church was formed.
[110]  In the 1920s the Lord raised up a group of young people in China under the leadership of Watchman Nee.
[111]  Brother Nee once told me that the Lord was forced to come to China because, as far as the practice of the church life was concerned, China was still virgin soil, whereas the United States and Europe had been spoiled.
[112]  There was no way for the Lord to have a proper start for the church life in either Europe or the United States.
[113]  If someone tries to argue with you concerning the ground of oneness, point as an illustration to the situation of the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
[114]  Jerusalem was the unique place, the unique center, chosen by God to maintain the oneness of His people.
[115]  We may apply the principle contained in this illustration to the situation concerning the church today.
[116]  When we take the standing that we are the church in Anaheim, other Christians may protest.
[117]  They may ask, "How can you say that you are the church in Anaheim and that we are not?"
