We will now consider another aspect, which is the Christian experience of God. In this world, Christians know God the best. We can prove the existence of God from the experience of Christians. We know God from His answers to prayers, from the grace of forgiveness, and from God's special protection. If there is no God, there would be no believers.</p><p>I will relate to you a little of my own experience in prayer. I do not usually tell others about my experience in prayer, but I will say a little today. During the Chinese New Year of 1926, I was working in the villages. At that time, a few brothers like Brother Wang Lien-chun, Simon Meek, and Faithful Luk were in Foochow preparing for an evangelistic meeting. They invited me to join them, but I thought that there were so many already, and that I did not need to go. I thought that I would go to preach in the countryside instead. Subsequently, I invited six brothers to come with me. Two of them are now helping Mr. ____ in Kun-shan Garden in Shanghai. One is in Pai-ya-tan in Fukien, two are learning to fly airplanes in Amoy, and one is in Lien-jiang. I mention them because they were all involved in this incident, and they can testify to this. We took a boat and went to a village called Plum Flower Village. There are many fish in that place, and the fishermen there make a great deal of money from fishing. Among the six brothers, one was only sixteen or seventeen years old. He was expelled by his school. His mother could do nothing with him, and she brought him to us. During the first month, we had practically given up hope in him. But in the second month, he was saved. After he was saved, he loved to work. In the third month, he went with us to preach in Plum Flower Village. I had made arrangements ahead of time with a teacher whom I knew in that village to stay at a school while we were there. But when we arrived, the teacher rejected us and would not allow us to stay there, because he found out that we were there to preach the gospel. We walked around back and forth until dark and still could not find a place to stay. Finally we came across a herbal shop, whose owner was willing to put us up, and we stayed in his attic.</p><p>We went out on the evening of the 7th for the first time. There was one thing that was special about the people there: they were all very courteous. But all of them were quite reserved. Before we would finish a sentence, they would walk away. After we spoke with them a little, they would ask us to stop. We asked them for the reason, but they would not say anything. We were quite bewildered. In the evening when we came home, we realized that we all felt the same way and had the same experience. We asked the owner of the herbal shop, with whom we had become more acquainted, about our experience. He told us not to be bothered by these things. The next day we went out to sell gospel literature and preach the gospel again. The young brother eventually got into trouble. He was not able to contain himself anymore on that day, and he grabbed a villager and forced him to tell him what was happening. The villager said, "You don't know how many gods we have here already. We cannot have any more gods. We have a Great King (Dah-wang-shen) here who comes out every year for the parade and carnival. You have come at the wrong time because we will have the carnival on the 11th, and everyone is too busy to hear about your Jesus. This great god has been faithful since the Ming dynasty. From the Ching dynasty until now, it has been two hundred years, and every time the carnival comes, it has always been a clear day. Not once has there been rain." The young brother became angry when he heard this and said, "This year it will rain during the carnival." Many young people were there when he said this. When they heard it, they broke into a commotion, saying, "These preachers are saying that it will rain this year when the great god comes out for his parade." In less than two hours, the whole Plum Flower Village had learned of this matter. They spread the word that the preachers claimed it would rain on the day the Great King came out for the parade. Some began a rumor, saying, "If it rains, their God works; if it does not rain, the Great King works." After we returned home, we knew that this was not a light thing for our brother to have said. I told the young brother, "No one can control the weather. How could you have said that?" He said, "We can go and pray." I said, "Yes, we can pray. But will God answer our prayer? Is this something according to His will?" However, we all went and prayed. A meal was prepared, but none of us would eat. We all went and prayed until our anxiety was gone and we were peaceful and confident. Then we went back to eat. While we were eating, we told the owner of the shop, "We all know that it will rain on the 11th when the Great King comes out for the parade." The owner said, "I do not think so. Don't try to talk such nonsense anymore. First, there are over two thousand households in Plum Flower Village, and all of the males depend on fishing for their livelihood. Do you think that they are ignorant about the weather? They can tell the weather a few days ahead of time. Second, please take care of my little shop. I depend on this shop for my living. Don't put my little shop in jeopardy." Yet we were all very peaceful and confident, and we were sure that God had heard our prayer. The next day was the 10th, and we went out again. This time, not only was the young brother telling others that it would rain on the 11th, but all of us were saying the same thing. We all said that it would rain the next day. When we tried to sell them the gospel literature, they would not buy it and would not receive the word we preached. They all said, "Let's wait and see what will happen tomorrow. If it rains, Jesus is God. If it does not rain, our Great King works."</p><p>It was so strange that on the night of the 9th, we received a promise, which was "Where is the God of Elijah?" This was related to God's glory. On the eve of the 11th, that is, the night of the 10th, we prayed again. If it did not rain the next day, it would be impossible for us to preach the gospel to the ten thousand or more people in Plum Flower Village again, and the door of the gospel would be closed there. No one would get in again. One or two among us who were weaker in faith thought that they should ask God to send rain right then. To them, it was better for it to rain that very night. We went to bed and did not get up until very late the next morning. I slept beside a window, and when I woke up, the sun was shining in my eyes. I thought, "Too bad! The sun has come out. What shall we do?" I did not bother to even put on my clothes, and I knelt down to pray. Later all the brothers woke up one by one, and everyone knelt down to pray, saying, "O God, today is the day for You to manifest Your glory. Please send the rain and prove that You are God." We all prayed earnestly. Later we all rebuked ourselves for praying so desperately, knowing that God had already heard our prayer. We went down to take our breakfast. I was the leader among them, and in order to boost their morale, I told the brother who took care of the food, "There is no need to prepare any sack lunch today; we will not be able to go out because it will rain." We blessed the food. After we blessed our food, one brother went on and prayed, "Lord, may You keep our faith and prove that You are God." Of course this was a spontaneous prayer. After this, we went to fill our bowls with porridge. I sat facing the window. Shortly after we finished our first bowl, the sound of dripping was heard on the roof. We looked at each other and began to understand what was going on. We went ahead for our second bowl. I asked, "Should we pray?" One brother said, "Why not? This rain looks too small. It has to rain very hard before others will see that this is a clear act of God and not an accident." We then proceeded to pray again. After our prayer, the sky turned dark and the rain increased. The sound of the rain on the roof became louder. The rain was pouring down harder and harder. After breakfast, we stood outside the shop to watch the Great King come out for its parade. The Great King was scheduled to come out at 9 a.m. But the rain did not stop from nine o'clock until eleven o'clock. Since the parade could not take place beyond a certain hour, the villagers reluctantly carried the great god out. The rain was truly a torrent that day, and two- or three-foot deep puddles of water were everywhere along the way. When the Great King came out of the temple, it only managed to move a few steps. One of the bearers slipped and fell into the water, and the great god fell with him also. Three of its fingers and an arm were broken, and its head was twisted. The villagers lifted up the Great King again, turned the head back to its original position, and tried to press on. By then many young people were shouting at the back: "The Great King is in trouble this year. It is in trouble this year." They shouted as they marched on. The rain became heavier and heavier, and it was obvious that they could not go on anymore. They moved the Great King into an ancestral hall that belonged to a Chan clan. Some elders of the village went in and asked the Great King why it had rained this year. What a trick they came up with eventually! They managed to tell everyone, "The Great King did not intend in the first place to come out for the parade on this day. You people have made a mistake. The Great King said that he had intended to come out at 8 p.m. on the 14th. Today is only the 11th." The elders proposed that the parade be changed to the 14th. But the young people asked, "Why then did the Great King trip, and why were his arm and fingers broken?"</p><p>At lunchtime we prayed that God would give us a clear day so that we could go out to work again. We became strong in our faith and prayed also that the Lord would send another rain on the 14th. After we ate, we went out to preach again. That afternoon, the sky was clear, and the quantity of books we took with us was not enough to meet the need. In a minute they were all sold out.</p><p>We had to leave the village and return home on the 15th. Therefore, we prayed for a clear sky on the 12th, 13th, and 14th so that we could work. We also prayed that it would rain on the evening of the 14th so that everyone would know that the Great King was not God. The 12th, 13th, and 14th were all clear days. We decided to hold a gospel meeting in the herbal shop on the evening of the 14th. By then the owner believed. Today he is still a good brother. On the evening of the 14th it began to rain, and many people were waiting outside the shop. We went up to the attic and prayed that God would send more rain. Praise the Lord, the rain became heavier and heavier. When the villagers moved the Great King out of the temple, seventeen or eighteen men were following it. But they tripped five or six times. Many young people were behind it, shouting, "There is God. There is no Great King." We were able to finish a fine work there. On the morning of the 15th, we left before the day broke. Praise the Lord.</p><p>We have received many answers to prayers. These answers prove that there is a God. Our spiritual experiences prove to us that our God is living.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_070.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_072.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 27: The Normal Christian Faith &nbsp; pg 71</div><br></body></html>
