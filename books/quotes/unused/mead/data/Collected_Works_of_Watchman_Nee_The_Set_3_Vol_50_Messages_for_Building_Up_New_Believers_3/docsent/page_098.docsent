   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 The Pope Having Two Crowns</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The pope must wear two crowns at his coronation, one signifying that he is the king of the church and the other signifying that he is the king of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One crown, the Miter, signifies the pope as the king of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the pope receives the Miter, he claims headship over the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Following that, another crown, the Tiara, is given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Tiara is a crown with seven layers and is made of pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This signifies that he is king of the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus has not established His kingdom on earth yet.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But here are men who have claimed the kingship for more than a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The kingdom is not here yet, but some have already assumed the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Tiara is embedded with 146 precious stones and 540 pearls.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>St. Peter's Cathedral, where the pope frequently appears, was built at a cost of nine hundred million pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This building was supposedly erected in remembrance of Peter, a fisherman by the sea of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have visited the Vatican.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is hard to estimate how much that city is worth, because everything there is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The entire ceiling of St. Peter's Cathedral is painted with eighteen- karat gold.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everywhere the city is shining with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The buildings in the pope's residence cause any palace of any king or emperor on earth to pale in comparison!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One can hardly find another place that exceeds Rome in luxury and excess.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet the pope claims to be the earthly representative of Jesus of Nazareth.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Bible the word abominations always refers to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, abominations in 2 Chronicles 33, Ezekiel 20, Daniel 9, and Deuteronomy 7 refer to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Abominations in the Bible only mean one thing idols.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that the things of other religions have been brought into Christianity.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She is indeed Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Babylon means confusion and fornication, and that is exactly what she is!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have said that she has mixed the world with the church, paganism with Christianity, believers with unbelievers, grace with the law, the New Testament with the Old Testament, and God with idols.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everything is a mixture and everywhere there is fornication.</S>
