   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Willing to Be Wronged</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Willing to Be Defrauded</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Bearing the cross is expressed in being willing to be wronged or defrauded 1 Cor 6:7b .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In all things and with all kinds of people, including our wives, husbands, parents, children, relatives, brothers, sisters, and roommates, we must be willing to be wronged or defrauded.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A willingness to be wronged or defrauded is a willingness to suffer loss, to learn the lesson of the cross, to keep the virtue of Christ at some cost.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our common experience is to react when we are wronged by others, especially when others make mistakes at our expense.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In May 1935, several co-workers stayed together with Brother Nee in order to study the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I stayed in a room with another brother with whom I was very familiar.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The room in which we stayed did not have a bathroom, so we had to bring water into the room from outside in order to wash ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every time I brought a basin of water into the room, I had to pass by his bed in order to get to my bed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The passageway by his bed was narrow and each time I passed by with water, I would spill a few drops of water onto his bed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After spilling some water on his bed, I did not feel peaceful, so I apologized to him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because I often spilled water throughout the day, I would apologize to him once, twice, and frequently three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One time when I began to apologize to him, he said, "The worst thing is to make a mistake and not apologize.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is good to apologize when one makes a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the best thing is not to make a mistake at all."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This word caused me to feel very ashamed, but it also indicated that my roommate was unwilling to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He reacted to my repeated apologies because he was unwilling to be wronged.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to apply the principle of not reacting but living under the shadow of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1 Corinthians 6 Paul applied the cross by asking two questions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Why not rather be wronged?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why not rather be defrauded?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you are unwilling to be wronged or defrauded, this means that you are unwilling to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Your unwillingness to be wronged or defrauded in small things is an indication that you are unwilling to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We Christians should behave not merely by the standard of morality, but by the standard of crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I may be absolutely right according to the standard of morality, but I may also be a person who is very much in the flesh without any experience of crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Being paid less than what someone owes you can be used as an illustration of being defrauded.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Someone may owe you 27.25.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if he only pays you 26.25, you have been defrauded of one dollar.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you react, this reaction indicates that you are unwilling to be defrauded.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After receiving 26.25, you may wait for a day or two, expecting the payment of the dollar.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the dollar does not come, you may go to the person and demand payment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the standard of morality, you are right.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But according to the standard of crucifixion, you lose everything because you are unwilling to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If I am a person who is willing to be crucified, I would never think about the dollar.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would not expect the payment of the dollar, not by exercising my patience, but by putting myself with my flesh on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a result, I would not remember the dollar or mention this incident to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This shows that the standard of our virtues as Christians is much higher than the standard of people in general.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is an example of bearing the cross in a very fine way.</S>
