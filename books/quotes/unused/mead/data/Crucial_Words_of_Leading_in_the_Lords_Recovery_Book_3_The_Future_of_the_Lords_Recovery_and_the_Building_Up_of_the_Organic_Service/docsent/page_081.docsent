   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN THE WAY TO ADVANCE THE SMALL GROUPS THE CHURCH NEEDING TO ADVANCE THE GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous message we fellowshipped concerning dividing into groups.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church in Taipei has already formed over four hundred groups.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The primary need now is to advance the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church in Taipei currently has about four hundred serving ones, including elders, co-workers, deacons, those who minister the word, coordinators of various services, young full-timers, and part-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every one of these serving ones, whether experienced or not, must be in a group.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From now on the move of the church will be carried out mainly through the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The work of the small groups is mainly to restore the dormant saints and to promote the gospel preaching in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then the groups can promote the gospel work on the college campuses, among the high school and junior high school students, among the children, and in the community.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In other words, the foundation of each area of work is the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The group is the basic unit and foundation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to have a foundation in our work, we must nurture the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once the groups begin to function, every aspect of the work will be carried out smoothly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the groups function, we can spontaneously bring in dormant saints, and it will be easy for them to be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the same time, we can spread the gospel in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we can be aggressive in the gospel work on the campuses, among the children, and in the community.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This will result in the multiplication and increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Concerning the practice of the group meetings, we are short of experience and personnel, even though we have four hundred groups.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that every serving one, including the elders and co-workers, should be assigned to help and advance a group.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, the serving ones should all serve to advance the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If there are not enough serving ones, we should ask other saints to help.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, the movement of a large truck is slow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we want it to move faster, it is best to push it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, as we push it, we will discover that some parts are out of order and defective.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we can make the necessary repairs so that the truck can run at an ideal speed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every serving brother and sister should help in leading a group, but this does not mean that they should regard themselves as a person who is responsible for the group.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Neither should they consider themselves as a group leader ; they should take the lead only in regard to fanning the gift within the saints into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the fire in a group has not been kindled, the serving ones should bear responsibility to help kindle the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the fire in a group is dying, the serving ones should fan it into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The serving ones should fan the gift in the saints into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>DIVIDING INTO GROUPS ACCORDING TO GEOGRAPHY</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In forming the groups, there should not be groups for brothers and groups for sisters or groups for elderly saints and groups for younger saints.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Neither should there be groups for working saints and groups for students.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, the grouping of the saints should be according to geography.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If there are eight to ten saints who live close to one another, they should form a group.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The members of a group should include brothers, sisters, elderly saints, and younger ones, without any distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even the serving ones should be assigned according to geography.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In other words, serving brothers should not be assigned to nurture brothers groups, nor should serving sisters be assigned to nurture sisters groups.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, there is no need to consider whether serving saints are suitable for a particular group.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They should simply go and work with a group according to geography.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to advance the small groups, we must first drop our old concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The only factor we should consider in forming groups is geography.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There should be no other consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This will limit the impact of preconceptions that can frustrate this simple principle of arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This way of arrangement can be compared to the old-fashioned marriages in China in which the husband in an arranged marriage often did not even know what his wife looked like until her veil was lifted.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Nevertheless, this way often produced very stable marriages.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Please do not analyze or doubt the benefit that will come from forming groups according to geography.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It will help every saint to endeavor to strengthen and supply each group.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After much consideration before the Lord, we believe that we should take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have eaten much of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and our eyes are opened Gen 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When our eyes are so open about certain matters, we often hesitate to act.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For example, a person who knows everything about the preparation of food is often reluctant to eat food prepared by others because he is afraid of eating food prepared using unhygienic methods.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is better to be blind.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The eyes of some of the younger elders and co-workers are too open.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When I propose something, some of them immediately begin to think of possible complications in how to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For example, before the meeting I said that we needed four hundred brothers and sisters to help the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Immediately, a brother asked whether sisters should lead only sisters groups and not lead brothers groups.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This brother has too many considerations.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Having eyes that are so open makes advancement difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The principle for arranging the small groups is by geography.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not say that it is difficult to lead a group that has more older saints.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Neither is it necessary to ask an elderly sister to help with a group of elderly sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Such thoughts are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Instead, it is possible for an elderly sister to lead young sisters and for a young sister to lead a group of elderly sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We do not agree with special arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we make arrangements by anything other than geography, we are no longer according to the principle of an old-fashioned Chinese marriage, that is, a match made in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When heaven acts as the matchmaker to put a couple together, it is the best match.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, the elders should not be involved in grouping the saints and the serving ones together in any way other than geography.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The church in Taipei has over twenty meeting halls and around five thousand saints who meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These saints have been divided into more than four hundred groups.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some halls are larger, and others are smaller.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some halls may have only eight or ten groups.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>These four hundred groups should be divided into eight districts, and every district should have fifty groups.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must still study how to combine the groups into districts for the advance of the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have not yet reached the stage of forming districts.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We first need to advance the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After the groups begin to function, the elders and co-workers should combine the groups to form districts.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Every district should have fifty groups.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then ten to twenty elders and co-workers should encourage the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is similar to pushing an old car.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Initially, many people are needed to push it, but once the old car starts moving, those who were pushing can take care of other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the same principle, once the groups begin to function, we will not need four hundred serving ones to push them.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We will probably need no more than a hundred serving ones to nurture them.</S>
