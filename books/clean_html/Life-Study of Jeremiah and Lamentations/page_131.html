<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. JEREMIAH DEALING WITH JEHOVAH</H2><P>Verses 16 through 25 speak of Jeremiah's dealing with Jehovah. Jeremiah asked Jehovah why He told him to buy the field since the city of Jerusalem had been given into the hand of the Chaldeans. Jeremiah could not understand this. Here the fellowship between God and Jeremiah was very intimate, like the fellowship between intimate friends. In asking about the field, Jeremiah addressed God as if He were his close friend.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. JEHOVAH'S ANSWER TO JEREMIAH</H2><P>Jehovah's answer to Jeremiah, found in verses 26 through 44, is very interesting.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah Giving the City of Jerusalem<br>into the Hand of the Chaldeans</H2><P>Jehovah said that He was giving the city of Jerusalem into the hand of the Chaldeans, and Nebuchadnezzar would take it, because of the evils of Israel which she had done to provoke Him (vv. 28-36).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah Gathering Israel Out<br>from All the Lands Where He Had Driven Them</H2><P>Jehovah went on to say that although He had driven Israel in His wrath and in His great indignation, He would gather them out from all the lands where He had driven them and would bring them back to the holy land and make them dwell there in safety (v. 37). Here we see that Jeremiah came to know God's intention and that His intention, revealed in His word to Jeremiah, became His promise to the prophet.</P>
