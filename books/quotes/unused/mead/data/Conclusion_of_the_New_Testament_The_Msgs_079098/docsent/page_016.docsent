   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>N. A SEAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Corinthians 1:22 says that God has sealed us, and Ephesians 1:13 and 4:30 tell us that, as believers, we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The anointing in 2 Corinthians 1:21 is the sealing in verse 22.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because God has anointed us with Christ, He has also sealed us in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be sealed with the Holy Spirit means to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have been made God's inheritance Eph 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the time we were saved God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belonged to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God's image signified by the seal, thus making us like God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not regard the sealing as separate from the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, anointing implies sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we are under the anointing, the anointing becomes a sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way we become different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, the seal causes us to bear the appearance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God anoints, the anointing is the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The anointing brings the divine essence into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, through the anointing God adds the essence of Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then this anointing seals us with the essence of God, forming the divine element into an impression to express God's image, thereby making us the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The seal of the Spirit signifies ownership.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It signifies that God is our owner and that we belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The anointing within us as the sealing declares to the universe that we belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God possesses us, and He has put Himself upon us as a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit as the seal of God upon us bears the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This implies that the seal of the Holy Spirit is the expression of God and brings God's image into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we bear the Holy Spirit as the seal of God upon us, we bear the image of God and the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The anointing within us becomes the seal, and the seal bears the very image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way we bear the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that we express God by being anointed and by being sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the seal of the Holy Spirit denotes both ownership and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>O. A PLEDGE GUARANTEE FORETASTE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The New Testament also speaks of the Spirit as a pledge 2 Cor 1:22; 5:5; Eph 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 2 Corinthians 1:22 Paul says that God has given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The pledge of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The seal of the Spirit is a mark that we are God's inheritance, God's possession, belonging to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The pledge of the Spirit is a guarantee that God is our inheritance or heritage belonging to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit within us is the pledge, an earnest, of God being our portion in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ephesians 1:14 says that the Holy Spirit is "the pledge of our inheritance."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need the Spirit as both the seal and the pledge because in God's work on us two kinds of inheritances are involved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ephesians 1:11 indicates that we were made God's inheritance, and verse 14, that God is our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In God's economy we are an inheritance to God, and God is an inheritance to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a mutual inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For us to be God's inheritance we need the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are God's possession, and as our owner God has put a seal upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because God is our inheritance we also need the pledge of the Spirit as a guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We shall inherit all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For such an inheritance, the Holy Spirit is the pledge, the guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Greek word for pledge in Ephesians 1:14 also means foretaste, guarantee, token payment guaranteeing the full payment, a part payment in advance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because God is our inheritance, the Holy Spirit is a pledge of this inheritance to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God gives His Holy Spirit to us not only as a guarantee of our inheritance, securing our inheritance, but also as a foretaste of what we shall inherit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In ancient times the Greek word for pledge was used in the purchase of land.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The seller gave the buyer a sample of the soil from the land being purchased.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, a pledge, according to ancient Greek usage, was also a sample.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Holy Spirit is the sample of what we shall inherit of God in full.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As those who are to inherit God, we have the Holy Spirit as a pledge, guarantee, earnest, and down payment of our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the same time the Spirit is also a sample and a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The foretaste gives us a taste of God; the full taste is yet to come.</S>
