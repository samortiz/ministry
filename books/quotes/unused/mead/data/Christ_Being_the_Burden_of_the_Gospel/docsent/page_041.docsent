   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Using the Proper Organ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Contacting the Lord by Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to use the proper organ to receive God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, receiving God s salvation is like eating and drinking; we simply need to receive without being concerned whether our sins are small or big.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the other hand, we need to use the proper organ to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to receive anything, we must use the proper organ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, we must use our ears to hear a message in a meeting; if we plug our ears, we will be unable to hear the words that are being spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We also need to use our eyes to see the different expressions of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we close our eyes, we will not see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We drink with the mouth, not with our eyes; we listen with the ears, not with our eyes; and we hold the Bible with the hands, not with our nose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The proper organ must be used in order to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The salvation that the Lord Jesus has accomplished for us cannot be separated from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we receive His salvation, we do not merely receive what He has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to receive what He has accomplished for us, we must receive the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In other words, when we receive the Lord Jesus, we also receive what He has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus is now the Spirit; God is Spirit, and we need to receive the Spirit with our spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not sufficient just to listen to a message about Him with our ears or to think about Him with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must use our spirit to contact and receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After rising up in the morning, many people like to go outdoors to breathe in some fresh air.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot use our hands to breathe in the morning air; we have to receive the air with our nose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus is God, and He is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Like the air, He cannot be touched with our hands or seen with our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to touch Him in spirit and in truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our spirit, not our mind, is the proper organ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more we try to receive Him by thinking about Him, the more we will be confused, and the more God will not seem real.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to stop our outward activities and even our inward thoughts and contact the Lord Jesus from deep within, touching Him in spirit and in truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then the Holy Spirit will work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Clearing the Obstacles between God and Us Confessing Our Sins to God</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we contact the Lord Jesus, He touches our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When He touches our spirit, we are enlightened concerning our sins because He is holy and cannot tolerate sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When He gives us a sense of our sins, we should respond by praying and confessing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we come to the Lord Jesus, we do not have to consider what to pray; we simply need to speak to Him in response to the inward sense deep within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, the Lord may give a person the sense that he has offended his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He should respond and say, O Lord Jesus, I have offended my parents.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If he also has a sense that he has offended his wife, he should say, O Lord, I have also offended my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to confess one thing after another to the Lord, according to His inward sense.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When someone draws near to the Lord, he may not have much feeling about his sins at first, but the Spirit of the Lord will work in him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From experience we know that the more we confess our sins, the more we sense our sins; and the more we confess our sins, the more sins we discover.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord enlightens a person concerning his sins, he should confess them, because the more he confesses his sins, the lighter his burden will be and the more joyful and peaceful he will be.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When he confesses his sins, he will receive the Lord in the deepest part of his being, and thanksgiving and praise will overflow from within him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through his confession his sins will be discharged, and the burden of these sins will be lifted.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In addition, his whole being will be bright and at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After we confessed our sins, we could truly testify that the Lord Jesus entered into us to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now we belong to Him, and He belongs to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who have not believed should give Him the opportunity to touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many people who have lived on the earth for thirty, sixty, or even seventy years are still confused about the meaning of their human life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because they have not been cleansed of their sins, they are like persons who have not washed their hands for their entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their hands are filthy, and they truly need the Lord to shine on them in order to be cleansed of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the Lord gives a person a sense of his sins, he should confess them one after another, as though he is spitting them out one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As he begins to confess, his sense of shame and sorrow will increase, and even his repentance will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, his sorrow will be a sweet sorrow, and his repentance will be a happy repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is truly marvelous that a person can be both sorrowful and happy at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is because it is easy for the Lord Jesus to come into one who believes and confesses his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A person who receives the Lord Jesus will be full of the Lord s joy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As soon as the Lord Jesus enters into someone who believes, he experiences the forgiveness of sins, the putting to death of his corrupt nature, and the receiving of God s life, which brings in true peace and boundless joy.</S>
