<p>We should all exercise to live in the spirit. Before the bread-breaking meeting, every co-worker, elder, and responsible one should be burdened in spirit to prepare for the meeting. If these serving ones are prepared and live in the spirit, the spirit of all the saints will be living when they arrive at the meeting, and the meeting will not be poor or fall into rituals and routines. Regrettably, we often do not live in the spirit, and we are unprepared for the meeting. If we are indifferent when we arrive at the meeting, we will be able to meet only according to a prescribed order and in formality. Once there is a prescribed order, we are not in the spirit, and once there is formality, there are regulations. This is the reason that the meetings are empty and weak in various localities. It is easy to follow a prescribed order and to be in formality because people do not need to exercise their spirit in order to sit and listen to a message. After two or three such meetings, however, everyone will be &ldquo;deflated,&rdquo; and they will not want to return.</p>
<p>The ones serving in the church must establish an atmosphere of living in the spirit so that everyone is encouraged to live in the spirit. If there is a bread-breaking meeting and our spirit is on the alert, our spirit will be uplifted in the meeting, and there will be a response in others&rsquo; spirit. Then the meetings will be a rich outlet for the Lord. Without the exercise of the spirit, the meetings will become like bean dregs in plain water, and our numbers will decline over time. People will not be attracted if they cannot touch spiritual things in a meeting. However, if all the serving ones are strong and alert in spirit and if they are serious rather than indifferent, the new ones, young ones, and weak ones will touch spiritual reality when they come to the meeting, and they will be drawn to return. Only in this way can we bear fruit. Regrettably, our condition is often routine and old, and we do not use our spirit enough to contact the Lord and to have spiritual transactions with Him. Such a condition is not attractive to people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Entering into the Spirit of the Ministry<br />
to Have a Goal and a Direction in the Work</h2>
<p>In principle, there are not many ministries that can be used by the Lord as a source of supply in each age. This is because a ministry is like a trumpet. If there are too many ministries, there will be too many uncertain sounds, which makes it difficult for people to take the way of the church. Therefore, the Lord may not necessarily raise up many ministries simultaneously to be a source of supply.</p>
<p>Whoever is not used by the Lord as a source of supply for the ministry should receive the supply that is available so that he may supply others. However, such a one must still use his spirit to enter into the spirit of the ministry. Regrettably, ministers of the word in various localities have not generally entered into the spirit of the supplying ministry in their release of messages; that is, they have not entered into the flow of the ministry. Thus, their supply of the word has no direction or goal; it is like a ship drifting without a compass. In helping a local church, the co-workers should be in the flow and the spirit of the ministry to follow the direction of the compass. They should be like a ship that has set sail from Keelung to Hong Kong; everyone should know where the ship is going. The co-workers, however, seem to speak as they wish. They say one thing today and another thing tomorrow, and they are indifferent about whether or not there is fruit, despite working for a month, a few months, or even a few years. The churches being helped are also indifferent. Thus, it is difficult to bear fruit in such a situation.</p>
<p>The co-workers must spend more time living in the spirit to enter into the spirit of the ministry and the flow of the ministry. If our spirit is strong, our work will not be aimless. The cause of our illness is our not being in the spirit. According to doctors, a weak constitution is caused by malnutrition. But once there is proper nutrition, the germs in us are killed. If we are not in the spirit, we will have many &ldquo;infections&rdquo; that bring in weakness, but as soon as we begin to live in the spirit, our illnesses will go away. For example, everyone is selfish, and as long as we do not live in our spirit, we will care only for ourselves. However, as soon as we are in the spirit, we are delivered from such a selfish realm. I hope that we will go before the Lord and let Him expose our true condition so that He may have mercy on us and save us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Vision for Serving the Church &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
