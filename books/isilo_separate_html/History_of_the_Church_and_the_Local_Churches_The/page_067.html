No announcements were made beforehand to have a meeting on that day, but the saints came and met. From morning to evening, everyone met together without eating or drinking. There was no schedule or program, but many things were carried out by the Lord that day. After a couple of weeks, our meetings were similar to those recorded in Acts 2 and 4. We met day after day for over one hundred days. That was a one-hundred-day conference beginning on January 1, 1943. Every meeting was different and new.</P><P>It would take many messages for me to relate all the wonderful things that happened during that period of time. I would like to relate a few things to give us some idea of what was taking place. During one afternoon, a young man, who was a student of about nineteen or twenty years of age, was reading the Bible. He read Isaiah 1:3-4, which says, "The ox knows his owner, / And the donkey, his master's manger; / But Israel does not know, / My people do not much consider. / Alas, sinful nation, / A people heavy with iniquity, / Seed of evildoers, / Children acting corruptly! / They have forsaken Jehovah; / They have despised the Holy One of Israel; / They have become estranged and have gone backward." He also read Jeremiah 8:7, which says, "Yea, the stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times; and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the law of Jehovah" (ASV). He was very inspired by these verses.</P><P>The Lord impressed him within that he should stand up that evening in the meeting to give a testimony concerning these two portions of the Word. He was very fearful of doing this since he was very timid. He told the Lord, "If you want me to give a testimony tonight, you have to do one thing. You have to ask Brother Lee to stand up to read these two portions of the Word to all the people." I had never talked to him before, and I did not even know his name. He thought it would be impossible for me to do this, but he told the Lord that he would not give a testimony unless this happened. At a certain point in the meeting, we all knelt down to pray. While we were praying, the Lord told me within to ask the saints to rise up and read Isaiah 1:3-4. He was amazed. Then I said, "Turn to Jeremiah 8:7." He was trembling. After we read this verse, he gave a testimony, sharing with us about how the Lord had dealt with him concerning these verses. This is one illustration of the prevailing move of the Spirit at that time.</P><P>The move of the Spirit was also prevailing in all the homes of the saints. The saints offered all of their possessions to the church. Every evening all kinds of offerings were given to the church. Just to keep an account of those offerings took much time. Everyone came to the meeting with something to offer, so we had to have different groups to keep an account of the different kinds of offerings. One group, for example, kept a record of all the title deeds to property that were offered. All those who owned any kind of property brought their title deeds and offered them to the church. By the last day of this revival, everyone literally offered all the things they had. Even things such as typewriters and sewing machines were offered.</P><P>Eventually, seventy saints traveled by boat from Chefoo to inner Mongolia, migrating there for the spread of the church life. They offered all that they had to the church, and the church assigned a certain amount of money and material things to each of them, which was enough for them to travel and live on for three months. Our experience in those days was just like the beginning of the church life when "those who believed were together and had all things common; and they sold their possessions and properties and divided them among all according as anyone had need" (Acts 2:44-45).</P><P>In my whole Christian life, I have never seen a revival like that. In all the homes, there was not any loose talk or gossip. All that the saints spoke was Christ, the church, and the Lord's migration. Every home&#151;old and young, fathers, mothers, and children&#151;was stirred up without one exception. At that time we called ourselves "the host, the army, of Jehovah." Such a situation was the result of our being in the practicality of the church life. The saints entered into the service groups in the church life, and this caused them to be burned. Then the revival came in. During that revival many young people were raised up who later became leading ones in the churches.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> </body></html>
