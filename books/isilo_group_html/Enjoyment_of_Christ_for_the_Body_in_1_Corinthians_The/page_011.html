<h2 class="head2">Putting Our Trust in the Lord<br />
and Having No Choice of Our Own</h2>
<p>On the one hand, it is wonderful to come together in oneness. On the other hand, however, it is difficult to come together. Even for two brothers to live together in the same room is a hardship. One may want the windows closed, and the other may want them open. Since the church life is a life of togetherness, what can we do? We must all put our trust in the Lord. The two brothers can say, &ldquo;Lord, if You put us together, we have no choice. We cannot choose to have the windows open or shut. Lord, it is up to You.&rdquo; To keep the windows open or shut does not matter. We must learn the lesson of not having any choice and of leaving everything up to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having No Confidence in Ourselves<br />
but Doing All Things by the Body</h2>
<p>Moreover, in our life of togetherness we should not do things by ourselves or have any confidence in ourselves. We must not say, &ldquo;I am very clear. I checked with the Bible, and what I am doing is fully scriptural. I prayed that the Lord would give me signs, and I received several. Now I am clear that what I am planning to do is of the Lord. Acts 5:29 says that it is necessary to obey God rather than men. Do not pressure me; let me go. You are merely men, and I must obey God.&rdquo; If anyone holds this attitude, he is deceived.</p>
<p>The church life is the Body life. If our body remains in the United States, our hand cannot say, &ldquo;I am clear to go to Taiwan. I must obey this feeling and not the body.&rdquo; In principle, this is what some of us have done in the past. If the Body does not share our feeling, we should say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord, I am enjoying the Body-Christ, not an individual Christ.&rdquo; If we do this, we will be safeguarded. The Body is a real safeguard to us. In the past I sometimes felt that the brothers were too slow to understand the Lord&rsquo;s will and that as long as I was clear, I could go on without them. Eventually, however, I realized that this was wrong. This is to be individualistic and not to care for the Body. We all need to learn the lesson. We should never do things in the church life in an individualistic way. We must always be checked by the Body. Whatever the Body says is better, and if the Body does not agree, we should not go ahead. Then the Body will be our safeguard. As long as we take care of the Body, we are fully protected.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Dealing with Others<br />
to Correct or Adjust Them, but Ministering<br />
the Life Supply through Fellowship</h2>
<p>In the church life we should also avoid dealing with others in the way of correcting or adjusting them. If we realize that some brothers are wrong in some matter, we may think that we have a burden from the Lord to charge them to repent and change their attitude and way. This never works. What we have in our physical body is simply the circulation of blood. The &ldquo;circulation&rdquo; in the Body of Christ is fellowship, not dealing. If we feel that some brothers are wrong and are even causing a loss to the Body, we should not go to them to deal with them. We should pray to the Lord again and again. Then we may have the deep sensation from the Lord to fellowship with some other brothers, pray for the needy ones, and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading together. Eventually, we may contact the ones who are wrong. At this time we should not touch their mistakes. We need to leave their mistakes to the Lord. Then after several contacts, we can fellowship with them about the needs. This is to keep the circulation of blood in the Body. The circulation of blood carries nourishment, and within this nourishment are the elements that spontaneously kill and discharge the germs. Perhaps after several times of fellowship, they may mention their problem to us. At that time we still should not touch their problem too much. We should only say a little, ministering life to them on the positive side. We may not even know at what point the disease is healed. Simply by our fellowship we bring the circulation of life again and again until the problem is gone. Then they may testify, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Our problem is gone and under the Lord&rsquo;s blood.&rdquo; Death will be swallowed up by life even if we never talk to them about their mistakes. To deal with people never works. What we always need in the church life is fellowship, the circulation of life.</p>
<p>After a short time in the church life, a young brother may still have his old, improper appearance. We should not go to tell him, &ldquo;Brother, you need to know that in the church we should not look like this.&rdquo; This is to deal with him in a wrong way. Rather, we should pick up a burden for that brother and go to him with one or two others for the purpose of fellowship. While we are fellowshipping with him, the Holy Spirit, the life within, will speak to him. Then after we leave, he may go to adjust his appearance, and in the next meeting we will see a new shining face. We may be surprised at the Lord&rsquo;s transforming work in this brother. The brother will not have a mere outward correction. He will have transformation out of the life supply he received through our fellowship. If we deal with a new one wrongly, we will damage the Lord&rsquo;s work. We should simply pick up the burden to fellowship with that one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">All the Members Functioning<br />
to Fellowship in Life and by Love</h2>
<p>The denominations in Christianity depend on one or a few pastors, but in the Lord&rsquo;s Body we do not need that kind of pastor. Instead, we need the fellowship of all the members. All the members are the promoters, not of correction but of the circulation of life. As long as life circulates among us, it will regulate, transform, and shape us. Therefore, we should not go to people to correct them. We must put our trust in the fellowship of life. We should always go to our fellow members to fellowship with them in life by love. This is a daily work. Day after day we will see the growth, transformation, and wonderful change in all the saints. In this way we will remain on the proper ground of oneness with the necessary fellowship to enjoy the Body-Christ. This is the proper way to have the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Never Gossiping but<br />
Treasuring the Precious Body Life</h2>
<p>We must also never gossip or spread any negative word. Even if we see the shortages or weakness of a certain brother or sister, we can tell it to the Lord, but we should never speak it to anyone else. We need to pray for the members. Any kind of gossip only spreads death in the Body. Gossip is a spreading of germs to kill the Body. We must treasure the fact that we are in the Body life. The Body life should be so precious to us that we would not do anything to damage it. If we see some weak points in one another, we should bring the situation to the Lord, pray, and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading to go to fellowship with the involved parties, not to point out their weaknesses but to minister life so that the life supply will swallow up the weaknesses. This is the proper way to preserve the church life. We must be on the proper ground, and we must fellowship again and again. Then we will enjoy the Body-Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>The Enjoyment of Christ for the Body in 1 Corinthians &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
