   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW JERUSALEM BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A GREAT SIGN OF THE TOTALITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF GOD'S CHOSEN, REDEEMED, REGENERATED,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND TRANSFORMED PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The New Jerusalem is not an actual city just as the lampstands are not actual lampstands but signs of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The New Jerusalem is a great sign of the totality of all God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church today is a house, the house of the living God 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The house of God today is not an actual house but the totality of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church today as God's temple, God's house, God's building, is not an actual physical building but is a sign signifying that the church's function is to be a house in which the Triune God can dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today the church is a house, and in eternity the church will be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the church is enlarged, it becomes a city.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church as a house is not an actual physical house in the same way that the church enlarged to be the holy city will not be an actual physical city.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Jerusalem is a city signifying the church's function in eternity to be God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many Bible teachers have misunderstood and misinterpreted the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They say that the New Jerusalem will be a heavenly mansion as a physical place for all God's redeemed ones to dwell in. It is altogether not logical to say that the New Jerusalem is a physical mansion or a physical city for God's redeemed people to lodge in. The New Jerusalem, the holy city, is a golden mountain Rev 21:16, 18 . This mountain is twelve thousand stadia in length, breadth, and height v. 16 . Twelve thousand stadia is about thirteen hundred and fifty miles, the approximate distance from New York to Dallas.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a high mountain has only one street which goes down spirally from the top of the mountain to reach all the twelve gates on the four sides of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If this is a real city to lodge in, we must ask how all God's redeemed through all the centuries will be able to lodge there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How could so many people live in a city with only one main spiral street?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How could these people travel in a city with only one main street?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For a physical city with only one main street to contain billions of people is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The holy city is not a physical heavenly mansion, but a sign signifying the totality of all God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the eyes of God, all His redeemed people will be like a great city just as today in God's eyes all the redeemed people are His house.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this age God's people are His house, but in eternity God's people will be His city.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate consummation of God's people.</S>
