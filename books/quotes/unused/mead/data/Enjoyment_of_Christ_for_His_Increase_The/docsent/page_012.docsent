   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REALIZING THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 3:29-30 tells us that the Lord must have a bride as His increase, His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ s increase comes into being because Christ died, rose, and imparted His life into us to make us His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is the unique grain of wheat, and we are now the many grains as His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now the many grains need to be blended together as one loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can have this oneness only by taking Christ as our life and allowing Christ to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are in Christ, Christ is in us, and we have Christ as our life; therefore, we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we would simply realize this, we would be powerful Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There will be a real impact among us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are one Body as the bride of Christ, His increase, His expression, just as Eve was a bride to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Regrettably, this truth has been greatly damaged by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has divided and dismembered the Body of Christ so that the one unique church as the Body of Christ has become many so-called churches in division.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to realize the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Strictly speaking, we as individuals are not the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is the corporate Body which is the bride, and we are merely parts, members, of this one Body, the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to realize the reality of this bride, we need to be in the reality of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A proper and normal Christian is one who realizes that he is a member, not an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we realize we are the members of the Body, we will function as members.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not function as members, this means we do not realize the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Are we living for Christ, or are we living for ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are living for ourselves or for something else, it is difficult to realize the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to have the reality of the Body of Christ, we must live for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even at home and in our daily life, our living needs to be unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our eating, our drinking, and even how we care for our children should all be unto Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything we do and accomplish needs to be unto Christ, because we have consecrated ourselves with all of our living to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether we are in the meetings or at home with our family, we are living unto Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then whatever happens to us, whether positive or negative, is all unto Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>BEARING OUR RESPONSIBILITY</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>TO PRACTICE THE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Concerning our attitude toward the believers who remain in the divisions, we cannot bear responsibility for the actions of others, but we should be responsible for our own attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christianity today is vast, and the number of Christians is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even within the Catholic Church I have met a good number of real believers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not have the attitude that there are no real ones in Christendom or that they are hopeless cases.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Among them there are still many genuine believers; however, it is not easy for us to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, they are not our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must bear our own responsibility before God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since we have been enlightened by the Lord concerning the oneness of the believers, we need to do our best to practice the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If possible, we should endeavor to come together with the other real Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If they refuse to come together, it is beyond our control.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If, for example, they choose to remain in the Catholic Church, it is impossible for us to join them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if some are willing and open to meet together, we should welcome them as our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If there is the possibility of joining with them and they are open to this, we need to take this opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if there is no possibility of this happening, it is out of our control, and we are not responsible for the result.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we bear our own responsibility to keep the oneness, we will be the overcomers in a situation of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although the situation is one of confusion, we are walking according to the Lord s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord is after the oneness of His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For centuries the Lord has been seeking after the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By the Lord s mercy we have been enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Accordingly, we should humble ourselves and pray, Lord, be merciful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I want to take some definite steps to join with as many believers as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If there is no possibility, Lord, that is not my business.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is out of my control.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I can only come to You weeping, praying earnestly that You would have mercy on those dear ones and open their eyes that they may see the need of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is all that I can do.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I would not insist on anything but that we all would be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This oneness is the very desire of God s heart.</S>
