<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S WILL AND THE LORD'S WILL</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: Saturday evening, December 14, 1940<br />Place: Shanghai<br />Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1-2; John 15:7; 1 Cor. 10:27; Acts 16:3, 6-7, 18; 17:16-17; 20:16</h1><h2 class="head1">GOD'S WILL BEING DIFFERENT<br />FROM THE LORD'S WILL</h2><p>Every Christian should know God's will. If a Christian does not know His will, he is still in darkness. John 12:46 says, "Every one who believes into Me would not remain in darkness." John 8:12 says, "He who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness." This means that all those who believe into the Lord and who follow Him will surely have light. They will surely see and know. Putting it another way, if a man does not have any light or if he does not see or know, he has a problem in following the Lord.</p><p>God's will is different from the Lord's will. God's will is objective; it is outside of man and has to do with God. The Lord's will is subjective; it is inside a Christian. Because God's will is objective and rests in God's throne, it is something mysterious to a Christian, and there is the need to seek after it. In order to know God's will, one has to drop his own will and reject the activities of the flesh.</p><p>At the same time, we have to realize that we know and understand very little concerning God's will in our daily life. If a man can say that he knew God's will fifty times in a year, he is very good. In many cases one cannot name ten times when he has known God's will.</p><p>God's will is often reflected through man's will. In John 15:7 the Lord said, "Ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you." The word "will" is an active kind of will in Greek. It is not a passive will. Both English and Greek use this word as a verb. It means for the will to make a decision. If our will actively wants something or asks for something, it will be done for us. This wanting is a very strong wanting. If we want something, all we have to do is to exercise our will to pray for it, and it will be done. This verse appears to pose a danger, because what would happen if what we will does not match God's will? We may be very careful when we read this verse and may even want to add a footnote, saying, "If something is according to God's will, and you actively will and ask for it, it shall be done for you." However, this is our concept; this is not the Lord's thought. The Lord said, "Whatever you will." The Lord believes that the will of some people is according to God's will.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN'S WISH</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 10:27 Paul said the same thing: "If any of the unbelievers invites you and you wish to go, eat everything that is set before you, asking no question for conscience' sake." It is strange that Paul did not tell us to pray to find out if we should go, or to pray to find out if we should eat. Paul did not mention God's will; he only mentioned man's wish. He only paid attention to the human will.</p><h2 class="head1">ABIDING IN THE LORD</h2><p>In John 15:7 the Lord Jesus said, "If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you." This word was directed at those who are in Christ, in whom Christ lives, and who are genuinely regenerated and consecrated. When a believer has the Lord's heart and is one with Him, he will experience this word.</p><p>The words in 1 Corinthians 10:27 and John 15:7 are not for everyone. They do not mean that anyone can wish what he wants and God will accomplish it for him. This word is for Christians who are in Christ, who are genuinely regenerated and consecrated, who have the mind of Christ, who receive the dealing of the cross, who abide in the Lord, and in whom the Lord's word abides.</p><p>We have said that God's will is objective while the Lord's will is subjective. God's will is on the throne, while the Lord's will is in the heart of Christians. God's will is outside a Christian, and he has to seek to know it. The Lord's will is inside a Christian, and it is waiting to manifest itself. God's will is countable; it can be a few wills or a few dozen wills. The Lord's will is continuous; it is continuously unveiled to us.</p><p>As soon as a man is regenerated, God's life enters into him and he becomes one with the Lord. Once the Lord's life enters a Christian, His will also enters into him. He will love what the Lord loves and hate what the Lord hates. The Lord's will becomes his will. To some the word of God is living, but to others it is dead.</p><p>Some may ask, "If this is the case, is not God's will too simple? Should we not spend more time to pray and to seek for His will?" Many people think that all they need is to spend more time to pray. But often the more they pray, the more confused they become. In the end they become cold and depressed. Actually, this need not be the case. If we are one with the Lord, we will want what the Lord wants; our will will become the Lord's will. Of course, this means that we must be proper persons.</p>
