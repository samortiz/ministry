   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AARON BLESSING THE PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Leviticus 9:22 says, "Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This signifies that Christ as our High Priest after His crucifixion blessed us in His resurrection Luke 24:50 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord in His resurrection is with us all the days until the consummation of the age Matt 28:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord's presence with us is His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As long as we have His presence, we are under His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When His blessing is with us, even our mistakes become blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But without His presence, even if we are right in everything, there is nothing but vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although our High Priest has gone into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is still present with us, and His presence is a blessing not only in the church life but also in our family life and in our practical daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord's presence as our blessing comes to us through our application of Him as all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every day we need to apply Christ as our sin offering, burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we apply Him as these offerings, we will have His blessing, which is His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John 3:16 says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In what way did God give His Son to us?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He gave Him to us as all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we take the sin offering, we take an aspect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we take the burnt offering, we take another aspect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we take the meal offering and the peace offering, we take yet other aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our Savior is the unique sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus, we applied Him as the sin offering without realizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Later, we might have been inspired to be absolute for God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although we had not heard about the burnt offering, we prayed and offered ourselves to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time, the Spirit might have shown us that we are sin, even leprous, and that we cannot be absolute for God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we might have prayed, "Lord Jesus, I cannot be absolute for God, but You are absolute, and You can be my absoluteness."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is to take Christ, the Son given to us by God, as the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many Christians understand John 3:16 in a very general way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How can we accept Christ as the great gift from God if we do not apply Christ as the offerings?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we would enjoy this all-inclusive person, we need to apply Him daily as our sin offering, burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we will enjoy His presence as our blessing in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>MOSES AND AARON ENTERING INTO THE TENT OF MEETING AND COMING OUT TO BLESS THE PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and when they came out they blessed the people" Lev 9:23a .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This signifies that Christ as our Prince and High Priest entered into the heavens to be our kingly Priest Acts 5:31; Heb 4:14; 7:1 and will come out of the heavens to bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both Moses and Aaron typify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moses was the leader, the prince, and Aaron was the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today Christ is our Prince and our High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When He comes to us, He comes with blessings, and His being with us is the all-inclusive blessing we need.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can enjoy this blessing only by applying Christ as the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we apply Him as the sin offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering, we will have the blessing we need.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The blessing of Aaron and Moses upon the Jews is still in effect.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This blessing will continue until the entire house of Israel repents and turns to the Savior at His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The principle is the same with the spiritual blessing we enjoy today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A spiritual blessing lasts much longer than we realize.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am still enjoying certain blessings which I received many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A spiritual blessing, therefore, is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The New Testament tells us to bless others and not to curse them Luke 6:28; Rom 12:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even if we are hated, persecuted, and evilly spoken of, we should bless those who persecute us and pray that the Lord will forgive them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In our feeling, no person should be under a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>V. FIRE COMING OUT FROM GOD AND CONSUMING THE BURNT OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"Then fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed the burnt offering and the portions of fat on the altar; and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces" Lev 9:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This fire signifies that God's holiness as a consuming fire accepts our offerings by burning.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Anything that corresponds to God's holy nature God's holiness accepts by consuming it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But anything that does not meet the requirements of God's holiness will be judged by God's holiness through burning.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In such a case, the fire represents the God who is the consuming fire Heb 12:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After we enjoy God's presence, the appearing of His glory, and the Lord's blessing, we should be prepared to receive the consuming fire.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is a spiritual law that God's blessing is followed by the consuming fire of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This fire is a sign that God has accepted what we have offered to Him in Christ and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The same fire, which is the representative of God's holiness, may either be a consuming fire for God's acceptance or a judging fire.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The consuming fire accepted the offering up of Stephen Acts 7:55-59 , whereas with the coming of Titus in A.D. 70 this consuming fire judged the mixture at Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To us today, the consuming fire may be a divine acceptance of our offering to God, or it may be God's judgment due to our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How do we know whether the consuming fire is God's acceptance or God's judgment?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This can be discerned by our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we enjoy Christ and offer Him to God, the consuming fire will be God's acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, if we offend God's government and a burning comes to us, this burning is God's judgment upon us for touching His government.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is a serious matter.</S>
