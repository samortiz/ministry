        <h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF REGENERATION</h2>
<p>Nicodemus might have understood the literal definition of the words <em>born</em> and <em>anew,</em> but he did not understand the meaning of being born anew. He thought that to be born anew is to be born again, that is, to enter a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb in order to be born. He did not know that to be born anew means to be born again with another life. This is not to enter a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born. A person who enters a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb and is born a second time would still be born of the human life.</p>
<p>Perhaps Nicodemus thought that an old and corrupt person could be rejuvenated and be like a newborn by entering a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb and being born. He did not know that even if he could enter a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born, he would still be flesh. The corrupted human life would still be in him, and he would be no different than before.</p>
<p>Regeneration is not a matter of entering a second time into one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s womb to be born of the human life but to be &ldquo;born of the Spirit&rdquo;: &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo; (v. 6). Therefore, to be regenerated is to receive the life of God, to have the divine life in addition to one&rsquo;s own life. Regeneration is the Spirit entering into man and giving man the life of God. This life is spiritual; it is invisible and intangible, yet it is still perceptible to man. Therefore, the Lord Jesus said that the life that is born of the Spirit is like the wind (v. 8).</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO BE REGENERATED</h2>
<p>After Nicodemus found out that to be born anew is to be born of the Spirit, he asked the Lord Jesus, &ldquo;How can these things be?&rdquo; (v. 9). In other words, &ldquo;How can one be born anew? How can one have God&rsquo;s life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life&rdquo; (vv. 14-15). The Lord Jesus&rsquo; reply shows that in order for man to be regenerated, there must be two things.</p>
<p>First, the Lord Jesus had to be lifted up, to be crucified. The bronze serpent was lifted up in the wilderness and judged by God on behalf of the children of Israel so that the dying children of Israel might live (Num. 21:4-9). In the same way the Lord Jesus was lifted up on the cross and judged by God on behalf of sinners so that fallen man might have God&rsquo;s life and be regenerated.</p>
<p>Second, man must believe in the Lord Jesus who was lifted up, who bore man&rsquo;s sins, and who was judged on the cross on behalf of man. We must confess that we are sinful, that we have offended God, and that we stand condemned before God. We must then believe that the Lord Jesus was crucified in order to bear our sins and that He received God&rsquo;s righteous judgment on our behalf. Then we can receive the forgiveness of sins and be regenerated.</p>
<p>If you confess that you are unable to change and if you are subdued before God to confess your sins and to receive the Lord Jesus as your Savior, the Spirit will enter into your human spirit and give you God&rsquo;s life. As soon as you open your heart to receive the Lord Jesus as your Savior, the Spirit will immediately enter into you so that you may have the life of God.</p>
<p>Let me demonstrate. A lamp may not be shining. However, as soon as I turn on the switch, electricity enters into the lamp, and it shines. Similarly, as soon as we open the door of our heart, the Holy Spirit enters into us so that we can have the life of God.</p>
<p>Some may say that it is vague to say that the life of God will enter into us. Others may say that we are superstitious. However, this is real and true. Two hundred years ago people would say that it is nonsense and superstition to think that people in China could hear someone speaking in America. But today we know that this is real. As long as we have a radio receiver and turn on the radio, the radio waves in the air will enter into the radio, and we will hear what is being transmitted.</p>
<p>When someone repents in his heart, calls on the Lord Jesus from his heart, opens the door of his heart, and receives the Lord Jesus as his Savior, the Holy Spirit will enter into him, and he will receive the life of the Lord Jesus, which is the life of God. This is the same as a radio receiving radio waves.</p>
<p>In order to contact anything, we must use the right organ and method. If we use the wrong organ or the wrong method, we will have no way to contact that thing. Let us use sound as an example. We must use our ears as the organ and contact sound by hearing. Concerning smell, we must use our nose as the organ and contact fragrances by smelling. Concerning the air, we must use our windpipe as the organ and contact the air by breathing. If we do not use the right organ, it will seem as if sound, fragrances, and the air do not exist.</p>
<p>Similarly, in order for you to contact God and have His life, you must use the right organ and the right method. God is Spirit. If you use your brain as the organ and thinking as the method, you will never contact God or have His life. Perhaps the more you think, the more you will decide that there is no God. The more you think, the more you will decide that the life of God is vague. God is Spirit, and His life is spiritual; hence, in order for you to contact Him and to have His life, you must use the organ of your spirit and the method of believing and calling. God and His life are invisible and intangible, but the human spirit can contact and perceive God and His life. If you confess your sins to God and call on the Lord Jesus, you will receive the Lord Jesus as your Savior, you will contact God in your spirit, and you will have the life of God. When God&rsquo;s life enters into you, you will be regenerated.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESULTS OF REGENERATION</h2>
<p>There are at least four results of a person being regenerated with God&rsquo;s life. The first result is that there will be a change in life. The human life is corrupt, but God&rsquo;s life is incorruptible. When God&rsquo;s life enters into man, it brings about transformation, a change within man. When God&rsquo;s sweet life is grafted into our sour life, there is a sweet change within us, and we bear sweet fruit.</p>
<p>Second, a regenerated person is able to understand spiritual things. This understanding is not based on knowledge but on life, it is not in the mind but in the spirit, and it is not a knowing in the mind but a sensing in the spirit. A regenerated person often may not understand a certain matter concerning God in his mind, but he will have a sense concerning the matter in his spirit.</p>
<p>Third, a regenerated person has a share in God&rsquo;s kingdom. Only those who are regenerated can know the things of God&rsquo;s kingdom. Therefore, only those who are regenerated can enter into the kingdom of God. Those who are regenerated are in God&rsquo;s kingdom today because their spirit is God&rsquo;s kingdom, and eventually their whole being will express God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>Fourth, a regenerated person will never perish, because he has the life of God. God&rsquo;s life is eternal. Hence, a person who has God&rsquo;s eternal life will never perish.</p>
<p>A moral person needs to be regenerated, which is to have God&rsquo;s life. If you have not yet been regenerated, that is, if you have not yet received God&rsquo;s life, you should believe in your heart and pray from your heart in order to receive the Lord Jesus as your Savior.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
