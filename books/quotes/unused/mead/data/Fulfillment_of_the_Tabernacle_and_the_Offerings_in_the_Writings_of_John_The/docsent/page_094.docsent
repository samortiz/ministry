   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAMPSTAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Other aspects of the Old Testament tabernacle are also fulfilled in John's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Consider the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first mention of the lampstand is in the book of Exodus, where we are told that the lampstand was in the tabernacle Exo 25:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapters eight and nine of the Gospel of John we are told that Christ is the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 8:12 the Lord Jesus said, "I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 9:5 the Lord went on to say, "While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In these chapters we have Christ as the reality of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the lampstand, the Lord Jesus is the light of life to enlighten this dark world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, in chapter one of Revelation we have "seven golden lampstands" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>12, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is another indication that in the writings of John we have the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE TRIUNE GOD REVEALED IN THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let us now say a further word concerning reality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In John 1:1-3 we see that in the beginning was the Word and that all things came into being through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through the Word, who is the very God, the entire universe was created.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 4 John goes on to say, "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to verse 14, the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the footnote on truth in 1 John 1:6 in the Recovery Version and in messages nine through eleven of the Life-study of 1 John, we point out that in John's writings truth, or reality, first refers to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that God is the reality, that Christ is the reality, and that the Spirit is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, the word God speaks is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How can we say that God Himself is reality?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can say this because John 1 reveals that God became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John 1:17 also says that grace and reality came through the incarnated God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As God incarnate, the Lord Jesus said, "I am the way, and the reality, and the life" John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before He died, the Lord spoke concerning the Spirit of reality 14:17; 15:26; 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In his first Epistle John clearly says that the Spirit is the truth, the reality 1 John 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moreover, in John 17:17 the Lord Jesus said, "Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, from all these verses we see that reality is God, Christ, the Spirit, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God, Christ, the Spirit, and the Word convey the reality of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Triune God is Himself this reality, and the Triune God is revealed in the Word and conveyed by the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that the Word is also the reality, the reality which is actually the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In His incarnation, the Triune God was the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, as the embodiment of the Triune God, Christ is the real tabernacle, and He is the real offerings.</S>
