We worship You even more that Your word is spirit and life. As the Spirit You come into our spirit to be our life, our sanctification, and our salvation in everything. Because of Your precious blood, we believe that You are with us. We also look to You for the rich outpouring of the anointing and that You would grant us Your rich blessings. Lord, we do not trust in our doing, our ability, or our knowledge. We trust only in You, Your blessing, and Your anointing.<p>Lord, we worship You for the past, and we look to You again for the future. We pray that You would visit us again with Your thought, Your feeling, Your word, and Your utterance. We pray further that You would open us to You from within so that our spirit is open, our heart is pure, and our mind is sober. Our whole being is submitted to You, and we want to receive Your implanted word in our submissive mind.<p>Lord, shine Your light among us and reveal in each of us again Your great mystery that we may know Christ, the Spirit, and life and even the more that we may enter into the knowledge concerning the church. Deliver us from our tradition, from the influence of the past, from all the distractions around us, and from all the coverings. We ask You to lift the veils and remove all our coverings so that the heaven above us may be visible, that our eyes may be open and our spirit within be clear. Lord, make our whole being clear as crystal so that Your word may be open to us.<p>Lord, we worship You. May You be abundantly glorified, may Your enemy be greatly put to shame, may Your churches be built up, and may Your saints be edified, supplied, and nourished. Lord, may You answer our prayers and bless us once again. In Your precious name, amen.<h2 class=head1>A SUPPLEMENT OF THE TYPES OF CHRIST IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><p>The extract of the whole Bible begins with Christ. As we have seen, the Old Testament refers to Christ mostly with pictures and figures, that is, with types that are mainly of six categories: human beings, animals, plants, minerals, offerings, and foods. Under the category of human beings, besides the priest, the king, and the prophet, there are the shepherd and the counselor. Under the category of plants, there are the henna-flower, myrrh, the rose, the lily of the valley, and others.<p>In addition to these six major categories, there are several items in the Old Testament which also typify Christ. One of them is the three universal lights: Christ is the Sun, the moon, and the Star. Numbers 24:17 says that a Star shall come forth out of Jacob, which Star is Christ. Psalm 89:37 says that Christ as the seed of David shall be established forever like the moon, and Malachi 4:2 says that Christ shall arise as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings.<p>Furthermore, the various dwelling places also typify Christ. First, there is the ark. When the flood came, Noah&#8217;s household of eight entered into the ark and were delivered from God&#8217;s judgment upon the ungodly generation. This typifies Christ as our ark; if we believe into Him, we will not perish but will have eternal life. Numbers 35 also speaks of the cities of refuge where manslayers who kill without intent may flee from death. This typifies Christ as our cities of refuge. We are those who sin without intent, but since we are all sinful in Adam, according to the law we should all perish. However, since we have believed into Christ and have fled into the cities of refuge, we are safeguarded from death, and God will not claim the debt of sins from us. Christ is our refuge. Not only so, He is the excellent tabernacle and temple with all their furniture: the ark, the golden incense altar, the golden lampstand, the showbread table, and the other items. All these are extremely precious matters.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> </body></html>
