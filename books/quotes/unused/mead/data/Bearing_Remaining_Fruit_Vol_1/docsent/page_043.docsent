   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING A LONG-TERM VIEW IN TAKING THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We know that the Lord Jesus is faithful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He spoke in the Gospel of Luke that He sends us out in the midst of the wolves, but among the wolves there are sons of peace who are pre-chosen by God 10:3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, we need to be well prepared that some sons of peace may not remain to be sons of peace for their whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The name Barnabas in the New Testament means son of encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the beginning, Barnabas was truly an encouragement to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was he who brought Paul into the New Testament ministry, and it was also he who brought Paul with him to go out to work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, though, he did not last long as an encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Acts 15 shows us that Barnabas, this son of encouragement, because of his natural relationship in personnel matters, no longer worked together with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This put Paul in a very difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Finally he separated from Paul vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>36-39 , but the Lord sent Timothy to Paul, which caused him to be joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to remember that no one can frustrate the Lord s way, but we also should not expect that this way will proceed smoothly without difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some have testified that after praying, confessing their sins, being filled, and going out, they baptized three to five families, and everything went smoothly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Others, however, fellowshipped that despite their effort no doors were open to them, or even when doors were opened to them, no one received the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This truly caused them to despair.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, do not lose heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must believe that as long as we go out, there will be some profit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not worry about how many of the newly baptized ones will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a universally true principle that those who are optimistic are happy for everything, while those who are pessimistic worry about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all should have an optimistic attitude and firmly believe that this way is the best way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No other way can gain so many people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Recently twenty thousand people have been baptized; even though eventually fifteen thousand are unstable, we still have gained five thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even among these five thousand there may be over three thousand who are weak, but there are still over one thousand who are stable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The joy in the universe is because of these one thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not all of our children are intelligent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If every child were intelligent, the world would be in disarray.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If every American was capable of being the president, the world would be turned upside down.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Americans would constantly contend one against another, and there would be no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We thank and praise the Lord that while some are intelligent, some are foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While we are taking this way, we should not look only at the dark side; we should also look at the bright side.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Bible there is first evening and then morning Gen 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This makes up one day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everything has a bad side, but we should never be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although we dare not say that this way is a broad highway without any difficulty, we know that this way is absolutely right and can be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may go out to knock on doors for the whole night, and no one may be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may go out again for a second night, and still no one may be baptized, and on the third night only two are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It seems that we labored for the whole week for only two to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was as if the Lord did not listen to our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In actuality, though, this is more profitable than not going out at all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, the profit will be great because it will snowball.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then in the future these compounded benefits will be added to our account.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, do not be narrow-sighted or shortsighted.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, your vision should be broader and farther.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This way is right.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we firmly believe this way and are faithful in taking it, after not too long the whole earth will be filled with our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we consider the new way with this view, we will not be afraid if no one is baptized through our door-knocking, because today is not the only day in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are three hundred sixty-five days in a year, and we can always labor.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Satan can never overcome us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He can cause us not to be able to gain people today and tomorrow, sending away all the sons of peace and giving us only wolves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the end, however, we still will meet the sons of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eventually, the Lord will add to us the lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are truly full of joy and hope within.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no problem for us to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord said, Go in peace!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The work we are doing is a work of peace, the people we are seeking are the sons of peace, and the way we are taking is a way of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As long as we take this way, our success is assured.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A message given on April 2, 1987 in Taipei, Taiwan</S>
