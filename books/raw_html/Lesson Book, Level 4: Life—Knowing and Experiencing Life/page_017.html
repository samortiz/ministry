WHAT IS THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE?</h2><p>Now that we have some basic knowledge of life, we need to go on to find out how to experience life. Everything in the Bible concerning life is for us to experience today. We must find out what life is and learn to experience it. If you lack experience according to the word, go back and study the word, then pray to experience life. The Lord will grant us every experience of life if we seek to experience it.<h2 class=head2>A. To Experience God</h2><p>We need to ask ourselves first, what is the experience of life? [We have seen that life is God Himself. God Himself flowing into us, being received and experienced by us, is life. An experience which results from God passing through man and man passing through Him is considered an experience of life. For example: in our prayer we meet God, become enlightened, see our own fault, and deal with it before God. It is not that we detect our own fault, but rather, when we draw near to God, we are inwardly met by God, and thereby we see our own fault. God is light; hence when we meet Him, we see our fault in His light. We naturally confess to God and ask for the cleansing of the Lord’s blood. As a consequence, God passes through us, and we also pass through God. Such experience causes us to experience God; therefore, it is the experience of life.<p>All experiences of life are from God and are His working within us; therefore they can cause us to touch God and experience Him. Hence, any such experience of God will show forth life (Phil. 2:13-16).]
