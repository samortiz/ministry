         <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">OUR BEING CORRESPONDING TO<br />
THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: July 31, 1959<br />
Place: Hong Kong</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED WITH THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>All Bible students acknowledge that Colossians and Ephesians are sister books because they have many similar utterances. For example, Colossians 3:16-17 speaks of giving thanks and praise when we are filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, and Ephesians 5:18-20 speaks of giving thanks and praise when we are filled with the Holy Spirit. These two portions refer to two aspects of one thing. If we want to be filled with praise and thanksgiving, we must be filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word as well as with the Spirit. Moreover, if we compare these two portions, we will understand that the Lord&rsquo;s word is the Spirit. When we are filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, we are filled with the Spirit. In order to be filled with the Spirit, we first must be filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, because the Lord&rsquo;s word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>Nutritionists tell us that food contains energy that can be measured in calories. Every day we need to consume many calories; hence, we must eat well in order to absorb energy from our food. Speaking on the podium consumes much energy because energy is required for the exercise of the spirit and the cooperation of the physical body. Hence, whenever I give a message, I need to eat food in order to have the energy to speak. The Lord&rsquo;s word can be compared to food, and the Spirit can be likened to the energy in the food. If we want to be full of energy, we must take in a sufficient amount of food. Similarly, if we want to be filled with the Spirit, we must be filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>I believe this is what Paul had in mind when he spoke of the Lord&rsquo;s word and the Spirit in Colossians and Ephesians. Both the word and the Spirit are indispensable. The Spirit depends on the Lord&rsquo;s word, and the Lord&rsquo;s word depends on the Spirit. A believer should pay attention to the Scriptures without and to the Holy Spirit within. Thank God that we have the Bible in our hand and the Holy Spirit in our spirit. This is very precious. In order to learn to take God as life, we need to know how to deal with the Bible and how to deal with the Holy Spirit. Both the Bible and the Spirit are indispensable.</p>
<p>Regrettably, many believers do not take care of both aspects equally. Some emphasize the Bible to the neglect of the Spirit. They use their mind to study the Bible, read the Bible, and memorize the Bible. As a result, the Bible becomes dead letter to them. It is not wrong to diligently read the Bible, but if we neglect the Spirit, the letter will quickly deaden us. Others emphasize the Spirit to the neglect of the Bible. Although they believe that the Bible is God&rsquo;s Word, they rarely read it, and when they read it, they do not comprehend or understand it. Instead, they focus on spiritual practices, such as praying. When they pray, they are full of Hallelujahs and touch a sweet inner feeling that seems to give them a sense of living in heaven. However, when we speak of reading the Bible, they say, &ldquo;The words in the Bible are dead letters. What good is there to read it? It is sufficient to pray. All our problems are solved when we pray and are filled with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; While we should pray and be filled with the Holy Spirit, the consequences of neglecting the Bible can be dangerous. Such a condition can be likened to a train with a boiling steam engine but with no train tracks to direct its motion. This is a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Once some people came to debate with us, saying, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit in us will never lead us in a wrong way. As long as we have the Holy Spirit living in us, this is enough. We do not have to pay attention to the dead letter.&rdquo; These people were very insistent concerning their views, but within a few years they fell into serious errors.</p>
<p>It is dangerous to pay attention only to the Spirit but neglect the Bible. We must pay equal attention to the Bible in our hand and to the Spirit within us. When the children of Israel journeyed in the wilderness, they were led by a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire during the night (Exo. 13:21-22). Actually, the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire were the same leading of God. During the day this leading appeared as a pillar of cloud, and during the night it appeared as a pillar of fire. The Old Testament clearly reveals that God was present in both the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire. God Himself is in the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire. The cloud typifies the Spirit, and the enlightening fire typifies the Bible. Just as God led the children of Israel in the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire as they journeyed in the wilderness, He leads us in the Spirit and in the Word. This is a very good type. When our condition is as bright as the day, we have the clear leading of the Spirit within us. When our condition is darker and we cannot touch the sense of the Spirit within us, we should follow the pillar of fire, the Bible. I hope that we all would follow the Lord by reading and meditating on the Bible diligently every day and by following the Holy Spirit within us moment by moment.</p>
<p>A normal Christian should have a normal relationship with both the Word and the Spirit. Whenever our being does not correspond with the Word, something is wrong. Similarly, whenever our being does not correspond with the Spirit, something is wrong. In order to be a proper Christian, our being must correspond to the Word without and to the Spirit within.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
