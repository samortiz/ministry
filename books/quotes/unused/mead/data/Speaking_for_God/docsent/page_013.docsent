   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As the Dew</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eighth, the word of God is the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rain and dew are different.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not sufficient for the vegetation in the field to have rain only.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, in the latter part of the night, there is the descending dew Deut 32:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The dew is more effective than the rain because the rainwater mostly goes to the roots, but the dew mostly descends on the leaves and branches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everything created by God has its spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We see that the word of God is life, the seed of life, and the rain which waters the seed; even more, it is the dew which moistens the plants.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a Sharp Sword</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ninth, God's word is a sharp sword.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A sharp sword is for fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and sharper than any two-edged sword."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here the sword is used for dealing with our self to discern the thoughts and intentions of our heart, that is, to divide our soul and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The unsaved people, and even the saved ones who do not have the word of God, may confuse the soul and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, when we quietly read the Word of God, regardless of which chapter or verse, we will be able to clearly discern our spirit from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For instance, there was a man who had a disagreement with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although both of them loved the Lord and did not quarrel, they always reasoned with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes they would pray, but after praying they would start reasoning again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One morning the husband was reading his Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What he read was not related to the matter of reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was just Psalm 19, which says, "The heavens declare the glory of God, / And the firmament proclaims the work of His hands" v. 1 . While reading it, he spontaneously prayed with the words of this verse; he prayed and read, and read and prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although he did this for only ten minutes, afterward he was clear inwardly, knowing that when he prayed he was in the spirit but that when he reasoned with his wife he was in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he had not had this kind of reading and praying in the morning, the soul and the spirit within him could not have been divided.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By reading the Word and praying in spirit, he was able to clearly discern his spirit from his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, he learned a secret so that the next time he encountered a cause for reasoning, he would quickly return to his spirit to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The wife might reason but he would not; the more she would reason, the more he would pray.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is God's word as a sharp sword, clearly dividing our spirit and our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ephesians 6:17 also speaks about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There it talks about the spiritual warfare needed to deal with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It says that the word of God is a sharp sword for slaying the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we see that God's word is a sharp sword; it slays the devil, and it also divides our spirit and our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a Hammer</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Lastly, God's word is a hammer Jer 23:29 which breaks to pieces our self, our hardened heart, and our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jeremiah 23:29 also says that God's word is a fire to burn us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can see that the word of God has so many functions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For us to live a normal life today, we must be in the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the other hand, for the church to be strong and normal, built up, spiritual, and mature in life, we must speak the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What we need today is our God, who is the word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This word is in the Holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must receive the word and speak the word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, the word of God as Christ, as the Spirit, as life, as light, as food, as the seed, as the rain, as the dew, as a sword, and as a hammer will be manifested as a reality upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The word of God can do innumerable things; everything hinges on God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, we must do all we can to read the Word of God.</S>
