His Presence Being the Spirit</H2><P>We can never separate the Spirit from the presence of Jesus. The Spirit is simply the reality of Jesus' presence (John 14:16-20). This presence is Emmanuel, God with us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Receiving the Spirit by Calling<br>on the Name of Jesus</H2><P>When we call on the name of Jesus, we receive the Spirit, who is the Person, the reality, and the realization of Jesus. First Corinthians 12:3 says, "No man can say Lord Jesus but in the Holy Spirit" (Gk.). Whenever we say "Lord Jesus," we are in the Spirit and we receive the Spirit. We have all been under the influence of tradition, thinking that we must fast and pray before we can receive the Spirit. However, it is simple to receive the Spirit&#151;just call on the name of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Enemy Trying to Take Over<br>the Land of Emmanuel</H2><P>According to Isaiah 8:7-8, the enemy may try to take over the land of Emmanuel. Do not think this word is only for the children of Israel. Today our spirit is the land of Emmanuel. Thus, we ourselves are the land of Emmanuel. The enemy, Satan, with all his army will do everything he can to take over this land of Emmanuel, that is, to take over our spirit and our being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. The Enemy Unable to Take Us Over</H2><P>Isaiah 8:10 tells us that because God is with us, the enemy can never take over the land of Emmanuel. Although Satan has tried his best to take you over, you are still here. Perhaps during the past week Satan tried twenty-one times to take you over, but he failed every time. You are still here because of Emmanuel, because of God with us. This Emmanuel is Jesus. Today we may enjoy Jesus and experience Him in such a real way as our Emmanuel.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> </body></html>
