In every age and every place, there are always things that damage God's work. Today at least three things are before our eyes.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Welcomed by Political Authorities on Earth</h2><p>Today the Chinese government welcomes Christianity. This affords us all kinds of conveniences in our gospel work. We readily acknowledge God's hand in this. However, whenever any political authority on earth welcomes Christianity, the church on earth is challenged with greater temptation! Pergamos failed in this area, and Thyatira also fell on account of this (Rev. 2:12-29).</p><p>Just as the Lord and His kingdom do not belong to this world, the church does not belong to this world (John 18:36; 17:14, 16). The church was chosen by the Lord out of the world (15:19) and sanctified from the world (17:19). The church is sanctified because it is separated from the world. Whoever belongs to the church has received a heavenly calling (Heb. 3:1). His commonwealth is not earthly, but heavenly (Phil. 3:20).</p><p>When a political authority rejects Christianity, such a problem may affect the move of the church, but this persecution is in accordance with the church's heavenly nature. However, if a political authority welcomes Christianity, it may make the move of the church easier, but the result is that she may lose her heavenly condition. Whenever any earthly political power embraces Christianity, the church loses her heavenly purity. Whenever Christianity and earthly authorities hold hands, the church unites with the earth and commits fornication with the world. Political authority is altogether earthly, while the church is altogether heavenly. The church and state should be absolutely separated one from the other! The Roman Church with its many dark, corrupt, evil, and erroneous practices came about because Christianity was joined to earthly political authorities. On the one hand, we should take advantage of the welcome from the government and use every convenient opportunity to spread the gospel. On the other hand, we should always be warned that earthly welcome can erode our heavenly position. We should always maintain our heavenly status with fear and trepidation.</p><h2 class="head2">Foreign Money</h2><p>We thank the Lord for His grace among the Western brothers and sisters, who brought His gospel to China. However, we cannot deny the fact that wherever the gospel from the West goes, the power of money from the West also follows. It is of God that the gospel came, but it is a real problem when money comes along with it. There is nothing wrong with money being given in the way of spiritual fellowship to meet the needs of the Chinese churches. But it is absolutely wrong for money to become a kind of financial power! The fact remains that much of the money from the West came as a kind of financial backing to Christianity in China. Due to the changes in the Chinese government between 1926 and 1927 (this change was certainly allowed by God), the power of so-called Western Christianity in China was reduced considerably. But after China won the last war, a kind of trend crept in. International cooperation has resulted in the so-called Western powers moving into Chinese Christianity again. We should guard against this!</p><p>Even if the money from the West is not an issue, one who is learning to serve God in purity should guard himself against it. Perhaps the money does not influence us, but it may become a crutch to us. The only thing a servant of God should rely on is God, not foreign currency. The source of his supply should be the heavens, not the West. His eyes should be on the heavens, not on Westerners. The money from the West may not become an influence, but it may cause one to lose his faith in God!</p><p>The Chinese saints and the brothers and sisters from the West should have fellowship one with another in the Lord. They should confine their relationship strictly to this fellowship in the Lord. If the relationship is normal, both spiritual supply and material supply will be mutual. If this is not the case, the relationship is abnormal and should not exist.</p><h2 class="head2">The Imitation of Outward Ritual</h2><p>The New Testament service is spiritual rather than formal (Rom. 7:6). It is of life, not of letter (Heb. 7:16; 2 Cor. 3:6). Although there are outward activities to our services and outward arrangements to our work, these activities and arrangements, in themselves, have no significance. They are merely expressions of the inward reality of life, expressions which match an inward spiritual need. If there is no reality of life inwardly and no spiritual need, any ritualistic activity or business arrangement has no bearing upon God's New Testament service. It is possible for a local church to have a certain outward expression that appears to be ceremonial in some way. Yet it is there to take care of the inward reality of life. It may have some outward arrangements in its service. But this is done to take care of some inward spiritual need. When other localities see these practices, they should not imitate. Outward things are done to express inward reality; they are done to match inward needs. If there is nothing inward, there should be nothing outward. Outward things should grow out of inward things; they should overflow from inward things. If there is nothing growing and overflowing from within, anything outward is vain imitation. It is worthless and is actually harmful. (Witness)</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
