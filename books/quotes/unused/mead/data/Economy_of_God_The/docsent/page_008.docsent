   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DIVIDING THE SOUL FROM THE HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For this reason we need to divide our soul from our spirit Heb 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are unable to divide our soul from our spirit, we will simply be unable to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the high priest had been unable to locate the Holy of Holies, his efforts to contact God would only have ended in failure.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, he had to enter the outer court, from the outer court he had to enter the Holy Place, and from the Holy Place he would finally enter the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There he would meet God and see the shekinah glory of God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must learn to discern our spirit from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The soul conceals and covers the spirit, just as the bones conceal the marrow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is easy to see the bones, but it is difficult to see the marrow hidden within.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to get to the marrow, we must break the bones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes the marrow has to be scraped from the bones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How our spirit sticks to our soul!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our spirit is hidden and concealed in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The soul is easily recognized, but the spirit is difficult to know.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know a little about the Holy Spirit, but we do not know the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The reason for this is that the human spirit is concealed in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because of this the soul needs to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Just as the bones are very strong, so our soul is very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have a spirit, but our soul covers it up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s Word as a sharp sword must pierce our soul in order to break it away from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Speaking of the Sabbath rest, Hebrews 4:9 and 11 say, So then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God...Let us therefore be diligent to enter into that rest lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to discover the meaning of the Sabbath rest, we need to look at another type in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the Israelites were delivered and saved from the land of Egypt, they were brought into the wilderness with the intention that they should go on into the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The land of Canaan was their land of rest Deut 12:9 , a type of the all-inclusive Christ Col 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is the good land of Canaan, and He is our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to enter into the rest, we must enter into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But where is Christ today?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The answer is that He is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Israelites who had been delivered out of Egypt, instead of going on into Canaan, wandered for many years in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a type showing that after being saved, many Christians simply wander in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The reason the book to the Hebrews was written is that many Hebrew Christians had been saved, but they were wandering in their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They would not press on from the wilderness into the good land that is, into Christ, who dwelt in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must not continue to wander in our soul but must press on to enter into our spirit, where Christ is our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let us illustrate further by the following diagram:</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In ancient times all the people of Israel had access to the outer court, but only the priests could enter the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, only one, the high priest, could enter into the Holy of Holies, and that only once a year Lev 16:3, 15-17, 34; Heb 9:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moreover, of all the Israelites who were saved and brought out of Egypt into the wilderness, very few went on into the good land of Canaan Num 14:28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even though we might have been saved for years, we must ask ourselves whether we are presently a Christian living in the body, in the soul, or in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Are we now in Egypt, in the wilderness, or in the good land of Canaan?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to ask the Lord and search ourselves in order to be clear where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Frankly, many Christians are wandering all day in the soul, that is, in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the morning they have smiling faces, but by afternoon they are sorrowful with long faces.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yesterday it seems they were in the heavens, but today they are down.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are wandering in the soul, the wilderness, without rest, circling in the same rut day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They might have been following the Lord for twenty years, but today they are still going in circles, just like the people of Israel, who wandered for thirty-eight years with no improvement and no progress.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The reason for their wandering is that they are in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we are in the soul, we are in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the reason the writer of Hebrews emphasized the need to divide the soul from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word of God must pierce us so that we may know how to press on from the soul into the good land and the Holy of Holies of our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A soulish believer is one who wanders in the wilderness of the soul, where there is no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The high priest had to pass through the veil in order to enter the Holy of Holies; this indicates that the veil, which typifies the flesh Heb 10:20 , must be rent and broken Matt 27:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, the people of Israel had to cross the Jordan River in order to enter the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Under the waters of the Jordan they buried twelve stones, representing the twelve tribes of Israel, and another twelve stones, representing the resurrected Israelites, were brought over into the good land Josh 4:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The old generation of Israel was buried in the death waters of the Jordan River.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All of this typifies that the natural man, the soulish life, and the old nature must be broken as the veil and buried as the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then we can enter into the Holy of Holies and into the good land in order to enjoy Christ as our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>DISTRACTIONS FROM THE HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These pictures will help us to realize that God s economy is the Triune God in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This Triune God in the one Spirit has taken our spirit as His residence and His dwelling place Eph 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, we must learn to discern our spirit from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The problem is that we Christians are full of many natural thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After we have been saved, we think that we need to be good and to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But God in His economy intends to work Himself into us as our life and as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must forget everything else and concentrate on the indwelling Christ in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must not be distracted from the aim and mark of this indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should forget about being good and doing good deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to drop all those good things and enter the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many Christians are busily working in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They do not know that God s intention for them is that they would enter into the Holy of Holies, where they can contact God, be filled with God, be occupied with God, be one with God in everything, and have God as their all.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must discern our spirit and fellowship with this indwelling One.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must let Him take us over and possess us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Another religious distraction is that after we are saved, we feel that we are weak and that we need strength and power.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Consequently, we pray that the Holy Spirit will be poured upon us that we may be made strong and powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although there is some ground for us to do this, the main line of God s economy is that we follow Him not in this outward empowering but in our spirit, where the Triune God dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, the most vital thing is for us to know our spirit and to deny our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We need to reject our soul and walk according to our spirit, because the Triune God is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This mark of God s economy is missed by most Christians even the seeking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Again we ask, where is the Triune God today?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Praise the Lord that today this wonderful One, the Triune God, is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Triune God as the wonderful, all-inclusive Spirit is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we are a believer, we have the Triune God in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Our need today is to discern our spirit from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we know the proper way to discern the spirit from the soul, we will hit the mark of contacting the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In a radio there is a receiver, a receiving element.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When we tune the radio accurately, the electric waves in the air contact that receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Today the Triune God is the spiritual electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He is the electric waves throughout the universe, and we are the radio.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The receiver within us is our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We tune our human spirit rightly when we have a broken and contrite spirit Psa 34:18; 51:17; Isa 57:15; 66:2 , when we are repentant before God and open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we have such a spirit, the Triune God, who is the wonderful Spirit and who is the spiritual electricity, will immediately contact our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>All we need to know is how to tune the receiver, how to tune our human spirit, discerning our spirit from all other things, such as our thinking, our emotions, and our choices.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When we discern our spirit from all these soulish things, we will know how to contact the divine Spirit, who is the wonderful, all-inclusive Spirit of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Then we will know the Lord s word as the sharp sword that pierces to divide our soul from our spirit, and we will realize how to experience, enjoy, and partake of the indwelling Christ all the time.</S>
