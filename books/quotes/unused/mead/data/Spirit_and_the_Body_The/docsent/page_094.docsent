   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECOVERED BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Body is one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some Christians may argue with us and say, "You say that the Body is one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But the Body is divided.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can you be the unique Body?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not say that we are the unique Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But we are the recovered Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At least, we are the recovered part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Consider the illustration of the children of Israel in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16 the Lord charged them again and again to worship Him at the unique center, which preserved the oneness of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, many were captured, and some were taken to Syria, others to Egypt, and the rest to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, they were captured and divided.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be divided means to be captured.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today nearly all Christians have been captured, some to the Presbyterian denomination, some to the Baptist denomination, and a great many to the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the children of Israel were dispersed and scattered, their oneness was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After seventy years, God commanded them to return to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But according to history, only a small remnant returned under the leadership of Ezra, Zerubbabel, and Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were a group of recovered Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After the return from Babylon, there were four groups: one in Syria, one in Egypt, one in Babylon, and one in the holy land.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Apparently, each group was a division.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But although the groups in Egypt, Syria, and Babylon were divisions, the group of the recovered ones in Jerusalem was not a division.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yes, they were a group, but they were not a division.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, they were the recovered Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, we in the Lord's recovery are the recovered Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us also consider the situation of the nation of Israel today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The nation of Israel is recognized as a nation by the United Nations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But there are more Jews in New York City than in the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But are they the nation of Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who returned to the land of their fathers are the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Jews in New York City may say, "You in the nation of Israel are Jews, and we are Jews also.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, we in New York outnumber you in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why then do you call yourself the nation of Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Are we not the nation of Israel too?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No, they are not.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Jews in Israel should say to the Jews in New York, "Brothers, you are certainly part of the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please come back to the land of our fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Don't stay in New York."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We see by this illustration that it is absolutely correct for those who have returned to Palestine to call themselves the nation of Israel, for they are the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the Jews in New York City are not in the position to be the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although they are Jews by blood, by position they are Americans, not Israelis.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When those in the denominations have inquired of me regarding the church, I have said, "If we are not the church of Christ, then what are we?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Give us a name."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When they claimed that they also were the church, I replied, "Since you are also the church, you need to drop your denominational labels, such as Presbyterian and Baptist."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They said that they were not able to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To this I answered, "As long as you cannot drop your labels, you are not the church, but a division, a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is confusion."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the Jews living in New York would claim to be part of the nation of Israel, I would tell them to go back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But they may say, "I love Israel, but I still want to live in New York City so I can make more money.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I may live in New York, but I give money to support the nation of Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No matter how much money they give, still they are not the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The nation of Israel is the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As long as they are in the land with the proper government, they are the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The number of people is not the determining factor.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let us also use the illustration of the Smith family.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Suppose there are twenty-eight members in the Smith family, but most are scattered all over the country and just three remain at home.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Are these three not the Smith family?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Certainly they are.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those members of the Smith family living in Hawaii may say, "Does not the Smith family also include us?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You three are not the only members of the Smith family."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yes, the Smith family does include those in Hawaii, but they need to return home to be with the other members of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As long as they are in Hawaii, they are away from the family.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If those members of the Smith family living at home are not the Smith family, then what are they?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In like manner, we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we are not the church, then what are we?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yes, the church in Cleveland should include all the real Christians in Cleveland.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But the majority of genuine Christians will not come back home.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Rather, they prefer to stay in their divisions, and only a small number have returned.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Those who have returned are the church in Cleveland.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For them to take a name would be a mark of division.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They should not call themselves anything other than the church in Cleveland.</S>
