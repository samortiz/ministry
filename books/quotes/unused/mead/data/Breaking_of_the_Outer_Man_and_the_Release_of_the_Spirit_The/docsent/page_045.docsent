   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When God shines on us, it is a time for believing and prostrating ourselves, not the time for petitioning.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many brothers and sisters busy themselves in prayer when God is speaking to them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a result they do not see any light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The principle that brought us our initial salvation holds true for all subsequent works of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the time we were enlightened for our salvation, we did only one thing: We knelt down and prayed, "Lord, I accept You as my Savior."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Following this, something happened.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a man prays after he hears the gospel, "Lord, I beg that You would be my Savior," he may pray the same prayer for a few days without feeling that the Lord has saved him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As soon as the Lord shines on us, we have to fall under His light and say, "Lord, I accept Your judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I accept Your view."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do this, God will give us more light and will show us how filthy we are.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The day that God shines His light on us, many things will change before our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We thought that we had done many things in the name of the Lord and for love's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now the picture changes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We discover that hidden beneath our noblest goals are base and ugly motives.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We thought that we were absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we discover that we are full of plans for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In fact we are so full of these things that we can only fall on our faces.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man's self creeps into every nook and cranny; it even tries to usurp God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Is there anything that man cannot do?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Under God's shining, we find out the kind of person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As soon as God's revelation comes, our condition is exposed and laid bare.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He exposes us, and we see ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Previously, only the Lord knew us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We were naked and laid bare before Him, but not before ourselves; we still did not know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when God exposes all of the thoughts and intentions of the heart to us, we become naked not only before Him, but before ourselves as well.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we are naked and laid bare before ourselves, we no longer dare to lift up our heads.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before we are exposed, we do not know ourselves, and we can easily get by.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when we see ourselves under God's light, we are so ashamed that no place is good enough for us to hide ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we know what kind of person we are!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now we know the kind of boasts we made!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We thought we were better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we know the kind of persons we are!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot find more fitting terms before the Lord to describe ourselves; we can only say that we are filthy and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We admit that our eyes have been blind for years, that they have seen nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we see our filth, the more ashamed we become.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It seems as if all the shame of the whole world is upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We prostrate before the Lord and repent, saying, "I repent of myself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hate myself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I admit that I am an incurable man."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This shining, repentance, shame, loathing, and prostration will shake off what we have been unable to shake off all these years.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man's salvation comes from this instant enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The seeing and removing are one work; the two are joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the Lord shines, He saves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The shining is the saving, and the seeing is the deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need this kind of seeing before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only this kind of shining will remove our pride, and only this light will stop our fleshly activities and break our outer shell.</S>
