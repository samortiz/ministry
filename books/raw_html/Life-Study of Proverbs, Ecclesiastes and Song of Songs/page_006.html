<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE SOUND ATTITUDE THE NEW TESTAMENT<br>BELIEVERS SHOULD HAVE TOWARD PROVERBS</H2><P>The next matter that we need to see is the sound attitude the New Testament believers should have toward Proverbs.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Believing That It Is a Part of the Holy Word</H2><P>As New Testament believers, we should believe that Proverbs is a part of the holy word in God's holy Scriptures.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Realizing That It Is the Breath of God</H2><P>We should realize that Proverbs is the breath of God for us to breathe in that we may receive the life supply from God (2 Tim. 3:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Reading It</H2><P>Next, we should read Proverbs by being filled with the fullness of God in our spirit (Eph. 5:18-19), in the New Testament Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), with our regenerated spirit, and by pray-reading to mingle it with spirit and life (cf. John 6:63).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE SECTIONS</H2><P>Proverbs has four sections: the collection of Solomon (chs. 1&#151;24), the collection of Hezekiah (chs. 25&#151;29), the word of Agur (ch. 30), and the word of King Lemuel (ch. 31).</P>
