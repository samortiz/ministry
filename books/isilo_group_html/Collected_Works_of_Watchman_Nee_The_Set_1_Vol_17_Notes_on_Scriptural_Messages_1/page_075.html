He "for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God" (Heb. 12:2). This is His case. In principle, the process should be the same for us too.</P><P>Shame was given to Him by men, and He despised it. The cross was given to Him by God, and He endured it. He was misunderstood, expelled, accused, forsaken, and condemned by people, but He did not care. It was not that the shame was never very severe; the shame He encountered was something ordinary men have never encountered. It was not that His holy emotion did not feel shame when He was insulted; His feeling was probably keener than that of anyone else. However, He despised it; He did not pay attention to the shame. The cross God gave Him was not light. What He went through before men, demons, and angels was not something easy. However, our Lord endured the cross. He took it. He endured it. What was the result? He was victorious to the end and "has sat down on the right hand of the throne," waiting for the appearance of glory.</P><P>How we like to save our face! We are afraid of being shamed, misunderstood, criticized, and opposed. We try our best to be a nice person. We avoid being shamed. We are not willing to deny ourselves or to be shamed for the Lord's sake. Even when we take the shame, we take it reluctantly. We are not willing to take such shame (which decreases our soul-life) silently, without any self-defense, and without trying to escape.</P><P>We are not willing to bear the cross which God gives to us. We are not walking on the way of the cross. We do not even know what the way of the cross is. We do not know that whatever happens to us is permitted by God. Everything that is contrary to our intention, that puts false charges against us, causes us painful feelings, frustrates us in our environment, and evaporates our hope, are crosses from God. How do we treat these things? Does our heart resist them? Do we complain to others? Do we wish that these things would go away? Any rebellious attitude within us will cause us not to run well in the race.</P><P>God allows each cross to come upon us with a special purpose. Each cross has its own special mission and its own special accomplishment in us. If we endure it according to God's will, just as the Lord Jesus endured His cross (note that His cross was for redemption, while ours is not), our natural life will be dealt with one more time. We will become more enlarged to be filled with the resurrection life of the Son of God. Our resistance and rebellion, as well as our strength in struggling to escape, will frustrate God's purpose and cause the cross to come upon us in vain. They will cause us to fail in what God wants to accomplish.</P><P>God set the Lord Jesus before us so that we may imitate Him. In closing, this passage tells us, "compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary, fainting in your souls" (Heb. 12:3). "Such" here indicates the way that He was disgraced, insulted, mistreated, forsaken, scourged, hurt, crucified (the cross also having its aspect from men), and so on. We should compare with care and compare these things one by one. In this way, we will not be weary and faint in our souls. When the Lord mentioned His persecution on earth to His disciples, He said, "A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a slave above his master." We cannot expect to be treated any better than the Lord Jesus was treated. "It is sufficient for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master." It is good that we are not treated worse than the Lord Jesus. For "if they have called the Master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of His household!" (Matt. 10:24-25). Since He suffered all this ill-treatment on earth, how about us? If we consider these things, we will not be weary or faint in our souls even though we suffer and are disgraced and opposed.</P><P>One of the most dreadful things in the race toward the kingdom is being weary and faint in the soul. The soul is the organ of the emotion, mind, and will. Growing "weary, fainting in your souls" means being without strength in the soul. The will becomes paralyzed, the feeling cools down, and the mind loses interest. Everything seems to be vain, and we allow everything to take its natural course. "Whether or not I will receive a crown in the future is up to fate." One of the greatest temptations in running the race is that when all the things against us have swamped us, and we are unable to resist them, we simply give in to them and refuse to run seriously any more in order to gain the heavenly crown.</P><P>If we are willing to consider the Lord Jesus and examine His experience, we will not give in in this way. Gideon and his three hundred men were "faint, yet pursuing" (Judg. 8:4). We ought to be "faint, yet running."</P><P>May we all be persons who run the race. May we all be running until the end. Even if we are hurt, offended, misunderstood, and rejected while running, we still have to cheer up and run the race unwearily for the sake of the Lord Jesus. Who receives the most praises in a race? It is the one who is hurt, who rises up again, and who finally wins the first place. This person will surely receive unceasing praises. Therefore, being hurt and suffering are not a problem; even failing is not a problem. The one who falls down and rises up again is still the best runner. Brothers and sisters, today we are all in the race. Nothing counts today; everything will receive its final judgment at the end of the race. We should not give up, become weary, or faint in our soul for any reason. We ought to look unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith and run the race set before us!</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_074.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 17: Notes on Scriptural Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 75</div><br></body></html>
