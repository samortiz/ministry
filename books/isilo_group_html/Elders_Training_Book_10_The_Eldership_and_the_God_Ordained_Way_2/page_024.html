These four factors are four persons&#151;the Body, the Spirit, the Lord, and God. The Body as the object is mingled with the divine Trinity as the elements to be the factors of the oneness of the Spirit. The three factors&#151;the Spirit, the Lord (the Son), and the one God (the Father)&#151;are the elements of the oneness of the Spirit. These three elements are mingled with the Body, producing a fourth factor. The mingling of these four factors is the oneness of the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>By One Faith and One Baptism<br>as the Two Means</H2><P>The one faith and the one baptism mentioned in verse 5 are the two means to accomplish this oneness. Faith is the means for the Body to be joined to Christ the Head, and baptism is the means for the Body to be separated from Adam, the old head. Baptism separates us from Adam, and faith joins us to Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>With One Hope as the One Goal</H2><P>The oneness of the Spirit has the one hope of our calling, mentioned in verse 4, as the one goal. This goal is for the Body to be brought into the divine glory of the processed Triune God, who is mingled with the Body. Thus, in the oneness of the Spirit, there are four factors, two means, and one goal. The genuine oneness is the Spirit, the Son, and the Father mingled with the Body through baptism and faith, with a hope of something to come. This is the oneness. Anything besides these seven items is a foreign article that divides the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Making the Body an Object<br>of Seven Attributes of Oneness</H2><P>The one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one God, one faith, one baptism, and one hope make the Body one in every aspect as its attributes. The four factors of which the Body is composed, the two means by which the Body is separated from Adam and joined to Christ, and the one hope that is the glorious goal of the Body are the Body's attributes, which make the Body one in every aspect. The Body is altogether a matter of oneness.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 10: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (2) &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
