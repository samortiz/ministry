   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE FIRST TABERNACLE THE HOLY PLACE,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SIGNIFYING THE OLD COVENANT AS A TYPE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have seen, the first tabernacle, the Holy Place, signified that the old covenant was a type 9:1-2, 6, 8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since the Holy Place was a symbol of the old covenant, it signified that the old covenant was a type of the new.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the entire Holy Place was a type, a figure, not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. Of This World</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first tabernacle was of this world, of this creation 9:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was altogether material, not spiritual, and it was on earth, not in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was a temporary type, not the permanent reality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. With Ordinances of Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first tabernacle had ordinances of flesh 9:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>None of these ordinances was in the spirit or according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every one of them was related to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because they were of letters outwardly, not of life inwardly, they could only give the worshippers a form, not the slightest amount of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>C. Unable to Perfect the Worshippers</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first tabernacle as a type of the old covenant was unable to perfect the worshippers 9:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because it was not spiritual and had no life, it was unable to perfect those who served God through it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It exposed the shortcomings of God s worshippers, but it could not perfect them with real things of life in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>D. A Parable, a Type of the New Covenant</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first tabernacle was a parable, a type, of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was not the reality but only a type, a figure, of the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless, the Jews hold the type as the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must tell them of this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are very thoughtful and need this kind of help.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Hebrew believers likewise were not clear concerning this at their time and also needed help in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>E. The Way of the Holy of Holies,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>of the New Covenant,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not Yet Manifested until the Time of Reformation</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 8 says that at that time the way of the Holy of Holies had not yet been manifested while the first tabernacle still has its standing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At that time, the way of the Holy of Holies, that is, the way of the new covenant, had not yet been manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To say that the way into the Holy of Holies was not manifested while the first tabernacle still had its standing means that the way to enter into the new covenant had not yet been opened.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we come to 10:19-20, we shall see that a new and living way has been freshly cut.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the way to enter into the Holy of Holies, into the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we have seen, the first tabernacle, the Holy Place, signifies the old covenant, and the second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, signifies the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now the veil that closed the Holy of Holies has been riven by the death of Christ Matt 27:51 since it has crucified the flesh Heb 10:20; Gal 5:24 , and the way of the Holy of Holies has been manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, we do not need to remain in the Holy Place, the old covenant, in the soul; we must enter the Holy of Holies, the new covenant, in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the goal of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The writer seemed to be saying to his readers, Hebrew brothers, you should no longer remain in the old covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You now have a new way to come out of the old covenant and enter into the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The writer s concept in the book of Hebrews is that the Holy of Holies and the new covenant are one; the Holy of Holies is the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we come into the Holy of Holies, it means that we come into the new covenant, and when we come into the new covenant, we enter into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Very few Christians have seen this or have found this key.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Regardless of the number of times they have read this chapter, they do not understand what it is talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But we have found the key, which is that the Holy of Holies is the new covenant and that the new covenant is the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we come into the Holy of Holies, we are in the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the new covenant we have the imparting of the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the new covenant God is our God and we are His people according to the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the new covenant we have the inward ability to know God and the forgiveness of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we put all these together, we find that we are in God s presence, at His oracle, and are meeting with God and having fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the new covenant with the law of life.</S>
