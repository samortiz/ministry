In the New Testament there is only the church of God (1 Cor. 1:2; 10:32), the church of Christ (Rom. 16:16), and the church of the saints (1 Cor. 14:33; 1 Thes. 1:1). There is not a church of the apostles in the New Testament. The apostles are the slaves serving the churches. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4:5, &#8220;For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus&#8217; sake.&#8221; I have a question mark, though, about some of you. You are trying to build up yourselves, and you do not consider yourselves as slaves to the churches. No church belongs to any apostle or to any worker. This is the missionary way. All the missionaries who went to China claimed that what they raised up was their church. If they were sent by the Baptist Mission, they raised up a Baptist Church. If they were sent by the Presbyterian Mission, they raised up a Presbyterian Church. We must ask ourselves whether we also claim our churches. Of course, we all would say that we never claimed the churches in this way, but we must consider what is unconsciously there in our heart.<p>I do believe that even the angels could testify for me that I never considered any church as my church. Some people accuse me of controlling, and some have even said that I control the Far East with a &#8220;remote papal system.&#8221; One brother from one of the churches in Taiwan recently testified that the leading elder in his locality was altogether against my ministry for six years. This brother also testified that during these six years I did not do anything. For six years this leading elder was against me to the uttermost. He brought in a kind of pentecostal teaching and publicly told people in the meetings that he found contradicting portions in my Life-study Messages. I never did anything, however, to vindicate myself or the ministry. This is just one example which shows that I do not control the churches. All of us must reconsider where we actually are. There are many subconscious and subtle things hidden within us.<h2 class=head2>Ambition and Pride</h2><p>All the problems are due to two old &#8220;gophers&#8221;-ambition and pride. If our ambition plus our pride had been killed, there would never be any problem. We like a position. We like to be honored and highly regarded by people. We may not say this, but we must be honest before the Lord. What has been within our heart? If we were not ambitious, we could never have trouble with others. If we do not have ambition and if we do not have any element of pride, we would have no problem with anyone. When I heard about that case in Taiwan, it did not bother me.<p>Could you stand this kind of test? Think about the real situation around you. Why do you need to be afraid that you would be cut off? Because of the subtle thing hidden within you-ambition. You want to keep your position. If you are not afraid of being nothing, you would never think that people would cut you off. To try to preserve your position and to safeguard it is the foolish way to keep your position. This does not work.<p>In the church position is just like a dove. If you do not want it, it comes to you. If you want it, it flies away. When I first came to San Francisco, I saw some doves on the street. When I approached them, they flew away. When I walked away, they all flew back to the same spot. Position is like a dove. If you want it, it flies away. If you are hunting for position and you want to have a position, you will never get it. If you say that you do not want position and if you flee from it, it will come to you. To keep a position, the wisest way is not to have it. If you want to grasp a position, the position is gone already. It is not yours because you are not qualified to keep that position.<p>This is something very subtle which has killed all the Christians during the past centuries. Why have there been power struggles among many Christians and Christian groups? The reason is the ambition for position. I hate to see that this kind of element would come into the Lord&#8217;s recovery. We all must admit, however, that we are still human. On the one hand, we are saints. On the other hand, we are still human. I must testify that day after day I was trembling before the Lord. I prayed in such a way: &#8220;Lord, thank You for another day to live You. I need Your mercy and I need Your preserving grace. Without this, Lord, You know I am still natural. I am still so much in my self in the old creation. Lord, You know that immediately without Your mercy and grace, I would live according to my flesh. I need You, Lord.&#8221; If we have a heart which is not so purified but rather mixed up with a main purpose for the Lord&#8217;s recovery and a subsidiary purpose hidden for ourselves, whatever we do will cause us trouble.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
