   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH 4 AS TYPIFIED BY ISAIAH,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PROPHET OF JEHOVAH,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR A COVENANT OF THE PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>TO RESTORE THE LAND Scripture Reading: Isa 49 50; John 14:10; Hosea 11:1; Matt 2:15b; John 13:31b; Rom 8:33a, 31, 34a</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chapters forty-nine and fifty of Isaiah present Christ as typified by Isaiah, the prophet of Jehovah, for a covenant of the people to restore the land.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we will consider these two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. THE THREE PERSONS OF THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to understand Isaiah 49, we need to see the three persons of the servant of Jehovah Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>5-9a , Isaiah the prophet vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1-4 , and Israel v. 3 . Both Isaiah the prophet and Israel consummate in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All three are one servant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, all are Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Israel, of course, is Israel, Isaiah was an Israelite, and Jesus Christ was a typical Israelite.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, as Israelites they all are one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, as a whole, Israel was God's servant, His witness, in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Isaiah as a part of Israel also was a servant of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the New Testament Christ is unveiled as the Servant of God Mark 10:45 and His Witness Rev 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This again shows the oneness of Isaiah, Israel, and Christ as servants of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But in the New Testament, our oneness with Christ as servants of God is seen more clearly, because the New Testament says that we are in Christ 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Together we are one corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since we are in this corporate Christ, and Christ is the Servant of God, we also are one servant of God, one witness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is God's eternal view, and this is the view we need to have in order to understand Isaiah 49 50.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A. Isaiah, the Prophet of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Isaiah, the prophet of Jehovah typifying Christ as the Servant of God for God's speaking John 14:10 , served Jehovah as His mouthpiece to speak forth His word, which is the embodiment of Himself Isa 49:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Isaiah spoke for God, but Christ spoke for God much more.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In His ministry on earth, the main thing He did was speak for God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even after He ascended to the heavens, He continued to speak, for He spoke in the speaking of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Epistles of Paul, for example, are a continuation of Christ's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word of God is God's embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we speak forth God's word, we speak forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We cannot speak forth God without speaking forth God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all need to learn how to speak forth God's word.</S>
