   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO REASON FOR DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to Romans 14, there is no reason for Christians to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, most Christians are accustomed to the existence of "high places."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some may even feel that today's "high places" are right and necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We think this way because we were born into an environment filled with division, with "high places" of every variety.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because we are so accustomed to division, we may have very little feeling about it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul's feeling in Romans 14, on the contrary, was altogether different.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here he encourages us not to argue over such things as eating or observing days.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Concerning these things, we should refrain from expressing our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this way, the oneness of the believers will be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the previous chapter I referred to a joint meeting of Christian groups that was held for awhile in Los Angeles in 1963.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The members of these groups were eager to come together for the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hearing of their interest and of their proposal to have a joint meeting, I gave them a word from Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I pointed out that if we intend to practice the church life, we must take the way set down by Paul in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many Christians talk about the Body life in Romans 12, but they neglect the principles in Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without Romans 14 it is impossible to have the Body life described in Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Throughout the centuries, Christians have been divided by opinions over doctrine and practices.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, Christians are divided over the matter of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is disagreement not only about the mode of baptism, but also about the water that is used and the name in which believers are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The opinions concerning baptism have caused many divisions, even many elevations that exalt a particular opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, it is of crucial importance that we follow the way exemplified by Paul in Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those from these groups assured me that they would take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, after just a few weeks, problems developed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some insisted on playing tambourines and speaking in tongues in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Others strongly opposed these practices.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, neither group was willing to give in and to care for the feeling of others in order to maintain oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, it was not possible for that joint meeting to continue.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The ones in these groups expected everyone to be the same as they were.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, if we have such an expectation, it will not be possible to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church life must be all-inclusive, able to include all manner of genuine Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Romans 14 Paul had no intention of taking sides on the questions of eating or of observing days.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead, he said, "He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives thanks to God" v. 6 . This was Paul's attitude, and it should be our attitude today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not try to make everyone the same as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, although we may not speak in tongues, we should not forbid others to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the other hand, those who speak in tongues should not insist that others do so as well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we have this attitude, we shall not be sectarian, and there will be no "high places" among us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some accuse us of narrowness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, we are not narrow, for we receive all genuine Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The ones who are narrow are those who insist on a certain doctrine or practice.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Their insistence on a particular matter causes it to be elevated and uplifted in place of Christ.</S>
