   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Preaching in the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit has the function of preaching in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we preach the gospel, the Spirit preaches in our preaching 1 Thes 1:5; 1 Pet l:12b .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Giving Joy to the Believers in Affliction</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Another function of the Spirit is to give us joy in our affliction 1 Thes 1:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we are suffering, we enjoy the Spirit s joy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Inspiring for Prophecies</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit has the function of inspiring for prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Thessalonians 5:19 and 20 say, Do not quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not despise prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit is quenched by us when we would not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all have to admit that we quench the Spirit many times.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the meetings of the church, we may have the feeling that we should stand up to speak, but we do not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to be strong in making up our mind to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We Christians have a very wonderful function.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we speak, the Spirit comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 2 Thessalonians 3:1, Paul asked the saints to pray for him that the word of the Lord might run and be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For the word of the Lord to run is for the word of the Lord to have free course see 2 Thes 3:1 KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The free course of the word is our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If no one spoke the word of God, this would mean that God s word was fully blockaded.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are going to let the word of God run, we have to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not despise prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That means we should not despise the speaking.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 19 of 1 Thessalonians 5 tells us not to quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then verse 20 tells us not to despise prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These two things go together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we quench the Spirit, we surely despise prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Thessalonians 5:19 and 20 imply the inspiring of the Spirit in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should speak whether we feel it is the right time or the wrong time to speak 2 Tim 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, the time is always right for us to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The considerations in our mind that discourage us from speaking for the Lord are devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to reject such considerations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may have a burden to speak and yet not know how to begin our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have learned not to consider what I would speak as an opening word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We just need to stand and speak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Quite often when I begin to speak, I am not very clear what I am going to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the Lord is faithful to give me the living speaking by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, this does not mean that we should speak in a loose or nonsensical way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to look to the Lord as the Spirit, trusting Him to speak in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Still, as long as we speak, this is better than not speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not be overly concerned about making mistakes when we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we do things in a wrong way, we learn to do them in the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a person wants to learn how to play the piano, he must practice and make mistakes to learn how to play correctly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His tutor will correct him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our tutor in our speaking for the Lord is the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Vindicating Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Who Was Manifested in the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to 1 Timothy 3:16, the Spirit functioned to vindicate Christ, who was manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The incarnated Christ in His human living was not only vindicated as the Son of God by the Spirit Matt 3:16-17; Rom 1:3-4 , but also justified, proved, and approved as right and righteous by the Spirit Matt 3:15-16; 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was manifested in the flesh, but vindicated and justified in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was in the flesh manifesting God, and He lived in the Spirit Luke 4:1, 14; Matt 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This Spirit vindicated that He was God manifested in the flesh.</S>
