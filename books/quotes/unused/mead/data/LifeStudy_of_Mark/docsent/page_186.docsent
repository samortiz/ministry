   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR SPIRITUAL UNDERSTANDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At this point I would like to say, by way of reminder, that when we read the Bible, we should not understand it in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not understand any word in the Scriptures in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The problem among Christians is that, for the most part, they read the Bible according to their natural understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our need is for spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was the reason Paul says in Colossians 1:9 that he asked on behalf of the saints that they would be filled with the full knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was also the reason Paul prayed, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him Eph 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul knew that in this Epistle spiritual mysteries would be unveiled, and he knew that he had to use human language.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was concerned that the receivers of this Epistle might understand his writing merely in a natural way according to the letters in black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, Paul prayed that the Father would grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This prayer indicates strongly that we should not try to understand the Bible in letter merely according to our natural mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No doubt, since the Bible is something written, we need a proper understanding of the words written.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the interpretation of what is written should not be according to our natural understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, the interpretation must be according to spiritual wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In particular, we need a spiritual understanding of how the Lord Jesus preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE LORD S WAY OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Mark 1:14 tells us that Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to verse 15, He said, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Repent and believe in the gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord s word here is brief.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no record in this chapter of a lengthy message given by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He came to Galilee to preach the gospel, He did not say, You all must realize that you are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You became fallen in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now you need to repent and believe in Me as the One who has come to die for your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you do not repent and believe, you will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Mark there is not such a message given by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only one chapter in the Gospel of Mark is devoted to the Lord s preaching, and this is chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Chapter four contains the only message of the Lord Jesus recorded in Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He did not give a message in chapters one through three; neither did He give a message in chapters five through sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His one message recorded in Mark was not preached to sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Taking a boat as His Holy of Holies, He preached the gospel to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sowing Himself as the Seed</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is the central thought of the Lord s message in Mark 4?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The central thought is that the Lord is the Sower sowing Himself into us as a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He opened His preaching in chapter four with these words: Behold, the sower went out to sow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Later, in 4:26, He said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we have the Lord as the Sower sowing Himself as the seed into God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some may question why we say that the Lord Jesus came to sow Himself into people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They may wonder why we do not say that Jesus came to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reason we emphasize the Lord s sowing is that the proper understanding of preaching the gospel has been spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yes, the New Testament says that the Lord Jesus came to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, He did not preach the gospel according to our understanding of the way the gospel is preached.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the contrary, in Mark 4 we see that the Lord preached the gospel by sowing Himself as a seed into people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Mark 1 we are told that the Lord Jesus came to Galilee preaching the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But how did He preach the gospel, and what is the gospel the Lord preached?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not understand either the gospel itself or the preaching of the gospel in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Concerning this, many Christians are covered by a thick veil of tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They take for granted that they know what it means, according to the New Testament, to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As we have seen, chapter four of Mark reveals that to preach the gospel is to sow the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we have pointed out in previous messages, the seed sown in Mark 4 is the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we want to have a proper understanding of the gospel and of the preaching of the gospel, we need to consider what is revealed in the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First, in 1:14 we see that the Lord preached the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In verse 15 He spoke of the kingdom of God and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Mark there is no further mention of the kingdom until chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have seen that 4:26 says, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, in chapter four of Mark we see what the kingdom of God is, and we also see what it means to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to this chapter, to preach is to sow.</S>
