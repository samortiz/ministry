   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Eighty-three THE ONE MOST FORGIVEN Scripture: Luke 7:36-50 Receiving Jesus This is a story about a Pharisee named Simon, who invited Jesus to have dinner at his house.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today there are also many who, like Simon, have heard of the fame of Jesus and want to study about Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They even want to have some contact with Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do not treat Simon s invitation as a sincere one or one coming out of believing; he only cared to investigate a little.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Knowing Jesus Although the Pharisee invited Jesus, he really did not know who Jesus was.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He had no idea that Jesus was the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He even questioned whether Jesus was a prophet, saying, This man, if he were a prophet would have perceived...</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Luke 7:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today there are many who study Christianity, but they still do not know who Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some even consider Jesus inferior to Confucius or some other great philosophers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While the Pharisee was trying to figure out in his heart who Jesus was, Jesus perceived the intent of that Pharisee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Pharisee was talking to himself in his heart, but Jesus knew.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This proves that Jesus is an extraordinary One.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord is not only a prophet, but One who knows the intent of man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fact that Jesus knew the intent of the Pharisee proves that Jesus is God who knows the heart of man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The answer of the Lord was intended to show the Pharisee that the Lord Jesus was not only a prophet but also his Lord, and even the One to whom he was indebted, the One whom he had offended.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is a twofold meaning in the way that the Lord Jesus showed him that He was the Lord: 1 the Lord Jesus is God, and 2 the Lord Jesus is the One to whom he is indebted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Pharisee considered Jesus only a good rabbi, but what the Lord Jesus did showed him that the One speaking to him was the very Lord who knew the hearts of men, and who was the One to whom all men are indebted.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Knowing himself The Pharisee knew only the sinful woman.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He did not know the Lord Jesus, and he did not know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many have studied about the Lord Jesus, but never knew who Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In due time the Lord Jesus let them know that He is God, and that He is the One to whom they are indebted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today many know only the sins others have committed, but they do not know themselves, much less the Lord Jesus whom they have offended.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many false Christians fit into this category.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The words of the Lord Jesus helped the Pharisee to know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While the Pharisee was doubting in his heart about the Lord Jesus, the Lord Jesus said right away: Simon...a certain lender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred shillings, and the other fifty Luke 7:40,41 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord showed him that although he may not have sinned and owed as much as that woman did, nevertheless at least he owed fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The woman was like a robber on a large scale, and he was like a thief on a small scale, the difference being the difference between fifty and five hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not one can say that he does not owe anything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There may be some difference in the size of the debt, large or small, much or little, but all are debtors.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord showed him that he owed at least fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, the Lord showed him that he was unable to pay back even that fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However large or small a sin he had committed, he still remained a debtor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Knowing grace The Lord said that both their debts, the five hundred shillings or the fifty, were equally forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The forgiveness of the Lord is neither casual nor careless, because the Lord is not only gracious but also righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord s grace caused Him to forgive, and the Lord s righteousness caused Him to die in our stead.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord s forgiveness must be based upon His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>True, the Lord s forgiveness is due to His grace, but it is also based upon His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The result of forgiveness The Lord forgave men so that men would love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord said the reason the sinful woman washed His feet with her tears, wiped them with her hair, and anointed them, was that she received more of the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The reason the Pharisee who invited the Lord Jesus for dinner did not wash His feet showing that he neglected the Lord was that he received less grace of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One to whom much is forgiven loves much, and one to whom little is forgiven loves little.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not that love produces grace and forgiveness, but that forgiveness produces love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Love is the result of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The reason that woman loved the Lord more was that she had received more grace and forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The assurance of forgiveness There is a difference between the fact of forgiveness and the assurance of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some received the fact of forgiveness but not the assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That woman had received the fact of forgiveness long before the Lord spoke, but she did not have the assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, she did not know whether her sins had been forgiven or not.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The assurance of forgiveness is found in the words of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord said to her, Thy sins are forgiven v. 48 . Many have believed in the Lord Jesus and were really saved, but they did not have the assurance because they did not lay hold of the words of the Lord as their assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After receiving forgiveness</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Go in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After being saved, you should walk the way of peace and live the life of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You should refrain from doing anything that makes you feel uneasy toward God or toward men.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do only what you feel at peace in doing.</S>
