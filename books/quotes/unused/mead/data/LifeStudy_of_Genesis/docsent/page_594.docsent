   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Branching over the Wall</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These branches are branching out over the wall 49:22 , that is, they are spreading Christ over all restrictions, magnifying Him in all circumstances Phil 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis 49:22 says that Joseph's branches run over the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The wall signifies restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since the day of Pentecost, wall after wall has been erected to restrict the spreading of the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One day Peter was even put into prison Acts 12:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But not even that stronghold could restrict the branching out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Year after year, decade after decade, and century after century, walls have been raised up by the opposers and by the enemy to restrict the church's fruitfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the branches have run over the wall every time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I can testify of this by what I have seen and experienced during the past fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During these years I have seen the fruitfulness of the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Nee, raised up by the Lord in China, was certainly a bough of a fruitful tree, a branch of the fruitful Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I was with him, I became very clear that nothing could restrict his testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Nee was burdened to bear a testimony of Jesus that was opposed to organized Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result, even many Christians put up walls to restrict him, and they spread rumors about him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let me give you an illustration of the evil rumors.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After he was saved, Brother Nee received great help from a sister named Margaret E. Barber.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Miss Barber had a co-worker named Miss Gross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both Miss Barber and Miss Gross were missionaries who had come from Britain to China.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, by the time Brother Nee was saved, they had left their missions and were in China living by faith in God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because Brother Nee received so much help from Miss Barber, Miss Gross also came to know him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since Brother Nee was under the helping hand of Miss Barber, he was simultaneously also under the help of Miss Gross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1929 Miss Barber went to be with the Lord, and Miss Gross remained and moved to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One day Miss Gross heard the report that a woman was living with Brother Nee, and she came to him to check with him about this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brother Nee was still single, and, like Miss Barber, Miss Gross, as an elderly sister, loved him and was very concerned about him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Miss Gross said, "I have heard that a woman is staying with you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Is this true?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Brother Nee answered, "Yes," Miss Gross rebuked him, asking how he, a single young man, could have a woman staying with him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Nee related this incident to me himself to help me understand something about self-vindication.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He told me that he was happy to be rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He also told me that the woman staying with him was his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He said this, not to vindicate himself, but to render some help to me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I asked Brother Nee why he did not tell Miss Gross about this, he replied, "She didn't ask me who the woman was.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She only asked whether or not a woman was staying with me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I told her that a woman was living with me, she rebuked me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I didn't say anything."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is one illustration of the rumors spread about Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another illustration: Immediately after his wedding, a great turmoil was stirred up in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was another wall raised up by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brother Nee showed me a newspaper, the leading newspaper in Shanghai and perhaps in all of China.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In huge Chinese characters there was a negative article regarding his marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brother Nee said to me, "Witness, in my whole life I never heard about such a thing happening after a wedding."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today many rumors are being circulated about us, but as yet none of them are as evil as the rumors spread about Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The fact that a rumor was circulated concerning a woman staying with Brother Nee indicates that the enemy was constantly trying to raise up walls to restrict his fruitfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But Brother Nee's fruitfulness has run over the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today his fruit can be found throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No one can wall it in. Even if some raise up a wall one hundred forty-four cubits high, the branches will still run over it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As the years went by, I saw all the things that happened to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I thank the Lord that I was allowed to see those things and experience them with him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, when I hear the rumors spread about me, I can laugh and say, "I am prepared for this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the past I saw a wall one thousand feet high.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But your wall is a mere fifteen feet."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I would like to tell all the opposers throughout the United States, "I don't think you can build a wall one thousand feet high.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Probably the highest wall you can build is five hundred feet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, I have already experienced branching over a wall one thousand feet high."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord knows that I am not boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At least two elderly brothers from China among us here can testify that in the past I suffered together with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Having rumors spread about us is nothing new.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If possible, we should tell the opposers they are wasting their time, for they cannot suppress this testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The higher the walls are built to restrict us, the faster the branches will spread over them.</S>
