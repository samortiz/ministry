<p>Bible readers recognize that Babylon the Great, the mysterious Babylon, mentioned in Revelation 17, refers to Roman Catholicism. By studying history, it is easy to see that Roman Catholicism is associated with Babylon the Great because it is full of divisions and confusion. When some ask, &ldquo;Are there no children of God in Catholicism?&rdquo; we should acknowledge that there are, but they are in a situation of mixture. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls.&rdquo; Those who have a little understanding of Roman Catholicism know that red is the most distinctive and vivid color in the Vatican.</p>
<p>In Revelation 21 the New Jerusalem is the bride (v. 2), the city is of pure gold (v. 18), the foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with every precious stone (v. 19), and each of the gates is, respectively, of one pearl (v. 21). Catholicism, however, uses gold, precious stones, and pearls only in the way of gilding, which refers to outward adornment by layering gold, precious stones, and pearls on something that is not of the same material. In Roman Catholicism there truly have been some lovers of the Lord. Madame Guyon can be likened to a pearl, and Brother Lawrence can be likened to a precious stone. However, these exceptions do not represent the true nature of Catholicism. They speak only of an aspect of adornment in Catholicism.</p>
<p>Verse 4 of chapter 17 says, &ldquo;Having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations.&rdquo; In typology gold signifies the divine nature. Therefore, the golden cup shows that on the surface Roman Catholicism does indeed have some things related to God. She preaches the unique God and declares the name of Jesus Christ, but her &ldquo;golden cup&rdquo; is &ldquo;full of abominations.&rdquo; This is Roman Catholicism today. Although there are some genuine children of God, some gold and precious stones and pearls within her, they are mixed in among evil and unclean things.</p>
<p>Verse 5 says, &ldquo;On her forehead there was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.&rdquo; This mysterious Great Babylon is the great harlot, the mother of many harlots. This mother is a great harlot who has given birth to many daughters, each one of whom is a harlot. The great harlot is Roman Catholicism, the mysterious Babylon. Revelation is a book of revelation and prophecy. Chapter 17 is a prophecy concerning Roman Catholicism and the various denominations, sects, and groups in Protestantism, which evolved from Roman Catholicism and which are all the harlot daughters of the great harlot. There certainly are things of God and children of God in Protestantism, but they are under the influence of Roman Catholicism, and they are in a situation full of division and confusion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARING FOR THE PROPER GROUND<br />
IN ADDITION TO SPIRITUALITY</h2>
<p>Today it seems as if God&rsquo;s children care only for spirituality and have no consideration for the proper ground. In addition to various denominations in Protestantism, there are many small free groups that are apparently quite spiritual. However, in God&rsquo;s eyes they are divided, confused, without principle, and without regulation because they follow their own preferences. If a married woman is not faithful to her husband, it does not matter how meek and kind she is toward others; she is still in a confused and improper situation. Her meekness and kindness mean nothing. In God&rsquo;s creation there is a governing principle of one husband and one wife. If a woman does not care for God&rsquo;s principle but only for her preferences and tastes, God&rsquo;s principle will be violated. Regrettably, this is the condition in today&rsquo;s Christianity. All the denominations, sects, and free groups in Christianity have been established according to preferences, which result in the violation of God&rsquo;s principle.</p>
<p>In contrast, a married sister who sees the principle of one husband and one wife will be preserved from the temptation of following her own preferences and tastes even if her marriage is difficult at times. In Matthew 19:7 the Pharisees disputed with Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Why then did Moses command us to give her a certificate of divorce and divorce her?&rdquo; Jesus answered them, saying, &ldquo;Moses, because of your hardness of heart, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so&rdquo; (v. 8). The Lord told the Pharisees that divorce was not according to God&rsquo;s principle from the beginning. He recovered the significance of human marriage to correspond with God&rsquo;s original ordination.</p>
<p>Today various groups in Christianity are like women who act according to their preferences and tastes, but they only produce confusion. This is inappropriate, because initially Christians met according to the principle of oneness without confusion. Oneness is the way that was from the beginning. I would like to inoculate the young people from the temptations that come from speakings like &ldquo;Such-and-such fellowship is so good; let us go there,&rdquo; &ldquo;Such-and-such denomination is so good; let us go there,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I know a place where we can listen to many good sermons.&rdquo; When you hear such things, you need to reply, &ldquo;Please stay away from me. I cannot go to Babylon. I cannot follow that great harlot Babylon or follow any of her daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Christians do not take the matter of the oneness of the church seriously, they will fall into the principle of the harlot and be involved with the many daughters of the harlot, even if they are not involved with the great harlot. Today we should take only the way of Jerusalem; we should not casually follow any Babylonian principle. Babylon represents division and confusion; any division and confusion are of Babylon or of the daughters of Babylon. They are all harlots in God&rsquo;s eyes. We have no desire to accuse others loosely but rather to proclaim God&rsquo;s truth and holy Word faithfully.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOLDING FAST THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE OF GOD&mdash;<br />
ONE CITY, ONE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We have all seen that the great harlot in Revelation 17, Babylon the Great, is Roman Catholicism, and her daughters are divisive Christian groups established at will, based on self-preferences. These groups have taken the way of harlots, falling into the position of a harlot, by not holding fast to God&rsquo;s governing principle. God&rsquo;s governing principle is oneness&mdash;one city, one church&mdash;just as in a household there can be only one husband and one wife. Because there is one Christ, there should also be one church.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s ordination is related to Jerusalem, but Jerusalem is troubled by the division and confusion of Babylon. Today division and confusion are prevalent because there are so many denominations, sects, and free groups in Christianity. There is nothing that can be put on their signs that will change the fact that they are in the principle of a harlot because of their division and confusion. Divisions produce harlots; this is an extremely serious matter. In contrast, Jerusalem is oneness without confusion. There is only one church in Taipei even though there are many meeting halls, because the saints in Taipei are one and without confusion. If another &ldquo;church&rdquo; were established in Taipei, it would be in the principle of Babylon. We need to be cautious because divisiveness and division are not small matters. Several years ago some brothers did not see the seriousness of this matter, and they went out from among us to set up their own meetings. The result of this has been division upon division and confusion upon confusion.</p>
<p>Those who create division and confusion, no matter the reason, are in the principle of being a small harlot in God&rsquo;s eyes. Whether or not a Christian group is a small harlot is not dependent upon its spiritual condition but on its position and standing. If some are standing as the church in Taipei, the establishment of another &ldquo;church&rdquo; only creates division, and it involves the divisive ones in the principle of Babylon. There is a church in Taipei, and all the saints in Taipei should know that in God&rsquo;s eyes the establishment of another group involves the principle of Babylon.</p>
<p>We must hold fast to God&rsquo;s governing principle whether we are in Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung, or Keelung. There cannot be another &ldquo;church&rdquo; in a locality where a church is standing on the ground of oneness. If there is, the principle of the harlot is present. We all need this compass, and we need to clearly see that Babylon is related to division and confusion but that Jerusalem is related to oneness without confusion. The church is today&rsquo;s Jerusalem, and any activity outside the church, no matter the group or the acts, comes from those who are standing in the position of a harlot. Although these words are not pleasant to the ear, I must speak them because a desire for acceptance from man cannot replace the need to speak God&rsquo;s word truthfully.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
