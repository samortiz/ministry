<p>Because of our shortage in the past, we have been speaking concerning exercising the spirit, blending in the spirit, serving as priests, and entering into the Holy of Holies. God always uses the Word and the Spirit to revive and supply the church. Sometimes the Word is emphasized, and at other times the Spirit is emphasized. More than forty years ago the Lord began a work of revival to supply the churches in the Far East. Since then, the emphasis has been on the Word. As such, our testimony and work, the establishment of local churches, and the raising up and producing of co-workers and other serving ones have all come about through the Word. Through our ministering the Word, we have brought forth the work, churches, and co-workers and serving ones. In the past forty years we have focused on the Word. If we continue to focus on the Word but neglect the Spirit, we will become unbalanced and dry. Eventually, we might fall into a state in which, instead of conveying the Spirit, the Word turns into empty doctrine and dead letters. We would lose the operation of the Spirit. This is the problem that the Brethren experienced. We are afraid of repeating their mistake.</p>
<p>I have a heavy burden that we would be balanced in the Word and the Spirit. There have been many ministers of the Word whose messages were more spiritual and inspiring than the messages we give. However, these ministers were short of the Spirit, and as a result, they ministered doctrine. These cases serve as a warning to us. We must not repeat the mistakes of those who have gone before us by allowing an unbalanced and dry situation to exist. Therefore, we are focusing on the strengthening of the Spirit. When we spoke of the building of God, especially the blueprint of His building, He reminded us not to approach the building in the way of doctrine but to be balanced by leading the saints to be blended in spirit.</p>
<p>It is more troublesome to lead the saints to exercise their spirit, to function as priests, and to minister in the spirit than it is to give a message. As long as the brothers have good utterance and use proper illustrations and superior content, the saints are willing to receive what is spoken. But when we ask them to pray, they hesitate. They seem to say that it is too difficult to pray. In order to learn a new skill, we must be willing to endure some pain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LISTENING TO THE MESSAGES WITH PRAYER</h2>
<p>Our situation is unbalanced because it is leaning toward doctrine. Everyone attends the conferences because there is someone giving the messages. The saints come to hear messages. A few years ago we conducted Life-study meetings in Taipei. For six months the number of those in attendance did not decrease. We also held a ten-day conference concerning building, and every day there were around two thousand three hundred saints in attendance. However, when the responsible brothers announced that we want to pray, the number of saints immediately dropped by one thousand. We should ask ourselves whether this is normal. Two thousand three hundred saints came to hear messages for ten days, but as soon as we announced our desire to pray, the number dropped by one thousand. If two thousand three hundred saints come every day to listen to messages, it seems reasonable that the same two thousand three hundred saints would pray every day. If we use our eyes, ears, mind, and heart to contact the Word of God, we should use our spirit to contact the Spirit.</p>
<p>Some might ask whether prayer is as important as the messages. Yes, it is. When we preach the gospel, people might be deeply touched and even moved to tears, but if they do not open their mouths to pray, no one will be saved. There is a certain gospel friend who is moved to tears every time he hears the gospel, but he has never prayed. Consequently, he still is not saved.</p>
<p>One day a person came to see me and said that more than twenty years ago he was moved when he heard a gospel message, so he attended a few gospel meetings. The more he listened, the more he was touched, and he was even moved to tears. However, he felt that he was not saved. When I asked whether he had prayed, he said that he did not pray when he was touched, even though he felt that he was sinful. Because no one helped him to pray and repent, he stopped going to the gospel meetings, and his inward feeling gradually disappeared. This example shows that no matter how much a person is moved by a message, if he does not open his mouth to pray with his spirit, he cannot touch the Spirit. This is an undisputed fact.</p>
<p>A person may be greatly touched many times, but he cannot be saved without prayer. This same principle applies to reading the Bible and listening to messages. We have been giving messages for more than a decade. If we consider the messages that have been given, our situation should be many times better than what it is today. However, in spite of the many messages that we have heard, our spiritual condition has not changed very much. Although we cannot say that there has been no growth, we must admit that we are not where we should be.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters have heard many messages, but the result is far less than what we expected; we have not prayed enough. I respectfully present this problem before all of you. Please consider, what would be our situation if, after every message, the saints would bring what they understood to the Lord in prayer?</p>
<p>By God&rsquo;s mercy we have the truth, revelation, and the ministry of the word. The messages are truly high and weighty. Those who hear the messages appreciate them and are touched by them. However, the impact produced by these messages is far less than what we anticipated. It seems as though we have heard too much. We hear with our ears and our mind, and we appreciate what we hear. Our heart is touched, but we must admit that we pray too little; hence, the effect is far less than it should be.</p>
<p>We must learn from history and not repeat the mistakes of the past. If we continue giving messages without adequate prayer, the result will be poor. I deeply regret the work we have done in the past. We cannot take the way of just the Word. Although we cannot disregard the Word, we should not neglect the Spirit. We must not lead the saints to listen to messages without prayer. When the number of saints in a conference drops by one thousand in a prayer meeting, there is an unbalanced situation that must be corrected.</p>
<p>In Acts the number of those who heard the message given by Peter was also the number who prayed. Chapter 2 says that three thousand people were saved. After they were saved, they all &ldquo;continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers&rdquo; (vv. 41-42). Not only did they listen to the message, fellowship, and break bread, but they also prayed. If the same number of saints attended the prayer meeting and listened to the message, our situation would be normal, and we would be balanced. I am not despising the messages that we give; they are effective. In the past thirty to forty years, we have supplied the churches through ministering the Word, without which we would not have our present growth. However, the Lord has shown us that this way is not adequate. We must also focus on the Spirit in order to balance our present situation. Just as we have focused on the Word, we should likewise focus on the Spirit. Just as we have supplied the churches with the Word, we should likewise supply them with the Spirit.</p>
<p>The brothers who minister the Word should know the living of the priests. Christ is everything in the living of the priests. Christ is what they wear, eat, and drink, and He is also where they dwell. All the churches should focus on the living of the priests in the ministry of the Word. However, before we focus on the living of the priests, we must lead the saints into exercising their spirit by prayer; otherwise, the spirit of the saints will not match the word that is spoken, and it will not be as effective. Not only the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones must have strong spirits; the saints who attend the meetings regularly must also have strong spirits. Then we can continue and minister concerning the living of the priests.</p>
<p>Blending in spirit is not a seasonal matter. Blending in spirit is a lifelong matter. We need to pray immediately after we hear a message, we need to pray immediately after we read a portion of the Bible, and we need to pray immediately after we gain spiritual knowledge. If we do not pray, at most the words will enter into our heart; they will not enter into our spirit. We will have heard words and understood them, and our heart will desire and receive them, but they will enter only into our heart; our spirit will not be moved. As a result, the words will be only words to us; they will not convey the Spirit. It is not until we pray in our spirit, digesting the words we have heard with our spirit, that the words can enter into our spirit and become spirit and life to us. I hope that this word will strengthen our feeling concerning the Spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
