   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX 9 Issue No. 20 THE SABBATH,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HOLY COMMUNION, AND BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: Recently, some churches have proposed that one should not keep the Sabbath on the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not God's will in the Bible that we observe the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In taking the holy communion, we should use unleavened bread and grape juice and should not have anything else as a substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Baptism should be by immersion and not by sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is better to have foot-washing at the same time we have the baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Wang</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Answer: We can only follow the Bible in everything we do.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Other than the Bible, no other human words should move our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1 Please note that we are not "keeping the Sabbath on the day of resurrection."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christians do not keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To say that Christians should keep the Sabbath is an anti-scriptural expression.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Where in the Bible does it say that Christians should keep any Sabbath?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should know that with Christians there is no Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We only come together to meet and to break the bread Acts 20:7 , to make our offerings 1 Cor 16:1-2 , and to rejoice Psa 118:24 on the first day of the week, which is the day of resurrection, the Lord's Day, according to the commandment and example of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Other than these, whether or not it is a Sabbath, whether or not we should do business or work on this day, are all questions related to the Jews and have nothing to do with us Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is a pity that there are too many Old Testament Christians!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2 The Bible does not have the words holy communion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a product of the Roman Catholic Church and a term left over from the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible only says the "supper" 1 Cor 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Of course, our emphasis is not on the rituals, but as much as possible we should use unleavened bread and grape juice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No doubt that was what the Lord used on the night of His betrayal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To follow the Scripture in this way will leave no doubt in the hearts of the weak brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>3 All the baptisms in the Bible are water baptisms.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, sprinkling is unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All those who have not been baptized in the scriptural way have not been baptized at all.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here we need to add another word: baptism alone will not save a person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But in order to belong to the Lord fully, a person has to act fully according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>4 Foot-washing is not a ceremony.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Personally, I believe that foot-washing should be practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is needed in foot-washing is humility, selflessness, love, and obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do not have these things, it is better that we do not practice foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To interpret the Bible spiritually does not thereby annul the commandments of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As to whether one should have the foot-washing after baptism, I do not see such a commandment in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the saints consider foot-washing a kind of ritual, it is better that they do not practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>SCOFIELD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Question: In what teachings are yours different from those of Mr. Scofield? Kuo</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Answer: Mr. Scofield's teachings are generally the same as ours.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The differences we have with Mr. Scofield are merely on a few questions related to the Sermon on the Mount, the rapture, and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To me, the Sermon on the Mount is what Christians ought to keep, the rapture will take place only in the case of the watchful and waiting ones, and not all those who have received eternal life will enter the kingdom to reign with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Mr. Scofield does not believe this way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>DAVID'S PLACE AMONG HIS BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Question: Is David the seventh or the eighth son of Jesse?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First Samuel 16:10 and 11 say that Jesse called his seven sons to pass before Samuel, none of whom were chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When he was asked if he had more sons, he answered that there was still the youngest one, who must therefore have been the eighth son.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But 1 Chronicles 2:13-15 records the names of the sons of Jesse, and David is ranked as the seventh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The two places are different.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Why is this so?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lin</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Answer: According to the order of birth, David was the eighth son of Jesse.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is a reason why he was called the seventh son.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First Samuel 16 was recorded when David was young.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that time, all his brothers were alive, and he was the eighth son.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First Chronicles was recorded at the time David became king.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One of his brothers had died and had no children.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His name was therefore removed from the record of the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As such was the case, David became the seventh son.</S>
