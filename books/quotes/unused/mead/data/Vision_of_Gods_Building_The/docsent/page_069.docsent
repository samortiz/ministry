   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>17 THE ONE INNER FLOW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our seventeenth point is that regardless from which direction we approach the city, regardless of which gate we use, we will be on just one street Rev 22:2 along with everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Remember that the New Jerusalem is shaped like a mountain, with the base of the city, a square.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This "mountain" has three dimensions, all of equal measure: it is twelve thousand stadia in width, length, and height.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The city's one street winds downward in a spiral fashion from the top to the base.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It begins at the throne at the top, and the last spiral of the street passes the twelve gates at the base.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So regardless from which side or by which gate you enter, you will be on the same street with all the others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not divided.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are all in one way, one flow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How significant!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not just the same street, it is the one street.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In a city there may be two streets which are quite alike, but this street is the one street, which means that there is only one flow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How wonderful it would be if all Christians cared only for the inner flow!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose that I am a Christian of Chinese origin visiting Christians in Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Chinese people differ greatly from the Japanese; yet when we forget all the outward things and simply care for the inner feeling, the inner flow, the result is indeed wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is the same taste, the same feeling, the same sense everything is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This principle also applies, of course, to Christians from Europe and America.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The problem is that although the inward flow is one and we are all in that one flow, we care for too many outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose that a group of Christians are together and having wonderful fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are all in the one flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But then one Christian in conversation asks another, "To which church do you belong?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The other may reply that he is a Methodist, and the first may exclaim, stiffening a bit, that he is a Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Most of us have had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we fellowship together about Christ, there is a wonderful flow; but when we talk about the denominations, everyone's face becomes long.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, in the New Jerusalem, we will all be in the same flow, in the one street, and we will all partake of the same food.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I hope that it will not be too late for some.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>18 THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our eighteenth point is that in this city there is real fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This fellowship begins from the throne and reaches all the gates.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is in the flow the river of life, with the supply the tree of life, and the way the street of life Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, this fellowship is not just among ourselves; it is also a fellowship between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not only horizontal; it is also vertical.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we are in the flow of life, enjoying the supply of life and walking in the way of life, spontaneously we have fellowship one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have proper and genuine fellowship with all the saints and with God on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you check your experiences, you will find this to be true.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We will see more later concerning this flow, this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>19 THE KINGSHIP AND THE PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have seen that the fellowship is in the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now we must see that it is also related to the throne Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The throne represents authority, and the proper fellowship in life is always related to the authority of the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, the authority is related to the kingship, and the fellowship is related to the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the inhabitants of the New Jerusalem are both kings and priests.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There must be these two aspects in God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need the kingship or the authority, and we also need the priesthood or the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Old Testament clearly illustrates this principle in every phase of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Moses represented the kingship in the building of the tabernacle, and Aaron, the high priest, represented the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All these had fellowship together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The tabernacle was built up by the authority and by the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>King Solomon represented the authority in the building of the first temple, and the high priest was there, representing the priesthood, the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Following the seventy years of captivity, in the recovery of the building, there was Zerubbabel, the governor, and Joshua, the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Chapter six of Zechariah portrays Christ as the builder of God's temple.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Upon His shoulders are the two offices of the kingship and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As the king He possesses the authority, and as the priest He has the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The building of the church is accomplished only by these two offices the authority and the fellowship, the kingship and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the church is to be built, there must be authority and order.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Each of us must subject ourselves to the Headship, the Lordship, the Kingship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This will deliver us from all kinds of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christianity today is full of confusion, but there can never be any confusion in the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Just a little confusion will tear down the building.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Any building contractor will tell you that proper order must be maintained during construction.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Confusion only damages the building process.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the church the authority of the headship must be exercised among all the members that we may have order without any confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, the kingship requires the balance of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What is the priesthood?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is all of us ministering to the Lord together as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must pray much together.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I do not believe any church can be built up by ministry alone.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must pray together as priests, ministering to the Lord, having fellowship one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In this way we will experience the kingship and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Vertically, there will be the order and authority, and horizontally, there will be the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this way the church building will be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We need more fellowship under the headship; then we will have the order and the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Spontaneously, all the materials will be put together and the reality of the building will be realized and accomplished.</S>
