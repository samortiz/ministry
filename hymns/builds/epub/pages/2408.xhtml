<div class='line'><b>1</b> Oh listen to a story of abounding grace</div>
<div class='line'>Of how our God came down to earth to join the human race</div>
<div class='line'>And through His kind intention, He came up with a plan</div>
<div class='line'>That He Himself might be expressed by dispensing into man.</div>
</div>
<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>Oh what a kind intention, oh what abounding grace</div>
<div class='line'>How our God came down to earth to join the human race</div>
<div class='line'>It surely was a mystery so deep we could not trace</div>
<div class='line'>That we might be to the praise of the glory of His grace.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> For God had predetermined, by His counsel and His will</div>
<div class='line'>That man might be a vessel, which He Himself would fill</div>
<div class='line'>And so for this He chose us, back in eternity</div>
<div class='line'>And He predestinated us His very sons to be.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> His task, it was not easy, it surely took much grace</div>
<div class='line'>When on the earth He first appeared, a man in time and space</div>
<div class='line'>And then for 33 long years, He lived out God in Man</div>
<div class='line'>That He might fully carry out all of the Father's plan.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> At the end of His lifetime, He did a wondrous thing</div>
<div class='line'>Went to the cross and shed His blood, redemption to win</div>
<div class='line'>This brought us into favour, into a blessed place</div>
<div class='line'>For God forgave our offenses by the riches of His grace.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> Now in the application, the Spirit's moving in</div>
<div class='line'>Applying all the Son has done, forgiving all our sin</div>
<div class='line'>He's sealing God into us, full sonship to bring</div>
<div class='line'>Oh, this is the mystery of the universe, and this is why we sing.</div>
