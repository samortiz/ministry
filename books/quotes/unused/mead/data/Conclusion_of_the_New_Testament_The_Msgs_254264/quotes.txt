[2]  In these messages on the conclusion of the New Testament, we have covered six persons: God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, the church, and the kingdom.
[3]  According to Revelation 21, the New Jerusalem will be the wife of Christ vv.
[4]  2, 9-10 and also the tabernacle of God, His habitation v. 3 . Revelation 21:7 indicates that the wife of Christ is composed of sons.
[5]  Since we are the components of the New Jerusalem and since the New Jerusalem, the Jerusalem above, is our mother, we, the sons, are the components of the mother.
[6]  God told Abraham to send Ishmael away, saying, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called" Gen 21:12 .
[7]  God never recognized Ishmael as Abraham's heir, for He regarded Isaac as the unique son.
[8]  The producing of Isaac was altogether a matter of God's grace, that is, of God Himself given to His chosen people to produce His many sons.
[9]  In this message we will consider some further matters regarding the Jerusalem above being the mother of the believers.
[10]  Concerning the Jerusalem from above, there are six vital matters: the Father, the grace, the mother, the sons, the city, and the covenant.
[11]  In the two foregoing messages we saw that the New Jerusalem is the Jerusalem above, which represents the new covenant and which is the mother of the believers.
[12]  In this message we will go on to see that the New Jerusalem is the city of the living God.
[13]  Seen from Afar, Longed after, and Waited for by the Old Testament Saints
[14]  In the foregoing messages we have seen that the New Jerusalem is the Jerusalem above and the city of the living God.
[15]  A. The Aggregate of the Result of God's Work of the New Creation in All the Dispensations within the Old Creation
[16]  The New Jerusalem is a sign of the aggregate of the result of God's work of the new creation in all the dispensations within the old creation.
[17]  In the Dispensation of Grace on the New Testament Believers
[18]  When, at the fullness of time Gal 4:4 , God determined that His purpose in decreeing the law had been attained and that the law had been used to its full extent, He became flesh, thus terminating the dispensation of law and inaugurating the dispensation of grace.
[19]  When God inaugurated the dispensation of grace, the Triune God became flesh in the Son, who was born of a woman to become Christ, possessing both the divine nature and the human nature and bringing grace and reality John 1:1, 14, 17 .
[20]  B. The Composition of All the Old Testament and New Testament Saints, the Sons of God Who Have God's Life and Nature, to Inherit All That the Processed Triune God Is, Built Together as God's Eternal Building
[21]  Hence, the New Jerusalem is the composition of all the Old Testament and New Testament saints.
[22]  The New Testament reveals that the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God Rev 21:3 and also the wife of the redeeming Christ v. 9 . In this message we will consider these two aspects of the New Jerusalem.
[23]  Revelation 21:3 says, "I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be His peoples, and God Himself shall be with them."
[24]  C. The Dwelling Place of God among Men the Nations in Eternity
[25]  Revelation 21:3 and 24 indicate that the New Jerusalem will be the dwelling place among men the nations in eternity.
[26]  Those people who do not follow the devil to rebel against God at the end of the millennium will be transferred to the new earth to be the nations living around the New Jerusalem and walking by its light.
[27]  B. Having Been the Bride of Christ in the Millennium
[28]  In the new heaven and new earth Christ will have a wife, but in the millennium He will have a bride Rev 19:7-8; 21:2 , consisting of the overcoming believers.
[29]  We have seen that the New Jerusalem is the Jerusalem above, the city of the living God, a sign, the tabernacle of God, and the wife of the redeeming Christ.
[30]  The Names of the Twelve Tribes of Israel Representing All the Old Testament Saints
[31]  The New Jerusalem is composed firstly of the Old Testament saints.
[32]  The ultimate consummation of God's eternal economy, His eternal plan, is the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people.
[33]  God is in this mingling, and His chosen people also are in this mingling.
[34]  The foundation of the New Jerusalem is the twelve apostles representing the grace of the New Testament, indicating that grace is the foundation of the holy city.
[35]  We can see this in Galatians 4, where the covenant of grace refers to the Jerusalem above v. 26 . The Jerusalem above is a producing mother who produces the sons of God.
[36]  Being the Foundation for the Building Up of the Church
[37]  The more we experience Christ and gain Christ, the more we participate in the divine element of Christ, and the more we become constituents of the New Jerusalem to be built up together with all the God-chosen and transformed people, that we could be the holy city, God's eternal dwelling. c.
[38]  The New Jerusalem as the holy city has many aspects.
[39]  The New Jerusalem as the holy city will be absolutely separated unto God and will fully protect the interests of God.
[40]  In Resurrection, Signified by the Measure of a Man as an Angel
[41]  The gates of the New Jerusalem are for all the saints to enter and participate in the holy city.
[42]  Bringing In the Mingling of Humanity with Divinity Signified by Four Man Multiplied by Three God to Form Twelve
[43]  Three gates on each of the four sides, constituting the number twelve, implies the mingling of the Triune God with man, God's creature.
[44]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY-TWO THE NEW JERUSALEM 9
[45]  In this message we will consider four more aspects of the New Jerusalem as the holy city the temple in the city, the light and the lamp, the street, and the throne.
[46]  The temple being the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb signifies the processed Triune God as a dwelling place for all the redeemed and perfected saints to dwell in and serve God in eternity.
[47]  Revelation 21:21 says, "The street of the city was pure gold as transparent glass."
[48]  The entering into the New Jerusalem as the holy city is through Christ's death and resurrection, whereas the daily walk, the daily living, in the city is according to the divine nature, signified by the street being pure gold.
[49]  In this message we will consider the four remaining aspects of the New Jerusalem as the holy city: the river, the water of life, the tree of life, and the kings and priests within the city.
[50]  Signifying Christ, the Embodiment of the Triune God, as the Divine Life
[51]  Because God and life are abstract, the abstract God needs an embodiment, and this embodiment is Christ.
[52]  Christ's Deeds, Signified by the Leaves, Healing the Nations on the New Earth to Keep Them Existing for Eternity
[53]  Having covered the various aspects of the New Jerusalem as the holy city, we will consider in this message two other matters related to the New Jerusalem: the enjoyment in the New Jerusalem and the New Jerusalem as the conclusion of the entire divine revelation and the central and ultimate consummated significance of the entire divine revelation.
[54]  The first aspect of our enjoyment in the New Jerusalem will be to participate in the holy city as the embodiment of all the blessings of the processed and consummated Triune God.
[55]  C. To Drink of the Water of Life Flowing from Its Spring Christ as the Flow of the Processed and Consummated Triune God
[56]  Another aspect of the enjoyment of God's redeemed in eternity is the water of life Rev 22:17; 21:6 .
[57]  The water of life of the life-giving Spirit is our eternal drink, and the life-giving Spirit is actually the processed and consummated Triune God flowing Himself out to be our drink.
