   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR HUMAN RESOURCES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we gospelize Taiwan, every town and village will have churches with Truth Lessons classes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This will be a glorious sight.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our current practice is to build up the church life in the homes; however, we still need a large meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The large meeting hall in Linkou will not only be a meeting place for the saints; it can also be a training center.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The training will be held every year, and there will constantly be new people coming through it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Soon people from around the world will come to attend the training; therefore, we will need to prepare two thousand beds.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even though every aspect of society in Taiwan is good, it is not sufficiently ethical or moral.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The newspaper contains many articles concerning arson, murder, assault, and robbery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that there is not enough truth in this land and that there is a lack of the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, we need to bear the burden to gospelize the island of Taiwan, after which we must go to every country and gospelize the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not think that this is merely a dream; this can be put into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we have one thousand people today who are equipped with the truth and have a foundation in foreign languages, we could send them out immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We receive phone calls from South America, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and many other places, saying, Please send us someone; we need help.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are more than ten countries in South America that are open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They receive the Life-study messages as if they are receiving a treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot translate the publications fast enough to meet their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every place needs the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, in the future it will not be sufficient to send out only the publications to spread the work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must also send out people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the full-time brothers and sisters pass through the training in the truth, receive experiences in serving the Lord, and learn some foreign languages, they will go and gospelize the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not idle speculation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE NEED FOR FINANCIAL RESOURCES</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are many brothers and sisters in Taipei who love the Lord but whose circumstances do not allow them to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, they can give their money and become money-supplying full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some saints will preach the gospel and do the Lord s work full time; other saints are in the church life and earn money for the use of the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The only difference between these two types of full-time serving ones is that some are full time with their time, and others are full time with their money.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The saints who cannot give their time to serve the Lord can be money-supplying full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to this understanding, all the brothers and sisters are full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need a budget for any move we make.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Most of the saints who answered the Lord s call to serve full time are recent college graduates.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, during their time of training and after they are trained and enter into the Lord s work, the churches will need to bear the burden of their monthly support.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Their support will not be a small amount.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our goal is to take care of the full-time serving ones and then build the large meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have full assurance concerning our financial budget.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Initially we said that of the saints who regularly attend meetings, one in every twenty should serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, nineteen saints should support one full-time serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There are 42,000 brothers and sisters in the Lord s recovery on the island of Taiwan, and approximately 18,000 of them attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we calculate one-twentieth of those who attend the meetings, there should be nine hundred full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is possible for the number of saints in the meetings to reach 20,000 by 1988.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that there can be one thousand full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, it will not be difficult for us to obtain the human and financial resources needed to gospelize Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There are two things that we need to consider.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to consider who is willing to serve the Lord full time and whether the brothers and sisters are faithful in their material offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to our present situation, it will be easy for us to produce one thousand full-time serving ones by 1988 if the brothers and sisters give one tenth of their income for this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The building of the large meeting hall is not only for the churches in Taiwan; it is also for the churches around the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In these next few years the brothers and sisters should do their best to offer money for the building of a large meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since we agree with the present way that we are taking, we must give our offerings according to the ability the Lord has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE LORD S BLESSING AND THE ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I believe that the Lord will bless this island and that this move will bring in a further blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord s blessing is the basis for our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the Lord does not bless us, we have nothing to offer Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are three great assets in the Lord s recovery: the truth, the churches throughout the earth, and the base for producing one thousand full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The human and financial resources are being produced in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because of the presence of the churches in Taiwan, God is taking care of His testimony, and He is blessing this country.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are in the last days of this age, but the gospel that has been preached over the earth is the general gospel, not the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God has given us the responsibility to preach the gospel of the kingdom, and He wants us to take the gospel of the kingdom to North and South America, to Africa, to Australia, and to the whole inhabited earth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>More than twenty years ago I went to America by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At the time I was almost sixty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I still remember the first conference we held on The All-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this conference I spoke for ten days on the three verses of Deuteronomy 8:7-9.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This conference surprised the pastors and professors who were there.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They had never studied or even heard the truth that was released in that conference.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I hope that when those who are sent out to preach the gospel of the kingdom speak, the local people will marvel and say, Where did these people learn such truths?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The move to gospelize Taiwan has begun.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The full-time brothers and sisters will go out in groups to every part of the island, and they will leave on the same day.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This will be very impressive.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They will move forward quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The present situation does not allow us to advance slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Most armies send supplies to a place before they send the troops; hence, I hope that the brothers and sisters are able to match the Lord s leading in their material offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The brothers and sisters who are trainees should be in one accord and care for one another while they are in the training.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They must also learn to be frugal and show mutual concern by taking care of their necessities and giving the surplus to others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>May the working saints do their best to give in order to cooperate with the church and to accomplish the Lord s move.</S>
