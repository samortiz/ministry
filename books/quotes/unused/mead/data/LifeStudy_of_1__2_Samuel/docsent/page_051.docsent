   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Saul declared that he had fulfilled the word of Jehovah, Samuel asked, "What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears and the lowing of oxen that I hear?" vv.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verses 22 and 23 Samuel continued by speaking a very strong word to Saul: "Does Jehovah delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices/As much as in obeying the voice of Jehovah?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>/Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,/And to heed, than the fat of rams./For rebellion is like the sin of divination,/And insubordination is like idolatry and teraphim."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here Samuel seemed to be saying, "Saul, you say that you spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to Jehovah, my God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But God prefers that you obey His word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He told you to utterly destroy the Amalekites and all that they have.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed, to take care of, God's speaking is better than the fat of rams.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Saul, you have rebelled against God, and rebellion is like the sin of divination, like the sin of witchcraft.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What you did was just as evil as contacting an evil spirit for the purpose of carrying out the intention of that spirit, not God's intention.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You did not subordinate yourself to God as your Head but acted presumptuously, according to your ways and by your will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now your kingship is over.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because you have rejected the word of Jehovah, He has rejected you from being king."</S>
