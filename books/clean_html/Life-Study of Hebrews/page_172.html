<h2 class="head1">II. ALL THE BELIEVERS OF THE NEW COVENANT<br />MUST RUN THIS RACE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. By Putting Off Every Encumbrance,<br />Weight, Burden, and Impediment</h2><p>Hebrews 12:1 says, &ldquo;Therefore let us also, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, putting off every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, run with endurance the race which is set before us.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;encumbrance&rdquo; may also be rendered &ldquo;weight,&rdquo; &ldquo;burden,&rdquo; &ldquo;impediment.&rdquo; The runners in a race must strip off every unnecessary weight, every encumbering burden, that they might have no impediment to winning the race. Notice that here Paul says &ldquo;us,&rdquo; not &ldquo;you,&rdquo; including himself in this matter.</p><h2 class="head2">B. By Putting Off the Entangling Sin</h2><p>Verse 1 mentions &ldquo;the sin which so easily entangles us.&rdquo; Sin here refers mainly to the thing which entangles us from running the race, just as the willful sin mentioned in 10:26 would keep the Hebrew believers away from the new covenant way in God&rsquo;s economy. Both the encumbering weight and the entangling sin would frustrate the Hebrew believers and restrain them from running the heavenly race in the new covenant way of following the Jesus who was rejected by Judaism. To the staggering Hebrew believers, the thought of shrinking back and returning to Judaism was an entangling sin. The sin mentioned in this verse is particular and unique, for Paul uses the definite article, saying, &ldquo;the sin.&rdquo; This unique, entangling sin was the willful sin of forsaking the assembling together with the saints, of giving up the new covenant way, and of going back to Judaism.</p><h2 class="head2">C. With Endurance</h2><p>There is much opposition to this race. Thus, we must run it with endurance (12:1). This means that in order to run the race of Christ, we must suffer the opposition with endurance, never growing weary or fainting in our souls.</p><h2 class="head2">D. By Looking Away from All Things</h2><p>In verse 2 Paul told the Hebrew believers to look away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of faith. The Greek word translated &ldquo;looking away unto&rdquo; means to look with undivided attention by turning away from every other object. The runners in a race, such as the hundred yard dash, turn away from everything else and look at the goal with undivided attention. In this verse Paul seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Hebrew brothers, do not stand there considering and looking around. You must turn away from everything other than Christ and look to Him with undivided attention. This is the way to run the race.&rdquo; The Hebrew believers had to look away from all the things of their situation, away from their old religion and its persecution, and away from all earthly things that they might look unto Jesus who is now seated at the right hand of the throne of God in the heavens.</p>
