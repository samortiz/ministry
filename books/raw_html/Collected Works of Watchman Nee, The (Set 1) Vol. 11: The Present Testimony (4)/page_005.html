<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God Dealing with<br>Moses' Fleshly Wisdom and Power</H2><P>We all know the story of Moses. He was eloquent, wise, competent, and knowledgeable. He thought that he could come forward to do something. He saw the enemy oppressing his brothers, and he slew the enemy with his fleshly power. The next day he saw two Israelites fighting, and he exhorted them to be at peace. He might have thought that this would be a very easy thing to do. Little did he realize that they would not receive him. Instead, they brought up the incident of his slaying an Egyptian the day before. As a result, Moses fled to the land of Midian.</P><P>What does this mean? Moses knew only his wisdom and power. He had not yet recognized his foolishness and weakness. God wanted him to realize that there were things that he could not do by himself. He wanted to help God save the people of Israel, but God did not need man to help Him. Anyone who tries to help Him with his fleshly wisdom and power will never please Him. There are many people that God will not use, not because they lack wisdom and power, but because they have too much wisdom and too much power. He cannot use them; He has to put them aside and cool them down. He cannot use them now; He has to wait until their strange fires are no longer burning.</P><P>Moses was a man who tried to help God with human wisdom and power. God put a halt to him and did not use him. The reason for this is that soulish and emotional wisdom can easily stir up fleshly power. These have no place at all in God's work. Moses stayed in the wilderness for forty years. He was not only tried by God but was also trained by Him. He began to realize that all that he possessed was vanity. Only after he had reached this point could he be useful. In the same way, God is now putting us in the wilderness to try us and to train us. He has put us aside, but we still do not understand His will. Repeatedly He has dealt with us, but we still do not submit to Him. Repeatedly He puts us in our place and strips us of a smooth environment in order that we will surrender under His mighty hand. He wants to see if we are willing to walk according to His will. Our own opinion has to be dealt with. This is a gate we must pass through. The Israelites' rejection of Moses was of God. Pharaoh's seeking to slay him was of God. His escape to the lonely wilderness was of God. He communicated with God during those many years in the wilderness under God's training, and in the end, he realized his own uselessness. After that he no longer wanted to use his own power to save the children of Israel. He no longer thought of himself as a great and competent man or as an extraordinary person in the spiritual realm. He knew that he could not do anything. This was where God wanted him to be.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Moses Acknowledging His Own Powerlessness</H2><P>Later at Mount Horeb, God sent Moses to save the people of Israel. If Moses had heard this word in the first forty years, he would have gone very gladly. There would not have been the need for God to send him; he would have volunteered to go himself. He only knew what he could do; he did not know what he could not do. Now Moses was different. He knew who he was. He also knew that his wisdom and power could not accomplish anything. Therefore, he said to the Lord, "Who am I,...that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?" (Exo. 3:11). He was now quite different from before. Before, he thought that no one other than him could do anything. Now, he said, "Who am I?" He was no longer self-confident or self-assured. He considered himself to be nothing. Brothers, God will lead us to this point. This is a spiritual withdrawal, a holy withdrawal, and a blessed withdrawal. If God has not caused us to realize from our heart that we are nothing, we still cannot be used by Him.</P><P>Moses said, "Who am I,...that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?" (Exo. 3:11). He considered himself so small and realized his own incompetence. If we have never considered ourselves in this way, we cannot do God's work. Moses now saw that this work was too great and that he was too small. He had learned the lesson and dared not exercise his fleshly wisdom and power anymore. He acknowledged his weakness, that he could do nothing. He did not even dare to evaluate himself. He could only ask God, "Who am I?" He left it to God to evaluate him. He had to be led by God to this point before God could use him.</P>
