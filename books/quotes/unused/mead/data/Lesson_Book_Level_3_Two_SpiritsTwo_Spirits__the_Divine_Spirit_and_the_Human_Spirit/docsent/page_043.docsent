   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Spirit Within and the Word Outside</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last lesson we pointed out that in order to preach the gospel effectively we must gain a rich deposit from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we see more clearly why this is so crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We surely need the Spirit's empowering, but it is the Word that we must preach.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have the Holy Spirit in our spirit, and we have the Holy Word, the Bible, in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These should not be two things, but two ends of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The end within us is the Spirit; the end outside of us is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Word enters our spirit it becomes the Spirit, and when the Spirit is expressed from our mouth it becomes the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE DAILY NEED TO TOUCH</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE SPIRIT IN THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our need, then, is to spend time every day to touch the Spirit in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even if we take as little as ten minutes to pray-read a portion of the Word, we shall receive nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the very least, we should do this every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The morning is the best time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before you go to school, before you do anything, pray to touch the Lord, apply His precious blood, and open the Bible to receive the Spirit through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As saved and regenerated ones, we have the Spirit of God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, when we exercise our spirit in pray-reading the Word, we apply the Word to us and mingle the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Immediately, we receive the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The all-inclusive, compound, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold intensified Spirit is embodied in the Word!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually you will find that ten minutes is too short a time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit is rather abstract and mysterious, but the Word of God is concrete and in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus is both the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without taking the Word, we cannot have the Spirit, because the Spirit is embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we would receive the Spirit through the Word, we must take the Word by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although the Spirit is our power for preaching, the Word is what we must preach.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every day we need to open the Bible to receive the Spirit through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>QUESTIONS Describe the two extremes concerning the Spirit among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is the proper balance?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What do we mean when we say that the Spirit is embodied in the Word?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Give three portions of Scripture that indicate that the Spirit and the Word are one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Briefly explain each portion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why is it so important that we exercise our spirit when we read the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How does the book of Acts show us that the Word is something living?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why do we need both the Spirit and the Word for our gospel preaching?</S>
