According to the Elements of the World</h2><p>The philosophy and empty deceit are not only according to the tradition of men, but also according to the elements of the world. Here and in 2:20 and Galatians 4:3, this expression does not refer to substances; it refers to the rudimentary teachings of both Jews and Gentiles, teachings that consist of ritualistic observances in meats, drinks, washings, and asceticism. In the eyes of Paul, the traditions of men were merely elementary principles. These traditions are included with the elementary principles of the world.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Not According to Christ</h2><p>Paul concludes verse 8 by saying that the philosophy and empty deceit are not according to Christ. Christ is the governing principle of all genuine wisdom and knowledge, the reality of all genuine teaching, and the only measure of all concepts acceptable to God. The book of Colossians focuses on Christ as our everything.</p><p>To fall short of being according to Christ, firstly means that we do not take Christ as life (3:4). Secondly, it means that we do not hold Christ as the Head of the Body. Furthermore, it is not to know Christ as the mystery of God (2:2), nor to experience the indwelling Christ as the hope of glory (1:27). Finally, to be not according to Christ means that we do not walk in Christ (2:6).</p><p>If we take Christ as life, hold Him as the Head of the Body, know Him as the mystery of God, experience Him as the hope of glory, and walk in Him as the all-inclusive Spirit, then we shall not be deceived by anything or by anyone. Those who do not experience Christ in these aspects can easily be deceived. If you analyze the situation of those who have been deluded and carried off as spoil, you will realize that they did not experience Christ in these five ways. They did not realize that Christ alone is everything in God&rsquo;s economy, and they did not take Christ as their life or as their Head. Furthermore, they did not experience the indwelling Christ as their hope of glory, nor did they live, move, and have their being in Christ. As a result, they were defenseless, and eventually were deluded and carried off into captivity. Our defense against deception is the Christ who is our life, our Head, the mystery of God, the hope of glory, and the good land in which we walk.</p><p>I believe that all these messages on the all-inclusive Christ will help to guard us against delusion and against being carried off as prey. They will build up a strong defense for us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Without such a defense, we can easily be deluded and carried off as spoil. But if we experience Christ as the center of God&rsquo;s economy in all these aspects, we shall be protected, and we shall not be deluded or carried off as spoil.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_061.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_063.html">Next</a> </body></html>
