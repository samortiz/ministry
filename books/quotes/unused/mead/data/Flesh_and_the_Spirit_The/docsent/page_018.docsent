   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We can use electricity as an illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The power plant is far away from the electrical lights in a building, yet these lights are one with the power plant when they are turned on.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In a sense, they are in the power plant because they are experiencing the electricity at the power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Apparently, we are here on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But actually, we are all in heaven when we turn ourselves to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not have two Christs one in our spirit and the other in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The One sitting at the right hand of God in the third heaven is the very One in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The same electricity can be simultaneously in the power plant and in a distant building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the same way, Christ is in the third heaven interceding for us, and He is also in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While He is interceding for us, He is talking with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many times while we are speaking, He is speaking in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are being built into the habitation of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our spirit is the gate of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May the Lord open our eyes to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not need any admonishing or exhorting to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need the message from Romans 7 and 8 to see how ugly our flesh is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is nothing good in our flesh, yet it is still here to help us turn to Christ in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ in the likeness of the flesh of sin crushed the sinful flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In resurrection He was transfigured into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He has come into us and is indwelling our spirit to impart life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is strengthening, supporting, and sustaining us to live a heavenly life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the same time, He is in the third heaven interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After listening to this fellowship, do not make up your mind to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This never works.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have to see the vision concerning the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You have to see a clear view of Christ as the Spirit in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not pray, "From now on I will make up my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I will never walk according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I will never lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I will never be a shame in the eyes of my wife."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That is a satanic prayer in the realm of the tree of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That is not a prayer by Christ interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We simply need to turn to the Lord in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then He will become more and more real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we can tell the Lord, "You are my world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You are my kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You are my sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You are my realm.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hallelujah, Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You are everything to me."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then the Lord will be happy, and He will become more to you in your experience for the fulfillment of His economy.</S>
