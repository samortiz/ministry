   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE CREATION AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, that later the earth became without form and void, and that God restored the earth and all the things on the earth in six days.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we will go on to consider the spiritual significance of all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Concerning the original creation, we only know that "in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" Gen 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the following verse we see that the situation changed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Things were not the same as they were before: "the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep" 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Surely this was not the situation that God originally created, because the Bible clearly states that God "did not create it waste" Isa 45:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, in Genesis 1, between verses 1 and 2, there was a great change.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the earth became desolate, God began His work of restoring the earth which He had judged.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From the first day until the sixth day, God worked to restore the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the seventh day He rested.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is it merely God's intention to let us know how He created and restored the world?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Or is there a deeper significance?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Is there a difference between the "new creation" and the creation of the world in those days?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Is the creation of the physical world similar to the spiritual world?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The outward world is only a reflection of the inner world.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The way in which God dealt with this great world is the same as the way He acts toward each individual.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In God's plan and in its fulfillment, the process of creating the physical world and the experience of personal spiritual renewal are related.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The history of creation typifies the path of the experience of our life in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our present focus is not on the history of ancient mankind, but rather on the spiritual experience of individuals today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In these latter days, the greatest failure is that people pay too much attention to mankind and forget about the individual man himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But God is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although He wants to bless mankind, He starts with individual men.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He does not look lightly upon any person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"And not one of them two sparrows will fall to the earth apart from your Father" Matt 10:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From the acts of God, we should see the Father's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man has sinned and has fallen; yet, thank God that He does not look lightly upon any person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His heart is poured out toward everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just to know this should comfort us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only God's heart can satisfy man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I."In the beginning" means the beginning of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" Gen 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the heavens and the earth first came out from the Creator's hand, how fresh and beautiful they were!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perfection, purity, beauty, and brightness were the condition of the heavens and the earth at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"The morning stars sang together, / and all the sons of God shouted for joy" Job 38:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How joyful!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No sound of sighing or sorrow was mingled with that joyful melody.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What harmony between the Creator and the creation!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There was no sin, no Satan, no sorrow, no pain, no sickness, no death, but rather graciousness and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Surely it was a world of sublime bliss.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This was the original condition of man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The original condition of Adam and Eve was perfect, just as the material world was perfect in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Man was created in God's image and after God's likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God prepared a companion for him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God put him in a garden and blessed him and entrusted all things into his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was the king of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God commanded him to be fruitful and to replenish the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God said that it was exceedingly good.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Adam's background, there was no inheritance of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The nature of sin was not in him, nor the mark of sin upon him, nor the condition of sin around him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Adam was an ideal man living in an ideal environment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Adam and his companion fellowshipped with their God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everything should have caused him to be satisfied and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>II."And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep" Gen 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The once perfect world fell, terrible calamities came, and the whole earth was distorted.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once sin came in, death followed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once death came in, so too came all manner of death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Creator's masterpiece was destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The potter's vessel was damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What was formerly most beautiful had become most ugly.</S>

   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What was once called perfect became desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Voices of singing could no longer be heard; the light was also diminished.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The whole earth perished under God's water of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There was no more firmament.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the deep covered the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There was nothing on earth apart from gloomy color, brackish odor, and roaring sound.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God's original creation was damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is a vivid picture of how man departed from God.</S>

   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What darkness!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Waves of lust toss and tumble.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Our once beautiful nature was buried under the depth of sin!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>"But the wicked are like the tossed sea, / For it cannot be calm, / And its waters toss up mire and mud" Isa 57:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Man became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Formerly he received blessing, but now, the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Death and sorrow came to the place where there was once life and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Man fell deeply into sin and could not rescue himself.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He was hidden in darkness and could not see himself.</S>

   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the true picture of every sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>How pitiful that many do not realize their own condition!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the cause of all the calamity and sorrow in the world.</S>

   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>7:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>However, man lost his condition.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>"As through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin, death; and thus death passed on to all men" Rom 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>"As through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners" v. 19 . Now before God, man's condition is "without form...void...and darkness," "alienated from the life of God" Eph 4:18 , "dead in your offenses and sins" Eph 2:1 , and "incurable" Jer 17:9 . "All have sinned" Rom 3:23 , and "there is none who does good" Rom 3:12 . "There is none righteous, not even one" Rom 3:10 . How pitiful! Yet men still boast of their knowledge, wisdom, education, and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If men would realize that they are "without form," "void," and "darkness," they would be blessed.</S>
