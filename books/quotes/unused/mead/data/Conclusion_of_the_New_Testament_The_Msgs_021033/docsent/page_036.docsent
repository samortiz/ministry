   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In resurrection Christ is the Lord Spirit: We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Spirit may be considered a compound title like the Father God and the Lord Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This expression strongly proves that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and that the Spirit is the Lord Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The previous verse says that the Lord is the Spirit, and this verse definitely speaks of Christ as the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is in resurrection that Christ is the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When He was in the flesh, He was not called the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when He entered into resurrection, He became in resurrection the life-giving Spirit, and in resurrection He is called the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The image in 2 Corinthians 3:18 is the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The same image means we are being conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, being made the same as He is Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ s being the Lord Spirit is for our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are being transformed into Christ s glorious image, and this transformation is a matter of dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Transformation is not merely an outward change.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>An outward change does not require the addition of the divine life element.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if we are to be transformed into the image of Christ, the divine life element must be added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The divine element is added into us by God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is dispensing His element into us so that we may have transformation and not merely an outward change.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Transformation is a metabolic change, and for this we need God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must have the dispensing of the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Day by day we need to have contact with the Dispenser, the One who dispenses Himself directly into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we have contact with Him and stay in the organic union with Him, we shall enjoy His dispensing of Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is all by Christ as the Lord Spirit that we may be transformed into His image from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ in the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In resurrection Christ is in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Three verses that say definitely that Christ is in us are Romans 8:10; Colossians 1:27; and 2 Corinthians 13:5.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 8:10 says, If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The preposition in here is most remarkable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ, the wonderful One, is actually in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order for Christ to be in us, He must be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the context, Christ dwells in us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Concerning Christ in resurrection being in the believers, Colossians 1:27 says, To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the book of Colossians, the Christ who is in us is the portion of the saints 1:12 , the image of the invisible God 1:15 , the Firstborn of all creation 1:15 , the Firstborn from among the dead 1:18 , the One in whom all God s fullness dwells 2:9 , the mystery of God s economy 1:25-27 , the mystery of God 2:2 , the reality of all positive things 2:17 , and the constituent of the new man 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What a Christ we have within us!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indwelling Christ is the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the Spirit, Christ now is in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 to be one spirit with us 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the life-giving Spirit mingled with our spirit, He is our life and our person Col 3:4; Eph 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 2 Corinthians 13:5 Paul says, Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves; or do you not recognize yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To test is to determine our condition; to prove is to qualify our status.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul tells the Corinthians to test themselves whether they are in the objective faith Acts 6:7; 1 Tim 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If anyone is in the objective faith, he surely has the subjective faith and believes in Christ and the entire content of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul specifically asked the Corinthians whether they recognized that Jesus Christ was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As long as a believer realizes that Jesus Christ is in him, he is qualified, approved, as a genuine member of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second Corinthians 13:5 is another verse revealing the fact that in resurrection Christ lives in the believers.</S>
