   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Ninety THE WOMAN SEEKING THE LOST COIN Scripture: Luke 15:8-10 Men are God s property Men are created by God; therefore, naturally, men belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God considers men as His property, as His treasure, just like the woman who considers the ten pieces of silver as treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Men are lost Men are born lost.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be lost is to be separated from the original owner.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you do not know to whom you belong, that is a proof in itself that you are lost.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you are lost, you fall into the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here the dust represents sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To fall into the dust is to fall into sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So the result of being lost is to fall into the filth of sins, and to live in a heap of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God comes to seek men The first parable in Luke 15 speaks about God as the shepherd coming to seek the lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This second parable speaks about God as the woman seeking the lost money.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The shepherd seeks the lost sheep out in the field, whereas the woman seeks the money inside the house.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first parable is objective; the second is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The woman seeking the lost money typifies the Holy Spirit coming into our heart to seek us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just as the shepherd typifies Christ, so the woman typifies the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the first parable the objective seeking is the coming of Christ to this earth nearly 2,000 years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the second parable the Holy Spirit comes into our heart, which is the subjective seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The steps the Holy Spirit takes to seek men: The first step is to light the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because there is darkness, there is the need to light the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The lamp typifies the enlightening of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is related to the fact that within man is darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Holy Spirit comes to enlighten us through the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Friends, the gospel which you are listening to today is the enlightening of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The second step is to sweep the house.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The house represents man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sweeping represents the moving of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The heart which has not been swept is not only dark and dirty, but also quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the Holy Spirit lights the lamp and sweeps the heart, the heart is tossed about and becomes restless.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The third step is to seek diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The diligent seeking of the Spirit causes you to have a thorough consideration and a keen feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the Holy Spirit enlightens and moves within you, you will begin to consider the past and the future.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fourth step is the finding.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Holy Spirit will seek until you are brought back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How to receive God s seeking Confess that you are a lost one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Repent and turn to God.</S>
