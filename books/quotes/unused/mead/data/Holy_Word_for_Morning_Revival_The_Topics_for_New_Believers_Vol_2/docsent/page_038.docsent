   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 13 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Dan 4:26 ...The heavens do rule.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matt 5:20 ...Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we come to the second aspect of the kingdom the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Kingdom of the Heavens The Ruling of the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Daniel 4:26 says, The heavens do rule.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This actually refers to the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The kingdom of the heavens is the heavenly rule, heaven ruling over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the New Testament a form of the word heaven is used many times.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For instance, Hebrews 3:1 tells us that we are partakers of a heavenly calling.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>... Furthermore, according to Ephesians 2:6, the believers have been seated together...in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>232 In the book of Ephesians, Christ as our life has saved us into a position in which we are above all God s enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here in the heavenly atmosphere, with a heavenly nature and a heavenly characteristic, we are a heavenly people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>233</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before we were saved, our situation was like that of the prodigal son in Luke 15 rebellion against the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the prodigal son returned to his father, he repented and said, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you v. 21 . Against heaven equals before you God the Father . Sinning against heaven is sinning before God, because God the Father is in heaven 11:2 . After we received the call from the heavens, we became another kind of people, people no longer of this earth but of the heavens.... This means that today we are under a rule that is with the heavenly nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we shall see, this rule is in our spirit, for this rule is nothing other than the living One, Christ consummated as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This One, the life-giving Spirit, indwelling us is the heavenly rule within us, and this heavenly rule is actually the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>234</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Crucial Part of the Kingdom of God</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The kingdom of the heavens is the heavenly ruling from the beginning of the church on the day of Pentecost to the end of the millennium, the crucial part of the kingdom of God....The kingdom of the heavens is a part of the kingdom of God just as Texas and Louisiana are part of the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Texas and Louisiana are the United States, but it is not correct to say that the United States is Texas and Louisiana.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In like manner, we can say that the kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God, but we cannot say that the kingdom of God is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God because it is part of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Remember, the kingdom of God refers to God s reign in a general way, from eternity past to eternity future, but the kingdom of the heavens 235 in scope is narrower than that of the kingdom of God, since it includes only the church in this age the dispensation of grace and the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a section within the kingdom of God; hence, it is also called the kingdom of God Mark 1:15, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Matt 4:17; Mark 4:11, cf.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Matt 13:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>236</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Entering into the Kingdom of the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you have been born again, you have entered into the kingdom of God....But to enter into the kingdom of the heavens is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Matthew 5:20 says, For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To enter into the kingdom of God requires regeneration as a new beginning of our life, but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens demands surpassing righteousness in our living after regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How strict this is!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>7:21; 18:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>237 To enter into the kingdom of the heavens is to live in its reality today and to participate in its manifestation in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>238</S>
