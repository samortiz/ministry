   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LOCAL CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we must proceed from the Acts through the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here we see not only God, Christ, and the church; we also have the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Matthew 16 the Lord says, "I will build My church."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This church is the unique, universal church typified by Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But just as Zion has many peaks, so the universal church has many local expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Matthew 18, where the Lord speaks of taking a matter to the church, we see one of these local expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may also liken the universal church to a tree and the local churches to the branches of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Matthew 18 we see one of the branches of this universal tree.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here is a local church to which we can go with our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, such a church can also deal with certain ones and even cause them to be regarded as heathen or publicans.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the book of Acts we read of the church in Jerusalem 8:1 and of another church in Antioch 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Acts 14:23, the apostles ordained elders in every church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The churches referred to here are those established in the provinces of Asia Minor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Corinthians 1:2 speaks of "the church of God which is at Corinth."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, in Galatians 1:2 Paul refers to "the churches of Galatia," a region of the Roman Empire that included many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just as there are many local churches in the state of California today, so there were a number of churches in the region of Galatia at the time of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the book of Revelation the divine revelation in the Bible reaches its consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The universal church as the Body of Christ is expressed through the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The local churches, as the expressions of the one Body of Christ Rev 1:12, 20 , are locally one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Revelation 1:4 says, "John to the seven churches which are in Asia."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Asia was a province of the ancient Roman Empire in which were the seven cities mentioned in 1:11.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The seven churches were in those seven cities respectively, not all in one city.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Revelation does not deal with the universal church, but with the local churches in various cities.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have seen that the church is firstly revealed as universal in Matthew 16:18 and then as local in Matthew 18:17.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Acts the church was practiced in the way of local churches, such as the church at Jerusalem 8:1 and the church at Antioch 13:1 and the churches in the provinces of Syria and Cilicia 15:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without the local churches, there is no practicality and actuality of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The universal church is realized in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Knowing the church universally must be consummated in knowing the church locally.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a great advance for us to know and practice the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Concerning the church, the book of Revelation is in the advanced stage, for it is written to local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we would know this book, we must advance from the understanding of the universal church to the realization and practice of the local churches.</S>
