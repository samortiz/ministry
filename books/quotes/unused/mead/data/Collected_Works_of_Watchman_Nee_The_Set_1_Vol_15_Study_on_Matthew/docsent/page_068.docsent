   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 18:"Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The meaning of this verse is similar to that of Matthew 16:19, which is a kind of indirect forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God would bind or loose through the church or through Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"You" here is plural; it refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a person requests that he be allowed to break bread or be baptized, the church has the authority to arbitrate in the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, one should not harden his heart, because the One in heaven will also bind and loose accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The binding and the loosing must be under the control and authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>See John 20:22-23.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One will surely fail if he relies on himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 19:"Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who has this authority?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Does the Roman Catholic Church or the pope have this authority?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No, they do not.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word "again" connects this verse with the preceding portion and adds new meaning to it: the binding and the loosing not only involve brothers but also involve prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"On earth" corresponds to "in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Two persons constitute the least among the plurals, but they are enough.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 19 refers especially to the corporate prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are two kinds of corporate prayers: 1 those that loose God's power, gifts, and the door of preaching, and that loose from sufferings, the burdens of sin, etc.; and 2 those that bind Satan, evil men, unforeseen disasters, etc. The word "harmony" is from a word whose Anglicized form is symphony.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is most difficult to pray in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, in praying for healing, one may pray for God to heal the sick one the "for" stand , whereas another may pray that God's will be done the "neutral" stand ; at the same time, a third one may pray that God would chasten the sick one through the illness the "against" stand .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way, there is no harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Harmony means that everyone has the same view and the same mind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 20:"For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word "for" is very precious because it indicates that the following passage is an example.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It explains why they receive an answer to their prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Gathered into My name."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This does not necessarily mean a prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No one can have a meeting by himself; all are called to meet in Christ's name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are like iron, and the Lord is like a magnet.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The magnet attracts iron but does not attract brass.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord's life in the Body urges us to meet together and to come under the name of the Lord; this is not to come under the name of any denominational church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no such thing in the Bible as "joining a religion."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord does not want us to belong to any other name.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When a woman marries, she accepts her husband's name and can no longer have another name.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christians today have so many other names besides the name of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A man would not allow his wife to take any other name; similarly, the Lord would not allow Christians to take any other name.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If one does not belong under the name of the Lord, he is rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If one belongs under the name of the Lord and then takes on another name, he or she has committed adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christians are a bride, and as such, they must be chaste.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord praises the church in Philadelphia because she has not denied the Lord's name, but has kept the Lord's word of endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church in these three verses verses 18-20 is the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is but the embryonic form of the whole church in Ephesians 5:23.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church in Matthew 16 is the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some people tolerate the reviling of Christianity or Christians but will not tolerate the reviling of their denominational churches or the members of their churches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To them it is acceptable to put Christ to shame, but it is not acceptable to put their denominations to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 21:"Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Up to seven times?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The preceding portion speaks of the relationship between committing sins and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This portion speaks of the relationship between committing sins and the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The preceding portion mentions the matter of forgiveness; therefore, Peter asked this question here.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps this question is based on Luke 17:3-4.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Peter assumed that seven times was the most generous.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At that time there were two famous rabbis who had set down a rule that it was enough to forgive three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"Seven times" is more than double three times already.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 22:"Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The phrase "I do not say to you" shows clearly the Lord's authority and power.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"Seventy times seven" refers to infiniteness; however, if one can forgives seventy times seven, it is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Seven perfection times seven perfection times ten man's perfection equals four hundred ninety perfect perfection .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 23:"For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who desired to settle accounts with his slaves."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"The kingdom of the heavens has become like a king."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This refers to the Lord, who is God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"His slaves" refers to the saved believers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some have said that it refers to the unsaved sinners, but that is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is because: 1 They are called slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>2 They deal with God directly and do not come through the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>3 The slave here refers to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Peter asked, "How often shall...I one already saved forgive him a saved brother ?"</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>4 Verse 35 reads "So also will My heavenly Father do to you saved ones ."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>"Settle accounts with his slaves" v. 23 indicates that God never forgets and is never confused about the believers' shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, the believers should realize that if they have come short of God at ordinary times, sooner or later God will reckon their account with them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The time of reckoning is in the present life; God will give them a serious illness or allow them to encounter dangers or inflict serious chastening upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some have said that this reckoning will happen in the coming age, before Christ's judgment seat 1 Cor 3:10-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is impossible, because: 1 the one who owes ten thousand talents can never be raptured; 2 at that time there will be no grace, only righteousness; therefore, the lord of the slaves will not be moved with compassion; 3 in the kingdom of the heavens one cannot take his brother by the throat and cast him into prison; and 4 verses 23-31 concern the present age, while verse 32-34 indicate the time before the judgment seat in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, the teaching in verse 35 is that if one does not forgive his brother in the present life, he will be dealt with in the same way by the One in heaven in the life to come.</S>
