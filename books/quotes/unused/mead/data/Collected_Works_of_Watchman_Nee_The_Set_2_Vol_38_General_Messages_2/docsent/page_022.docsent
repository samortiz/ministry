   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE NUMBERING OUR DAYS Scripture Reading: Psa 90:12; Eph 5:16-17; Joel 2:25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Editor's Note: The following article was printed in the Chinese edition of Twelve Baskets Full, Volume 5, chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is similar in content to the article "The Numbering of Spiritual Days" published in Issue No. 47 of Notes on Scriptural Messages and reprinted in The Collected Works, Volume 19.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, there are variations in the arrangement of the material in these two articles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since we do not have the assurance that this message is based on the same spoken message, we have included it in this volume.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Psalms, Moses prayed to God, "Teach us then to number our days/That we may gain a heart of wisdom."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If our days are numbered according to the calendar, then a day is a day and a year is a year; this is easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But if we take God's view, then some years and days will be numbered, while others will not be numbered.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our days on earth are limited.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How should we please God within such a limited number of years and days?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How can each day and each year of our life be counted?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the subject of our study.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>ONE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are two genealogies in Genesis 4 and 5.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapter four is the genealogy of Cain, while chapter five is the genealogy of Seth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The way that the two genealogies are recorded is different.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Cain's genealogy is very simple; it does not record the age of Cain and his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Seth's genealogy is much more detailed; it tells us how old each person was when he begot offspring and how many years he lived.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It records the ages of generation after generation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Based on the fact that one genealogy is simple and the other is detailed, we can trace God's principle in numbering our days.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Cain's genealogy was simple because he offended God and was far away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He did not have any fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Seth's genealogy was detailed because Seth replaced Abel and was acceptable to God; he fellowshipped with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, our spiritual days are reckoned according to our condition before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we were far from God and dead in sin, our days were not reckoned in the sight of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But when we repented, turned to God, and began to fellowship with Him, our spiritual days began.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Israelites left Egypt, God commanded them, saying, "This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you" Exo 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first month is the beginning of the year; it is the starting point of reckoning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this month the Israelites killed the Passover lamb, left Egypt, and freed themselves from the bondage of Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, God charged them to call this month the first month.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From this month forward, the Israelites had a new beginning before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brothers and sisters, how much spiritual history do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some of you are quite old; you may be fifty or sixty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But spiritually, you are still only one year or even one month old.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Your spiritual age began the day you were regenerated and saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The day you received the Lord's salvation was the day your spiritual history began.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before that day, no spiritual years were counted before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, even after you believed in the Lord, one year does not necessarily mean one year.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You may have been a Christian for five years, but in the eyes of God, you may not be five years old as a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, even after you become a Christian, some days and years are not counted in God's sight.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can see from the Bible that some years were skipped over because God considered them to be wasted, and they could not be counted.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He also records some years in the Bible to serve as our warning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We will consider the following passages and draw some lessons from them.</S>
