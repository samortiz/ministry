   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT BOASTING WITHOUT MEASURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 13 says, But we will not boast without measure, but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach even as far as you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The apostle is bold, but he is not bold without limit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This shows that he is under the restriction of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His boasting is according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure, the ruling God, has apportioned to him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul s ministry to the Gentile world, including Corinth, was according to the measure of God Eph 3:1-2, 8; Gal 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, his boast is also within this limit, not without measure, as that of the Judaistic teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word rule in verse 13 literally means a measuring rod, as a rule used by a carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should never boast without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In giving a testimony of what we have learned of the Lord, we should have a limit, a measure.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word measure in verse 13 indicates being ruled by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has allotted us just so much for our work and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, He has given us just so much to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, when we give a testimony about our work, experience, or enjoyment of the Lord, we must testify within measure, that is, within a certain limit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In giving a testimony or a report we should never exaggerate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the reports in certain Christian publications are exaggerations; those reports go beyond measure, beyond limit, without restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, in testifying of our experience, we must stay within the measure God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not boast without measure, beyond measure, but according to the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is One who is ruling and measuring.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This One is the God of measure, the God who rules.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we must stay within the limits of God s ruling, of God s measuring.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul s words reach even as far as you indicate that his coming to the Corinthians was under God s ruling and measuring.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 14 continues, For we do not, as not reaching to you, overstretch ourselves, for we were the first to come even as far as unto you in the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In contrast to the Judaistic teachers, Paul and the other apostles did not overstretch themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They were the first to go to Europe, and hence to the Corinthians, with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the Judaizers had gone there first, probably the apostles would not have gone, and that would have been the sign that Europe had not been measured to them under God s ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is related to Paul s point in arguing with the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verses 15 and 16 Paul says, Not boasting without measure in others labors, but having hope, your faith growing, to be magnified among you according to our rule unto abundance, to preach the gospel unto the parts beyond you, not to boast in another s rule in things made ready.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we see that the apostles have hope that through the growth of the faith of the Corinthian believers, their ministry will be magnified in the sense of praise , by being enlarged and increased abundantly, yet still according to the rule, the measure, that God has apportioned to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul hoped to be magnified among the Corinthians according to the limit of God s measuring.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>GOD S RESTRICTION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From verses 13, 14, and 15 we see that although we expect the Lord s work to spread, we must learn how to be under God s restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not expect a spread that is without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That kind of spread would certainly not be within the limit of a walk according to Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From experience we can testify that if we spread the work according to the Spirit, there will always be a certain limit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Inwardly we shall have the consciousness that the Lord intends to spread the work only to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, outwardly, in the environment, the Lord may cause matters to restrict the spread of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, inwardly we do not have the peace to spread the work beyond a certain point, and outwardly the environment does not allow us to go beyond a particular boundary line.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The young people are not yet very much into the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nevertheless, I would encourage them to keep this word within them, for one day they will experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all need to learn that in serving the Lord and in working with God, there is always a limit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is also true in the service of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord is especially interested in restricting the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the young ones do not have a heart to serve the Lord, He will stir them up to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But once they have been stirred up, He will limit them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Human nature does not like this kind of limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, both in our sleeping and in our activity we may not like limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When, spiritually speaking, we are asleep, God will stir us up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But when we become too active, He will restrict us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I know some young people who have been offended because God has done this to them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A young brother may want to be a leader among the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If he becomes a leader, he may then want to be a deacon or an elder in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In these matters he may expect to make swift progress.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s way, however, is first to speed us up and then to slow us down, first to raise us up and then to lower us down.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we are down, He will lift us up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But when we get too far up, He will lower us down.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, God s way of dealing with us is up and down, down and up.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we can take God s ups and downs, we shall eventually become useful in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many young people cannot tolerate God s ups and downs.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After a few of these ups and downs, they want to quit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Their attitude may be, If God wants me up, then let me go up to the heavens and stay there until the Lord Jesus comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But if God wants me down, let me stay down.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But I don t like going up and down, down and up.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This unhappiness with God s ups and downs is an expression of the disposition of many young people.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God does not want us to be always up or to be always down.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even in nature the alternating of day and night testifies of this.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is no such thing as an unending day or night.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Rather, there is the alternating of day and night, night and day.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God did not create us so that we would have a day or night that would last for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This may be according to our way, but it is not according to God s way.</S>
