   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have seen in volume 4 of Level 3 that in the progressing stage of God s full salvation, the stage of transformation, the believers experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity corporately by entering into the kingdom of God, by living in the church, and by living in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The believers experience this dispensing also by putting on the new man and by wrestling against the devil and his spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this volume we will consider the believers experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in other aspects and the issue of the experience and enjoyment of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This lesson covers the believers experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God in serving and worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to experience the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in other aspects, including serving and worshipping God, working and laboring for the Lord, not loving the world, overcoming Satan, fighting the good fight, running the course of the race, being profited by all things in our circumstances and environment, having the best attitude toward others, having the highest standard of morality and virtues, and watching and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Very few Christians realize that for all these matters we need the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, we need to see that in order to carry out these matters, we need God s divine supply, which is given to us through His divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For all the requirements revealed in the New Testament that are related to the believers, we need to receive the divine supply through the divine dispensing of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without this dispensing we cannot receive the supply, and without this supply we cannot fulfill the requirements in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some may think that it is easy and natural to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, we cannot truly worship God, that is, render the worship that satisfies God, that is accepted by Him as a real pleasure to Him, without God being dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through this divine dispensing we can worship God in a way that satisfies Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In like manner, apart from the divine dispensing of the processed Triune God, we cannot be humble or meek.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The meekness required in the New Testament is much higher than that required by human teachings concerning morality, ethics, and human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In society there are many teachings concerning such matters as humility, meekness, gentleness, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But it is impossible to meet the requirements of humility, meekness, gentleness, and love as revealed in the New Testament by our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need another being the being of the processed Triune God dispensed into our being and even constituted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, it is altogether necessary for us to contact the processed Triune God so that we may receive His supply through His dispensing of Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I. SERVING AND WORSHIPPING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the New Testament serving God is actually the same as worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot serve God without worshipping Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Neither can we worship Him without serving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to Matthew 4, to worship actually means to serve vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, to worship God is to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Thessalonians 1:9 says that we serve a living and true God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this verse serve means to serve as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, our service to God includes everything that we do in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, the fact that we are serving a living God proves that we are in God the Father v. 1 . If we were not in the Father, we would not be able to serve a living God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To serve the living God is to say that God is living to us and in us; He is living in our speech, in our behavior, and in every aspect of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our present living is a testimony that the God whom we serve is living.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is living in us, and He controls us, directs us, and deals with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In certain matters, even in such small things as our thoughts and motives, He will not let us go; rather, He corrects and adjusts us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a proof that He is living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is also a proof that we are worshipping and serving the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We, as proper believers in Christ, must live a life that bears the testimony that the God whom we worship and serve is living in the details of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our reason for not doing or saying certain things should be that God is living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The God whom we worship and serve is living not only in the heavens but also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No doubt, when God is living to us in our experience, He is also true.</S>
