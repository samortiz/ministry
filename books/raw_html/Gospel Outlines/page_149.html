<h1 class="title">FOR WHOM DID CHRIST DIE?</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rom. 5:6-8</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Christ did not die for the righteous man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The righteous man is one who is just and faultless toward God and man; he is one who has completely fulfilled his duty.</li>
	<li>There are very few people, if any, who would die for this kind of man.</li>
	<li>But Christ did not die for the righteous, because actually there are not any righteous men in the entire universe.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ did not die for the good man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The good man is a moral person, even surpassing the righteous man. What the good man does goes beyond his human duty; he is not only just and faultless, but kind as well.</li>
	<li>There might be a few who would be willing to die for the good man.</li>
	<li>But neither did Christ die for the good man, because strictly speaking, there are not any good men on the earth.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ died for the sinner
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>A sinner is not a good man or a righteous person.</li>
	<li>Christ died for such sinners who are neither good nor righteous persons.</li>
	<li>Whoever considers himself a good and righteous man is not one who is saved by Jesus&rsquo; death; thus he cannot obtain the salvation of the Lord Jesus.</li>
	<li>Jesus died for the sinners, thus manifesting God&rsquo;s love.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to participate in the death of Jesus<br />
