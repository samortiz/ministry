<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING THE PURE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST</h2><p>We need to stress that since Christ is the life, content, and everything to the church, the church must be purely the expression of Christ, not of anything else. The church should not be the expression of any teaching or gift but just the expression of Christ. This is why there is not much teaching in the book of Ephesians. If we were asked to write something about the church, we might write a long book with many chapters of doctrine. But Ephesians is a book on the church of only six chapters. This is because the church is the expression of Christâ€”not of Christ in doctrine, but of Christ Himself. This is why the miraculous gifts are not mentioned in the book of Ephesians. Instead, what is seen are the living person of Christ and His living Body with His living members. Even the gift of teaching is not mentioned in the book of Ephesians. We have the Teacher, not the teaching. We have to realize that the Teacher is different from the teaching.<p>In the Body of Christ, His living members express Christ and nothing else. The Body is the fullness of Christ as the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23). Christ must be the very fullness within us, settling down within us to make His home in us as our everything by occupying, saturating, and permeating our whole being. Thus, the church becomes a pure expression of Christ and nothing else. We have to see this vision clearly.<p>Many so-called churches today give people the impression of healing, teaching, or speaking in tongues. These gifts become a replacement of the Body of Christ. When you come among some Christians, you may have the impression that they are very dogmatic. They are always determining the difference between wrong doctrine and right doctrine, giving others the impression that they are for a certain kind of teaching. This is all wrong. We must give people the impression that we are for nothing but Christ. When people come to our meetings, they must have the impression that we are standing for Christ Himself, not only in terminology but in reality. This should be our atmosphere and the impression which we give others. We need to reconsider the book of Ephesians. This book does not give us the impression of doctrines or gifts but only of Christ.<p>We have to make it clear that Christ is the life of the church, the content of the church, and everything to the church. Thus, the church must be the unique and pure expression of Christ and nothing else. Then we need to know how we can have Christ as our life and content. We need to see the detailed items in the New Testament of Christ being our content. The book of Acts shows us that Christ was the content of the early church, and the church was the expression of Christ. The Old Testament types also show us Christ as the content and the church as His expression. He is the reality of all the offerings and of the rich produce of the good land for our enjoyment. He is also the real ark as the very content of the tabernacle. The tabernacle is the expression and the ark is the content. In the abnormal situation, the ark as the reality and content was not within the tabernacle. Whenever we minister the word, we have to stress Christ as the content of the church and the church as the expression of Christ. We have much to experience and much to learn in ministering along this line. We have to learn how to minister Christ as the content of the church and the church as the expression of Christ.
