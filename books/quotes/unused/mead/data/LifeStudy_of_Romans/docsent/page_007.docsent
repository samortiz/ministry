   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Glorification the Purpose of Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The next section in the book of Romans is glorification Rom 8:14-39 , unveiling the purpose of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Following sanctification, there is the need of glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our body needs to be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although a brother may be quite saintly, his body needs to be glorified because of its physical defects and limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Lord Jesus comes, we will be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Presently, I must wear thick, peculiar eyeglasses, but when the Lord comes I will be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We shall not only be justified and sanctified; we shall be glorified, that is, our body shall be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Glorification is the full redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This glorification reveals the purpose of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The purpose of God s salvation is to produce many brothers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Originally, Christ was the only begotten Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now the only begotten Son has become the firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We ourselves will be processed into the many brothers of Christ and the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the next message we will see that Christ is the prototype and that we are His duplication, the mass production.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The little Jesus has been processed and designated as the Son of God, and we also are in the same process to be designated as the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the firstborn Son, and we, the many sons, are His many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the purpose of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>F. Selection the Economy of Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After glorification, we come to selection which reveals the economy of salvation Rom 9:1 11:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has a purpose and an economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His economy is for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is very wise and He arranges everything for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He knows what He is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He knows who are His chosen people and He knows when His chosen people should be called.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In relation to God, selection is for the accomplishment of His purpose; in relation to us, selection is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>G. Transformation the Life-practice in Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After this, we have the section on transformation, unfolding the life-practice in salvation Rom 12:1 15:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this section we see the life-practice of all that has been produced by the life-process.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever is produced in the section on sanctification is practiced in the section on transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, sanctification becomes transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In one sense, we are in sanctification; in another sense, we are also in transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are in the process of life and in the practice of life that we may have the Body life with a proper private life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every aspect of the proper Christian life and church life is included in this section on transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>While we are being sanctified, we are also being transformed from one form into another form and from one shape into another shape.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are all under the life-process of sanctification for the life-practice of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>H. Conclusion</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>the Ultimate Consummation of Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The last section of the book of Romans is the conclusion, indicating the ultimate consummation of salvation Rom 15:14 16:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The ultimate consummation of God s salvation is the churches not just the Body, but the local churches as the expressions of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The book of Romans begins with the Gospel of God and concludes with the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Romans, we do not have the local church in doctrine but the local churches in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As we will see in later messages, many churches are mentioned in Romans chapter 16.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE MAJOR STRUCTURES OF ROMANS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The major structures of the book of Romans are three salvation, life, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A. Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first major structure of Romans is salvation, revealed in 1:1 5:11 and 9:1 11:36.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Salvation includes propitiation, redemption, justification, reconciliation, selection, and predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In eternity past God predestinated us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then He called us, redeemed us, justified us, and reconciled us to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, we have full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to differentiate between redemption and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Redemption is what Christ accomplished in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Salvation is what God has wrought upon us based upon the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Redemption is objective, and salvation is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When redemption becomes our experience, it becomes salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>B. Life</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Salvation is for the life unfolded in 5:12 8:39.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this section the word life is used at least seven times and, according to chapter 8, this life is four-fold, which we will see as we come to that chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>C. Building</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the last part of Romans, 12:1 16:27, we have the building, the Body with all of its expressions in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Salvation is for life, and life is for building.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus, the three major structures of Romans are salvation, life, and building.</S>
