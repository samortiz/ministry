<h2 class=head1>R. THE SEVEN EYES OF THE LAMB</h2><p>In Revelation 5:6 we have yet another symbol of the Spirit—the seven eyes of the Lamb: “I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.” The seven lamps are simultaneously the seven eyes of the Lamb. The lamps are for enlightening and burning; the eyes are both for watching and observing and also for infusing and transfusing. As the redeeming Lamb, Christ has seven watching and observing eyes for the carrying out of God’s administration. These seven eyes are also transfusing all that the Lamb is into our being so that we may become the same as He. The way for us to be transformed is to come to Him and be seen by Him. As the Lord enlightens and judges us, He looks at us, and His seven eyes transfuse Himself into us.<p>It is significant that in Revelation 5:6 the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of Christ, the Lamb. A person’s eyes cannot be separated from the person himself, for a person’s eyes are his expression. Our inner being is expressed mainly through our eyes. In like manner, the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of Christ by which Christ expresses Himself. As a person and his eyes are one, so Christ and the Spirit are one. Therefore, it is a mistake to say that the Spirit is separate from Christ. Since the seven Spirits are the Holy Spirit and are also the eyes of Christ, then the Holy Spirit, who is the seven Spirits, is not separate from Christ. The Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the expression of the Son. The seven eyes of Christ, which are the seven Spirits of God, are Christ’s expression in God’s move for God’s building. Today Christ’s eyes are upon us so that we can be transformed and conformed to His image for God’s building.<h2 class=head1>S. THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE</h2><p>The last symbol of the Spirit in the New Testament is the river of water of life: “He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street” (Rev. 22:1). This river of water of life is a symbol of God in Christ as the Spirit flowing Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply. It is typified by the water that came out of the riven rock (Exo. 17:6; Num. 20:11) and symbolized by the water that flowed out of the pierced side of the Lord Jesus (John 19:34). In Revelation 22:1 the water of life becomes a river proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb to supply and saturate the entire New Jerusalem. Therefore, as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, the Spirit as the river of water of life is the flow of the processed Triune God with Himself as the water of life to satisfy His chosen people that He may have an eternal manifestation to express Himself for eternity.
