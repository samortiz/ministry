<h2 class="head2">Loving the Brothers</h2><p>God is light. When we dwell in the light, we have no problem with God whatsoever. But 1 John 3:14 says that we know we have passed from death to life because we love the brothers. It is a difficult thing for men with different backgrounds, social statuses, races, and philosophies to come together. But Christians can do this, because we are not only "comrades" with common interests or men given to a common cause; we are those who love the brothers and sisters and who can love one another from our heart. Many people can help their comrades, but they cannot love them. But a saved person who has God's life and God's love within can love others.</p><p>Being saved means to receive the life of God. This is something inward. All those who are begotten of God surely love God, and they surely love one another. As soon as you know that a certain person is a brother, you will love him. When you travel in a train or ship, there may be unbelievers all around you. But as soon as you see someone reading a Bible, you will love him no matter what denomination or sect he belongs to. Your heart will jump for joy. This love for the brothers is in the divine life which we received at the time of regeneration. This love is the expression as well as the proof of our salvation and regeneration.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Continuing in Sin</h2><p>A saved person will not continue in sin. If you do not continue in sin, it proves that you are a saved person. This is something that can be tested. First John 2:29 says, "Everyone who practices righteousness also has been begotten of Him." This refers to our deliverance from sin. Those who are begotten of God practice righteousness. The life within demands that they practice righteousness. This is the characteristic of the life of God. Under ordinary circumstances a piece of wood will not sink in water. However, under special circumstances it will sink. If you put a ton of stones on the wood, it will sink. If the wood could speak, it would voice its objection every second. It would say that it should be afloat, but that the stones have weighed it down. But even if the wood is submerged under water, it will not become "submerged wood." When the circumstances change and the pressure is gone, the wood will come back up again. It may sink temporarily, but wood itself does not sink. This cannot be said of rocks, which automatically sink. Even if a saved brother or sister has sinned, I can still say that he is one who does not sin, because the life within him does not sin. If he sins, a power or nature within him will make him feel sorry about it. This is something that an unbeliever can never experience.</p><p>A sister once testified that prior to being a Christian, she did not blush when she lied. She was a "professional" liar. But she changed after becoming a Christian. When she lied, her heart would beat fast and her face would turn red. Inwardly she would condemn the lies as sins. There is something within her that forbids her to lie. An unbeliever must exercise a conscious effort to not lie. But for a Christian to not lie is something innate; it is the inward power that makes him not to lie. Lying matches the inward nature of those in the world, but it is something that goes against the Christian nature. This nature has to do with the life that begat you. It is difficult for you to quit gambling and smoking merely on the ground that you are a Christian. But these are very natural things when you have the power of God's life within you. A Christian does not grit his teeth to refrain from sinning. There is a power within him which keeps him from sinning. There is a sinless nature within him. If you sin, this nature objects and makes you feel uneasy. This is Christ's salvation. It is not a matter of resisting sin by your own strength. You have received a life that does not sin. Being delivered from sin is the third manifestation of our salvation and regeneration.</p><h2 class="head2">Having God's Testimony in One's Heart</h2><p>First John 5:10 tells us that God's testimony is within us; we have the life of God. Not only does the Bible say this, even our heart testifies to this fact. This has nothing to do with one's outward behavior; it is an inward thing. We are God's children; not only does the Holy Spirit testify of this within us, even our own spirit testifies of the same. There is a difference in feeling between Brother Chen Ke-san calling his mother-in-law "mother," and his wife calling her "mother." Brother Chen's calling is related to his circumstance; he does so because of his wife. His wife has "the spirit of sonship," but he does not. Today we spontaneously and sweetly call God our Father. We have the Spirit of God's Son within us, and His testimony is in us. Many people call God the Father in a vain way in their prayer; they have merely learned of this term from others. This is the prayer of a nominal Christian. All those who are genuinely saved can cry "Abba Father" from the bottom of their heart.</p><p>First John 5:13 says, "I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God." Many people jump to this verse too quickly. They skip verse 11. Verse 11 speaks of the testimony of God. When a man has the testimony of God in his heart, he will spontaneously know that he has eternal life. Some read John 3:16, which says, "Every one who believes into Him...would have eternal life." As they are reading it, they think they have eternal life. But when they go to bed and consider some more, they doubt whether they have it. It seems as if the life they received is not eternal. We must have the testimony in our heart before we can know that we have eternal life. First, there is the Son of God, and then there is life. Salvation and regeneration are not something outward. They have nothing to do with knowledge. Salvation is to have God's Son and God's life in a real way. It is God's testimony in us that convinces us of our birth in God.</p><p>As soon as we are saved, we can know God and love the brothers and sisters in the Lord. We will not continue in sin, and we have God's testimony in our heart, proving to us that we are of God. These are the manifestations and evidences of our regeneration and salvation.</p>
