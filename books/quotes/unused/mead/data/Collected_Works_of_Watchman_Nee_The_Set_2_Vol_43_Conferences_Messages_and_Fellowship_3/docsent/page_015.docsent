   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S LOVE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is another problem that, if left unresolved, would prevent God from saving man even if He wanted to.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the problem of satisfying His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the righteousness of God was left unresolved, untouched, and unsettled, that is, if God's righteous requirements were not met, He could not save man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans is a most important book.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who have not read this book do not know of these two seemingly insurmountable obstacles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These two obstacles are: 1 God has to satisfy His love for man, and 2 God has to satisfy His own righteous requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is God's righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's righteousness is the principle by which God works.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When God works, He must operate according to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything that God accomplishes is accomplished according to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible shows us that there are three items specially related to God: glory, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's glory is God Himself; God's holiness is God's nature; and God's righteousness is the method, the way, in which God works.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every time we read about God's glory in the Bible, we should realize that it refers to God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every time we read about God's holiness, we should realize that it refers to God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every time we read about God's righteousness, we should realize that it refers to the method or the way in which God works.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is righteous, and the procedure by which He works also has to be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, God's salvation of man must also be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God can save man in many ways, but no matter which way He takes, He has to do it according to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the most difficult problem in God's salvation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If God were not strict, He could resort to any kind of method.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But it is a challenge for God to do things without conflicting with His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A sinner only cares to be saved; he does not care about the method which is used.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But God cannot be unrighteous in saving man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Righteousness is the foundation of God's throne Psa 89:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God cannot do something that is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God wants to save man, but He also wants to maintain His own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, God has a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He must find a way to save man that is righteous, a procedure that is compatible with His righteousness, which also will enable Him to save man?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Two years ago the father of one of our co-workers was imprisoned for violating the law of the country.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He had indeed violated the written regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the sin he committed was forgivable because he was forced by others to do it and did not commit the crime intentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The law he violated carried a very severe punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I felt that, under the circumstance, the offense he committed should be pardoned.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, he was advanced in age and was the father of one of my co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was quite close to several co-workers, and we all treated him as our own father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because of my family connections, I knew some prominent persons in the government, and I promised to try my best to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We went to a prominent one in the Nanking government, and said to him, "Our friend is an upright person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can guarantee that he did not commit the crime.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We only need a statement to be issued in order for him to be released."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But he replied, "I believe what you said.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In my heart I also want to release him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the last ten days, I have solicited the help of some influential people, but I still do not have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is not just a matter of personal influence.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I could release a statement immediately, but I must have the proper basis before I can issue the statement.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I cannot transgress against the state through my act.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I will try to think of a way to release him, but I have to use a method that is legal and proper.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I cannot incriminate myself by releasing him."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do you see this?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God was faced with a similar situation in order to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He wants to save us, but He must find a way that is righteous and that will also save at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's righteousness is manifested in the fact that when He saves man, He does so by not making Himself unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here we see the problem that God has in saving man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the one hand, He must satisfy His love, and on the other hand, He must satisfy His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He cannot sacrifice love for the sake of fulfilling His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He also cannot become unrighteous for the sake of love.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Neither of the two can be sacrificed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Bible says that unrighteousness is a sin 1 John 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God cannot do anything that is not according to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God wants man to know that he is saved through righteousness; it is a salvation that is lawful, proper, and procedurally righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is why God has to be careful in how He deals with the sins of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now we have three facts: Man is a sinner, God is full of love, mercy and grace, and God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Romans 3:25 says, "God set forth Jesus as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Verse 26 continues, "With a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This means that in reckoning those who believe in Jesus to be righteous, God demonstrates to man that He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Through His act of saving man, God wants man to know that He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God cannot violate the law.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He cannot make Himself unlawful just because He wants to save man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Romans 3:21 says that God's righteousness has been manifested apart from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If God's righteousness was manifested according to the law, we would have to die because the law says that all who sin must die.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, if God's righteousness was according to the law, all sinners would have to die, and there would be no gospel to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God's righteousness is apart from the law; therefore, man can be saved, and God is still righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>How does God preserve His righteousness and save us at the same time?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This was accomplished by the cross of Christ and the precious blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Friends, I do not know whether or not it has ever occurred to you that without God's righteousness, there would be no need for Christ to die.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Why was the cross needed?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It was so troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Jesus had to go from Bethlehem to Calvary to be crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Why did God go to such lengths?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He could have declared to the world that everyone was forgiven and could go away free.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This would only involve God's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Would this not be the simplest thing to do and the most efficient way to take?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, if He took such a simple and efficient way, His righteousness would be sacrificed.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is why God cannot be so free.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He needed the Lord Jesus to come as a man and put on a body of flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>One day He was crucified on the cross and shed His precious blood so that all those who believe in Him could have their sins forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is how God fulfilled His righteousness and accomplished His goal of saving man.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In God's righteous salvation, He sent the Lord Jesus to die on the cross and to accomplish the work of redemption on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This satisfied the love that God has toward man and also fulfilled His own righteous requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Hallelujah for God's wonderful love, mercy, grace, and righteousness!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Praise Him!</S>
