<h2 class="head2">C. In Resurrection</h2><p>Exodus 19:11 says, &ldquo;And be ready against the third day: for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai&rdquo; (Heb.). It is significant that this verse does not speak of the second day or the fourth day, but speaks of the third day. In the Scriptures the third day signifies resurrection. To be in resurrection means that the old has passed away and that we are altogether in a new position and situation.</p><p>Before God spoke to the people, the people prepared themselves. If God had come to speak to them on the first day, they would not have been ready. Suppose you had been among the children of Israel during those days of preparation. What would you have done? Certainly you would not have wasted time in idle conversation. Instead, you would have prayed, &ldquo;Lord, show me anything that separates me from You. Lord, I don&rsquo;t want to have anything between You and me.&rdquo; You would have used your time to get ready to meet with God. You would drop one thing after another until you were in resurrection, ready to meet the Lord. Instead of indulging in criticism, gossip, or complaining, you would pray until you were in resurrection, until the old things had passed away and you were altogether in a new position.</p><h2 class="head2">D. To Hear the Speaking of God</h2><p>Having been brought into the presence of God, God&rsquo;s people heard His speaking (v. 9). This is fellowship. To have God&rsquo;s speaking is to be in God&rsquo;s presence.</p><h2 class="head1">III. BROUGHT INTO THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD</h2><p>Whenever we are brought into the presence of God and enter into fellowship with God, we are spontaneously brought into the knowledge of God. Before we come into fellowship with God, we are ignorant of many things. We know neither the world nor God&rsquo;s building. We do not know the altar, the lampstand, the showbread table, or the ark. Everything revealed in chapters twenty-five through forty corresponds to what Paul describes as the full knowledge of God. Many Christians today are ignorant of what the church is. They do not know the ground of the church, the content of the church, or the function of the church. Before the children of Israel were brought into the presence of God, what did they know about the outer court, the holy place, or the Holy of Holies? Did they know anything about the ark made of acacia wood overlaid with gold? Certainly not! They were ignorant concerning these things.</p><p>When we come to chapter twenty, we shall see that the law is a revelation and description of God Himself. The law shows what kind of God He is. Before the children of Israel were brought into the presence of God, they did not have this knowledge of God, even though they had experienced His salvation, had enjoyed His provision, had defeated Amalek, and had been brought into the kingdom.</p><h2 class="head2">A. To Know the Grace of God</h2><p>In the fellowship of God we first come to know the grace of God. In 19:4 the Lord said, &ldquo;Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles&rsquo; wings, and brought you unto myself.&rdquo; This is grace. Isaiah 40:31 says, &ldquo;They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles.&rdquo; Those who trust in the Lord will be carried on eagles&rsquo; wings. Experientially, this is what Paul refers to in 1 Corinthians 15:10: &ldquo;But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.&rdquo; All that we experience of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation and provision is an experience of the wings of the great eagle. Perhaps you have been saved for many years without realizing that God has borne you on eagles&rsquo; wings. You have been carried by the grace of God, and this grace has been doing everything for you. First, Christ is our Passover lamb; then He is an eagle.</p><p>Whenever I recall my years with the Lord, I am filled with gratitude. For more than fifty years, I have been the object of His mercy and grace. Throughout the course of these years, I have been carried by the wings of a great eagle. Many things which have taken place have been not at all according to my expectation. I thank the Lord that so many things did not work out according to my way, but according to His way. He always knows what I need. I never expected to come to this country, but the Lord has brought me here. Have you ever dreamed that you would be where you are today? In the words of a hymn written by Charles Wesley,</p><p class="hbody">&rsquo;Tis mercy all, immense and free;<br />For, O my God, it found out me.</p><p>What a mercy to be carried on the wings of a great eagle! At the mountain of God, the children of Israel could say, &ldquo;Lord, we are not here of ourselves. Your strong wings have brought us out of Egypt and carried us through the wilderness to this place, where we are here with You.&rdquo;</p><p>As we hear the Lord&rsquo;s voice and receive His revelation, we know His grace. The longer we remain in His fellowship, the more we know His grace and realize that we owe everything to it. Year after year, we have been carried on by the grace of God. Every morning I pray, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for another new day to live You. Lord, I ask You to make this day full of Yourself. Please give me this day&rsquo;s portion of grace. Grant me grace today that I may live You and practice being one spirit with You.&rdquo;</p>
