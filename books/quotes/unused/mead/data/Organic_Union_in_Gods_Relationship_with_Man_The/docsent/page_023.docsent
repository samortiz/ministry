   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWING UNTO SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY DRINKING THE MILK OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Peter 2:2 says, "As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For our physical growth, we need to drink milk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Likewise, for our spiritual growth, we need to drink the divine milk from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every morning we need to drink a cup of milk from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you will do this, you will see the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You will be healthy and will be a tree of life growing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This tree will bear fruit, and all the fruit will nourish your wife, your children, your grandchildren, your neighbors, your colleagues in your office, or your classmates in your school.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You will become the tree of life to all the people in your community.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today, America needs this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>America needs Christ to grow in the neighborhoods, in the schools, in the offices, and among the families and the in-laws.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not merely attend the church meetings; we need to grow that we may be a tree of life to nourish today's communities in America.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am very grateful to the Lord that I live in America.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here I have the full liberty to speak what I want to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am grateful for this, but whenever I look at today's situation, I am saddened because of the shortage of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Needless to say with the unbelievers, even with the believers there is the shortage of Christ, the lacking of the growth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peter said that if we drink the milk of the word, we will grow unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not think that we are fully saved and have no need of any further salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a concept is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We still need to be saved every day, even every minute, from our temper, from our sorrows, and from our anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to be saved from many things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am a quick person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is easy for me to lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I was young, my temper was a trouble to me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But later on I learned that I can be saved, and I have been saved through the drinking of the milk of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Drinking the milk of the word causes us to grow unto salvation from our anger, our temper, our anxiety, our worry, our fear, and our trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every day we need a daily salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need today's salvation in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>GROWING UNTO MATURITY BY EATING THE SOLID FOOD</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Among today's Christians it is difficult to find one who is mature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many Christians are still childish.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In their joking with one another we cannot sense God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Also, they are too free in having contact with the opposite sex.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is no wonder that there is fornication even among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A sister should not speak lightly to a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For a female to speak lightly is to sell herself cheaply.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A sister must keep her female dignity 1 Tim 2:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This female dignity protects her from many sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, in order to avoid falling into sin, a sister should not get too near a member of the opposite sex.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our need is to grow unto maturity, to be matured.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even one who is still a teenager in his physical age can be a mature believer in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have seen some young people like this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to grow unto maturity to know God, to know the Bible, to know the church, and to know today's situation and condition in a mature way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not be childish.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to grow unto maturity, we need to eat solid food Heb 5:14; Col 1:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Drinking milk is for babes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every day we need to drink a cup of milk from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We also need to take some solid food from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Bible words such as "God so loved the world" John 3:16 and "Husbands, love your wives" Eph 5:25 are like milk.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In contrast, those portions of the Word concerning God's creation of man in His image and according to His likeness, His preparing a human spirit by breathing His breath of life into man's nostrils, and His putting man in front of the tree of life, a figure of God Himself as life, are solid, like diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nevertheless, we need to eat these portions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need spiritual teeth that can eat such solid food, and we also need a spiritual stomach to digest such words.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to grow unto maturity by eating the solid food.</S>
