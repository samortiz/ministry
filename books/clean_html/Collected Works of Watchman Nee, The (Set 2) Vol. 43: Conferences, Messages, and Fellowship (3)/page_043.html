<h2 class="head1">ONE GRAIN FALLING TO PRODUCE MANY GRAINS</h2><p>John 12:24 touches the mystery of the gospel. This is the highest and most crucial passage in the Bible because it touches God's goal. The Lord compared His death to a grain of wheat. The Bible never uses wheat as a type of redemption, because wheat has no blood. The death of the grain of wheat refers to the non-redemptive aspect of Christ's death. Christ is the one grain of wheat. On the outside of the grain, there is a glossy shell, which locks the life of the grain inside. In order for the life to be released, the grain must first be buried into the ground.</p><p>The Lord said, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." The Lord's life is like a grain of wheat. The life of this grain is bound by its outward shell, and unless the outward shell is removed by the grain passing through death, the wheat will never grow. When the grain is buried in the ground, the moisture and humidity of the earth act on the shell and break it. In a few days the grain sprouts, and after a few months, hundreds of grains are produced.</p><p>The Lord said that He was like a grain of wheat. Life was in Him, but unless He died, He would forever be the only One, because God had only one Son; He was the only Begotten of God. He was the only One who had life. When He became flesh and came to the earth, His life was bound by the flesh even though He was God's Son and had God's life. Men could not receive His life, and He could not bring forth many grains. Suppose one hundred grains are harvested from one grain. How many grains would there be? There would be one hundred and one. Because the one grain has died, one hundred grains are produced. Originally, there was only one unique grain, who is God's only begotten Son. But after death and resurrection, He brought forth many grains. What happened to the original one grain? It became the first grain. Originally, it was the unique one; now it has become the first of one hundred and one grains. Originally, He was God's only begotten Son. Now through death and resurrection, He has become God's firstborn Son. Before the Lord Jesus died, He was God's only begotten Son. After resurrection, He became God's firstborn Son.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST</h2><p>My friends, please remember that death and resurrection have the same boundary line. Before the Lord's death, God had only one Son. After the Lord's resurrection, God has many children. The Lord became the first grain. God's only begotten Son has become the firstborn Son. Originally, there was only one grain. Now there are hundreds of grains. What is the difference between the hundreds of grains and the first grain? When a mustard seed is sown, mustard comes out. When a grain of wheat is sown, wheat comes out. When the Lord Jesus is planted, what comes out must be the Lord Jesus.</p><p>There was an elderly black woman in Africa who was a very spiritual sister. She did not have any education and was not eloquent at all. Yet many people went to her for the truth. One British pastor once went to her and asked, "What are Christians?" She answered, "They are fragments of Christ." This is indeed well said. I am afraid that many doctors of divinity cannot answer the question the way she did. Every Christian has a little bit of Christ in him. The hundreds of grains are produced from the first grain. When the hundreds of grains are put together, you have the original grain. When Christ and all the Christians are added together, we have the Christ.</p><p>I have often been amazed by 1 Corinthians 12:12. I do not know whether others are equally amazed when they read this. This verse tells us that just as a body has many members and is still one body, so also is Christ. Brother Paul, have you made a mistake? Why did you not use the word church? You should have said, "So also is Christ and the church." But was Paul wrong? No! He did not speak of the church, because the church is Christ. He did not have to say Christ and the church, because the church is Christ!</p><p>In reading the Bible, we should make a distinction between two different aspects of Christ. In Greek, when the name Christ is used without a definite article, it refers to Christ Himself. When it is used with a definite article, it refers to the church of Christ. Most versions do not make this distinction clearly. Only Darby's translation brings out this distinction. There is a difference between Christ and the Christ. The former refers to the individual Christ, while the latter refers to the church. The Christ refers not only to one individual, but to the corporate man composed of all those who are in Christ. This corporate man becomes the Christ. The individual Christ refers to Jesus; He was not corporate. He is the Head, and all Christians combined together form His Body. The individual Christ becomes the Head of the corporate Christ, and the whole is called the Christ.</p><p>Through His death Christ becomes us. Within every saved person there is now a little bit of Christ. Everyone has a little bit of Him. This is why we break the bread. Originally, there was one bread, but God charges us to break it and each take a piece of it. There is only one bread before us, and when we put together all the pieces that each one has taken, we have the same one bread. Within each one of us there is a little bit of that bread. Within each one of us there is a little bit of Christ. This is God's goal. Our Lord was God's only begotten Son. After death and resurrection, He begot many sons, and He Himself became the firstborn Son.</p><p>In the physical world, how does one grain produce many grains? It was most suitable for the Lord to use this illustration. In the natural realm, one grain can be turned into many grains. In the same way, one Christ can be multiplied to become the corporate Christ. This is a fact. How does one grain become so many grains? We do not know, but we do know that this multiplication is a fact. Christ is the seed of God. God has sown Christ into the earth, and many Christians have been produced. Through His death and resurrection, Christ released His life into us. After resurrection, He said to His disciples, "I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" (John 20:17). Originally, God was His Father. After the Lord's resurrection, God became our Father also, and Christ, who had been the only begotten Son, became the firstborn Son among many sons.</p>
