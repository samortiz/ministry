   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to see that there is something on this earth structured as a kind of organic constitution which is called the Body of Christ, and this Body of Christ is the organism of the unseen God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Dear saints, this is the consummation of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many things are mentioned in the Bible, but eventually, at the end of the Bible, there is only one consummation, and this consummation is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this consummation, we can see God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and God's redeemed humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can see Israel because the New Jerusalem bears the names of the twelve tribes representing saved Israel Rev 21:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can see the believers because the holy city bears the names of the twelve apostles representing all the New Testament believers v. 14 . The New Jerusalem is the consummation of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has constituted Himself into our humanity and our humanity also has been constructed into His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now divinity and humanity are joined, united, mingled, and blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do we need to wait until the New Jerusalem comes before we blend?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is not such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The New Jerusalem comes into existence by the blending of God with His elect, His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even the Old Testament people such as Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Isaiah, and all the prophets were blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They were not just individual saints.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were considered by God on this earth as a nation, a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This corporate entity was not only incorporated with men but also incorporated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then in the New Testament we also see a marvelous blending.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus blended all the seven churches in Asia together by sending them one aggregate epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul blended the churches in Colossae and Laodicea by writing one epistle to each of the two churches respectively and asking them to read the two epistles reciprocally Col 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that in the eyes of Paul those two churches were one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They both should know the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, the coming out of the divine revelation is a city, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That is the consummation of God, of Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Isaiah, Peter, John, Paul, Darby, Watchman Nee, you, and me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord has opened up to us the truth of God's economy with God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First Timothy 1:4, Ephesians 1:10, and Ephesians 3:9 all use the word economy, a translation of the Greek word oikonomia.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This economy with God's dispensing will consummate in one city.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we composed our hymnal thirty years ago in 1964, I wrote a number of hymns on the New Jerusalem Hymns, #971-972, 975-976, 978-980 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since 1984 I have given many messages on the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The last nineteen chapters of the book entitled God's New Testament Economy are concerning the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After my study of the Bible for the past sixty-nine years, what have I seen?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I would say that I have seen the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is my vision, this is my revelation, and this is my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have been in the United States for thirty-two years, and I have published approximately four thousand messages.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have stressed the Triune God, Christ, life, and the Spirit, and the church, the Body, and ultimately, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is the significance of our blending?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not an organization of any nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first stanza of Hymns, #541 says, "Not the law of letters,/But the Christ of life."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then stanza 4 says, "Not religion, even/Christianity,/Can fulfill God's purpose/Or economy."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our blending has nothing to do with the dead letter, any religion, or anything of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The significance of our blending is the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This reality is nothing but the group of God's redeemed who have all been made God, the God-men, by God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They live a life not by themselves but by another life which is within them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This other life is the Triune God processed and consummated to enter into them and to take them as His abode, His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ephesians 3:17 tells us that Christ is now making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In John 14:23 the Lord said, "If anyone loves Me My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This word make is not a small word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To make is to build.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The only way to make a home is by building.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This building is not by anything physical but by the spiritual element and spiritual essence of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This building actually is a kind of organic constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The reality of the Body of Christ is a living by all the God-men united, joined, and constituted together with God by mingling humanity with divinity and divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>REJECTING OUR NATURAL LIFE AND LIVING BY THE DIVINE LIFE WITHIN US</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now that you realize this, what should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every day remember that you are a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You have God living in you, making His home in you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You and He, He and you, are mingled together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You should not live a life by your natural life, your natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You and I, the old man, the natural man, have been terminated on the cross, crucified by the Lord in His death Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must leave our natural man on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is what it means to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By leaving your old man on the cross, you will be conformed to the death of Christ Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The death of Christ means that when Christ lived on this earth, He was always rejecting Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He told us that He never did anything by Himself, but He did everything by the Father John 6:57; 5:19; 4:34; 17:4; 14:10, 24; 5:30; 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He had a very holy, pure human life, but He did not live that life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He put that life aside, put that life to death, and lived by the Father's life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>That was a model to us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should be the mass production of that model, the God-men who have both the human life uplifted in Christ's resurrection and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even our human life has been uplifted in Christ's resurrection, but we should not live by that, by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is not an exchange, because Paul went on to say, "And the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God " v. 20b . Paul was a person living not by himself but by the pneumatic Christ, and this pneumatic Christ is the all-inclusive Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All of this is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When you do not live by your natural life, but live by the divine life within you, you are in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The issue of this is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The reality of the divine life within us is the resurrection, which is the pneumatic Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit, and the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I hope that this brief fellowship will help us to know the significance of the blending.</S>
