   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD SAVING US WITH A PLAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, is our salvation an accident or a purposeful act of God?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Is God's salvation like giving two pennies to a beggar that one happens to come across in the street?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Or is God purposefully seeking to find a man to whom He can give money?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Is God's salvation an accident, or is it according to a definite plan?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who do not understand salvation may think that God's salvation is an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But all those who understand the Bible and who know God realize that His salvation is not an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, it was planned long ago according to a definite plan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 8:29 says, "Those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 30, a parenthetical word, says, "And those whom He predestinated, these He also called; and those whom He called, these He also justified; and those whom He justified, these He also glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The salvation that we are talking about involves all the things covered in verses 29 and 30.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The history of our salvation began with justification in verse 30.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were saved at the time that we were justified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We only know that we have believed in Jesus and that we have been saved and justified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We think that justification is our first encounter with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We think that the first time we touched God in our life was when we were justified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the Bible says that God touched us long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He knew us long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our justification came afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's knowledge of us came first.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some have said that Romans 8:29-30 is the only chain in the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a chain of different rings linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a most precious and complete chain.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first ring of this chain is God's foreknowledge of man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The second ring is our predestination to be conformed to the image of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The third ring is the calling of those who have been predestinated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fourth ring is the justification of those who have been called.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fifth ring is the glorification of those who have been justified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a series of rings linked to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We think that we first knew God when we were saved and justified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the Bible says that before we were saved and justified, God knew us already.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those whom God knew long ago, He marked out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be marked out means to have a check mark put by our name, indicating that He has claimed us for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For what purpose were we marked out?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is so that we would be like His unique Son, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He not only wants one Son, Jesus Christ; He came to mark us out so that we would be identical to His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who were marked out are called.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The ones who are called are known by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He called the ones whom He knew and marked out.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After He called them, He justified them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If justification is the first step in a Christian's relationship with God, it does not matter much for us not to be justified again in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If I pick up two pennies today and throw them into the fire tomorrow, it does not matter much to me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not to be justified is, of course, a loss on man's part.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But God suffers no loss.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we have to know that the history of our relationship with God does not start from justification and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, it starts from God's foreknowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's foreknowledge is the beginning of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be marked out is the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be called is the third step.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only after the third step do we have justification.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we were to lose our justification and become sinners again, we would put a question mark on God's omniscience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since God foreknew us and marked us out, how can we still perish after we are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A person predestinated by God can never be thrown into hell and burned like a piece of wood.</S>
