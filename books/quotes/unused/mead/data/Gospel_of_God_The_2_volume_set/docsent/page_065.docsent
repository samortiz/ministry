   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MAN JESUS HAVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE RIGHTEOUSNESS ACCORDING TO THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND BEING QUALIFIED TO REDEEM MAN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jesus of Nazareth has come into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While He was on the earth, His works demonstrated that God loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But at the same time, He fulfilled the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was truly submissive to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was a holy man and a submissive man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Him we see a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus of Nazareth was full of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was a righteous man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Throughout history there was only one man who could be saved by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He did not need to keep the law, yet He kept the law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible says that only those who keep the law can inherit the righteousness that is of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With righteousness, there is life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The law says that he who keeps it will live.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To keep it is to abide by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All who have the righteousness of the law have life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The only purpose for God to say this to the whole world is to condemn man and prove to him that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God gave us the law to prove to us that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is only One who has life by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This One is Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us for the moment set aside the fact that He is God and consider Him as a man, a very ordinary man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He kept the law and lived.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He lived on earth for over thirty-three years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not only did He not sin, He did not even know sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was tempted in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But He was not tempted by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Note this: the Lord Jesus was not tempted by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When many read the book of Hebrews, they receive a wrong understanding based on a wrong translation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Greek text shows us clearly that although the Lord Jesus was tempted in all things, He was never tempted by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was in the flesh and therefore had weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But He knew no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was never tempted by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you consult an accurate translation, you will see this clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Are the Lord Jesus' righteous acts of any benefit to us?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Indeed they are.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The righteous acts of the Lord Jesus prove that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because of these righteous acts, the Lord Jesus did not have to die for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The righteous acts of the Lord qualify Him to die on the cross on behalf of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the Lord Jesus had any sin, His death would have been for Himself; He would not have been able to die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since the Lord did not have any sin at all, He was qualified to be offered up as a sacrifice for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christian theology says that God has made the righteousness of the Lord Jesus ours.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God has transferred the Lord's righteousness to us in the same way that banks transfer money from one account to another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord kept the law for us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have disobeyed the law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But the obedience of the Lord Jesus has earned us God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But let me ask emphatically: Has the Bible ever mentioned the "righteousness of the Lord Jesus"?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Who can find a place in the New Testament that speaks of "the righteousness of the Lord Jesus"?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you read the entire New Testament, including the Greek text, you will discover that the New Testament never mentions the words the righteousness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One place seems to say this, but it does not refer to Christ's own personal righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Men do not like to read God's Word today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They like to study theology.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Theology, however, is created by man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It does not come from God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Theology tells us that God has imputed Christ's righteousness to us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible does not have this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the contrary, the Bible is opposed to this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The righteousness of Jesus of Nazareth is His own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is indeed righteousness, but it is the righteousness of Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This righteousness qualifies Him to die for us and be our Savior, but God has no intention to transfer the righteousness of Jesus to us.</S>
