<p>Much of what we are and have is still natural, and very little is in resurrection. This is because the shining in us is not sufficiently strong. In our practical experience we seldom condemn, reject, or put aside what is of us, that is, what we originally are and have by birth. For example, someone may tell us, &ldquo;In your way of doing things, I have found much that is not appropriate and proper and that requires some adjustment.&rdquo; The way we react to this word is a test. Most people think that the proper reaction is to accept the critique and that to reject it is not proper. Actually, it is possible for either reaction to not be in resurrection. Resurrection is not a matter of accepting or rejecting the critique. When others point out our shortcomings, we may immediately have a certain feeling, but at the same moment, a light may shine on us, saying, &ldquo;You need to put this feeling to death. This feeling needs to be condemned.&rdquo; Whether a person accepts or rejects criticism does not determine whether or not that person is in resurrection. A person may be quite able to accept another&rsquo;s criticism, but he may accept it by gritting his teeth. To accept it in this way is natural and is not of resurrection. The feeling must be put to death. Only then will his acceptance be in resurrection.</p>
<p>Similarly, being praised is also a test that manifests whether or not a person is in resurrection. If a person has the light of resurrection when others praise him, he will sense a hand within him pointing him to the cross. To some degree we have all had this kind of experience. From morning to evening, there is always a condemning hand within us, not condemning us in our conscience, but pointing at us and saying, &ldquo;This is natural. This is in its original state. It has not been rejected. It is a grain of wheat that has not yet died.&rdquo; If this is our experience, we are in resurrection.</p>
<p>How much there is of the element of the church among us today depends upon how much we judge the natural things in us. When we are in one accord, we are not necessarily the church. Likewise, when we all love one another, we are not necessarily the church. For us to be the church depends upon whether or not we judge the natural things in us. Not only do the natural things need to be judged, but even the so-called spiritual gifts and spiritual views need to be judged. There should always be a finger within pointing at us and saying, &ldquo;Is this spiritual insight the first or the second? Is this spiritual gift the first or the second? Is this Isaac according to birth, or is this Isaac who passed through the altar?&rdquo; Although Isaac according to birth was good, he had to pass through the altar. By birth, he was not of resurrection.</p>
<p>Anything that has not passed through the altar is not of resurrection. Even if it is a gift obtained from God, it still needs to be rejected. Anything that is finished and gone after being rejected is not of resurrection. When something is of resurrection, the more it is rejected, the more it increases. Just one Isaac was put on the altar, but thousands of Isaac&rsquo;s descendants were gained. This is resurrection, and this is the church. Concerning this matter, we need to be enlightened and to receive grace. Once a person is enlightened, he will begin to sense something within him condemning him every day. It condemns not only the evil things but also the good things. It condemns not only the natural things but also the spiritual things. This condemnation is a seeing, a shining. It is the Lord&rsquo;s presence and His showing mercy to us. It is grace. It is God adding something additional to us.</p>
<p>When a person who has seen the principle of resurrection is criticized and senses that his feelings are stirred up, he will immediately sense something within pointing at him and saying, &ldquo;You need to condemn this feeling. You need to reject this feeling.&rdquo; When others praise him and he senses a happy response, immediately something will convict him and say, &ldquo;This feeling needs to be rejected.&rdquo; Likewise, when he relies on his gifts, something will also convict him, saying, &ldquo;These gifts need to be put aside.&rdquo; When he is about to argue for the Lord&rsquo;s work, something will point at him and say, &ldquo;This argument needs to be condemned.&rdquo; It is hard for us to say what this something is. Some say it is the condemnation of the cross. However, according to our experience, this condemnation is experienced by everyone who is in resurrection; hence, it is not related only to the cross. We do not have the boldness to say that this condemnation is related only to resurrection; however, everyone who senses this kind of condemnation is in resurrection. It is in resurrection that the church, the coordination, the one accord, the expression of the Body, and every function of the Body are realized.</p>
<p>If the saints in the church are not in resurrection, their service and coordination will be only an exercise of tolerance, with each of us yielding a little to the other. Then when there are problems among us, a certain brother may mediate and remind us that for the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s name and work, we should forbear and be patient with one another. It is common to have this kind of mediation among us. For example, when two responsible brothers get into an argument, someone may rise up to mediate in this situation, saying, &ldquo;Both of you are leading brothers, and if you argue like this, many brothers and sisters will be stumbled. Please calm down.&rdquo; This kind of mediation is not the church; rather, it is politics.</p>
<p>What is the church? The church is realized when brothers, while being judged inwardly, say, &ldquo;O Lord, even if my proposal is of You, it still needs to be placed on the altar and rejected.&rdquo; This is the church. Whatever is in resurrection does not fear rejection. The Son of God fell into the ground and died to become many sons. The only begotten Son died, and many sons were produced. Whatever is of God does not need to be safeguarded by us. Some brother may ask, &ldquo;What if we suffer loss? What if things are spoiled? What if things are delayed?&rdquo; If we suffer loss, let us suffer loss. If things are spoiled, let them be spoiled. If things are delayed, let them be delayed. We must place everything in God&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>The crucial matter is whether we have passed through judgment and whether something within has inwardly convicted us. When there is nothing more to be said or done, when there is absolutely nothing more, then there is resurrection. If something can still come forth after everything is dead and finished, it is resurrection. In the church man&rsquo;s zeal and cleverness should be judged. Even our giving of a message should be judged. People are concerned that if they miss an opportunity, they may never have the opportunity again. To this, the Lord will say that it is not a matter of having an opportunity but a matter of whether it is of the first or the second. God has allowed many, many opportunities to pass. He has been missing opportunities for the past six thousand years. Instead of paying attention to opportunity, God keeps asking whether it is of the first or the second, whether it is of man or of man in God. Is it man alone, or is it the mingling of man and God? This is what God cares for.</p>
<p>Everything that is merely of man is natural, but everything that is of the mingling of God and man is in resurrection. If a person has been shown mercy, inwardly there is always a finger pointing at him, just as when he was first saved and began to pursue the Lord. Within a newly saved one there is always a story of love. Although he cannot utter or explain it, this story is in him, and it causes him to desire and incline toward the Lord all the time. Even when he is doing a small thing, a feeling of love touches his inward being. In the same way, if he has been shown mercy, today there is another story in him, that is, a story of conviction, a story of being rebuked. Not only are bad things rebuked, but also good things are rebuked. Both good things and bad things are rebuked. What is of the self is rebuked, and even what is of God is rebuked. Natural things as well as spiritual things are rebuked. Everything that is done through a human hand is rebuked and condemned. Everything of Ishmael and Isaac must be put aside. The church is realized through this unceasing rebuke.</p>
<p>Due to a shortage of this experience among us, we cannot perceive much of the church. If man cannot enter into God and God cannot be expressed from within man, not much of the church will be expressed. The story of resurrection is that man enters into God and allows God to be continually expressed from within him. Only in resurrection can the church be realized. This is a crucial point. If we miss this point, everything is just doctrine.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> </body></html>
