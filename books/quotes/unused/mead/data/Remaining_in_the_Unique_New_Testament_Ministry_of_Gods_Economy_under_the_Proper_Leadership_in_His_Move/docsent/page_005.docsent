   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Divisions Coming out of Different Ministries</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to be very clear that the foundation of all the denominations and the factor that produces each denomination are their different ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If all the Christians today would be willing for the Lord to take away their different ministries, they would all be one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The basic factor of all the divisions, their very root, is different ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ministries that are different may be very sound, even very scriptural, but they are something Paul said was creeping in at the time of Galatians 2 v. 4, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>. This thing crept in as early as the time of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul, Peter, and James were all there, and a ministry of another kind was trying to come in. In 1 Timothy 1 Paul charged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to take care of one thing: to charge certain ones not to teach differently, which means not to teach according to another ministry vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time the different teaching was the teaching of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Galatians 2 what was trying to creep in was the law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At a later time, the heretical teaching of Gnosticism came in. Gnosticism was heresy, but you cannot say that to teach something of the Old Testament was heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At this point we need to consider that whole situation carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul was carrying out God s New Testament ministry and his ministry followed Peter s ministry, which was an immediate continuation of the ministry of the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the four Gospels Jesus Christ carried out God s ministry, and in the first part of Acts, Peter continued that ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then in the second part of Acts, Paul s ministry was a continuation of Peter s to carry out God s New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, when the Judaizing believers were strong in teaching the law, Peter became weak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter was afraid of those who came down from James Gal 2:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This also indicates that James was a strong figure, a strong character, in tolerating the teaching of the law in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Can you imagine Paul facing that problem?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Antioch Paul was facing the number one apostle, Peter, and he was facing representatives of the most influential apostle, James.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was not easy for Paul to face that situation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Two strong influences were there, the influence of Peter and the influence of James.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter could have said to Paul, Who are you, Saul of Tarsus?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When I was speaking there in Jerusalem, you were still a young man opposing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Who do you think you are?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In addition, Paul was facing the representatives of James, a godly man who prayed so much, day after day, that there are reports that his two knees were calloused.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>James was famous for his godly perfection and was very influential.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He became even more influential than the great first apostle, Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Peter was afraid of his influence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Antioch Peter was eating with the Gentiles peacefully.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, when some representatives came from James, Peter became a hypocrite and pretended that he had not eaten with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates how strong James influence was.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul, as a younger apostle who had come later than Peter, was facing such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Undoubtedly, it was hard for him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nevertheless, for the sake of the truth, Paul did not tolerate that situation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He did not allow such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He cut off the different ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He closed the door for the different ministries to creep in, and God honored what Paul did in that situation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the New Testament and according to church history, from that time onward Peter did not play an important role in God s New Testament economy, not as important as the role he played in the first twelve chapters of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is an important point.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After not too long a time, in A.D. 70, God destroyed Jerusalem Matt 24:1-2 , which was the base of Peter s work and the base of James influence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He tore down the whole thing, leaving no stone upon another, destroying it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only was that a judgment on the rebellious Israel, but it was also the destruction of the base of Peter s work and of James influence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After the destruction that took place in A.D. 70, however, Paul s ministry and his influence remained.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God did not allow different ministries and other influences.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to see this principle throughout the entire Christian era.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the troubles, divisions, and confusions came from the one source of the tolerance of different ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many Christian teachers have known the peril of different ministries; nevertheless, they have tolerated them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There has been a tolerance of different ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Lord s recovery, for the long run, we should not believe that this kind of creeping in of the different ministries would never take place.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, we must be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such a peril is ahead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we are not watchful, if we are careless, in one way or another the enemy would creepingly use some means, some ways, to bring in different ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Such a thing would end the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you look at today s situation, you will realize that there are many different ministries in addition to this unique New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you could take away all the different ministries and leave only the unique ministry of the New Testament, all the denominations, all the different groups, and all the divisions, would disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There would be no division and no confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All of us need to learn this sober lesson and be on the alert not to deviate from the ministry of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we carry out something new, something different, something other than this unique ministry, we will be through as far as the Lord s recovery is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Actually, the Lord s recovery is to bring us back to the unique ministry of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Elders Training, Book 1: The Ministry of the New Testament, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>14-16, 72, Witness Lee</S>
