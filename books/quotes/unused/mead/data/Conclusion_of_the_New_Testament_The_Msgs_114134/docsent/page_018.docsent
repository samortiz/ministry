   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN THE BELIEVERS THEIR PRESENT 3</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall see that, as part of their present, the believers have been sanctified by the Spirit and that they have repented.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sanctified, Separated unto God,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>by the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The believers are sanctified, separated unto God, by the Spirit 1 Pet 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The divine title the Holy Spirit signifies God reaching us to make us holy even as He is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Holy Spirit separates us unto God for the purpose of making us holy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, following God s calling, the Spirit comes to sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Peter 1:2 speaks of the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this verse sanctification of the Spirit is not the sanctification of the Spirit which comes after justification through the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here sanctification of the Spirit is before justification through Christ s redemption 1 Cor 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that the believers obedience unto faith in Christ results from the Spirit s sanctifying work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concerning the sanctification of the Spirit, there are two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first aspect precedes justification.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This aspect of sanctification carries out God s choice, His selection, and brings the chosen ones to the obedience and sprinkling of the blood for their justification.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, this aspect of the Spirit s sanctification is before justification through the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then, following justification, the Spirit continues to work to sanctify us dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sequence is this: God s selection, the Spirit s sanctification, justification, and subjective sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In eternity past God, according to His foreknowledge, chose us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He selected us and made a decision to gain us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But how could this selection be applied to us?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order for it to be applied, there is the need for the Spirit to separate us unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, after God selected us in eternity, the Spirit came to us in time to sanctify us, to set us apart, from the world so that we would obey Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that the Spirit came to separate us for the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the sanctifying Spirit who separates us from the world unto the obedience of Christ s blood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, we repent and believe, and then we obey what Christ has done on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Following this, we receive the sprinkling of the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the sanctifying work of the Spirit following God s selection to carry out God s choice and to bring us to Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all can testify of this sanctifying work of the Spirit from our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We were wandering on earth, perhaps never having a thought about God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then one day the wind of the Spirit blew us to a place where we heard the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While we were listening, faith was infused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way God s selection was applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this sense the sanctification of the Spirit preceded our experience of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>a. Sought by the Enlightening of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Spirit separates us unto God through seeking us by enlightening us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This enlightening of the Holy Spirit is illustrated by the second parable in Luke 15, the parable of the seeking woman.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Luke 15:8 says, What woman having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek carefully until she finds it?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The lamp signifies the word of God Psa 119:105, 130 used by the Spirit to enlighten and expose the sinner s position and condition so that he may repent.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The word sweep indicates the searching and cleansing of the inside of a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit s seeking here is inside the sinner, carried out by the Spirit s working within the repenting sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Spirit seeks the sinner as a woman seeks carefully one lost coin until she finds it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that the Spirit comes to find us out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the accomplishment of redemption by the Son, the Spirit comes to seek us and find us by enlightening us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As indicated by the parable of the seeking woman, the Spirit enlightens us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Spirit seeks us by enlightening our inner being in a fine, careful way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As the result of the Spirit s enlightening, we are separated to God and we repent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The repentance resulting from the enlightening of the Spirit is an inward matter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such a subjective work can be done only by the penetrating Spirit, for the Spirit is able to penetrate the depths of our being to enlighten us and expose us.</S>
