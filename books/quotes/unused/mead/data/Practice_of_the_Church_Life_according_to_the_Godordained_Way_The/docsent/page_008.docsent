   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE PREREQUISITE OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ACCORDING TO THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:16-17; 3:14; 1 Cor 14:29b; Acts 2:42a; Eph 4:14</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this term of training I have a deep consideration for all the trainees, especially the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I also believe that what I am going to fellowship with you in this message will be a help to all the saints in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I believe you have heard that beginning in September 1987 a group of brothers who had been among us for many years became very dissenting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the past four years they have spoken and even written a number of things that are divisive and very misleading.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During this time I adopted the attitude that I would not fight with them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, I did not say much, but, on the positive side, I received a burden from the Lord to put out more and more messages on the divine Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Beginning in the summer of 1988, after they had begun their conspiracy, my speaking increased.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, in 1988 I put out the Life-study of Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then from 1989 through 1991, I released, consecutively, the life-studies of Numbers, Deuteronomy, Isaiah, Daniel and Zechariah, and Jeremiah and Lamentations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Presently, I am ready to finish the life-study of the Old Testament Prophets by covering the Minor Prophets in the coming summer training.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During the same period, besides all the life-studies on these books of the Old Testament, I have held a number of conferences in different cities, including Seattle, Cleveland, Atlanta, Pasadena, San Diego, Taipei, Berkeley, and Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In all these conferences I passed on some crucial messages for the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this message and the next I would like to take the opportunity to make the present situation in the Lord's recovery clear to all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we will know where we are and will also know how to face the present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I say again that I have no intention to fight with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For all the years of my ministry I have never done the Lord's work in the way of stressing things on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the contrary, I have always done the work by ministering things on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, in this message what I am going to say is not something negative but something very positive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the previous message we covered four points of the prerequisite of the practice of the church life according to the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this message we will continue with the fifth and sixth points.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>V. TO HAVE A CLEAR VIEW CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE PRESENT SITUATION OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The fifth point of the prerequisite is to have a clear view concerning the present situation of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since we are in the recovery, we should know the present situation of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not be indifferent but should know the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This requires that we get into the intrinsic nature of every problem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to God's ordained principle in His creation, nothing can exist without two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even a thin piece of paper has two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not only so, but according to God's ordination, for many things to exist, they need not only two sides but also an outer covering and an inner reality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A walnut is a kind of fruit, but its appearance is tough and rough.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The external shell of the walnut is not the real walnut.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The real walnut is not the shell but the kernel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we eat a walnut, we do not eat the shell; we eat the kernel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The shell of the walnut and the kernel of the walnut are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The book of Jeremiah may be likened to a walnut.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I misunderstood this book for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I first read it, I did not appreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, there were two verses in Jeremiah that I could never forget.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first was 17:9, which says, "The heart is deceitful above all things/And it is incurable;/Who can know it?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From my youth I remembered that verse.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It helped me not to trust any heart, including my heart, because man's heart is deceitful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The second verse is 13:23, which says, "Can the Cushite change his skin,/Or the leopard his spots?/Then you also may be able to do good,/Who are accustomed to do evil."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This verse says that man's sinful nature is unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jeremiah likens man's sinful nature to two things: the skin of the Cushite and the spots of the leopard.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The fact that no one can change these two things indicates that man's sinful nature is unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>While I was writing the outlines for the 1991 Winter Training on Jeremiah, I was forced to get into the kernel of Jeremiah intrinsically.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was then that the Lord showed me the intrinsic contents of this book.</S>
