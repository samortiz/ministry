   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When He established the heavens, wisdom was there; when He inscribed a circle upon the surface of the deep, when He made firm the skies above, when the fountains of the deep became strong, when He set for the sea its boundary, that the waters should not transgress His commandment, when He marked out the foundations of the earth; then wisdom was by Him, as a master workman.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Wisdom was daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him, rejoicing in His habitable earth; and wisdom's delight was in the sons of men.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Wisdom loves those who love her, and those who seek wisdom diligently will find her.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Riches and honor are with wisdom, enduring wealth and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Wisdom's fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; and her yield than choice silver.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Wisdom walks in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice, that wisdom may cause those who love her to inherit substance and that she may fill their treasuries.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ became wisdom to us from God in three vital things in God's salvation: righteousness for our past , by which we have been justified by God, that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life Rom 5:18 ; sanctification for our present , by which we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will, with the divine life 6:19, 22 ; and redemption for our future , that is, the redemption of our body 8:23 , by which we will be transfigured in our body with the divine life to have His glorious likeness Phil 3:21 .</S>
