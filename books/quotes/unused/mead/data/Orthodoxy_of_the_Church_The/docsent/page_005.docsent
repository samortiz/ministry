   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE CHURCH IN EPHESUS Scripture Reading: Rev 2:1-7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church in Ephesus is prophetic concerning the condition of the first stage of the church after the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The apostolic age was prior to A.D. 96.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After A.D. 96 the apostolic age apparently was over, and many wrong things began to creep in. Since Revelation is a book of prophecy, the names in the book are also prophetic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesus in Greek means "desirable."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church which continued after the apostolic church was still desirable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"I know your works and your labor and your endurance" Rev 2:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The pronoun your in Revelation 2 and 3 is singular in number.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Among the seven churches, five are rebuked, one receives no rebuke and no praise, and only one is praised.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesus is one among those which are rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the Lord first tells the messenger of Ephesus about the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some think the Lord attempts to say something good before He rebukes so that the one being rebuked will not feel so bad, as if the Lord is being diplomatic.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But this is not so with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, the Lord points out the spiritual reality in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is something called the spiritual reality which exists regardless of the outward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although the Israelites were worthless in the sight of men, God said through Balaam that He did not behold iniquity in Jacob Num 23:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not that God does not look; rather, He looks but sees nothing wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not that the eyes of God can see better than ours, but that God sees the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not difficult for us to see that the condition of the church today is desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes we think a certain brother or sister is just as desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if the children of God are enlightened by the Lord, they will see that their many weaknesses and failures are lies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the spiritual reality is true, then these are all lies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consider a little child who runs out to the street and returns covered with mud.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although he is filthy when he enters the house, I say that he is clean and beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is true that his body is covered with dirt, but the dirt does not grow out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once he is washed, he will be clean again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Each child of God must see that even before he is washed, he is good.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The dirtiness is a lie; his reality is good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today the church does not look as glorious as God says, but today the church is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you have spiritual insight, though the church is not washed, you can still see that she is good.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason you can also thank God continually for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today the church is glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things Eph 5:25-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No spot means sinless, and no wrinkle means not aged, always maintaining her freshness before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God says the church in Ephesus is good; it is her spiritual reality that is good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"And you have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false" Rev 2:2b .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord says something about trying the apostles, which proves that after the apostolic age there are still apostles in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If there were only twelve apostles, then all they would have to ask is whether or not the professed apostle was John.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If he was not John, then he would not be an apostle, because by that time all the other eleven apostles had passed away and only John was left.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The necessity for the apostles to be tried proves that there were still more apostles after the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"But I have one thing against you, that you have left your first love" v. 4 . The word "first" in Greek is proten.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It refers not only to primacy in time but also in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Luke 15 the father gave the best robe to the prodigal son to put on; the word "best" is also proten.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"But if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent" Rev 2:5b .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are not only churches in prophecy but also churches that were actually in seven localities in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Remarkably, history tells us that for more than a thousand years, there has been no church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The lampstand has been removed; even her outward appearance has been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now there are churches in Corinth, Rome, and so forth, but none in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because she did not repent, the lampstand was removed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate" v. 6 . Nicolaitans cannot be found in church history.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since Revelation is a book of prophecy, we must look into the meaning of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nicolait in Greek is composed of two words.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nikao means "conquer" or "above others."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Laos means "common people," "secular people," or "laity."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>So nicolait means "conquering the common people," "climbing above the laity."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nicolaitans, then, refers to a group of people who esteem themselves higher than the common believers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord is above; the common believers are below.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Nicolaitans are below the Lord yet above the common believers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord hates the behavior of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The conduct of climbing over and above the common believers as a mediatorial class is what the Lord detests; it is something to be hated.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But at that time there was only the behavior; it had not yet become a teaching.</S>
