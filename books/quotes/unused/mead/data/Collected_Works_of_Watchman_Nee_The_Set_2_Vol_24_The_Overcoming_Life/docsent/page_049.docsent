   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Philippians 4:4 says, "Rejoice in the Lord always."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In describing joy, the Bible either uses the word great, or full, or always.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Always means all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul was saying, "Have you heard this word?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you have not heard it yet, let me repeat it for you: Again I will say, rejoice.'"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we did not get it yet, he would repeat it once more that we should rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The life that God gives is a life of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rejoicing is the daily life of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There may be tribulation and trial, but there is still rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The opposite of rejoicing is being anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many people are anxious for their children, their money, or their business.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the Word of the Lord says, "In nothing be anxious" Phil 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We think that anxiety is justified, but the Lord says, "In nothing be anxious."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is because we should always rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we do not rejoice for a day, we have sinned that day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once a brother was preaching at a conference on being anxious in nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a sister heard this, she was very angry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She thought, "How can a person not be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the brothers would be a little more anxious, they could serve us better food."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The brothers were the ones taking care of the food during that conference.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the Lord could not let her go.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She eventually saw that anxiety is a sin, and she overcame.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I can say much more about this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul said in 2 Corinthians 12:10, "I am well pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions and distresses."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul rejoiced in weaknesses, insults, necessities, persecutions, and distresses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brothers and sisters, we do not know what will befall us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do know, however, that while we are living on this earth, our circumstances will not always go our way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some are sick; others have family members who are sick.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some have relatives who are dying, and others are facing persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What are we going to do?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may say, "Lord, I will endure," but saying that means that we have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we say, "Lord, I thank and praise You," we will be victorious and Christ will be manifested in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We will provide the Lord a chance to manifest His power, and we will rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is our daily life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should rejoice and thank and praise the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First Thessalonians 5:18 says, "In everything give thanks."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should give thanks in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Colossians 3:17 says, "And whatever you do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These two passages of the Scriptures encompass everything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whatever we have missed in the other passages are included in these two verses.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I can say, "Hallelujah."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Others may wonder what is happening to us, but we can give thanks in everything and praise the Lord for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers and sisters, if we do this, we will prevail over every temptation, and we will withstand every trial.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No tribulation or trial will touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who go this way will find the strength for their temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can thank and praise the Lord for temptations because we have obeyed the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some may think that I am against endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Endurance is precious, and it is right to endure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, the kind of endurance we want is not an endurance that comes by gritting our teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Colossians 1:11 says, "Unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We endure and suffer with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not an unwilling or bitter endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The daily tone of the Christian life is one of endurance and long-suffering with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In everything we give thanks, and in everything we offer praise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a life in the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>THE LORD'S VICTORY MORE THAN CONQUERS</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Why must the overcoming life be manifested in rejoicing?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why must we rejoice before we can say that we have the overcoming life?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Romans 8:37 says, "But in all these things we more than conquer."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God gives only one kind of victory, the victory that more than conquers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Any victory that barely makes it is not a victory from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The victory that the Lord gives is the victory that more than conquers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The victory that barely makes it and barely carries us over the top is not a victory at all.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord's victory is always one that more than conquers, and the only way to have the victory that more than conquers is by rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Brothers and sisters, our cup is running over.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Everything that God gives runs over.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Anything that does not run over is not from God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The kind of victory that God gives is, "Whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>And to him who wishes to sue you and take your tunic, yield to him your cloak also; and whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two" Matt 5:39-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The victory that runs over is God's victory.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Barely overcoming is a man-made victory; it is the product of human effort.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Brothers and sisters, this is the tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>May God open our eyes to see that any victory that does not more than conquer is just an imitation victory.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>While we are suppressing and wrestling, we are only imitating victory.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If Christ lives in us, we will rejoice in everything, and we will thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We will say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Praise the Lord" forever.</S>
