   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE FACTOR OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE FACTOR OF THE DIVINE LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: John 7:39; 2 Cor 3:17; John 20:22; Acts 1:3; John 20:19; Acts 1:9, 12-14; 2:1-4, 33; Luke 24:49; Rom 8:9, 2; Acts 16:6, 7; Phil 1:19; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 5:10, 17; Rev 20:6</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for this gathering, that You have gathered us together around You, through Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Oh Lord, how we love You, and how we love Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We thank You that You are the very God, the very Word, and the very Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We thank You that You are even the life, the divine life, which we are enjoying every day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, we believe that You are with us, and that we are really one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We praise You that we are here in the church enjoying You as the Spirit, as life, and as the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thank You for the cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thank You for all the enlightening words, and thank You for the anointing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We put our full trust in You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thank You, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Your precious name, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the two preceding chapters we have covered three factors which are vital to the recovery of the church life: Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this chapter I wish to speak a further word regarding the factor of the Spirit and the factor of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE SPIRIT BREATHED INTO THE DISCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the previous chapter, we saw that the Spirit of God became the Spirit after Christ was glorified John 7:39; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was at this time that the Spirit was first breathed into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the day of the Lord s resurrection, He came back to the disciples in the evening, breathed Himself into them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Greek word pneuma, translated Spirit in this verse, also means breath.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Lord Jesus said, Receive the Holy Spirit, He meant that they were to receive the holy breath.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Holy Spirit is the holy pneuma, and the holy pneuma is the holy breath.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, the Lord likened the Spirit to breath by which we live.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit as the holy breath was breathed into the disciples essentially for their existence that they might live by this life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the Spirit of life, the Spirit of the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When this Spirit of life was breathed into the disciples, this meant that the divine essence of God was breathed into their inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The processed Triune God as the Spirit in His divine essence was breathed into the disciples inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s divine essence thus became the very element in their inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From then on the disciples had the divine element in their being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was for their existence, for their spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All this happened in the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To repeat, in His resurrection the Lord became a life-giving Spirit, and in His resurrection He came to the disciples and breathed Himself as the Spirit into them as the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now they had something divine in their being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was for their spiritual being, their spiritual existence, and their spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>TRAINING THE DISCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>TO LIVE BY HIS INVISIBLE PRESENCE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After He was resurrected, the Lord Jesus stayed with the disciples for forty days in order to train them to enjoy His invisible presence Acts 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord had been with them in the flesh for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>During those three and a half years, the disciples had enjoyed the Lord s physical presence which was visible to all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But to their great dismay, the Lord Jesus was crucified and was buried.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They thought that was the end of Him, and they were very disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was a great surprise to them when on the third day the Lord Jesus was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That night He came back to them, not in a physical way but in a spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The doors of the room in which the disciples met were closed, yet the Lord Jesus came and stood in their midst John 20:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They did not know how the Lord entered the room, yet He came into the room, appeared to them, and breathed into them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then after a while He disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The disciples had never experienced this before.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This was the Lord s spiritual presence, a presence invisible to human eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In those three and a half years the Lord s presence with them was physical and visible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But now in resurrection the Lord Jesus came back to the disciples in a spiritual way, and His presence was no longer physical but spiritual and invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, because of the weakness of the disciples, they sometimes needed His invisible presence to become visible for a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He then would disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For forty days the Lord Jesus was with the disciples in this way, appearing and disappearing, becoming visible and invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This might have troubled the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After the Lord had appeared to them and then disappeared, Peter, John, and the other disciples might have asked one another what this meant.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Was that not the Lord Jesus who had appeared to them?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Surely it was He, but where was He now?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They did not know where the Lord had gone.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They needed to realize that Jesus never left them, for He was within them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this way the Lord Jesus trained them for forty days to practice and to enjoy His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although we cannot see Him, we believe the Lord Jesus is here.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is not visible, but He is very real in us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I have the assurance that Jesus is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>While I am speaking, I believe that the Lord Jesus speaks with me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you really believe that the Lord Jesus is within you, it is impossible for you to remain silent or stay still.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Because you have Jesus within you, you cannot help but jump for joy and shout, Hallelujah!</S>
