   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Immanuel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth great prophecy concerns Christ as Immanuel Isa 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The name Immanuel means "God with us."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This prophecy is all-inclusive because a son born of a virgin includes the thought of the seed of woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The seed of woman, who is also the seed of Abraham and the seed of David, is Immanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The central thought of the prophecy concerning Immanuel is that God is with man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even in the very name of Immanuel there is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Hebrew the last two letters of Immanuel el mean God, and "with us" indicates man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, in this one name there is the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The New Testament fulfillment of this prophecy is found in Matthew 1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Chapter one of Matthew is very profound.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this chapter the above four prophecies are fulfilled: the seed of woman as the son born of a virgin v. 23 , the seed son of Abraham v. 1b , the seed son of David v. 1a , and Emmanuel v. 23 . Such a One is God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Child as the Mighty God and the Son as the Eternal Father</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Isaiah 9:6 records the fifth main prophecy concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse says, "For a child is born to us,/A son is given to us;/And the government/Is upon His shoulder;/And His name will be called/Wonderful Counselor,/Mighty God,/Eternal Father,/Prince of Peace."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The little child born in a manger in Bethlehem is called Mighty God, and the son who is given to us is called Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Again, this prophecy shows us the mingling of God with man and the oneness of the expression with the source.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man is the expression, and God is the source; the Son is the expression, and the Father is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, these two are not separate but are mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The expression is one hundred percent in oneness with the source, as indicated by the fact that the Son is called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The central thought of God, that He mingles Himself with man, is clearly seen in Isaiah 9:6 in that the expression is one with the source.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A Root Out of Dry Ground</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Another major prophecy concerns Christ as a root out of dry ground Isa 53:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here Christ is prophesied not as the eternal root mentioned in Isaiah 11 but as a root in time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ as the eternal root is God Himself as the Lord and Creator, yet here He is another root, a root in time, grown out of dry ground.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The root out of dry ground refers to the human life and living of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the root in time, He grew up in a poor family, in a poor home, and in a small city John 1:45-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was truly out of dry ground; there was nothing rich in His living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The great thought hidden within this prophecy concerning Christ, as well as in all the above prophecies, is that this wonderful One is the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is the eternal root because He is the very Creator, the eternal God, and He is also the root out of dry ground because He became a man to grow up on this earth in a poor situation and poor environment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is God and He is man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Eternal One</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is also prophesied as the eternal One in Micah 5:2.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse says, "But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah,/So little to be among the thousands of Judah,/From you there will come forth to Me/He who is to be Ruler in Israel;/And His goings forth are from ancient times,/From the days of eternity."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, this short verse tells us that this Ruler of Israel came out of Judah, that is, out of the human source, but on the other hand, it tells us that He came out of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fact that He came first out of eternity and then out of Judah means that He is God becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we lack the vision, we will acknowledge Him as only a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, He is more than a Jew; He came not only out of the Jewish race but also out of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, He is God becoming a man as the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, Psalm 102:26-27 tells us that Christ is eternal not only in the past but also in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to Micah 5:2, Christ is eternal in the past, and according to Psalm 102, He is eternal in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, He is eternally without beginning and without end. Hebrews 7:3 is the fulfillment of this prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This verse says, "Without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This wonderful One has no beginning and no end.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In conclusion, the seven main points above are all prophecies concerning this wonderful Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David who is called Immanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This Immanuel is a child who is called Mighty God, and He is a son called Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is also a root out of dry ground.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He has no beginning from eternity past, and He has no end unto eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This wonderful One is the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have read many books about the prophecies in the Old Testament, but almost none present them according to their central thought.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The central thought of the prophecies is that God became a man; He was born of a virgin to be a little child and to grow up out of dry ground, yet He is the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is the branch, and He is the root.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is a man of God and God in man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is everything!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the wonderful One who was God coming into man, becoming a man, to mingle Himself with man as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ is a child, yet this child is called Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is also a son, yet this Son is called Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He came out of the Jewish race, yet He is from eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is the Son of David, yet He is the Lord of David.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is the branch, yet He is the root.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The entire Old Testament is centered around the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we grasp the central thought of all the prophecies, they will be clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If, however, we miss the central thought, we can never understand the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Scriptures reveal the thought that man is mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God Himself is the very life, the very content, and man is the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Man expresses God's life within him as his content.</S>
