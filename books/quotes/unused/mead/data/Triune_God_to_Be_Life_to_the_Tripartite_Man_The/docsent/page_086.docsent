   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HORIZONTAL ASPECT OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP BY THE HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to enter into the horizontal aspect of the divine fellowship by the human spirit Phil 2:1; Rev 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are going to have real fellowship horizontally with one another, we need to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we exercise our spirit, we will never talk in a worldly manner or speak negatively about the saints or the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A local church can be severely damaged if many of the saints in that locality spend time speaking negative things about other saints and other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such discussions spread gossip and death among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This kind of contact between the saints is not the fellowship of spirit that Paul spoke about in Philippians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Philippians 2:1-2 Paul said, "If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tenderheartedness and compassions, make my joy full...."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul seemed to be saying, "Brothers, if you have any fellowship with me in spirit, your fellowship will be my encouragement and consolation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then you will make my joy full."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Real fellowship is by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we exercise our spirit, we are unable to talk about worldly amusements and entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we exercise our spirit, the nature of our conversation will change because our spirit is holy cf.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2 Cor 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there are problems in a certain church, we may have a desire to merely talk about the situation, but our spirit within will urge us to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our spirit will not allow us to gossip about others' mistakes and failures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The only way to have the reality of horizontal fellowship is by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The two aspects of the divine fellowship require us to be in the two spirits, the Holy Spirit and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These two spirits eventually become one Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Paul charges us to walk according to spirit in Romans 8:4, he is speaking of the mingled spirit the divine Spirit mingled with our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we exercise our spirit to carry out the divine fellowship, we are fully sanctified, rescued, and saved from everything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be victorious, overcoming, sanctified, and transformed, we must exercise our spirit to carry out the two aspects of the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE INTERWOVEN FELLOWSHIP INCLUDING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The horizontal and vertical aspects of the divine fellowship are very closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can see this from our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes, we may talk about other saints under the pretense of having fellowship about their situation, but our conversation is actually gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Afterwards, we often cannot pray, because our praying spirit is quenched by our gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But when we fellowship in a genuine way by exercising our spirit, we are eager to pray and contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This shows how close the relationship is between the vertical and horizontal aspects of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The horizontal fellowship ushers us into the vertical fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If two brothers exercise their spirit to have genuine, proper, horizontal fellowship, they will eventually be ushered into a very honest and sincere intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When they pray together, the two aspects of the divine fellowship are interwoven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The horizontal fellowship is interwoven with the vertical fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This interwoven fellowship is the real fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Fellowship cannot have just one aspect alone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You cannot have the vertical fellowship without the horizontal fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you have a good time with the Lord in vertical fellowship, you will be eager to see the other saints in order to have fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once you have fellowship with the saints through prayer, you are brought into vertical fellowship with the Lord again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Your horizontal fellowship with the saints brings you into vertical fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then your fellowship with the Lord brings you into horizontal fellowship with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, these two aspects are always interwoven, that is, they are always crisscrossing each other.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we have the proper view of the divine fellowship with its two aspects, we will thank the Lord that we have the opportunity to fellowship with other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every day as we fellowship with the Lord, we are ushered into fellowship with other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The more we have this kind of fellowship, the more we will sing and praise the Lord together.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is not much singing and praising among us because we are short of the divine fellowship.</S>
