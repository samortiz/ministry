   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENJOYING THE OUTPOURED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we need to consider Acts 2:17-21, which is a quotation from the book of Joel This portion of the Word begins by saying that God will pour out of His Spirit upon all flesh v. 17 . Then it ends by saying, "And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved" v. 21 . If you put the beginning and the end of this quotation together, you see something marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that God pours out of His Spirit and that we have to call upon the Lord to get this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has poured out already.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Shall we ask Him to give us the outpouring of the Holy Spirit by fasting, by not sleeping, or by weeping with tears?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now what we need to do is to call upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we get the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I present a glass of water to someone, all he has to do is take it and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the same way, we do not need to ask God for the Spirit, because He has already been poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God has presented the Spirit to us already.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has poured out of His Spirit upon all flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now all we need to do is to call on the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible says that God has poured out of His Spirit, not upon all spiritual or religious persons, but upon all flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all are flesh, and the Spirit has been poured out upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The drink has been presented to us, so we do not need to beg for it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We just need to take and drink by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The presentation of the drink is in verse 17; the way to drink is in verse 21.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God says, "I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then He says, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We simply need to call, "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Calling on the Lord in a simple way will water you and even flood you with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the way to take in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>DRINKING THE SPIRIT BY CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Corinthians 12:13 says that we have all been given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that we have been positioned to drink and we are in a position to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God has accomplished everything, but God can never drink for us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Regardless of how much God loves you, you still have to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The way to drink is in verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse says that when you say, "Lord Jesus," you are in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, when you say, "Lord Jesus," you are drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be in the Holy Spirit means you are drinking of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may feel you are so sinful, but your sinfulness has been taken care of on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We were kept away by our sins, but our sins have been taken away John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we were brought back to God and have been positioned and made to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may say that you are so weak, but this is why you need to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no excuse or reason for being kept away from drinking the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whatever sin you have committed cannot be bigger than the redemption accomplished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The redemption accomplished by Him on the cross is big enough to cover all your failures.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You have to realize you were positioned to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Forget about your failures, your sins, and your weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The redeeming blood, the prevailing blood of Christ, has taken care of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why we are told that we have been given, or made, to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, slaves or free, we all have been made to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now that we have been positioned to drink, we should drink simply by calling, "Lord Jesus," again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Call on the Lord for fifteen minutes, and see what will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some of the older saints may say, "All of this is good for the young people, but not for me."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But breathing is the same for all ages.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The young ones need the breathing; the old ones also need the breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As an older one, you may need more breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not consider that because you are old, you are qualified to graduate from breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no graduation from breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Calling on the Lord makes you younger.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By calling on the Lord, you enjoy the Lord as your new strength and you mount up with wings like eagles Isa 40:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many people have been Christians for years, and it is easy for them to read and consider the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if you ask them to pray or call on the Lord, you put them on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When a newborn babe is delivered, sometimes the doctor has to spank him to get him to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sometimes we need to be "spanked" so that we will call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One brother did not want to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But one day he was involved in a car accident.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>That was a real spanking.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Right away he began to call, "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you are not breathing, the Lord will give you a "spanking"; then you will right away say, "O Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whenever we have troubles or get sick, we may call on the Lord, but afterwards we may forget.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should build up a habit of calling on the Lord all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do not think that this is a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should be the calling people.</S>
