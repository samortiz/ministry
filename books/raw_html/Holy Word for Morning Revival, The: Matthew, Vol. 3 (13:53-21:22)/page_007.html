<p class="bold">WEEK 11 — DAY 6</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 15:8-9, 11-14, 18-20</h2><p>8 &nbsp;“This people honors Me with their lips, but their <sup>1</sup>heart stays far away from Me;</p> <p>9 &nbsp;But in <sup>1</sup>vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men.”</p><p class="bold">11 &nbsp;It is not that which enters into the mouth that defiles the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this <sup>1</sup>defiles the man.</p><p>12 &nbsp;Then the disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were stumbled when they heard this word?</p><p>13 &nbsp;And He answered and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has <sup>1</sup>not planted shall be rooted up.</p> <p>14 &nbsp;Let them be. They are <sup>1</sup>blind guides of the blind; and if a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.</p><p class="bold">18 &nbsp;But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those defile the man.</p><p class="bold">19 &nbsp;For out of the heart come <sup>1</sup>evil reasonings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies.</p> <p class="bold">20 &nbsp;These are the things which defile the man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile the man.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>8<sup>1</sup> The heavenly ruling of the kingdom requires inward reality, not mere outward practice. Such ruling deals with the real condition of the heart, not with the expression of the lips.</p><p>9<sup>1</sup> This reveals that some worship offered to God may be in vain. The main cause of this is to consider as teachings the commandments of men. We must worship God according to His word, which is the truth.</p><p>11<sup>1</sup> I.e., makes the man common, unclean (Acts 11:8). So in vv. 18 and 20. In the kingdom life, defilement is not an outward matter but an inward matter.</p><p>13<sup>1</sup> This word from the heavenly King indicates that the hypocritical Pharisees had not been planted by the heavenly Father. Because of their rejection of the heavenly King, they were uprooted from the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>14<sup>1</sup> The self-righteous and arrogant religionists thought that they were clear concerning the way to serve God, not realizing that they were blind guides of the blind. Their eyes were veiled by their religion with their traditions; hence, they could not see the reality of God’s economy and thus were not able to enter into the kingdom of the heavens. Their blindness led them to “fall into a pit.”</p><p>19<sup>1</sup> In the kingdom of the heavens, defilement is not related to material things but to moral matters. Material things have nothing to do with the heavenly ruling, but moral matters do. That so many evils issue from our heart proves that we are not under the heavenly ruling.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The problem between the Pharisees and the Lord Jesus and His followers was that the Pharisees cared only for outward tradition, ritual, and practice, for example, the washing of hands. They cared nothing whatever for inward reality. Therefore, the Lord Jesus pointed them to the inward matter of the heart. The Lord seemed to say, “Don’t care for this outward practice of washing of hands. The dirt that needs to be cleansed away is within you.” In the Lord’s recovery today we likewise do not care for outward things; rather, we care for inward reality.…It is an insignificant matter whether our hands are dirty; it is the condition of our inward parts that is important.…If we speak without reality, we are more than pitiful. Tradition is a matter of utterance from the lips without reality in the heart.…Those who follow the traditions are blind guides of the blind. This is true today.…They may claim to know the Bible, but actually they are completely blind and have no light at all.…I feel very sad about all those who are being misled.…They have missed the blessing and enjoyment.
