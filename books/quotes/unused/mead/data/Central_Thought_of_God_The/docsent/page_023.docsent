   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST VERSUS THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The apostle Paul told the Galatians that it was God's pleasure to reveal His Son in him Gal 1:15-16 , and he told them that Christ would be formed in them 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This was because at that time the Galatian believers were very much influenced by the teaching of the law, the teaching to keep the law 3:2, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The law is something from God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is good, holy, divine, righteous, spiritual, and perfect Rom 7:12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the law is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are not bound to the law at all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are simply bound to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ, not the law, is the central thought of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The law is not the center, but Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So the apostle told the Galatians how he used to be under the law, but one day God revealed His Son in him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That was something other than the law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From that time on he could discern the difference between the law and Christ, and he gave up the law and kept Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He told the Galatians that today with us, the Christians, it is not a matter of keeping the law but a matter of living by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He said, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He also said, "I through the law have died to the law" v. 19 . He had nothing to do with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was a dead person to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As far as the law was concerned, he was dead and finished.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was bound to Christ, and it was Christ who lived in him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Strictly speaking, no one is teaching the law today, but you have to realize that many times you yourself are like a teacher of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Perhaps every morning in your prayer you are a good teacher trying your best to teach yourself to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You are the law teacher and the law giver to yourself, and you yourself even become the law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may set up many laws for yourself to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may set up a law to sacrifice for the Lord and a law to be humble, to love others, and to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may have more laws than the Ten Commandments, and you may be a better law giver than Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you realize that you have been very much influenced by trying to do good?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You must forget about trying to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are not bound to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are bound to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Can you forget about doing good?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are still trying to do good, you are a "Galatian."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>CHRIST VERSUS RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only so, but there is also the case of the Hebrew believers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hebrews 1:2 says that God "has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son," indicating that the Son, Christ, is the center, the focus, of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Hebrew believers held on to a sound, fundamental, good, and even genuine religion Judaism, which may even be considered a religion from God and from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, it is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today we are not bound to any kind of religion, not even to Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Inasmuch as Christianity is a religion, we have nothing to do with it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christianity is not Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Often I tell people that there are the words Christ and Christian in the Scriptures, but there is not the word Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christianity is a human-manufactured word, and I do not like to use it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christianity is a dead religion, a religion other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Epistle to the Hebrews there is a big difference between Christ and all the good things of the genuine, fundamental religion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In that religion there were the angels, the apostles such as Moses and Joshua, and the priests, including the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, there were the Scriptures and the temple, including the Holy of Holies, the sacrifices, and the rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the good, sound, fundamental, and genuine things of religion were there, yet all these are not Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Anything that is not Christ Himself is not good for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The building up of the Body of Christ must be something which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to know Christ in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to experience Christ in a real way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ must be everything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is the real Angel from God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is the real Apostle from God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is the real Priest, the High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is the temple and the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not a "New Testament church" but a "Christ church."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today in this country I have learned that many Christians like to use the term "New Testament church."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The first time I heard this term, I said to myself, "What is the New Testament church?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Is this another category of Christianity?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I do not think this is a proper term for us to use.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not say that we are going to have a New Testament church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are not going to have a new movement and form a new church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is something that cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There are enough movements in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There are enough kinds of "churches"; there is no need for us to add another one.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What we need to see is that we must experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Everything must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even the church life must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even the fellowship among us must be Christ, not a religion nor Christianity, but Christ.</S>
