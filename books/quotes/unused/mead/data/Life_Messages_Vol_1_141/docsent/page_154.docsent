   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVE BY ME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The daily walk of a Christian is not a matter of morality or ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the living of this divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me" John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To live because of Him means that He is your life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is within you as your life, and He has to be without as your living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Though He is one Person and you are another, He wants you to be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Human culture, whether western or eastern, has developed a code of ethics to uplift morality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have all been raised under this influence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our natural concept when reading the Bible is to find out how we should behave ethically.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This concept is a frustration to the proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Though the Christian life undoubtedly represents the highest ethics, it is not concerned with ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our morality, humility, love, and kindness are the highest because they are Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In our dictionary there is only one word, Christ, and one footnote, the church!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is Christ who is our love or humility or kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This I say partly from what I have read, but mostly from my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let us come back to the illustration of the cake.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I found out my wife had given away the cake brought for me, years ago I would be annoyed and ready to say some angry words to her.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But within I would be checked, "Who is this who is angry you or Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those angry words about to come out are yours, not Mine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Remember the message you gave last weekend on not living by yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who is chasing after this cake?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Is it Christ or you?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I would feel so ashamed I would not have the boldness to say the Lord's name or to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I could not and would not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I would just go on strike!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After many such experiences, I learned.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now, by His mercy, however many cakes are concealed from me, I can smile and say, "Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because that is what He says, I say it too.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He does not want that much American dessert.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is my life and I am His living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may sing, "Amen the Word of God," but suppose the Lord says, "No more cake for you!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the cakes that come are for your grandchildren."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Will you still say amen?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Saying amen is not what matters; He wants you to be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is what Paul testified of in Galatians 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was no longer Paul that was living, but Christ who lived in him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord said in John 14:19-20, "Because I live, you shall live also.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ and we live together, having only one life and one living.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You need to come to the Word several times daily in order to receive the supply of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not use the Word the way many Christians do when they have a Bible study.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Suppose there is a Bible study class every week, and one week the topic is Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible teacher charges the husbands in accordance with the Scriptures to love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then he charges the wives to submit to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After the class a quarrel develops between a husband and wife, each accusing the other of not fulfilling the exhortations they heard.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such is the effect of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is no life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Bible teacher has made the Bible the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should rather pray when we come to the Word, "Lord, supply me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I come to Your Word to receive nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am not interested in knowledge or instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I care only for Your supply."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not try by yourself to do the things that are taught in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I realize this sounds strange, but I know what I am talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Come to the Word with a sincere heart and an open spirit, to receive the Lord Himself through the Word as your supply.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The best teachings do not come from the black and white pages, but from the real nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The nourishment of life will teach you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>NOT TEACHING, BUT TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This kind of teaching through being nourished transforms you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It seems to be a correction, but actually it is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Word as the life supply metabolically changes you, carrying away the old and replacing it with the new.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This change is organic, not lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>PRACTICING</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To practice living out this life, do not do or say things quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If your spouse gives you a hard time, do not be troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Be steady.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Check with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"Lord, You act in me.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I would not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I am one with You.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You be the One to answer for me."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Do not be pushed into reacting hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you will practice this secret, you will see how different we are from worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They have only their own life, but we have the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This makes us a special people.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We are privileged to have Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Now He wants us to live Him and to have Him as our living.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>That is why I said that we should not try in ourselves to keep the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>That is the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Just be one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Hold the attitude that you are one with the Lord and that He is your life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is the secret of how to take the life revealed in the Gospel of John.</S>
