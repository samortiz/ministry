<p>On the one hand, we need life and the truth for the church, which is our service, our testimony, and our Christian living. On the other hand, our Christian living is not practical without the church. Our living is the church. Without the church there is no living. In the same principle, although testifying for the Lord is an individual matter, if there were only one Christian in the church, there would not be a testimony. Therefore, our testimony is also the church.</p>
<p>Similarly, our service is the church. The life that we have received is not only a holy life; it is a serving life. We cannot be satisfied with only a holy living. We need a serving life in order to be satisfied. Although we may often feel that serving is tiring, if we stopped our service, nothing would satisfy us, and we would be restless. Our physical life needs water; hence, we feel thirsty when we do not drink. Likewise, our spiritual life needs service; otherwise, we will be thirsty. However, a Christian cannot serve by himself. In order to serve, he must be in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Meeting</h2>
<p>The church is our living, our testimony, and also our service. Our living in life and walking according to the truth are for the service of the church. The first item concerning the service of the church is the meetings. We must have meetings, and we must know how to meet. Whether the condition of a locality is good or bad, living or dead, or strong or weak depends on the condition of the meetings. Whether or not the service in a locality can bring in blessing depends on the condition of the meetings. If the meetings in a locality are strong and living, there will be much blessing. Therefore, in order to take care of the service of the church, we must pay attention to our meetings. The various meetings must be strengthened, enriched, refreshed, and enlivened. The responsible brothers must learn how to meet. If the meetings can be carried out in a living, fresh, strong, and rich way, the saints will be strong.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Visitation</h2>
<p>Another item in the service of the church is visitation. When we neglect visitation, the church suffers a great loss. The church can be likened to a family. A family with only adults between the ages of thirty and fifty does not have a promising future, because its members will gradually get older and die. In order for a family to prosper and flourish, its members need to include the elderly, the middle-aged, the young people, and the children. A family with six adults and many children has a promising future.</p>
<p>A family with only adults does not need much care. This is also true of the church. It is not normal for every believer in a locality to be an experienced Christian. The church is a family with older believers and younger believers. A locality with many newly-saved believers needs much visitation and care. This is our responsibility.</p>
<p>In the church, service meetings are of primary importance, followed by visitation. The word <em>visitation</em> implies shepherding and teaching. To shepherd is to give food, and to teach is to impart the truth. The gifts to the Body include shepherds and teachers (Eph. 4:11). We cannot expect every saint to function in this way, but we should at least expect every responsible saint to do the work of shepherding and teaching. This can be likened to the older siblings in a family being able to prepare food for their younger siblings or to help them with their homework.</p>
<p>A church that lacks proper shepherding and teaching cannot be built up. Degraded and deformed Christianity does not care for shepherding and teaching. Catholics rely on priests, and Protestants rely on pastors, but in the Lord&rsquo;s churches every member should function to supply their fellow members. The responsible saints are more experienced and have learned more lessons before the Lord. Hence, they should endeavor to supply the younger saints in the meetings and in private visitations. Such visitation is shepherding and teaching.</p>
<p>The responsible ones should serve mainly by leading the meetings and visiting the saints. The responsible ones should not run the meetings. They should lead the meetings so that the meetings are living and strong. The responsible ones should also have thorough coordination concerning care for the saints. All the saints&mdash;whether they are weak, backsliding, dormant, sick, or unemployed, or have financial needs, family troubles, or marital problems, or have suffered the loss of a family member&mdash;should receive shepherding and care. The responsible ones must have a clear understanding of the human and spiritual needs of every saint in order to provide proper leading and help.</p>
<p>Visiting the saints and thorough fellowship are not merely an ideal; they are practical. If we can care for every brother and sister, there will be many opportunities for them to be active and serve both in the meetings and individually. According to his growth, a brother can be given some responsibility to serve in visiting others. The purpose of our gospel activities is to bring in more new ones who can learn to take care of other believers. This is our family custom. Every saint should have a spiritual living and produce spiritual children. Then the church will gradually spread.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
