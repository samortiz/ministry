<p class="bold">WEEK 7 — DAY 6</p><h2 class="head1">Scripture Reading</h2><p class="bold">Rom. 1:9 &nbsp;For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers.</p><p class="bold">Acts 4:31 &nbsp;And when they had so besought,…they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness.</p><h2 class="head1">Much Prayer Needed</h2><p>For the preaching of the gospel we need much prayer ([Rom.] 1:9). We need to pray for souls and to pray for the gospel. In preaching the gospel, prayer is more needful than any kind of effort. If we are prayerless, we will be fruitless in the gospel preaching.<sup>214</sup></p><p>The Lord Jesus said, “All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out” (John 6:37). According to Acts 2:47, the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved. The first thing that we must do is ask God for people, asking Him to give men to the Lord Jesus and to add them to the church. In order for men to be saved, we need to ask God and implore Him. It is very difficult to deal with man’s heart. It is not easy for us to turn a heart toward the Lord. We must first go to God and pray for these people, asking God to bind the strong man (Luke 11:21-22). Afterwards, we can talk to them at length. We have to present these people one by one to the Lord and pray for them fervently before we can effectively lead them to Christ.<sup>215</sup></p><h2 class="head1">Preaching the Gospel by Speaking the Word</h2><p>Based upon our prayer, we need to speak….In order to speak, however, you need the proper material. In 1980 the Living Stream Ministry published Gospel Outlines, containing two hundred sixty-six outlines for gospel messages. These outlines cover God, man, the fall, Satan, redemption, justification, and many other topics. The outlines are quite detailed. This book will provide you with something to say.<sup>216</sup> [In addition], the booklet we have published entitled The Mystery of Human Life really works. Thousands have been saved through this booklet.<sup>217</sup> You should fill yourself up with all the materials related to the truth of the gospel.</p><p>There are many gospel truths in the Bible. The apostle Paul had a great deal to speak because the Old Testament was a rich source of light and truth to him. You have to learn the truth as Paul did. When you are equipped with the truth, you will be like a doctor who has a dispensary full of medicine. When you contact a young person, you will know what medicine he needs. The medicine is the word of the truth. However, do not wait until you know everything. Start speaking right away. There is a principle in the Bible that the more you speak, the more light you will receive.</p><p>Before we speak, however, we have to pray. We must fulfill our priestly service by praying to bring people to the Lord. We should put them on our breast and shoulders (Exo. 28:29-30), bearing them in love and in power into the presence of the Lord. After we pray in this manner, we will be authorized and filled with the word. The word is our authority to go to the people as kings. We are both priests and kings (1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 1:6).…Firstly, we bring sinners to the Lord, and then we bring the Lord to sinners. When we go to the Lord with sinners by praying, we are priests. When we come to sinners with the Lord by preaching, we are the kings.</p><p>If you do not pray and speak the holy word from the Bible, your speaking will not have any weight.…Weighty speaking comes only from prayer and the use of the holy Word. You must be filled with prayer and the Word. Then you will be saturated with the Word. Eventually you will be the embodiment of the Word. Our being needs to be constituted and composed with the Word. The Word should be in every fiber of our being….The Word is the Spirit and the Word is life (John 6:63). Only the Spirit and life are powerful.<sup>218</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
