   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS GRACE AND POWER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 8 and 9 say, Concerning this I entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from me.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sufferings and trials are often the Lord s ordination for us, that we may experience Christ as grace and power.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, the Lord would not remove the thorn from the apostle as he entreated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul might have prayed like this: O Lord, take away the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Get rid of this messenger of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am suffering, and I cannot bear this thorn any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord answered Paul s prayer, but not according to Paul s way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Likewise, the Lord will answer our prayer, but He may not answer it according to our way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord seemed to say to Paul, No, I shall not remove the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This thorn is being used by Me to keep you down.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I realize that you are suffering, and I shall give you the grace you need.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul, My grace is sufficient for you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Don t ask Me to take away the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I were to take it away, I would have to take away the visions and the revelations, and I would have no way to do that except by taking you away.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul, if you do not have this thorn, you may be too proud and lifted up too high.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I cannot allow that to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The best way to keep you down is to leave this thorn with you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But I shall grace you and support you so that you may be able to bear this suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Also, in your experience, My grace will become power made perfect in weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The thorn exposes your weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without it, you would not realize how weak you are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now you need Me to be your grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In your experience, your enjoyment, My grace will become power tabernacling over you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The grace experienced by Paul was actually the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I believe that in his experience Paul realized that the Lord s grace became power spread over him like a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, this grace-power became a dwelling place for Paul in his sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As he was suffering, Paul could dwell in the tabernacle spread over him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This tabernacle, this tent, sustained him, supported him, maintained him, and kept him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To magnify the sufficiency of the Lord s grace, our sufferings are required.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To show forth the perfectness of the Lord s power, our weakness is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, the apostle would most gladly boast in his weaknesses, that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Grace is the supply, and the power is the strength, the ability, of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both are the resurrected Christ, who is now the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us 1 Cor 15:45; Gal 2:20 for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Greek word translated tabernacle in verse 9 is episkenoo, a compound verb composed of epi and skenoo.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Skenoo, meaning to dwell in a tent, is used in John 1:14 and Revelation 21:3.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Episkenoo here means to fix a tent or a habitation upon.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It portrays how the power of Christ, even Christ Himself, dwells upon us as a tent spread over us, overshadowing us in our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 10 Paul concludes, Wherefore I am well pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions, and distresses, on behalf of Christ; for whenever I am weak, then I am powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Greek word rendered well pleased also means well content, as in Matthew 3:17.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Insults are mistreatments, and necessities are constraints, urgent needs that press much.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Literally, the Greek word for distresses means narrowness of room; hence straits, difficulties, distresses.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the end of this verse Paul speaks of being weak and also of being powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was weak in his old being, but he was powerful in the overshadowing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE LORD S COOKING</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What we have in these verses is the Lord s cooking of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord cooked Paul and made him a delicious dish for us all to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For more than fifty years, I have been enjoying the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But I must testify that I have never enjoyed Paul as much as I have recently.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He certainly is a delicious feast cooked by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes in preparing Chinese food, the food is first put into the fire and then in cold water.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It seems that this process of cooking results in the best taste.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This illustrates how the Lord dealt with Paul, how the Lord cooked him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First the Lord uplifted Paul to the third heaven, then He carried him away to Hades, and following that He allowed a thorn to come to him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If I had been Paul, I probably would have wondered what was happening to me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I surely would have told the Lord that I was not able to bear the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But as we have pointed out, the Lord s sufficient grace was supplied to Paul, and this grace became power tabernacling over him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>BECOMING RICH IN THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As Paul considered the high visions and marvelous revelations, the thorn worked on him to keep him from being proud and lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But as the thorn worked to keep Paul low, grace supplied and sustained him, and power overshadowed him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This was the Lord s wonderful way of cooking Paul to cause him to experience the all-extensive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As a result, Paul was rich in the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Judaizers certainly could not compare with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How foolish the Corinthians had been to be distracted by them!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Judaizers had no revelation or vision.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Likewise, they did not have the thorn, the grace, or the power tabernacling over them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They were utterly devoid of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Paul, on the contrary, had seen visions and received revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Furthermore, he had been dealt with by the Lord through the thorn in order to experience Him as grace and as power in a very practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, Paul was a man full of vision, suffering, experience, and enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord became grace to him and also the power spreading over him like a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What the Apostle Paul experienced is very much lacking among today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many believers are natural and traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Like the Judaizers, they have an old, traditional religion, a Bible in dead letters, and many rituals and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In principle, they are the same as the Judaizers, even in the matter of preaching a Jesus who is not altogether genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>With them there is no vision, no revelation, no thorn, and no grace.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They interpret the Bible in a natural way, and they follow traditions and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>With them there is no power tabernacling over them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What a contrast between the experience of Paul and today s Judaizers!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Do not be disappointed if a thorn comes to you after you receive a revelation from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Visions and revelations are always followed by sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is not necessary for you to pray much concerning the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The thorn will not be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Instead, the Lord will allow it to remain for the purpose of bringing in grace for your enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This grace will then become your daily strength and even your dwelling place, a tabernacle overshadowing you.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This will enrich your spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When we enjoy the Lord s grace and dwell under the overshadowing of His power, we shall always have something to say regarding Christ and the church.</S>
