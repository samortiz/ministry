	 <h2 class="head1">BLESSING AS THE ISSUE OF MERCY AND GRACE</h2>
<p>Blessing is the issue of mercy and grace. David had a son who built the holy temple. That was God&rsquo;s blessing. David obtained the land that was the site for God&rsquo;s temple. That was also God&rsquo;s blessing. Eventually, the holy temple was built under the oversight of David&rsquo;s house. That was also God&rsquo;s blessing. Let us look at another example. After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, Peter went back to his former profession. He went fishing with some of the disciples. They labored the whole night but caught nothing. As soon as the morning broke, however, they listened to the Lord&rsquo;s word, cast their net, and hauled in a hundred and fifty-three fish. That was God&rsquo;s blessing (John 21:3-11). If God does not bless, all human labor on earth is in vain; after a whole night of labor not one fish will be gained.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a big gospel meeting coming up, and we all know that we should pray and be prepared. However, we should believe in and depend on God&rsquo;s blessing more than our prayer and preparation. We should not trust in our prayer or our preparation. We should trust in God. Blessing is the issue of God&rsquo;s mercy and His grace. It is the issue of God reaching us. We should never think that we are able to do anything, that we have methods, are perfect, or have a good character. Such thoughts do not allow us to know mercy or grace, and they do not allow us to know God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>God wants to work what He is into us. If our condition is normal, what reaches us is grace. If our condition is abnormal, God will still visit us. However, instead of reaching us as grace, He will be mercy to us. Whether He reaches us as grace or mercy, the issue is blessing. Blessing is not the result of our effort. Blessing is the result of God&rsquo;s mercy and grace reaching us. For example, we may labor in a place for a while without perfecting one saint to be an elder, but if we have God&rsquo;s grace, a group of elders will be raised up. This would be a work that God has accomplished, and it will be His blessing.</p>
<p>Theology is taught in seminaries with the expectation that spiritual people will be produced and cultivated. However, it seems that there is not much result. It is God&rsquo;s blessing for us to be able to perfect some spiritual ones after meeting and serving in a place. Blessing is the issue of mercy and grace. The more we live before God and follow Him, the more we will know mercy, grace, and blessing and will realize that what we have is worthless before God. However, if we are too strong and prevent the grace of God from being manifested through us, at the necessary time God will allow us to be broken. Either He will break our ability and intelligence, or He will break our morality and our will. We may need to fall into a miserable situation so that God can give us mercy. This mercy will bring in a result&mdash;the blessing of God. The blessing will produce Solomon, and it will also gain the threshing floor of Ornan&mdash;the site for the building of the holy temple, God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<p>Blessing as the result of mercy and grace ultimately becomes God&rsquo;s dwelling place. The building up of the church is God&rsquo;s blessing. It is the result of our knowing mercy and grace. The building up of the church is not the issue of our effort. Our effort can bring in only temporary prosperity that does not last; rather, it will either pass away or be broken by God. Furthermore, our effort will cause God to raise up an environment to do a breaking work on us. He will break our strength so that the grace of God can be manifested in us according to His mercy. The result of this breaking will bring in God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
