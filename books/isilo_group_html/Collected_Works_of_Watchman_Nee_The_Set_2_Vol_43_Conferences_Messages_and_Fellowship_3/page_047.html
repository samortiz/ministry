Today we want to see why God gives us Christ. Paul said, "Christ our life," and, "For to me, to live is Christ" (Col. 3:4; Phil. 1:21a). But we have to admit that the way we live does not reflect the fact that Christ is our life. We fail, we are weak, and we glorify ourselves. We are short of love, and we make demands on others. We do not love the brothers, and we are not like Christ. We find it hard to speak like the Lamb. Our thoughts are filthy and unholy, and we are defeated by many sins. Christ has died for us and risen to be our life. But in our daily life we do not have the experience of Christ living within us. Although we have the life of Christ, we do not live it out. We are not very different from the worldly people, and we have not grown very much. When we look at ourselves, all of our sins are still with us.</p><p>Many Christians are like this. They do not know how Christ can be their life. Some seek to control their temper, hoping that they can become patient, and some seek for victory. But in spite of their pursuits, their prayer before the Lord, their confession, their prayer for grace, and their aspirations for a holy life of humility, gentleness, and brotherly love, their stubbornness remains and their nature is unchanged. Although they pray much, it seems as if God has never heard their prayer. They do not know what they should do before the Lord. Therefore, we want to consider what it means for Christ to be our life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BE HUNGRY<br />IN ONE'S PURSUIT FOR VICTORY</h2><p>I have mentioned previously that a dissatisfied person will not receive anything. Only a hungry person will receive something. Friends, do not confuse dissatisfaction with hunger. Many people are not satisfied with their daily life, but they do not have a positive desire to pursue before the Lord. They have not had any dealings with the Lord and have never wrestled with the Lord. Hence, a dissatisfied person is not necessarily a hungry person. Let me say a strong word: Although you may be dissatisfied, you may not be experiencing the overcoming life at all. Only a hungry person can receive something. Those who are not hungry may understand what I am saying, but they will still not overcome. I have never seen a person who is not hungry overcome. A person may understand the doctrine of victory, but just being dissatisfied will not make one victorious.</p><p>Only seeking ones will experience Christ as their life. Those who think that they can pick up the overcoming life capriciously are cherishing a vain hope. You can pick up any item off the street, but victory is not something that can be picked up mindlessly. Victory does not come by chance. Only the hungry and seeking ones find it. If only three or five persons attending this conference find it, I will be very thankful to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST OVERCOMING FOR US</h2><p>The overcoming life is just Christ Himself. God has given us Christ so that we will not only live by Him but that He would also become our life and live within us on our behalf. God has given us Christ. His intention is not just for Him to live within us but for Him to live for us within. He has already died for us on the cross. Today He wants to live for us within us. This is not a matter of overcoming through trusting in Christ. Nor is it a matter of Christ empowering us to overcome. This is not even a matter of Him helping us to overcome. It is a matter of us stepping aside and Christ becoming our victory within us.</p><p>Let me repeat: This is not a matter of Christ empowering us to overcome, nor is it a matter of Christ upholding us to overcome. Rather, it is Christ overcoming on our behalf, just as He died on the cross on our behalf. Christ died on the cross for us; we did not do anything. He is living for us in the same way. We do not have to put forth any effort of our own. For God to give us Christ as our life means that He has put Christ within us and has caused Him to live for us. Our old man has died, and Christ is living for us within us. This is fully a matter of substitution. If it is not a substitution, it is not the gospel. Without the cross, there is no victory.</p><p>Today we are not asking the Lord to empower us to be patient. Rather, the Lord within us is becoming our patience. We may be stubborn, proud, critical of others, lacking in love, or filled with unclean thoughts. We should not ask the Lord to empower us to overcome these things. Rather, the Lord within us is becoming our purity, meekness, and humility for us. Everything is in the principle of substitution. If we do not see the matter of substitution, there will never be any victory. A man can be conscious of his mistakes before God, but this does not mean that he will overcome. We may ask God to help us overcome, but we will never overcome. God does not help men overcome. He knows that we will only fail. He crucified our old man on the cross and gave Christ to us to be our true bread so that He would live for us within. This is the gospel, this is God's way of salvation, and this is victory.</p><p>Christ is our victory. Many people think that Christ helps them overcome or that Christ empowers them to overcome. But this is not the way. We are so weak that we cannot even stand up by ourselves. We are incurable. Overcoming is altogether a matter of Christ living for us within us. This is God's way of salvation.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 43: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (3) &nbsp; pg 47</div><br></body></html>
