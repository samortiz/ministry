<h2 class="head2">B. God Glorifies Us That<br />We May Arrive at the Consummation<br />of the Experience of His Organic Salvation</h2><p>God glorifies us that we may arrive at the consummation of the possession of His divine image. Furthermore, He glorifies us that we may not only be built up, established, shaped, and solidified in the experience of God&rsquo;s organic salvation, but also arrive at the consummation of such experience.</p><h2 class="head3">1. God&rsquo;s Glorifying Work in Us<br />Begins with Regeneration</h2><p>In God&rsquo;s organic salvation His glorifying work in us begins with His regenerating us with His life of glory.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Then, through His Work of Renewing, Sanctification, Transformation, and Conformation,<br />His Glorifying Work in Us Reaches Its Consummation</h2><p>After regenerating us, God continues, step by step, with His work of renewing, sanctification, transformation, and conformation to transfuse us with Himself as glory until the glory of His life saturates our being and is manifested in our body; thus His work of glorification in us reaches its consummation.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Our Glorification Is the Top Portion<br />of Our Divine Sonship</h2><p>Our glorification is the top portion of our divine sonship in God&rsquo;s organic salvation (Gal. 4:5; Rom. 8:23). God&rsquo;s economy is that we may become sons of God to inherit all His riches. The day is coming when our body will be redeemed and we will enter into the top and full enjoyment of the divine sonship.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Consummation of God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation<br />Is the New Jerusalem&mdash;<br />the Universal Incorporation of the Union and Mingling of Divinity with Humanity</h2><p>The consummation of God&rsquo;s organic salvation is the New Jerusalem&mdash;the universal incorporation of the union and mingling of divinity with humanity&mdash;the processed and consummated Triune God incorporated with His regenerated, renewed, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite elect.</p><p>Dear brothers and sisters, our future is the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. We are not here miserably longing for His return so that our afflictions may be over quickly and we may be released from the bondage of slavery. Rather, we are awaiting the Lord&rsquo;s coming back by daily experiencing His organic salvation. We are waiting not by sitting passively but by being saved actively day by day. We cannot remain in the stage of regeneration; rather, we must cooperate with the Lord for Him to renew, sanctify, transform, conform, and glorify us so that God&rsquo;s organic salvation may be accomplished in us for the fulfillment of His eternal economy.</p>
