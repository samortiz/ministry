I believe that the desperate need today is to testify of the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. Our hope is that God's children will fully overcome sin, the world, and the devil in this age through applying the accomplishment of Christ's death and resurrection, to the extent that we all can testify that our Lord is indeed living and resurrected. A defeated life has no testimony, no matter how much truth the mind has received. For this reason (and actually, for more than this, that is, for the glory of God) we send out this issue of our magazine. Our attitude, however, is not one of preaching from a high position to those below. No! We are preaching to ourselves as well. In fact we are first preaching to ourselves. It is for our mutual exhortation that we have written these pages. We are not saying that we have already obtained or that we are already perfect. We are still pursuing with thousands of other children of God and are pressing together toward the mark. Whatever our personal achievements may be, we believe that the following pages contain the truths, and not only so, but truths that our hearts treasure. I hope that my readers will read this issue of the magazine with prayer and that they will truly gain what it says.</P><P>I will also take this opportunity to say a few words concerning myself. This letter is written in Kuling, Kiangsi. Through the love of a Western missionary in Nanking, I was able to secure a quiet and cool house here. The year before last, she was willing to let me use this house, and this year she allowed me to use it again. I am so thankful for this. Because of my psychological and physical needs, I cannot live in the low plains during the summer. It is also necessary for me to spend some time every year quietly before the Lord to learn to pray and receive revelations. I thank many of God's children as well as my co-workers for caring for me and tending to my needs in such a special way so that I have no lack here. I know that in the summer, many readers will want to come up to the mountain. I hope that they will come and visit me. The best time is from ten o'clock in the morning until twelve noon. At other times I am occupied by other affairs. My room number is 103.</P><P>As far as other matters about myself are concerned, I believe that my friends' advice, my work schedule, and my health have all caused me to consider some changes. After long periods of prayer and consideration, I feel that I am beginning to be somewhat clear. But I still do not know about God's actual arrangement for my future.</P><P>I have a deep feeling that God's children do not have a living experience of Christ. This is why they are not willing to spend and be spent for the sinners. The Lord Jesus is coming soon, and there is the urgent need to proclaim God's testimony concerning His Son. My dear ones, consider what lowly worms we are. Yet God, the Creator, has called us to participate in the rejection of His Son. What a wonder this is! How few are such opportunities, and how short the time! It is hard to say if today is the last day. Who can say that the Lord will not receive His children back to His home? For this reason, we need to seek after His lost sheep in an unprecedented way. God has only one Son, and He was a preacher! Should we not be the same?</P><P>As for those who possess wealth in this world, I exhort you to offer generously to the Lord. I feel most sorry that many rich ones who ought to offer hundreds of dollars are only offering a few dollars and a few dimes! The poor ones offer more than the rich! Yet God's work is suffering, while the rich ones' silver and gold are corroding! God's workers are lacking, and the bottoms of their wallets are often empty. Yet the rich ones are still gathering money for needs that will never come! We know that we will be judged for how we use our money as well as how we do not use our money. Of course, I am not advising you to offer it to unprofitable works, because many workers are no longer God's workers, and many works are no longer God's works. What I am saying is that we should care for those who are genuinely going out "on behalf of the Name..., taking nothing from the Gentiles"-those who live by the Lord. According to my knowledge, there are at least a few dozen people in China now who are of this kind. How great are their needs! Yet the rich believers have not cared for them.</P><P>The next issue will follow immediately after this issue. We pray that the Lord will bless it! Brothers, I most earnestly need your prayers. Please pray for me in faith continually. Peace be to you!</P><P>The servant of Christ,<br>Watchman Nee<br>June 17, 1930</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 08: The Present Testimony (1) &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
