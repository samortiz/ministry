in Their Homes</h2>
<p>In practice, if the saints open their homes for the gospel, they should invite people with the same occupation. There is no need to invite people from other occupations. This is the way we should take if we want to preach the gospel to working people. For example, we can fellowship with a sister who is a nurse to see whether it is suitable for her to open her home. If it is suitable, she can open her home and invite her friends in the nursing occupation to hear the gospel. We should also ask the sister to preach the gospel. There are many advantages to taking this way. Suppose a brother who is a doctor and who does not usually preach the gospel receives the leading of the church and invites his colleagues to his home. His colleagues would be shocked, and their interest would be stirred up when they hear him singing gospel songs and explaining verses from the Bible to them. However, if a full-time brother gives the message, he might display an air of preaching, which would not be interesting to the doctors.</p>
<p>The two kinds of Chinese boxing are an example. One is called fancy boxing, which is mainly for show and cannot inflict any harm. The other is solid boxing which has the ability to kill. We cannot do the Lord&rsquo;s work as if we are merely doing fancy boxing to dazzle the eye but not devastate. We should work as if we are doing solid boxing and hit the target with every blow. This is the burden that the brothers who take the lead to promote the work must receive. This burden will bring results, no matter how heavy it may seem. If we can have thorough fellowship with the working saints in the twenty-one halls in the church in Taipei so that they open their homes to preach the gospel to their colleagues at work, the church will flourish, prosper, and bear new fruit every month. Moreover, this kind of fruit often comes in clusters, like grapes.</p>
<p>Not only should we preach the gospel in the medical field in this way, but we should do the same with the policemen. If a brother, who is a policeman, is willing to open his home for the gospel, he can invite his fellow police officers to his home and preach the gospel to them. We do not have to go to the police station to preach the gospel. Similarly, there is no need to go to the courthouse to preach the gospel to those in the legal field. We first need to pray and ask the Lord to give us a brother who works as a judge and is burdened to invite his colleagues to his home for the gospel. In this way the door to the legal field will be opened. The most effective way is to encourage the working saints to open their homes and to invite their colleagues to hear the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Full-timers and Part-timers<br />
over the Age of Thirty<br />
Being Assigned to the Community Gospel</h2>
<p>There are many brothers and sisters who have consecrated themselves to be full time, and about two-fifths of them are over thirty years old. There are also saints who are over seventy and are retired, and their children are either overseas or married with their own families. The best bargain for these older saints is for them to consecrate themselves to serve the Lord full time. There are still other saints who are willing to serve the Lord part time. We decided that all the full-timers and part-timers who are over thirty years old will be assigned to the community gospel. This is about two hundred serving ones. However, not all of them will go to the homes of the working saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel in Apartment Buildings</h2>
<p>Here are some suggestions for preaching the gospel in apartment buildings. There may be an older sister who lives in an apartment building and is burdened to serve full time. She should first care for the people living in her building. She should not advertise what she is doing, because this will close people. She can discreetly find out who lives in each apartment, their occupation, whether they are young or old, and their schedules. She should be clear concerning these matters.</p>
<p>Then once a week she can distribute gospel tracts to every home, giving a different tract each week. This is the principle. In the beginning, we should not knock on our neighbors&rsquo; doors but rather place a tract in their mailboxes. One of our neighbors might be an older lady who stays at home to look after children. After two or three weeks of distributing tracts, we can find a morning suitable to knock on her door and visit her. When the older lady opens the door, we can gracefully and politely inquire if she has seen the tracts that were in her mailbox. We should be as bold and thick-skinned as a salesman but also polite and keen. After talking with her for a while, we can ask to enter into the home and chat with her. We can use this simple method in every apartment building in Taiwan. After we cover the building we live in, we can go on to the next building. If we would continue in this way for one or two years, all the people in the apartment buildings will know that we love Jesus. They will like us as their neighbor, and they will welcome us if we visit them again. Most of the older sisters can consecrate their time to preach the gospel in this way if they are retired and do not have grandchildren to care for.</p>
<p>This is not impossible. If three thousand can take this way, it will reap a significant result. The way for increase is through the gospel in the community, and the gospel in schools and homes, and the children&rsquo;s work. Most Christian groups that are successful in the gospel take this way, and this way is most suitable for older sisters. Today everyone is afraid of being robbed, but old ladies do not look like robbers, nor do they act like robbers. They are harmless and do not arouse fear in people. If the older sisters are willing to take this way, their neighbors will know the gospel after six months to one year. Not only so, if some other brothers and sisters, who live in the same area as an older sister does, also practice this, the gospel will be spread in a short while.</p>
<p>The older sisters can also participate in distributing tracts, booklets, Bibles, audiotapes, and videotapes. These can be distributed gradually over time. Our main burden is for the leading ones to encourage the working saints to open their homes and invite their fellow workers to hear the gospel. At the same time, the leading ones should teach the saints how to preach the gospel. Furthermore, the full-timers and part-timers over thirty years of age should participate in the community gospel by visiting families and distributing gospel tracts.</p>
<p>We need to encourage all the working saints to open their homes. This includes not only those working in the medical field, in education, in commerce, on the police force, and in the legal field but also those in politics. There are some saints who hold high positions in the government. We need to pray and ask the Lord to touch these saints to also open their homes and invite their colleagues to hear the gospel. We should also encourage the saints who are school principals to open their homes and invite people in the educational field, such as other principals or well-known people in the academic fields, to hear the gospel. For the community gospel all the saints scattered in various occupations should open their homes and invite their colleagues to hear the gospel. This approach is very profitable. If the church in Taipei is able to break through in this matter, it will cause the rest of the island to rise up.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
