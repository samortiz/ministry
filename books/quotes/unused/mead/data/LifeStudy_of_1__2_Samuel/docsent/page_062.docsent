   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SAUL'S ENVY OF DAVID</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 18:6-9 we see Saul's envy of David.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. David's Return from Striking the Philistines</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Saul became envious of David after David's return from striking the Philistines v. 6a .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>B. The Women's Welcome and Praise</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As David returned from striking the Philistines, the women came out of all the towns of Israel to meet Saul and they said, "Saul has stricken down his thousands;/But David, his ten thousands" v. 7 . When Saul heard this praise, he was displeased and said, "They ascribe ten thousands to David, but to me they ascribe only thousands.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And what more can he have except the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So Saul eyed David from that day on" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Saul was angry and was envious of David.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are many "Sauls" in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may become envious when others are approved and we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, suppose you share in a meeting and hardly anyone says amen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then someone else shares, and he receives many amens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may say to yourself, "Why were so many amens spoken to him and so few to me?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you say this, you are today's Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us take as another illustration of the Sauls in the church life the matter of appointing elders.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In appointing elders we must be fair and pure, and we must not be political.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose that in a particular church five brothers are taking the lead, but thus far no one has been officially appointed to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, only three of these brothers are appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The other two are very good brothers, but they do not have the capacity to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These two may be stumbled and wonder why the other three were appointed to be elders and they were not.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These two brothers might say, "The five of us have been laboring together to take care of the church, but we two have been set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why were the others appointed to be elders and we were not?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These brothers need to receive grace in order to put their flesh on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Otherwise, they may become cold to the church and withdraw, no longer continuing faithfully in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The hardships in the church life are related to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the flesh in the church life needs to be diminished.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Galatians 5:17 says, "The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the whole universe there is only one war the war between man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The man warring against God is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The flesh wars against God as the Spirit, and God who is the Spirit is warring against our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our flesh is the real enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, Galatians 5 not only speaks of this war but also says, "They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts" v. 24 . Christ has crucified the flesh, and now we must apply this to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>David was very different from Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>David knew only to behave and to have his being according to God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He had no feeling for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, he knew only to labor and conduct himself for God's people and God's kingdom.</S>
