   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s purpose was made according to His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 1:9 says God purposed His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that according to what He desired, He made a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since God had such a good pleasure, He made a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Ephesians 3:11 Paul tells us again that God made a plan in Christ, a plan of the ages, an eternal plan, an eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>HIS ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Economy is an anglicized word from the Greek oikonomia.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It means the law of a household, or household administration.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1 Timothy 1:4 this word is used for arrangement, plan, administration, or management.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament Pharaoh s house was in need of some household management or arrangement, and Joseph was put into a position to take care of that management.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What he did was mainly to distribute the rich food to the hungry Gen 41:33-41, 54-57 , and that distribution was a dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The management of Pharaoh s house was an economy carried out to dispense the riches to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the New Testament this word is mainly used by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the same word is used by the Lord Jesus in Luke 16:2-4, referring to the stewardship of a steward.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Joseph might be considered as Pharaoh s steward, and his responsibility as his stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That duty, his stewardship, was to dispense the rich food that Pharaoh possessed to feed the starving.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His Dispensation</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Ephesians Paul tells us that he was appointed by God as a steward, and that with this God gave him the responsibility, the duty, that is called the stewardship 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Greek word for stewardship is the same as the word for dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether it is translated into stewardship or into dispensation depends upon the context.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Ephesians 3:2 Paul says God gave him the stewardship of the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then the same Greek word, oikonomia, is found in 1:10 and 3:9, where it seems better to translate it as dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This word economy mainly denotes a plan, an administration, a management, to dispense one s riches to others.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Ephesians 3:8 he says that God appointed him to preach, to minister, to distribute, or to dispense the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These riches are in God s household.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is a store of the unsearchable riches of Christ, and God appointed the apostles Peter, John, James, and Paul to be stewards to dispense these riches to all God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Stewardship is the same as dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Joseph carried out his stewardship by dispensing food.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His responsibility, his office, his duty, was to distribute the rich food to the needy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That distribution was a dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some Bible teachers have taught that there are seven dispensations in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Old Testament there are the dispensations of innocence, conscience, human government, promise, and law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then in the New Testament there is the dispensation of grace in this age and the dispensation of the kingdom in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In these seven dispensations, they say, God deals with man in seven different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This may be correct, but do not forget that the dispensations are God s household administration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has a great family, and within this household He needs some administration, some plan, some management, for dispensing Himself into His household.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God s main thought, even from eternity past, was to have an arrangement throughout the ages to dispense Himself into His chosen and predestinated people.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Paul s fourteen Epistles we can see that God had a good pleasure, according to which He made a plan, a purpose.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is God s plan, and this is God s dispensation for His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In English the words dispensation and dispensing are both forms of the verb to dispense.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I use the word dispensation, I mean economy, arrangement, or management.</S>
