<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Twelve</H2><P>Twelve is an eternal number. Seven is the dispensational completion or temporal completion; only twelve is the eternal perfection. Seven is four plus three, the creature (man) joined to the Creator (God). Twelve is four times three, the creature (man) mingled with the Creator (God). Seven represents man and God joined together. Twelve signifies that God bestows grace on man and receives him so that the creature is mingled in with the Creator. Therefore, seven represents dispensational perfection, and twelve represents eternal perfection. The former indicates the contact between the creature and the Creator. Although it is complete, it is temporary. The latter indicates the mingling of the creature with the Creator. It is not only complete but eternal. We ought to know that both seven and twelve are derived from the numbers four and three. Whereas seven is the sum of these two numbers, twelve is the product of these two numbers. Addition means that two numbers are parallel; they are put together. Multiplication means that they are mingled together into one. The meaning of multiplication is deeper than addition. Therefore, one is eternal, and the other is temporal. When the creature and the Creator are put together, there is completion, but there is still the distinction between the eternal and the temporal. Here we can see the importance of mingling with God.</P><P>There are twelve months to a year. There were twelve tribes of Israel. There were twelve precious stones on the breastplate of the high priest (Exo. 28:21). There were twelve loaves of showbread on the golden table (Lev. 24:5-6). There were twelve springs at Elim (Exo. 15:27). There were twelve men that were sent to spy out the land (Num. 13). Joshua put twelve stones into the Jordan River (Josh. 4:9). Elijah took twelve stones and built an altar (1 Kings 18:31-32). Solomon used twelve brass oxen upon which the molten sea was set (1 Kings 7:25). The Lord Jesus went to Jerusalem when He was twelve years old (Luke 2:42). He chose twelve apostles and promised that they would sit upon twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel (Matt. 19:28). He healed a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years (Luke 8:43-44). He raised Jairus' daughter who was twelve years old (Luke 8:42). He took five loaves and two fishes to feed the multitude of five thousand, and the fragments that remained were twelve baskets full (Matt. 14:20). He had the power to pray to the Father who would present twelve legions of angels to save Him (Matt. 26:53).</P><P>In Revelation, we can see that the number twelve is used more than in any other book. The woman has a crown with twelve stars on her head (Rev. 12:1). The New Jerusalem has twelve gates of twelve pearls (Rev. 21:21). There are twelve angels at the gates (v. 12), and the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel are written thereon (v. 12). The wall of the city has twelve foundations and on them are the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (v. 14). The tree of life bears twelve kinds of fruit (22:2). There is one thing that deserves our attention: in the eternal kingdom of the new heaven and new earth, all the numbers are twelve; there is no seven. The first part of Revelation uses the number seven many times when it speaks of the situation of the temporary age. In the eternal kingdom, twelve is used. This proves even further that seven is the temporal perfection and twelve is the eternal perfection.</P><P>In the Bible there are many other significant numbers, but according to our need today, these numbers are enough. When we review the meanings of the relationships between these numbers, we will see more wonderful things. In the Bible, one to seven is a cycle of numbers. If we look carefully we will see that their sequence is also meaningful. All the other numbers in the Bible are derived from the multiplication and addition of these seven numbers. In the Bible these seven numbers are the base of all numbers. Before we continue we should see one thing, that is, although all the numbers have their own meaning, their denotation can be either good or bad. If the number is to refer to God, it is good; if it is to refer to man, it is bad.</P><P>Numbers one, two, and three represent God's completionâ€”the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. God ought to be before all the numbers. God ought to have the first place in all things, otherwise, we will see failure.</P><P>Four is the symbol of the creatures. In the Bible, four is composed of three and one. Four is the first number after three. Three represents God. Four represents what comes out from God, that is, every created being. Therefore, four is the number of the creature. Here we see the relationship between the creature and the Creator: the creature comes out of the Creator. It is pitiful that men do not know this. Besides the creature and the Creator, there is nothing else in the universe; therefore, three plus four is a complete number; all the other numbers are based on this.</P><P>Five, six, and seven are based on four. One, two, and three are the first three of the seven numbers; they represent the greatness of the Creator. Four is the middle number of seven, and it represents the creature. Five, six, and seven are the last three of the seven numbers; they represent the condition of the creature. Five is four plus one, six is four plus two, and seven is four plus three. God's number is only three. Man's number is only four. The relationship between God's number and man's number goes only to seven (four plus three). Therefore, seven is a complete number.</P><P>Five is four plus one which indicates that the creature (four) is the antithesis of the Creator (one). In another sense, five is four plus one, meaning that the creature is before the Creator. Hence, it has the meaning of responsibility. Although the Creator is merciful, that does not mean that man's responsibility is annulled. Therefore, all the numbers that have five in them such as ten, forty, etc., denote responsibility.</P><P>Six is four plus two. It indicates how the creatures (four) are in want and always disputing (two). It also indicates how they (four) receive help and deliverance (two). Hence, six indicates the real situation of fallen man.</P><P>Seven is four plus three. It indicates the creatures (four) being well accepted by the Creator (three). Seven is a complete number. When we read the numbers that God shows us in the Bible, we have to praise Him for His wisdom and admire His wonderful teaching and thoughts. After we know the overall meaning of the numbers, whenever we read Revelation, we will see new meanings in connection with the numbers in the book.</P>
