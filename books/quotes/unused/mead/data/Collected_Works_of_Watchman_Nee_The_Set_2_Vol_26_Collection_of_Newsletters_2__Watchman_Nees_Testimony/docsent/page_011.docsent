   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Jan Ch'i Yu's Answering Letter</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I received your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I thank you very much for your kindness, but there are a few things that I must explain:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 What is the little flock?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Please read Luke 12:32.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It says, "Do not be afraid, little flock, because your Father has been well pleased to give you the kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Can you oppose this little flock?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The term "little flock" refers to all the saved ones who believe in the Lord's name at all times and places.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you oppose the little flock, you are opposing yourself and myself unless we are not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We who meet in the meeting place at 321 East Street Road are not called the little flock.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are called "The meeting place of those who meet in the Lord's name in Hangchow."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Outsiders call us "The Little Flock" because the hymnal we use is called Little Flock Hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This really is not our name, because we do not have a name.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot take this broad name.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we have a name, we have become a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2 What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ephesians 1:22-23 says, "The church, which is His Body."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ephesians 4:4 also says, "One Body."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the church includes all the saved ones who believe in the Lord's name in all times and places.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please look at 1 Timothy 3:15 also.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is called "the house of God."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then what is not the church?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church is not a chapel, nor is it a youth group, nor a sect or denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every saved believer in the Lord's name is a member of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The members are produced naturally; they cannot join anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, I "meet in the Lord's name" on East Street Road.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have seen that according to the Bible there should not be "denominational" differentiation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Having denominations is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I left Sze Cheng Chapel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I did not leave the church; I only left a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My leaving of the denomination was not because of individual preference but because of obeying the teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>3 In the Bible, the word sanctified in its positional aspect means that something is separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Please read the section beginning with Matthew 23:17, 1 Timothy 4:4-5, and John 17:19.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Bible, holy and common are opposites.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Holy and sinful are not opposites.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Please read Ezekiel 44:23.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The brothers and sisters who meet in the Lord's name do not all have a great knowledge of the Bible, nor have we all attained a high level of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, we can say that everyone among us is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The level of salvation, however, varies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some have been saved for two months, some for six months, some for a year, and some have just been newly saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our greatest work every week is to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Preaching the gospel is to bring unsaved ones in through the door of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many people misunderstand us and think that we only are trying to pull people out of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That is a great mistake, but it was also my previous concept.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>4 The organization of the church: The organization of the church is spontaneous just as the organization of a body is spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The present chapels and denominations are not the church, so they need man's organization.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because there are many unsaved, unregenerated, and worldly ones in the denominations, they need man's organization.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you come to Hangchow, I will welcome you very much.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, it is best if we do not discuss this matter because the light which we have individually received is different.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You cannot understand the truth of leaving the denominations in your heart without "God's enlightenment."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is my answer to you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Greetings!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Jan Ch'i Yu</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>July 30, 1934</S>
