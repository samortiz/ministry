   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>On one hand, there is revival praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the other hand, it must be rebuked before the Lord because it is never returned to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Protestant churches have revivals continuously, but the Lord says they are not perfect, they have not gone back to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must remember what was in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The problem is not how we receive and hear now; the problem is how we received and heard in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Acts 2 many were saved, and the Lord said they continued steadfastly in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It does not say that they continued in the apostles' breaking of bread and the prayers, but in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fellowship of Christ is the fellowship of the apostles; the teaching of Christ is the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God only counts the fellowship of the apostles as fellowship; He only counts the teaching of the apostles as teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot invent a fellowship; neither can we invent a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The mistake of Thyatira was that she manufactured her own teaching, since Jezebel was there.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God does not want us to invent; He just wants us to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the twentieth century anything can be invented, but not the teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Spirit we may talk about discovery, but in teaching there cannot be any invention.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must examine what we have received, what we have heard, and hold fast and repent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you" v. 3 . "Come" is to come by descending.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Upon" in Greek is epi, which means I will descend by your side, not come upon you, but apart from you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The coming of the thief is a coming of epi.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are here, and he prowls up by our side.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord's use of words is very ingenious.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can translate it as, "I will come and pass by you, yet you will not know it."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The thief does not come to steal the cheap things; he always steals the best.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord will also steal the best from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The best are in His hands, not outside of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are in the house: one will be raptured, and one will be left.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So the Lord says that if you will not watch, He will come.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus is coming back soon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The day is getting closer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May we be precious enough to be "stolen" by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white because they are worthy" v. 4 . Jacob brought seventy souls into Egypt Exo 1:5 . Ordinarily the Scriptures say so many men, so many souls.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the Lord says here that there are a few names; the Lord pays special attention to our names.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He says that there are a few names who have not defiled their garments.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These garments are our righteous deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we stand before God, we put on Christ, for Christ is our white garment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, we are not standing before God here, but before Christ, before the judgment seat Rom 14:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not put on Christ here; rather, we put on "fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints" Rev 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There are a few names which have not defiled their garments; that is to say, their behavior is clean.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They will walk with the Lord, for they are worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"He who overcomes will be clothed thus, in white garments, and I shall by no means erase his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels" 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The matter here does not involve whether the name is recorded, but whether the name will be confessed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those whom the Lord confesses will participate in something; those whom the Lord does not confess will not participate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the names are recorded in the book of life, but he who is not confessed by the Lord is like one who is marked out with a circle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He will not participate.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here the problem is not related to eternal life in eternity, but to whether or not you can reign with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is an unfortunate thing to be recorded and yet not be able to participate.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May the Lord be gracious to us so that we may wear the white garment before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have the white garment to put on before God, but what about before the Lord?</S>
