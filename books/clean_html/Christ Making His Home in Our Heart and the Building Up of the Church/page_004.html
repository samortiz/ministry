<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Life Being Manifested<br />
as the Tree of Life in Genesis 2</h2>
<p>In Genesis there is a clear picture explaining God&rsquo;s work of restoration and further creation in six days. This work can be divided into two parts: the first three days, which are related to light, and the second three days, also related to light. In chapter 1 the light came on the first day and again on the fourth day. In chapter 2 we see the tree of life (v. 9), signifying that God came to be man&rsquo;s life in the form of food. During the first three days there was light, but the light was not solid. Consequently, the light generated only a lower form of life. The light on the fourth day was solid and thus generated higher forms of life. The forms of life progressed upward in three levels: from the plant life to the animal life, from oviparous life to viviparous life, and from viviparous life to human life, which is the highest form of created life. However, in the universe the progression of life does not stop with human life. There is a life that is higher than human life. This life is God&rsquo;s life. Therefore, in chapter 2 God came to be life by manifesting Himself as the tree of life. The God who came as light is also life (1 John 1:5; John 1:4). He came as food to be received by man (6:51). He came to be eaten by man so that man can receive Him. God is the tree of life as well as the bread of life to be eaten by man. Man needs to receive Him as life.</p>
<p>In the first two chapters of Genesis there are several levels of life. The lowest form of life is the plant life, which is a life without consciousness. The next level of life is the animal life, the fish and the birds. This life is higher than the plant life and possesses consciousness, but it is an oviparous life and is very low. The third level of life is the viviparous animal life, which is the middle level of life with consciousness. Above this is the created life with the highest consciousness, that is, human life. Therefore, there are at least four levels of life. First is the life without consciousness, which is level one. Then there is the life with consciousness, which has three levels: low, middle, and high. However, in the universe, in addition to these forms of life, which are all created, there is still another life, the uncreated life. This life is the highest form of life. This life, which not only has consciousness but has the highest form of consciousness, is the divine life. It is God Himself&mdash;God&rsquo;s life. This is the life that is signified by the life of the tree of life in chapter 2.</p>
<p>Genesis 1 speaks of the created life, and chapter 2 speaks of the uncreated life, God&rsquo;s life, God Himself. Five levels of life exist with three levels of light. The first level of light is the first-day light. The second level is the fourth-day light, which is solid. The third level of light is in Genesis 2, where God Himself came to be light to shine Himself into man. God desires to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life so that man can obtain Him as the highest life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ADAM HAVING ONLY THE HUMAN LIFE</h2>
<p>Let us now consider how God created Adam. Genesis 2:7 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.&rdquo; This verse shows that Adam was created with only the human life; he did not have God&rsquo;s life. According to the record in the Bible, the life that Adam had when he was created was good. We know this because God considered His work of creation in the first five days to be good (1:4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25), but on the sixth day &ldquo;God saw everything that He had made, and indeed, it was very good&rdquo; (v. 31). This indicates that what God created on the sixth day was very good. Since what God did was very good, we must believe that Adam&rsquo;s life was good. Nevertheless, even if Adam could love others and show humility and gentleness, and even if he was not proud, did not hate others, and did not steal, he had only the human life; he did not have God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PURPOSE OF REGENERATION BEING<br />
FOR MAN TO HAVE ETERNAL LIFE</h2>
<p>The Bible speaks concerning regeneration. What is regeneration? According to its literal meaning, the prefix <em>re</em> means to do something again; hence, <em>regeneration</em> means &ldquo;to generate again.&rdquo; Regeneration is a great truth in the Bible. It is also necessary in order for man to satisfy God&rsquo;s intention in His creation of human life. In John 3:7 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You must be born anew.&rdquo; No matter what the state of our original life is, we must be born again to satisfy God&rsquo;s intention. Regeneration is for us to obtain God&rsquo;s eternal life in addition to our human life. In chapter 3, after speaking at length about being born anew, the Lord pointed out that the life we obtain from regeneration is the eternal life (v. 36). This eternal life is God Himself; it is also the life of God, the life signified by the tree of life. As a created being, Adam had a created life; he did not have the uncreated life. He had human life but not God&rsquo;s life. Although his life was good, his life was not God&rsquo;s life; it was merely human life. God placed Adam in front of the tree of life, indicating that God&rsquo;s intention was for Adam to obtain the life of God, in addition to his human life. A person is regenerated when he obtains the uncreated life of God in addition to his created life.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2 God&rsquo;s intention was for Adam to eat the tree of life; however, according to the record in chapter 2, Adam did not eat of the tree of life. The record concerning Adam&rsquo;s eating is in chapter 3. Adam did not eat the tree of life. He ate the wrong tree; he ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Therefore, at the end of chapter 3 God guarded the way to the tree of life (v. 24). Since Adam ate of the wrong tree, he was not allowed to eat of the right tree. If Adam had eaten the fruit from the tree of life, he would have received God&rsquo;s life into him; he would have been regenerated.</p>
<p>Today in the New Testament age a person needs to believe into the Lord Jesus in order to be regenerated. Concerning regeneration, the Gospel of John says, &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo; (1:4). The Lord Himself told His disciples that He is a tree (15:1) and that He is &ldquo;the bread of life&rdquo; (6:35). These three points show that the Lord Jesus is the tree of life and that He is God coming to be our life. He said, &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (v. 57), and &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life&rdquo; (3:36). In these verses eating is the same as believing. Believing into the Lord Jesus is equivalent to eating Him. We usually say that we receive the Lord Jesus. However, the word <em>receive</em> is not specific, because there are many kinds of receiving. For instance, when I give a person a hymnal, he receives it. That kind of receiving is outward. If I give him a glass of water to drink and he drinks it, that is also receiving, but this kind of receiving is inward. Our receiving of the Lord Jesus is not an outward receiving. Our receiving of the Lord Jesus is to take Him into us by eating Him.</p>
<p>Not only so, what a person eats becomes part of him. Hence, if Adam had eaten the tree of life, it would have been equivalent to Adam receiving the Lord of life into himself to be his life. Adam was a created man with only the human life. He received the breath of life from God, which became his spirit, but he did not obtain the element of God. He had only the created life, not God&rsquo;s uncreated life. He still needed to be born again.</p>
