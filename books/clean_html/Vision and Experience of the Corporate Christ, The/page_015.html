<h2 class="head2">The Church Being Composed of<br />
the Unsearchable Riches of Christ</h2>
<p>Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; In the Body-Christ, whom we have received and in whom we are walking, dwells all the fullness of the Godhead. Because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ, He is unsearchably rich. Thus, Paul says in Ephesians 3:8, &ldquo;To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.&rdquo; In order to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ, Paul was given not a miraculous gift but grace. To preach doctrine, we need a gift. However, to preach Christ Himself with all His unsearchable riches, we need grace, which is Christ Himself.</p>
<p>When by grace we preach all the unsearchable riches of Christ, the church is produced (v. 10). The church is produced by, with, and out of all the riches of Christ. How rich, weighty, and high the church is depends upon how much we enjoy the riches of Christ. The church is a composition of all the riches of Christ. Paul preached the riches of Christ so that the church may be produced.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Calling on the Lord and Pray-reading<br />
to Partake of the Riches of Christ</h2>
<p>The way to partake of the riches of Christ is to call on the name of the Lord at every time. First Corinthians 15:45 reveals that Christ is the life-giving Spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s person comes when we call on His name, and His person is the life-giving Spirit. Jesus is the name, and the Spirit is the person (2 Cor. 3:17). Thus, we receive the Spirit by calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, Romans 10:6-8 reveals that Christ is the living Word. Christ is not only the life-giving Spirit but also the Word of life (1 John 1:1). We need to identify the living Word with the written word to make these two words one. We can do this by calling on the name of the Lord, the living Word, when we are pray-reading the Bible, the written word. Reading alone will not cause us to enjoy the riches of Christ. Jeremiah 15:16 says, &ldquo;Your words were found and I ate them.&rdquo; The way to eat the word is to pray-read. We breathe the Spirit by calling on the name of the Lord, and we eat the word by pray-reading. The Lord has shown us a wonderful way to feed on His word. By pray-reading we receive nourishment (Eph. 6:17-18).</p>
<p>To call on the name of the Lord is to breathe the Spirit into us, and to pray-read is to eat the word, which is Christ. All that Christ is, is embodied in the word (1 Cor. 15:45b; John 6:63; 15:4, 7). For this reason we are nourished when we take in the word. It is not sufficient simply to breathe Jesus; we also need to eat Jesus. When we call on the name of the Lord and pray-read, we receive the Spirit as our spiritual breath and the word as our spiritual food. In this way we are nourished and enjoy all the riches of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Calling and Pray-reading Corporately</h2>
<p>We should learn to call on the Lord and pray-read not only by ourselves but also with others. At home we can do this with our spouse. I often enjoy the Lord in this way with my wife. A person cannot have a feast by eating alone. We may have many dishes on the table, but if we are eating alone, that is not a feast. A feast requires a group of people to come together to eat. Eating in a corporate way is a great enjoyment. We partake of much more of the riches of Christ when we enjoy Him with others than when we enjoy Him alone. Whenever possible, we should call on the Lord and pray-read with the saints.</p>
<p>We also need to call and pray-read with the whole church. First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body...and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; Drinking is not only an individual matter but also a Body matter. We have all been positioned to drink by being baptized into one Body. The position for drinking is in the Body. We need to drink in the Body by coming to the church meetings to call and pray-read together with all the saints.</p>
