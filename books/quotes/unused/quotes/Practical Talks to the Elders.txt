We pray desperately that they all may see Your vision, that they all may see Your heart, that they all may see the desires in Your heart
If the elders lack a clear vision as to what the Lord is doing-and this vision must be very strong-we are doing things in vain
Mainly they emphasized Bible teaching, the exposition of the types and practices and the teaching of the different books
The lampstands represent the Triune God with the Father as the nature, the Son as the embodiment, and the Spirit as the expression
We must bear such a testimony in every aspect of the church life and of our daily life, including the family life
In using this word mystery, Paul refers first to Christ as the mystery of God and second to the church as the mystery of Christ
As the lampstand is constituted of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, so the church also is constituted of the divine Trinity
It is a living organism constituted of the living God in His divine Trinitythe Fathers nature the Sons embodiment and the Spirits expression
Do you think there is any place among them with a group of Christians bearing a testimony which corresponds to the mystery of the faith?
From 1972 there was a tendency to promote numbers, to be occupied with getting the proper place and the proper people
From 1973 for at least five years we were in a somewhat drugged situation, even though the ministry never deviated from the central lane
Now that this distraction is apparently over, the churches seem to be doing quite well, to be going on steadily
Some churches are endeavoring to build up their kind of church in their locality, with a bigger number, with more vitality
You will not be satisfied with the condition of the churches because it is hard to find one that is centered on God's focus
Brothers, nothing can keep you in the recovery, nothing can keep you one with the brothers, except this vision
Surely we want good meetings and a good church life, but the meetings and the church life must have this as the focus
They would have liked to use our field to carry out their own work; when they realized there was no way, they left
Coming together to have an assembly according to the Scripture-an ekklesia, the called-out ones meeting together?
It is good that the churches preach the gospel, that they use the Life-studies, that they are doing things according to the Scriptures
As to whether the Chinese-speaking saints in southern California come to these meetings, it is up to the churches
As for the churches, surely something should be done, based upon the principle of shepherding, for the Chinese-speaking saints
As for the Chinese-speaking saints, if your English is sufficient, you are not qualified to come to the Chinese-speaking meeting
One set of meetings will be in Chinese, needing some to take care of it; another will be in English, also needing some to take care of it
More than a hundred years ago there was a war in this country between the north and the south over the matter of race
If in your heart you are thinking, 'How good it will be if there is no Chinese-speaking meeting,' you are trying to avoid this
After resigning from the eldership in San Francisco, he took over a little group which was an outpost of the church in San Francisco
Since there were so few who would be going there, it would be better not to go and get involved in the complicated situation
If there was the likelihood that that outpost was going to be a church, it should have been done under a sweet fellowship
Palo Alto is one city among many cities in the Bay area with churches; and it was originally an outpost of an already-existing church
If he goes to the meetings of the church in Anaheim, he will have to drive a long way to get to the meeting hall
He could argue that they are being too legal and say that there is no need for him to be bound by such a legality
If he knows what the flesh is and what the lesson of the cross is, he would choose not to meet with the church which meets nearby
Even if the situation in Palo Alto were desirable for starting the church life, this still would not qualify you
Once something is started by you under the umbrella of the church with an impure motive, everything is annulled'
If you have even a little desire to be a leader, not an elder but just a leader in the Chinese-speaking meeting, this disqualifies you
To judge with the best discernment whether to have a Chinese-speaking meeting in your locality requires a pure motive
Not only in this matter, but in every situation in the church life, especially in the leadership, this principle applies
A husband and wife who truly love each other without impureness may quarrel and have disagreements, yet without misunderstanding
They may try to be careful, patient, and wise, but the misunderstandings will continue because of the impureness
In the world, say, in a corporation, people are very careful not to offend each other, because the world is filled with impurity
There is a demon in your thinking, because you are doing something which you hope Brother Lee will not find out about
Now that the Chinese-speaking meeting has started, all these frogs from the depths of the well have come to the surface
Several times he mentions that the Lord's commission to him was not the external things of the work of the church life
The Lord's commission to him was the testimony of Jesus, that is, to live a life of Christ in His death and resurrection
The Lord commissioned him to give messages on Christ, on His death and resurrection, and on His Body, the mystical Body
Under the subtlety of the enemy some said that before World War II Brother Nee was for the ground of the church but after the war he changed
Even we who say we take Brother Nee's ministry take mostly the external part, the chicken feathers and the garlic skins
After many years of being separated and scattered, both old and young came together, in some cases three generations, in Christ
The denominations, on the other hand, have lasted just because of their organization and all these external things
He learned by observing those who went before him and lacked these external things, so he did take care of them
It is true that in spite of our weakness and of our not being up to the Lords standard there is no other group of people who are so seeking
To understand the doctrine is one thing; to see the vision and be caught by it, and to practice it, is another matter
It was due to the earnest prayers of many European and American brothers and sisters who went to China as missionaries
Before their departure, some Christian workers in this country got word from their connections in Taipei as to who among us was coming
They offered to take them by car wherever they wanted to go; if they had no place to go, they took them to their guest house
They did not have a strong foundation in the church life, so after they came they were distracted by their schooling, job, or relatives
There were a good number like Hudson Taylor, who cared only that the Lord's salvation be applied to the Chinese people
A brother from Taiwan was in San Francisco for a couple of years, and another was in Berkeley, yet nothing seemed to happen
The proper cooking in the churches first of all requires that the leading ones get into the messages on the central lane
The basic point of the proper cooking is this: the leading ones need the practical experience of the words on the central lane
These two things-to experience and to help others to experience-will take much time to practice, to learn, and to pray over
Elementary school takes six years, then junior and senior high take three years each, and then a college course of study needs four years
To help a church get into the practical living of the central lane, to set up a foundation, will take about four years
It was like attending class after class in a university without being able to figure out what the course was about
The decision had been made by the work under Brother Nee's leadership to send the truths we had received of the Lord to the denominations
A housewife should not say she does not know how to cook, that she wants to invite someone to cook for her, for her family
Children may like to eat hamburgers bought from a fast-food place, but that kind of cooking will not build them up
In those two months two hundred newcomers were baptized, thus laying a strong foundation for the church in Tsingtao
As long as the leading ones were there, the church would have trouble because the Communists were after the leaders
Especially after the training on the Epistles of Peter, you can see how much they were both one in the unique ministry
Maybe what Paul wrote is hard for you to understand, but don't twist it; if you do, you are twisting the Scripture
There is only one God, one Savior, one Lord, one way, one testimony, one ministry, one flow, one throne, and one goal
We shall use our meetings time after time, maybe four or five meetings a week, week after week, just for this one thing
That is more damaging to my health than to spend hours and hours talking with those involved to help them solve it
The churches around the world, especially the churches in the Far East, are my children, more precious even than my own children
Even though the scale of the recovery is small, it is nonetheless scattered throughout all the continents and is still spreading
Just five years ago a distraction came in which confused some dear ones who were concerned for the Lord's recovery
The dear ones who are in and who will be brought into the Lord's recovery can have a clear view about what it is
In other words, as we have pointed out elsewhere, in the entire Bible there is only one line to carry out what God wants
The tree of life will consummate in the city of water; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil will consummate in the lake of fire
As those who have been saved, called, and separated by God unto His economy, we are not in the enemy's line but rather in God's
There is the one line of the unique God, of His unique plan, of His unique economy, of His unique work, and of His unique way
In the four Gospels not much is indicated of this, but in the Acts there is the unique way for the churches to be carried out
In one of our hymns we say The fullness of God dwells in Thee but Colossians 29 says the fullness of the Godhead not the fullness of God
That the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ really denotes that the divine Trinity is dwelling in Christ in full
That flesh, that humanity, was of the old creation and remained such until it was brought through death and into resurrection
Until this glorification was accomplished, the second of the Trinity had not finished the process which He should go through
In Acts 1:17 Peter says regarding Judas, 'For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry'
Not only an apostle, but even a deacon, serving for example in the business affairs of the church, is part of the ministry
There are Jesuits Dominicans and Franciscans yet all three groups are carrying out one objective that is to build up the Catholic Church
It is a recovery of the unique plan, the unique economy, the unique way, the unique word, and the unique focus by the unique ministry
All of them used different terminology and different ways of presentation, yet they were all doing the one work
Prophecies and the interpretations of the Old Testament are covered, but all these prophecies and interpretations are for the focus
The prophecies are defined, the Old Testament is interpreted, all in the way to carry out the focus, which is the divine Trinity
The only thing that can keep us permanently and absolutely one is the unique ministry to minister the unique focus
If we expect an increase either by evangelism or by the spreading of the doctrines we teach, we shall surely face these two perils
If we don't care for the Lord's recovery by paying heed to all these unique points, then we will care for the spreading of our work
The elders should not lord it over the flock but be an example, a pattern, of how to live Christ, how to practice the focal things
There is a natural tendency to want big numbers, good meetings, good service, a good appearance for our local church
How we thank You that we may take You as our sin offering and as our trespass offering, even as all the offerings
My burden these days is that we should realize the danger there is that we may fall into those perils we talked about last time
The Lord did not tell His disciples much what they should do for Him; He just kept attracting them to love Him
The churches of the Lord's recovery in the United States, even though they are much younger, are also in this danger
With the new churches the problem is not that great, but with the established churches, the danger is surely here
Without the Spirit, we don't have the experience of Christ; if we don't have the experience of Christ, we don't have much life
Now your knowledge has increased, your experience has become more than in the past, but your zeal is less than it was when you first came in
You may go to a seminary or to a Bible college and gain a lot of knowledge, but you may not receive light because light is the Lord Himself
If we don't love the Lord, we may come to the Bible, we may have morning watch, but what we read may be just knowledge without light
If we have the Lord's presence mingled in our knowledge, then that knowledge is the truth because the Lord's presence is the light
From the second third of the last century to the first third of this century many Christian books came out with many truths, full of light
To take this as an excuse in order to carry out your narrow kind of practice will dry up and even kill the church life
You are not rich, yet you still want to keep your position; you want to keep things in the church just as they are
You have no reservoir to preserve even the rain water; there is no need to say that the river cannot flow up to your high place
Regardless of how long you have been an elder in a local church, as long as you are zealous, there is no danger
The relationship among the apostles and among the elders and even among the churches should be absolutely and purely in the spirit
When the family is brought into the church leadership, or into the work, there is a peril that the thing would not be so pure
A number of these brothers with their wives were willing to help this elder in church affairs, but not in a pure way
In every place where relationships among families have been too close, the church in that place has suffered a great loss
There must be purity in the motive, in the intention, in the procedures, and in all the doings related to the leadership
We would expect-if we are a prevailing elder-that eventually our son or sons would be our successors in the eldership
If we can educate our children to be saved, if we think we can raise them so that they get saved, then where is predestination?
We must do our best to raise our children well, and we must do everything we can to help them to know the Lord
On the other side, we cannot see any hint as to who was the successor of Peter, or of John, or the other apostles
We must do our best to take care of our children, to teach them, and to raise them in the knowledge of the Lord
My point is this, brothers: in the Lord's work and in the church leadership, we have only the relationship in the spirit
Since you are a leading one in this kind of work in society, if they are allowed to help you, they feel honored
In a positive sense, the elders should be those who are open to others, who easily contact others, and who are easily approachable
The elders or the leading ones in the church responsibility are those most in need of the constant infilling of the Spirit of God
There is a difference between the New and the Old Testaments, yet in the reality of God's economy there is no difference
Don't think of God as in the heavens and sending His Spirit down to earth to enter into the designers to do the work
As you know, the Spirit today is much, much richer than the Spirit of God in Old Testament times; but the principle is the same
Even Moses himself, strange to say, did not have the wisdom to design what he had seen, what he had been charged with
God treasures your willingness, which He initiated, but your capability-what you can do, what you know-in God's estimation means nothing
On the one hand, willingness is really valuable; but on the other hand, the natural capability must be discounted, even entirely abandoned
When Moses was young, he had the willingness to be used by God to do something for his people, who were under the tyranny of Pharaoh
God, as we all know, spent forty years to empty or unload him, until he was fully deprived by God and was absolutely empty
The problem is that we are not emptied and therefore cannot be filled with the Triune God as the filling Spirit today
Whether the church is living and fresh and enriched depends on this one thing: that we are being filled continuously with the Triune God
We have confidence, we have knowledge, we have a way, we have ability, we have strength: we are certain we can handle the situation
We need to empty ourselves, knowing that whatever we can do is not counted; it is not only rejected but even condemned by God
Since you are taking the lead, you should carry out all that is commanded by God; all believers may not be able to do this, but you should
One of these things, which you have picked up through the years and which you must drop, is the way you are related to others
You have your choice, your preference: you like to fellowship with this one, and you avoid having fellowship with that one
You will know how much salt you need to add, and you will be able by exercising in a strong way to add the right amount of salt
Other times we may stand up and share a lot, but the congregation has the feeling that it is from the old man, that it is empty
When we contact others we may speak the same word talk about the same point but sometimes there is a result and other times it is lifeless
When the others in the group were not in agreement, those concerned about the gospel left and formed their own group
We must blow the trumpet that the Body of Christ is one and that in any locality the expression of this Body as the church must also be one
Brothers, we ourselves need to learn, and then we need to train the saints in the recovery, how to preach this
We must learn to present the truth in a clear and prevailing way, leaving no loophole for the other side to argue or reject
As the leading ones in the local churches you all need to get into these truths experience them and be trained to preach them to others
The New Testament shows us that all the believers are lights in the world and that every local church is a lampstand
You may mention John 1721 That they all may be one and Ephesians 413 where the first item in a walk worthy of God is to keep the oneness
At the Lord's table we can take a half hour to train the saints to speak on the oneness of the children of God
If you check my writings in both Chinese and English, you will see that their focus in the past thirty-four years is actually the Spirit
If you trace from 1969 till now, within these fourteen years, you will see that the light has mostly been on the Spirit
In the inner life teachings of past centuries, the main word used to describe our relationship with God is the word union
Because their teaching stirred up so much debate, however, the term was dropped and the word union was used all the time
The issue of these more than twenty years of ministering the Word with the focus on the Spirit is the matter of the divine dispensing
God could not be present and practical if He were not such a processed, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, compound Spirit
If God has not become such a Spirit to us, then He is just objective, an external object; He is not practical, and we cannot experience Him
The clearest writing in the New Testament regarding this, especially in John's writings, is John 14 through 17
He goes on to say that He is the only way to the Father ; in fact, He continues, He is in the Father and the Father is in Him
The Lord firstly told His disciples that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him; when He speaks, the Father does His works
When we put all these verses together, we can see the Father in the Son and the Son coming with the Father as the Spirit to be in us
We may love the Bible and study it, but we don't have the habit, the desire, the aspiration to dig into its depths
You will surely have the riches to minister to the saints, and we shall have, using Paul's term, the full knowledge of the truth
When a question is raised by either an opposer or a seeking one, we should present the truth to him as it is indicated in the Bible
We should practice, then, these two things: the inner experience of the Spirit and the outer study of the Word
Exercise to pick up the skill to present the truth to others and to help the saints in our meetings and in our fellowship
In the Lord's recovery, this dispensing must be the central thing, so that we are being continually filled with Him
