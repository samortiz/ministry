   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jehovah Making Them a Terror</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to All the Kingdoms of the Earth for Evil</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jehovah said that He would make them a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth for evil, to be a reproach, a proverb, a byword, and a curse in all the places where He would drive them v. 9 . Here byword indicates mocking, and proverb signifies a formal expression of derision.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because of God's judgment, they would be put in such a low condition that they would be mocked and derided by the nations.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jehovah Sending Sword,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Famine, and Pestilence upon Them</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Finally, Jehovah promised that He would send sword, famine, and pestilence upon them until they were consumed from the land which He had given to them and to their fathers v. 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. Jeremiah's Prophecy</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>concerning All the People of Judah</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In chapter twenty-five we see Jeremiah's prophecy concerning all the people of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Beginning from the Thirteenth Year</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>of Josiah the Son of Amon, King of Judah</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jeremiah's prophecy in this chapter began from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verses 1 through 3 say, "The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah that is, the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even unto this day, these twenty-three years, the word of Jehovah came to me, and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you have not listened."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nebuchadnezzar came into power as king in 607 B.C., and the next year he attacked Judah, seizing Jerusalem and capturing a number of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In his prophecy, Jeremiah told the people of the evils, the calamities, that were coming upon them, and he advised them to repent and return to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we read the book of Jeremiah, we should keep in mind that this book was not written according to the historical sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, Jeremiah, inspired by the Spirit, wrote a book that is a composition of history, prophecy, and autobiography.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, although this book does not follow a historical sequence, it often conveys a spiritual sequence.</S>
