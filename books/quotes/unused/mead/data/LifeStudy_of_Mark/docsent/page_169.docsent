   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FIFTY-EIGHT A LIFE FULLY ACCORDING TO AND FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 7 Scripture Reading: Mark 1:1, 14-15; 4:1-20, 26-29</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Gospel of Mark we see a Person living a life according to God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This book does not reveal anything other than the Lord Jesus as this wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>MATTERS THAT OCCUPY OUR ATTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us now list a number of matters that have occupied people s attention throughout human history: culture, religion, ethics, morality, the improvement of character, philosophy, being scriptural, being spiritual, being holy, and being victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These ten items cover the thoughts, ideas, and concepts of all people, including Gentiles, Jews, and Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>People everywhere have their minds occupied with culture, religion, ethics, morality, the improvement of character, and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In addition, Christians may be occupied with being scriptural, spiritual, holy, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many books have been written by Christian teachers on how to be scriptural, spiritual, holy, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the Gospel of Mark, the Lord Jesus did not teach culture, religion, ethics, morality, improvement of character, or philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Neither did He help people to be more scriptural, spiritual, holy, or victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we pointed out in a foregoing message, the Lord Jesus did not live in the kingdom of law or that of ethics; He lived altogether in another realm the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE SOWER SOWING HIMSELF AS THE SEED OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the One who lived in the kingdom of God, how did the Lord Jesus live?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What did He do?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapter four of Mark we see that the Lord was a Sower and that He sowed Himself as the seed into people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In particular, He sowed Himself into Peter and the other disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was not an easy matter for the Lord Jesus to sow Himself as a seed into human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To sow seed into soil is easy, but for the Lord to sow living seed into people was difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This difficulty can be illustrated by the problem parents sometimes face in getting medicine into a sick child.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because a child may strongly resist, the parents may have to hold him down and open his mouth in order to put the medicine into him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In a similar way, the Lord Jesus may have had to use angels as helpers in sowing Himself as the seed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It may have been necessary for us to be put into a difficult situation before we opened to the Lord to receive Him as the divine seed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Praise Him that in spite of the difficulty, He has been sown into us!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Gospel of Mark shows the Lord Jesus living and working in such a way as to sow Himself as seed into people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Mark is not a book of culture, religion, ethics, morality, improvement of character, or philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Neither is it a book teaching us to be scriptural, spiritual, holy, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, the Gospel of Mark is a book presenting the Sower sowing Himself into us as the seed of a life that lives according to God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is possible that the thoughts even of the saints in the Lord s recovery may be occupied with the matters of how to be scriptural, spiritual, holy, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you not want to be holy?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you not want to be spiritual and victorious?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Books written by Christians emphasizing the need to be holy, spiritual, and victorious may quote verses from the Bible to support their teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, the Gospel of Mark does not touch this field at all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This Gospel does not teach us how to be holy, spiritual, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead, the Gospel of Mark presents the Lord as the One sowing Himself into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord s close followers spent three and a half years with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>During those years, He must have taught them many things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is surprising that in the Gospel of Mark we do not find a hint concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this book we see that the Lord Jesus was continually sowing Himself into Peter and the other disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In chapter one the Lord saw Peter and his brother Andrew fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord called them and, attracted by Him, they left all and followed Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It may be that the Lord s sowing of the seed into Peter began at that time.</S>
