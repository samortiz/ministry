<h2 class="head1">HOLDING A DEFINITE GOAL FOR THE MEETING<br />
 AND NEVER LETTING THE MEETING END<br />
IN EMPTINESS</h2>
<p>You should hold a definite goal for the meeting, and never let the meeting end in emptiness. Go to the meeting with a purpose and keep at least ten minutes of the meeting to fill the new ones with some riches of your purpose. You may stay there for seventy minutes, but you should reserve at least ten minutes for your purpose. We need to consider the way the Lord was on this earth when He talked to people. The four Gospels show us that the Lord talked to people without forms, legalities, or programs. He was always flexible. In any situation and with anyone, a profitable and building up word proceeded out of His mouth. We must learn to talk to people in this way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Always Trying to Overcome the Deviation<br />
in a Pleasant Way</h2>
<p>If there is a deviation in the meeting, you should always try to overcome it in a pleasant way. Do not do anything to give people a bad feeling, but always do something in a pleasant way to arrive at your goal, to reach your destination. You are not going to the meeting to have fun with them. You have a purpose to accomplish. You have to reach your destination.</p>
<p>Do not go to someone&rsquo;s home to have a legal, formal meeting. Go there to spend one hour in an informal way. Talk to the new ones in a conversational way and let them say something. As you are meeting with them, one of them may remark that his shoes are too old and that he needs a new pair. Overcome this deviation in a pleasant way. You may say something about their need for a new pair of shoes and then bring the meeting back to the Bible. They will be happy. Do not set up a program with a schedule. If you have a prearranged program, you will have a legalistic attitude to stop any distraction that comes in. If they ask any questions about a different portion of the Bible, you will tell them that it is too deep for them or that it does not fit their situation today. If you have the attitude that only what you are doing is the best, you will kill everything. Go to the homes with no regulation, form, or program. Whatever they do, do it with them. But always hold your purpose and bring them to your goal.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Always Endeavoring to Share<br />
Some Spiritual Reality in Life or in Truth<br />
to Swallow Up the Emptiness</h2>
<p>We should always endeavor to share some spiritual reality in life or in truth to swallow up the emptiness. The meeting may have been going on for close to one hour, yet you should still grasp the last ten minutes to minister some reality either in truth or in life. At the end of a meeting, you may raise up the word <em>redemption.</em> Then you can speak a little bit about how the Lord died on the cross to accomplish redemption. You can say that we needed redemption because we got lost. We needed to be brought back to God, so the Lord Jesus shed His blood on the cross to take away our sin (John 1:29), to deliver us from the penalty of God&rsquo;s righteousness (John 3:18; 5:24), and to repossess us, accomplishing an eternal redemption for us (Heb. 9:12). Such a short speaking within three minutes ministers a truth to them. In this short time you can impress them with the word <em>redemption.</em></p>
<p>How many among us can give a clear word on the truth concerning the Lord&rsquo;s redemption? In the last thirty years, how many saints have been raised up that can teach others? Most countries on this earth basically practice a similar educational system of kindergarten, elementary school, junior high school, high school, and college. There are also advanced degrees such as a master&rsquo;s degree and a Ph.D. But in the church we have been speaking to the dear saints for years, and not many have come to the full knowledge of the truth. We have to realize that our way in the past was wrong. We need to be brought into the full knowledge of the truth and we also need to bring the new ones into this full knowledge.</p>
