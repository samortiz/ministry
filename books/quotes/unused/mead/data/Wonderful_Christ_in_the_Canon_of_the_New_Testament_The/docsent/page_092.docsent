   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRANSFORMATION BY THE FLOWING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The beginning of the Bible and the end of the Bible are much alike.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Genesis 2, besides the tree, there is a river flowing in four directions Gen 2:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is just like the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There the one river from the throne flows until it eventually reaches all four directions of the twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Genesis 2:12, we see that in the flow of the river there is gold, bdellium or pearl , and onyx stone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Three kinds of precious materials are in the flow of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually a woman was builded as a bride for man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man builded he a woman, and brought her unto the man Gen 2:22, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a very meaningful picture.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we read through the whole Bible, we begin to see that the tree of life is just God Himself presented to man in the form of food.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When this life enters into man, it becomes a flowing river.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Jesus comes into us, we begin to feel something flowing within.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>While we are in the classroom, while we are at work, while we are at home, there is something flowing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is Jesus as the water of life, flowing to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is by water flowing through a log that it becomes petrified wood.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The flowing of the water brings in many minerals and discharges the old wooden essence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is a replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Likewise, by the flowing of the living water within us we are replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Romans 9 tells us that we are vessels of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But God s intention is to transform these muddy vessels into precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Precious stones are not created by God naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They were originally something else, but under the proper conditions they were transformed into precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Originally we were all made vessels of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sooner or later God will transform us into precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is very patient.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To Him, one day is equal to a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He will not hurry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may look at ourselves after three years in the church life and feel that we are about the same.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But to God this is just a few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>PRECIOUS MATERIALS ARE FOR BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the precious materials are for a building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Genesis 2 God did not create a woman; He built a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is the same at the end of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The New Jerusalem is built with exactly the same materials that were in the flow of the river in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is the tree of life growing in the river, and a city is built up with gold, pearl, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And this city is a woman, a Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This Bride was not produced, but builded with the transformed items.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we can see the consistency of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What was in the beginning in Genesis is eventually in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But there is a big difference.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Genesis these three precious materials were only lying there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They were not built together.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But in Revelation, all three precious items are fitly framed and compacted together as a building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the Bible s consistent and progressive revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>LIVING STONES FOR GOD S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From Genesis we come to Matthew, the first book in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In chapter sixteen Jesus asked the disciples who the people thought He was.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Peter answered boldly, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God Matt 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then the Lord answered Peter, And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When Peter answered the Lord, he was right, but he was only half right.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to underline the little word also in verse 18.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The name Peter means a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When Andrew first brought Peter to the Lord, the Lord changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which means a stone John 1:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, the Lord was telling Peter that he was a stone to be built upon Himself as the rock for the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This little verse covers the whole New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Peter could never forget these words.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When he was speaking to Jewish leaders in Acts 4, he told them that they had not simply rejected a little man from Nazareth, but the stone which God had made the head of the corner for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved Acts 4:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many Christians preach this word concerning the name of Jesus, but they never touch the previous verse about the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Peter told the Jews that they had not only rejected the Savior, but also the stone for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Salvation is not for going to heaven; salvation is for building.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be saved is not merely to go to heaven some day.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To be saved is to be built into God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Jesus saves us with the purpose of making us a stone for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Later, Peter wrote in his first epistle, Ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are not made living stones for an exhibition in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Stones are not for exhibition; they are for building.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Ye also as living stones, are built up a spiritual house.</S>
