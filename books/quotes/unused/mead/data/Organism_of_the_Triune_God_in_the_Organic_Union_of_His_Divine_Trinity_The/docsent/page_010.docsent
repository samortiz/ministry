   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter two we saw that the organic union of the divine Trinity is in the Spirit as the reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We also saw the Spirit in eight aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is the very essence of the Triune God, the very reality of God, the reaching of the Triune God to man, the processed and compound Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God, the Spirit of life, the life-giving Spirit, and the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this chapter we want to fellowship concerning the organic union of the divine Trinity in the work of the Spirit and concerning the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the Spirit works in us, He works with all that the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit works in us with the innumerable items of all that the Triune God is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He also works in us with what the Triune God has passed through.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Triune God has passed through incarnation, human living, an all-inclusive death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now He is in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit works in us additionally with all of the Triune God s great accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was a great accomplishment for the Triune God to become a man, an accomplishment greater than His restoration and further creation of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did His creating work in only six days by speaking things into being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But to become a man through the divine conception, He had to be conceived in the womb of a virgin and remain there for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What a great accomplishment it was for the infinite God to stay in the womb of a virgin for nine months!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Triune God s incarnation was a much greater accomplishment than His creation of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now in the universe there is a particular man, a special man, a man with two natures the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This man is a God-man.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What a wonder it was for the Lord Jesus to live for thirty years in a poor carpenter s home and to live in the despised town of Nazareth!</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was the holy and infinite God in an unholy environment, being limited in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I was a young Christian, I wondered why the Lord had to pass through thirty-three and a half years of human living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God created things by speaking them into being, and I wondered why He could not do the same thing to accomplish redemption.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He needed to be tested so that He could be qualified and capable of being our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God s natural law for us human beings is that we grow to maturity until we are experienced and qualified to do certain things and to bear the responsibilities of adulthood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When God became a man, He passed through this growth process that He had established.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through His incarnation and human living, He was fully qualified, prepared, and equipped to die on the cross, thus accomplishing His all-inclusive death.</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through His incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension, He obtained and attained something.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In His incarnation He obtained a proper man with a proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One man was obtained by Him in His incarnation, but eventually He obtained a people through His death and resurrection Heb 8:10; 1 Pet 2:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The totality of all His obtaining and attaining is the church in this age and the New Jerusalem in the coming age and for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the eyes of God, the church and the New Jerusalem have been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The working Spirit uses the church and the New Jerusalem to work on us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This matter is all-inclusive, profound, and deep, but we need a vision to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church and the New Jerusalem have already been obtained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the Apostle John talks about the New Jerusalem, the verbs that he uses are in the past tense.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Through the processes God has passed through, from His incarnation through His ascension, He has completed the building up of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What God has completed is what He has obtained and attained.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now the working Spirit uses what the Triune God has obtained and attained to build us up firstly as the church and then as the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Spirit today works with all that the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>These are the elements with which the Spirit works on us and in us.</S>
