Lord, only You are the Lord, the Sovereign Master; we worship You, serve You, preach You, and dispense You to people
O Lord, we pray that You would give us a glorious beginning; glorify Yourself, glorify the Father, and glorify the Spirit
O Lord, we are Your slaves, and we can only bow down and worship before You, looking to You to grant us a good beginning
Lord, release Your children, release Your rich grace, and release Yourself that we may receive Your rich and abounding supply
In this conference we want to see how to be a co-worker and an elder and how to fulfill the obligations of the co-workers and elders
In the first stage of incarnation to bring God into man, to express God in humanity, and to accomplish His judicial redemption
In the third stage of intensification to intensify His organic salvation, to produce the overcomers, and to consummate the New Jerusalem
Although we still have the language problem passed on to us from Babel, we keep the Lord's word by not having national differences
They had followed the Lord for three and a half years; they had been beside Him and had received numerous revelations from Him
Although they heard the Lord saying that He was going to die, they did not hear Him saying that on the third day He would be resurrected
James and John were the Lord's cousins in the flesh, for their mother was the sister of Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus
Paul said, 'For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake'
The believers were not to regard Paul, Peter, and others too highly simply because they were apostles and evangelists
He was the Lord and the Teacher, yet He emptied Himself and girded His loins to wash His disciples' feet, serving them as a slave
The riches of what Christ is, are unsearchable , but among them, there are the four following items which we need to know in particular
To know Christ, we have to discern clearly that His being in His humanity is one thing and His being in His divinity is another thing
Concerning the redemption of Christ, the general saying is that Christ was a man with blood and flesh, so He could die for us in His flesh
We should not remain only in the general saying; this is an indication that our knowledge concerning Christ is not deep enough
We must penetrate the deepest part of the divine truth to see the intrinsic significance of Christ in His humanity
Romans 5:10a says that we 'were reconciled to God through the death of His Son'; this refers to His redemption
Whether we are co-workers or elders, when we go to shepherd and teach people, we can speak these things to them in a very clear way
To be a co-worker or an elder, we also need to experience and enjoy Christ in His full ministry in His three divine and mystical stages
We need to know Christ; second, we need to experience and enjoy Christ, that is, to gain Christ, in His full ministry
These require us to pursue by forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before
In His full ministry in the first stage, the stage of His incarnation, Christ brought the infinite God into the finite man
In general, most Christians today know only about the so-called Christmas to celebrate the birth of Christ as our Savior
They have not seen anything concerning the mystical aspect of the full ministry of Christ in the stage of His incarnation
In His full ministry in the first stage of His incarnation, Christ also united and mingled the Triune God with the tripartite man
Concerning the Triune God, the Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the entering in
Concerning the tripartite man, the spirit is the innermost part, the soul is in the middle, and the body is on the outside
When two pieces of wood are connected together they are united when two things are ground into powder and blended together they are mingled
It is easy to speak concerning the union of God with man, but it is not easy to speak concerning the mingling of God with man
These rich attributes were expressed by the Lord Jesus in His humanity to become the aromatic virtues in His humanity
Jesus said, 'Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens'
In His human living Christ expressed the bountiful God mainly in His rich attributes, that is, in the unsearchable riches of what God is
Immediately they followed Him, giving up their net mending, abandoning their boats, and forsaking their fathers
Peter was charmed by the Lord to such an extent that although he was rebuked by the Lord frequently, he still determined to follow Him
On the night of His betrayal, the Lord said to the disciples, 'You will all be stumbled because of Me this night'
Later, while Peter was sitting in the courtyard of the high priest, a little servant girl came to question him
At that time the Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter, remembering the Lord's word to him, went outside and wept bitterly
The Lord Jesus must have possessed some aromatic virtues in His humanity that could attract and captivate people
It was not until after the Lord's resurrection, when they had been regenerated, that they understood what the Lord had told them before
He was in the flesh, but He did not live by His human life in His flesh; rather, He lived by His divine life in His resurrection
The first two things were concerning His birth the third thing was concerning His human living and the fourth thing was concerning His death
After He passed through His human living, He went to die on the cross for the accomplishment of His all-inclusive judicial redemption
Ephesians 2:15 says that on the cross He created the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers in Himself into one new man
Christ created the new man in Himself, indicating that He was the very element for the conceiving of the new man
When Christ accomplished His all-inclusive judicial redemption, He released His divine life from the shell of His humanity
Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, its outer shell cannot be broken and its life within cannot be released
He needed to suffer death on the cross that the shell of His humanity might be broken to release His divine life from His human shell
Prayer: O Lord, thank You that You are the Lord who speaks and who gives to us the Spirit, even the unlimited Spirit
In the preceding message we saw that, as co-workers and elders, we must first know Christ in four particular items
The first stage of Christ's full ministry was the stage of His incarnation, from His birth through His human living to His death
From the time of His incarnation, when He put on human nature, He possessed humanity in addition to His divinity; hence, He had two natures
The holy anointing ointment was not merely oil, which was just one of the ingredients; it was an ointment compounded with many ingredients
The holy anointing ointment typifies the compound, life-giving Spirit whom Christ became in the stage of His inclusion
He was begotten as God's firstborn Son; second, He became the life-giving Spirit; and third, He regenerated His believers for His Body
In eternity past He was already resurrection just as He was life, but He had not yet entered into the experience of resurrection
The Lord is resurrection, and He has been resurrection from eternity past because He is God, who is resurrection
As the only begotten Son of God, Christ is resurrection from eternity, but then He did not have the experience of resurrection
It was not until after He had accomplished His ministry in the flesh through His death that He entered into resurrection
In His incarnation the only begotten Son of God became flesh to be a God-man, a man possessing both the divine nature and the human nature
That death causes the shell of the grain to be broken and destroyed, yet at the same time, the life within the grain is made active
John 12:24 says, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
Not only so, when His humanity was made alive, it was uplifted into the sonship of the only begotten Son of God
The 'only begotten son' means that there is only one son, whereas the 'firstborn son' means that there are at least two sons
Ephesians 2:5 says that God 'made us alive together with Christ,' and verse 6 says that He 'raised us up together with Him'
The second great thing accomplished by Christ in the stage of His inclusion was that He became the life-giving Spirit
Why is it that John 7 says that the Spirit was not yet because Jesus had not yet been glorified, that is, had not yet been resurrected?
Prior to the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit was not yet means that there was not yet the life-giving Spirit
In the previous stage Christ was a man in the flesh but after He had entered into resurrection He was transfigured into a lifegiving Spirit
Unless the grain of wheat is sown into the ground and dies, the life within the grain is confined within its shell
When the grain is sown into the ground and dies, the shell of the grain is broken and the life within is released
Today the truth concerning the pneumatic Christ has spread to many countries in the world, the most evident of which is Russia
In that gathering it was purposely arranged not to let the American brothers or the Chinese brothers do anything or say anything
Within a few years after the Lord's recovery spread to Russia in 1991, the Russian saints have grown in life and truth
The third great thing accomplished by Christ in the stage of His inclusion was that He regenerated the believers for His Body
The birth of Christ in resurrection was indeed a big delivery, one delivery giving birth to millions of sons of God
The first One was the firstborn Son, Christ, and the rest were the many sons, all the believers belonging to Christ
In His resurrection Christ gave Himself as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit without measure through His speaking of the words of God
Today people in the Pentecostal movement claim that if you have received the baptism of the Spirit, you must speak in tongues
The Bible says that when you receive the words of God and the words of God enter into you, you have the Spirit
Such a constitution, such a building, is consummated through dispositional sanctification , renewing , transformation , and conformation
After regenerating us, God sanctifies us in our disposition, renews us in our old creation, and transforms us in our entire being
You must be able to speak forth thoroughly concerning all the crucial points of Christ's accomplishments in His three stages
Accordingly, the brothers in Russia put these six things into practice, resulting in the situation there today
We have been working in Russia for only five years, yet, besides the two big churches raised up in Moscow and St
In addition to these, there are innumerable denominational groups that have touched the light and truth in the Lord's recovery
At the inception of the full-time training in Anaheim in 1989, we had only seventy to eighty people in the first term
We worship You that in Your recovery, for over seventy years from the past up to the present, You have never stopped Your speaking
You have even given us unprecedented light to see how You carry out Your ministry in three stages in the age of the New Testament
O Lord, You have been so patient to wait until today for us to be ready in this last age to see Your ministry in these three stages
The New Testament tells us clearly that after His resurrection, Christ in His ascension is the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power
The Lord also told us personally that, in His coming back, He will be the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven
Not only so the Gospel of John tells us that in eternity Christ as the ladder is the Son of Man on whom the angels of God ascend and descend
It is a great heresy either to deny that the Lord Jesus is the Son of Man or to say that He was the Son of Man only until His death
We have to know particularly that in His humanity Christ accomplished His judicial redemption through His death
The average people in Christianity, however, cannot say that Christ, in His humanity, accomplished His judicial redemption through His death
In this statement, the modifiers such as 'in His humanity,' 'judicial,' and 'through His death' are very precious
We need to know particularly that in His divinity Christ is carrying out His organic salvation in His resurrection
He was begotten as God's firstborn Son; second, He became the life-giving Spirit; and third, He regenerated the believers for His Body
In the third stage of His ministry, the stage of His intensification, Christ is accomplishing three great things
He is intensifying His organic salvation; second, He is producing His overcomers; and third, He is consummating the New Jerusalem
The first thing that happened in the degradation of the church was the turning away from the apostles' teaching
Concerning the degradation of the church, Paul went on to say that Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to him
If we do not experience the Lord's being with our spirit and therefore lose the presence of grace, that is the degradation of the church
Thank God, we have been fighting here for thirty-four years, and now it is more common for Christians to refer to the human spirit
Recently, the Lord also has shown us that the secret of experiencing God's organic salvation lies in 'the Spirit with our spirit'
The first thing which Christ is doing in the third stage of His intensification is to intensify His organic salvation
The organic salvation, carried out by Him as the pneumatic Christ in the second stage of His inclusion, is already adequately strong
Look at today's Catholicism and Protestantism, in the midst of which are thousands and thousands of believers, but where are the overcomers?
Today's reformed theology teaches people that God has predestinated us, and if we believe, His salvation will be accomplished in us
They see that we were chosen by God in eternity past and that God's selection and calling are forever irrevocable
Anyone who is genuinely saved will not suffer the second death; they will not be cast into the lake of fire to suffer eternal torment
In his book The Gospel of God, Brother Nee pointed out clearly that to be hurt by the second death is to be hurt by the lake of fire
Do we also ignore and are we also indifferent concerning the warning of the Bible and the Lord's call to the overcomers?
We can only wait for His return when we will stand before His judgment seat and He will judge whether we have overcome or have been defeated
If we do not mature in this age, we will be put into the darkness in the coming age to be chastised so that we may become mature
The New Jerusalem in the kingdom age is of a small scale, being constituted only with the overcomers in this age
In such a sevenfold-intensified organic salvation, we can become overcomers by Christ as the sevenfold intensified Spirit
The third thing which Christ is doing in the third stage of His intensification is to consummate the New Jerusalem
In the degradation of the church, on the negative side, there is the frustration from Satan, sin, the world, and the flesh
In the beginning of the Bible there is one single God, and at the end there is a great, corporate God the New Jerusalem
In the beginning He is a simple God, a God who is triune; at the end a city appears, and that is the corporate God
The New Jerusalem is God's enlargement and expansion, God's expression in eternity, which is the corporate God
In spite of the fact that the holy Word contains such a clear revelation, most readers of the Bible disregard the New Jerusalem
Today, the majority of Christians disregard the New Jerusalem, the tree of life, and the river of water of life
Genesis 1 says that God created man, blessed man, and told man to be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth
It is by one birth at a time, with only one pregnancy a year, and with each pregnancy lasting nine months before delivery
Perhaps some will say, 'Brother Lee, over forty years ago, didn't you hold big meetings to preach the gospel'?
We should no longer have big meetings we need to practice the vital groups and go out to visit people one by one by knocking on their doors
Suppose the Lord's recovery has two hundred fifty thousand members throughout the earth and all practice the vital groups
To be overcomers we should take the goal of God's eternal economy, the New Jerusalem, as our unique and ultimate goal
For more than seventy years You have been caring for and showing mercy to Your recovery, and You have been speaking to us to this day
Today anyone who has received some education and has studied some world history surely has learned something about Jesus Christ
Some say that only He is the true God, that He created all things, and that He became a man as the Savior to mankind
Besides those fifty-one messages, a number of messages on the Gospel of John have been given on many other occasions
Suppose when a child is noisy and refuses to eat, the mother tries to amuse him to make him happy this is cherishing
Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the Son of Man be lifted up that every one who believes into Him may have eternal life
Verse34 says For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God for He gives the Spirit not by measure this shows that He is the Son of God
In chapter four the Lord came to the well in Sychar, a city of Samaria, and met a woman who came to draw water
In chapter eight the woman who was caught committing adultery was brought to Jesus , who was surely the Son of Man
Many in the world know that Jesus Christ came to the earth two thousand years ago, but very few know what He accomplished on the earth
In the first stage He was the Son of Man in the flesh; this is the stage of His incarnation in the four Gospels
They have learned a secret, that is, they pray-read and study the message outlines, they memorize and recite them, and then they speak them
The word beware tells us that certain things are against us and are damaging us; hence, we need to be cautious and beware of them
Some brothers who may be useful in the church behave outwardly in a humble way, but in their heart they are lifted up
It is neither fitting nor proper for one to attempt to appoint elders simply because he has become a co-worker
To fulfill the obligations of the co-workers and elders, first, we need to beware of ambition, and second, we need to beware of pride
Even with Paul, the Lord was wary of his exceeding exaltation of himself, so He let him have a thorn in his flesh from Satan
Not only was he born on this earth, but he had also been down to the Paradise in Hades and even had been up to the third heaven
New convert literally newly planted one denotes a person who has recently received the Lords life but has not yet grown and developed in it
When a person is proud, he follows Satan, and consequently he will be judged with him to suffer the judgment prepared by God for him
He will have mercy on whomever He will have mercy, and He will have compassion on whomever He will have compassion
Brother Watchman Nee said that we should not be afraid of making mistakes, but we should be afraid of not having the Lord's blessing
Paul told us that if we desire to live the life of the Body of Christ, we must not think more highly of ourselves than we ought to think
In His last journey into Jerusalem, the Lord explicitly told His disciples that He would suffer death and then be resurrected
The disciples were arguing about who was greater and no one cared for what the Lord said concerning His death and resurrection
Wanting to be great and not to be a servant and wanting to be the first and not to be a slave are also a sign of pride
The apostle Paul preached not only Christ as the Lord but also himself as the believers' slave for the Lord's sake
He also testified that whoever was weak, he also was weak, and that to the weak he became weak that he might gain the weak
The third thing which the co-workers and elders need to beware of is self-justification, the justifying of oneself
In John 317 the Lord said For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world but that the world might be saved through Him
When the Lord was on the earth, He ate with tax collectors and sinners, and for this He was criticized by the Pharisees
Stanza 3 says All things of the Father are ThineAll Thou art in Spirit is mineThe Spirit makes Thee real to meThat Thou experienced might be
In a previous chapter we saw that the degradation of the church is due to our not enjoying the Christ who is in our spirit
To overcome today's degraded Christianity, we need to enjoy Christ in our spirit as our portion to be the abounding grace to us
Among us, we have the light in the books and the hymns, but we have neglected the practical experience in our living
Do we, moment by moment, touch the Spirit and receive the Lord's word that we may receive the Lord as our supply?
If we desire to announce to people the unsearchable riches of Christ, we need to experience Him richly in our living
Paul said, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
If you are late and still sit on the first row in a haughty manner, that is not the death of Christ; that is a grotesque form of pride
To discipline our children without provoking them to anger is something that we simply cannot do in our natural man
We need to beware of not magnifying Christ by living Him through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
We are the servants of Christ yet we live a life of worrying of blaming others of criticizing others of being unsatisfied and of murmuring
We should not only be wary of ambition, pride, and self-justification, which are not deadly but merely little foxes and small fleas
The co-workers and elders also have to beware of not living with Christ, not walking, working, and moving with Him
God the Father is strengthening our inner man, which is our spirit, according to His glory with power through His Spirit
When we are strengthened in this way, Christ can make His home in our heart, step by step, smoothly and without hindrance
If we want to let Christ make His home in our heart, we must give Him the room so that He may make home in our mind, emotion, and will
When these children are occupied by Him and let Him make home in every part of their being, they become Him to be His fullness
In Philippians 2:13 Paul went on to say, 'For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure'
It is this God who operates in us so that both our willing within and our working without may be according to His good pleasure
Lord, save us from oldness, from the old creation, from our old 'I,' from our old man, and from everything old
To work with God is to carry out His divine building in three aspects the church, the Body of Christ, and the New Jerusalem
In these seventy years among us in the Lord's recovery, God has given us a thorough interpretation and analysis of the New Jerusalem
The Triune God is the flowing God with the Father as the fountain, the Son as the spring, and the Spirit as the river
The Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as the fountain, the spring, and the river gives us to drink of Him daily
In a preceding chapter we said that in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body and were all given to drink one Spirit
In the New Jerusalem there is not only the Triune God as our river of water of life, but there is also the tree of life in the river
In His first stage there was only the mentioning of the church ; there was not yet the actual building of the church
We need to establish and shepherd the churches by the pneumatic Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit, with His organic salvation
In Revelation, Christ has become the sevenfold intensified Spirit to build and constitute the Body of Christ in a sevenfold intensified way
In the divine and mystical realm, building and constituting are the same thing; we may call it building-constituting
To know how to build up the Body of Christ, we must study thoroughly the messages given in chapters two and three
If you build with wood, grass, and stubble, your work will be consumed, but you yourself will be saved, yet so as through fire
Whenever we touch the eternal goal of God, the New Jerusalem, we need to be very pure; we must not be careless
Once a certain pastor ridiculed me, saying, 'You know only to imitate Brother Nee's speaking; whatever he speaks, you speak'
