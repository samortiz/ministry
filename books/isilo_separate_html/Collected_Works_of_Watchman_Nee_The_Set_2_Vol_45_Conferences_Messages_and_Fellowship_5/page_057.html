The greatest temptation they face in trying to know God's will is their constant introspection, self-analysis, and attempt to find what is of God and what is of themselves. They want to know what is of the spirit and what is of the soul, what is spiritual and what is carnal. Such ones will never understand God's will. For man to make judgments in himself will result in nothing but error. In John 13&mdash;15 Philip, Peter, Thomas, and Judas asked many questions, but in chapter fourteen the Lord told them that a day would come when they would no longer need to ask anything, because the Holy Spirit would teach them of all things when He came (v. 26). When a person asks questions, this proves that he does not have the presence of the Holy Spirit. Those who know the Spirit do not need to ask questions. Those who have God, who have the anointing, and who have God's word are clear within; they do not need to ask anything.</p><p>In Psalm 139:23 the psalmist asked God to search and know his heart. This is because man's heart is wicked above all things. A man can deceive himself; he can be cheated to think that he is the best. But in the eyes of God, what we consider the best may be the worst. God never asks us to engage in introspection. He never asks us to discern what is of the spirit and what is of the soul. This is not the responsibility of the Christian; it is the responsibility of the word of God. God's word is living and is sharper than any two-edged sword. It can divide and cut asunder man's spirit and soul. Some may say, "I have read the Bible a few times, but I do not feel that my spirit and soul have been divided." We must realize that the dividing of the spirit and the soul has to do with our seeing. It has to do with revelation, not with our studying. Those who strive to know are living in darkness; they are not living by the law of life.</p><p>Those who have not seen the light may think that they have been a good Christian for many years. They love the brothers and sisters, offer material offerings, and have dealt with sin and the world, etc. They may be very satisfied with themselves, and others may say that they are good Christians, having received much help from them. But when God's light shines on them, they will see that many of their so-called good works are actually the most defiled and offensive works in the eyes of God. They will discover many of the things they do are actually sins in the eyes of God. Revelation can never come about through human wisdom. Before Paul was saved, he opposed Christ and persecuted the Christians, thinking that he was serving God. He was the most zealous among all the Judaizers and was more advanced than his contemporaries, yet he was opposing God's work. A man may think that his motives are pure, that he is for God, but in reality he may be doing a work that is against God. Such a one is living in darkness; he does not have God's light. Today the dividing line between everything rests with God's word. Once we have light within, we will see everything. This is totally different from the knowledge of good and evil that is spoken of in Genesis 2 and 3.</p><p>I am not saying that it is useless to read and study the Bible, and I am not saying that it is useless to listen to messages. I am saying that these things alone cannot solve our problems. What we need is God's light. When the living word of God comes, we can no longer live as before. God's word will kill us, and His light will remove all that is not of God. We may think that we have a great deal of goodness in us, but when God reveals Himself, we will see that all of our goodness is but refuse. Then we will begin to gain spiritual knowledge. Our faculties will become more exercised. We will be able to discriminate between good and evil, and we will grow and mature.</p><p>At the beginning of his Christian life, a Christian should not analyze himself. He should not ask so many questions; instead, he should learn to look to the Lord and ask the Lord for revelation and light. Once he has the light, he will be able to discriminate between good and evil. His mouth may not be able to clearly articulate the difference, but his inner being will be very clear. The real issue is whether or not one has God's word and God's light. When God's word comes, the thoughts and intents of the heart will be divided and exposed like the bone and the marrow. The human mind is incapable of understanding the things of the Spirit. The things of the Spirit are things that eyes have not seen, ears have not heard,  and hearts have not imagined (1 Cor. 2:9). The soulish man cannot comprehend the things of God (v. 14). Inward judgment has nothing to do with good and evil or even the apparent right and wrong of matters. It has to do with God's word within us. It is God's word that divides the spirit and the soul. Only God's word can operate this way.</p><p>I used to work in Amoy. Sometimes when the work was finished, I would find the result encouraging; men had received help and rewarded me with praises. But deep within, I felt like something had snapped; I felt like a deflated tire. At other times the result of the work would be the same, but I found myself filled with strength inwardly, more so than before I had worked. All the workers should learn from the Lord, who in quenching the Samaritan woman's thirst, was filled Himself. If a work does not bring inward satisfaction, there must be something wrong with the work. The Lord's food was to do the will of the One who had sent Him and to finish His work (John 4:34). A worker must learn to seek after God's word and to work according to His living guidance. He should not work according to what he thinks is good, but according to what the Lord thinks is good.</p><p>After a man is regenerated, the first thing he should do is to allow God's word to come into him and to divide his spirit and soul. I do not know how many of the things that we have done were done out of ourselves, our ideas, and our concepts of good. We even considered them to be God's will. Many people need to repent and confess for what they have repented and confessed about. Many times even our tears are unclean in the eyes of the Lord, and they need the cleansing of the blood. We must see the worldliness of the love that we have known. We must see that the fellowship that we have known has been nothing more than social enjoyment. The light of the cross must come into us to wreck us and expose our wickedness. If we have never passed through such a thorough experience, we may bear the cross, do our work, exercise our love, preach our gospel, and render our help to others. But one day we will find that all these things have been done in ignorance. May the Lord be merciful to us. May He give us the light. May we be torn down and broken so that we will have the spiritual sight and will have a proper spiritual discrimination.</p><h2 class="head1">A PRAYER</h2><p>Lord, although man's word can disappear, may Your word be remembered. May the self be checked, and may we all receive a light like Paul's. May Your light kill us. May You answer us not according to our prayer, but according to Your riches and supply. In Your name we pray, amen.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> </body></html>
