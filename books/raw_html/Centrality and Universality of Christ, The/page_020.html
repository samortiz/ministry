<P>We know that we are identified with Christ and one with Christ. However, we have to realize that this oneness is possible only in the spirit, not in the body nor in the mind nor in the soulish life. We are one with the Lord in the spirit. The Lord is the Spirit, we have a spirit, and these two spirits are mingled as one. The divine Spirit is life to the human spirit, and the human spirit is the container, the vessel, to contain and express the divine Spirit. I have no human word to express what is on my heart and in my spirit about this matter. It is something too great and wonderful.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, I would ask you to read again the sixty-six books of the Bible, look into the universe, and consider what the central point in the divine thought is. The central point in the divine thought is that this wonderful divine Spirit wants to come into this little human spirit. This is the key, the secret, of the whole universe, and this is the very center of the sixty-six books of the Bible. These sixty-six books tell us a great number of things, but the very center of all the things mentioned in these books is this wonderful oneness. Christ, as the substance of the Divine Trinity, as the Spirit, comes into our spirit to dwell in it and to be one with us. There is nothing that can be more subjective than this.</P><P>Now let us turn to 2 Timothy 4:22: "The Lord be with your spirit." At the end of the two Timothys you have such a "hidden" verse. I say "hidden" because it was hidden to me for over thirty years. I had read the New Testament again and again, and I knew many things in 1 and 2 Timothy, but I did not notice this verse which says, "The Lord be with your spirit." It is regretful that many Christians today do not even know that they have a spirit. You have the heavenly King in your home, yet you do not know in which room He is. Many Christians simply do not know what the human spirit is and where the human spirit is. However, 2 Timothy 4:22 tells us that the Lord is with our spirit.</P><P>You all know where your ears, eyes, nose, lips, tongue, stomach, hands, and feet are. You also know that you have a mind and a heart. But do you know that besides all these you have a spirit within you? First Thessalonians 5:23 says that you have a spirit, a soul, and a body. The spirit is a part distinct from the soul and the body. I have the burden to stir up your heart to pay attention to the fact that you have a part in you which is the spirit. You have a room in your building, yet you do not know where that room is. You have to find the room and open the door, and you will see the heavenly King in it. In your building there is such a wonderful room, a secret chamber, where He is.</P><P>We have a spirit. Otherwise, this Bible is a lie. We all believe that the Bible is the Word of God. In this Word we are told clearly that the Lord is with us in our spirit. Even though very few Christians today know that they have a spirit and very few know how to exercise their spirit, the Bible clearly says that the Lord, the living One, the all-inclusive One, the central One, the universal One, is today subjectively in our spirit. Whether we know it or not, this matter is clearly revealed in the Word.</P>
