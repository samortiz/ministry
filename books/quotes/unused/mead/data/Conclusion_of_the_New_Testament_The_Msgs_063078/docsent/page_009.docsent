   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Raising the Dead</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On certain occasions the Lord performed the great miracle of raising the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Luke 7:11-17 we have the case of the Lord's raising up the dead son of a widow in the city of Nain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"As He came near the gate of the city, behold, one who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a considerable crowd from the city was with her.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And seeing her, the Lord had compassion on her, and said to her, Do not weep" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This case was unique in its misery the only son of a widow was being carried in the coffin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's compassion was also unique in His loving sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He volunteered, in His tender mercy, His power of resurrection to raise the widow's son from death, without being asked to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"He touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And He said, Young man, I say to you, arise!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And the dead man sat up and began to speak; and He gave him to his mother" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His raising up the dead son and giving him to his mother, we see the expression of Christ's divine attributes in His human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Another case of Christ's raising the dead is that of Lazarus in John 11.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 25 the Lord said to Martha, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me, even if he should die, shall live."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here the Lord Jesus spoke in the present tense, saying, "I am the resurrection and the life."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The words "I am" indicate that He is Jehovah, the great I Am, the One with whom there is no time element.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because Christ is resurrection, whenever He is present, resurrection is there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord proceeded to demonstrate this fact by raising up Lazarus: "He cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And he who died came out" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>43-44 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Lazarus heard the voice of the living Lord, he was quickened and was raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This case of resurrection indicates that the Lord Jesus is not merely a healing Savior but a life-giving Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wants not only to heal us but to give us life, to resurrect us. d.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Casting Out Demons</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus also cast out demons Matt 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Mark 1:23-28 we have a case of the casting out of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A man with an unclean spirit cried out, and the Lord Jesus rebuked him saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This unclean spirit was not a fallen angel; this spirit was a demon vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>32, 34, 39; Luke 4:33 , one of the spirits of the living creatures who lived in the preadamic age and were judged by God when they joined Satan's rebellion see Life-study of Genesis, Message Two .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The fallen angels work with Satan in the air Eph 2:2; 6:11-12 , and these demons, the unclean spirits, move with him on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Both act evilly upon man for the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The possession of people by demons signifies Satan's usurpation of man, whom God created for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus came to destroy the works of Satan 1 John 3:8 , and in His earthly ministry He cast out demons from the possessed people Mark 1:34, 39; 3:15; 6:7, 13; 16:17 so that they might be delivered from Satan's bondage Luke 13:16 , out of Satan's authority of darkness Acts 26:18; Col 1:13 , into God's kingdom Mark 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Matthew 12:28 the Lord Jesus says, "If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Spirit of God is the power of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Where the Spirit of God is in power, there the kingdom of God is, and there the demons have no ground.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By the Lord's word here we see that the battle fought for the kingdom is not fought by man alone but by a man with the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus said that He cast out demons by the Spirit of God and that this is the coming of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Doing Signs</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In His ministry on earth the Lord Jesus did signs, many of which are recorded in the Gospel of John John 20:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A sign is a symbol with a particular significance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Gospel of John is a book of signs, not of miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Matthew, Mark, and Luke we read of miracles, but in the Gospel of John the word "miracle" is not used.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead this Gospel speaks of signs.</S>
