The church and the kingdom are corporate persons. In this message we will begin to consider another corporate person-the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head1>I. THE JERUSALEM ABOVE</h2><p>The New Jerusalem, the most mysterious and puzzling matter in the Bible, is first mentioned not in Revelation 21 but in Galatians 4. Galatians 4:26 speaks of &#8220;the Jerusalem above,&#8221; that is, the heavenly Jerusalem in contrast to the earthly Jerusalem.<h2 class=head2>A. Representing the New Covenant</h2><p>As indicated by Paul&#8217;s word in Galatians 4:22-26, the Jerusalem above represents the new covenant. In these verses two women, who correspond to the earthly Jerusalem and the heavenly Jerusalem, symbolize two covenants. Paul says, &#8220;For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one of the maidservant and one of the free woman. But the one of the maidservant was born according to flesh, and the one of the free woman through the promise. Which things are an allegory; for these are two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, bringing forth children unto slavery, which is Hagar. Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the Jerusalem which now is, for she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free, who is our mother.&#8221; Of the two covenants mentioned in verse 24, one is the covenant of promise to Abraham, which is related to the New Testament, the covenant of grace, and the other is the covenant of law related to Moses, which has nothing to do with the New Testament. Sarah, the free woman, who corresponds to the Jerusalem above, represents the covenant of promise, and Hagar, the maidservant, who corresponds to the earthly Jerusalem, represents the covenant of law.<p>In verse 25 Paul speaks of &#8220;the Jerusalem which now is.&#8221; Jerusalem, as the choice of God (1 Kings 14:21; Psa. 48:2, 8), should belong to the covenant of promise represented by Sarah. However, because it brings God&#8217;s chosen people into the bondage of law, it corresponds to Mount Sinai, which belongs to the covenant of law represented by Hagar. The Jerusalem above, on the contrary, is related to the covenant of promise. Therefore, according to the context, the Jerusalem above represents the new covenant.<h2 class=head2>B. The Mother of the New Testament Believers, Bringing Them Forth through Grace</h2><p>In Galatians 4:26 Paul tells us that the Jerusalem above is our mother. The mother of the Judaizers is the earthly Jerusalem, but the mother of the believers is the heavenly Jerusalem, which will eventually be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth (Rev. 21:1-2). She is the mother of the New Testament believers, who are not slaves under law but sons under grace. We, the New Testament believers, have all been born of her from above.<h2 class=head3>1. Composed of Sons</h2><p>According to Revelation 21, the New Jerusalem will be the wife of Christ (vv. 2, 9-10) and also the tabernacle of God, His habitation (v. 3). Revelation 21:7 indicates that the wife of Christ is composed of sons. As the sons of God, we are the components of the New Jerusalem, which is the wife of Christ. Since we are the components of the New Jerusalem and since the New Jerusalem, the Jerusalem above, is our mother, we, the sons, are the components of the mother. Hence, the New Jerusalem is Christ&#8217;s wife and our mother. On the one hand, we have been born of this mother; on the other hand, this mother is composed of us as the sons.<h2 class=head3>2. The City for Which Abraham Was Looking</h2><p>The mother of the believers is the city for which Abraham was looking. &#8220;He waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Maker is God&#8221; (Heb. 11:10). This city is identified in Hebrews 12:22, which tells us that we have come to the heavenly Jerusalem, the wife of Christ and the mother of the New Testament believers composed of the sons of God, who have been born of her. The wife of Christ is thus the city for which Abraham was waiting and to which we have come.<p>Abraham certainly was not waiting for a physical, material city. A material city could not be the wife of Christ or the mother of the believers. Furthermore, a material city could not be composed of all the saved ones as the sons of God. If the New Jerusalem, the Jerusalem above, were a physical entity, how could this city produce us as her children? How could our producing mother be a physical city built with actual gold, pearls, and precious stones, which are not organic and which cannot produce anything? This, of course, is impossible. We should not understand the New Jerusalem in a physical, material sense, for it is altogether a spiritual entity. Only the natural, uneducated mind, a mind that lacks adequate biblical knowledge, understands the New Jerusalem in this way. If our mind has been enlightened and renewed and if we have been adequately educated spiritually, we shall not have the mistaken understanding that the New Jerusalem is a material entity. Rather, we shall realize that the New Jerusalem as the wife of Christ and the mother of the New Testament believers is a spiritual entity.<p>In eternity past God had a plan according to His good pleasure. In the New Testament this plan is called the economy of God. According to His plan, God created the heavens, the earth, and billions of items. He then created man as the center of His creation. God&#8217;s intention in His creation of man was that man would be His expression and His representative. Therefore, man was created in the image of God. Then man was given dominion over all created things, especially the things on earth.<p>The man created by God was deceived by the enemy and fell again and again until his situation became hopeless. In a sense, after Babel God gave man up, but He did not do this absolutely. God chose one of the fallen men-Abraham-to be the head and father of a new race. In the Bible this new race is considered the chosen race. Adam was the head of the created race, which was given up by God, and Abraham was the head of the new race, which was chosen by God.<p>God&#8217;s choosing Abraham to be the father of the new race is related to the New Jerusalem and to our understanding of it. In choosing Abraham it was not God&#8217;s intention simply to restore fallen man to his original, God-created condition. Rather, in choosing Abraham God&#8217;s intention was to carry out His economy. God&#8217;s economy is to produce, to bring forth, many sons. Therefore, God&#8217;s intention in choosing Abraham was not to restore man to man&#8217;s original condition in God&#8217;s creation but to bring forth many sons. All that God did with Abraham from the first step to the last was according to this principle.<h2 class=head3>3. A Matter of God&#8217;s Grace</h2><p>God&#8217;s goal of bringing forth many sons is accomplished not by man&#8217;s work but by God&#8217;s grace. What is God&#8217;s grace? Contrary to the concept of many, God&#8217;s grace is not merely unmerited favor. According to the divine revelation in the New Testament, grace is actually God Himself given to His chosen people for their enjoyment, and this enjoyment will make them God&#8217;s sons.<p>This understanding of the grace of God is found in the Gospel of John. In John 1 we see that the Word, who is the very God, became flesh (vv. 1, 14) and that grace came with Him (v. 17). This means that He came as grace. According to John 1, God came as grace to be received by His chosen ones. Verses 12 and 13 say, &#8220;As many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&#8221; Whoever believes in Him and receives Him will be born of Him to become one of His children. Therefore, by giving Himself to His chosen people as grace, God brings forth many sons.<p>Two other verses which indicate that grace is God Himself are Galatians 2:20 and 1 Corinthians 15:10. In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, &#8220;It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.&#8221; In 1 Corinthians 15:10 he says, &#8220;Not I, but the grace of God with me.&#8221; Taken together, these verses indicate that grace is Christ Himself as the embodiment of the processed Triune God. Hence, grace is nothing less than the processed Triune God given to His chosen people to bring forth many sons.<p>When God called Abraham, He called him with the intention of producing many sons. Because these sons are brought forth by God&#8217;s grace, God did not ask Abraham to work for Him. God desired only that Abraham would agree with Him to believe in what He intended to do. Abraham did believe this, and his believing was considered by God to be righteousness. &#8220;He believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness&#8221; (Gen. 15:6). Here we have the base for the teaching concerning justification by faith. Paul expounded this basic teaching in the New Testament (Rom. 3:21-31; Gal. 3:6-9). God&#8217;s intention is to produce many sons by dispensing Himself into His chosen people as grace. At least to some extent, this was made known to Abraham, and he accepted it and believed in it. As a result, he was counted as righteous in the eyes of God.<p>In Genesis 15 God promised Abraham that he would have an heir, and Abraham believed God. However, in the very next chapter, because Abraham did not have a child by Sarah, he followed Sarah&#8217;s suggestion to have a child by Hagar, her handmaid. Hagar gave birth to a son, and he was called Ishmael. Abraham&#8217;s having a child by Hagar was displeasing to God, and He did not appear again to Abraham for thirteen years. When the Lord appeared to Abraham again, He said to him, &#8220;I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly&#8221; (Gen. 17:1-2). The Lord indicated to Abraham that His grace would produce a son by him. But what Abraham had done by himself was of the flesh and as such was condemned by God. Nevertheless, Abraham said to God, &#8220;O that Ishmael might live before thee!&#8221; (v. 18). The Lord then said to Abraham, &#8220;Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him&#8221; (v. 19).<p>In Genesis 18 the Lord appeared to Abraham again and said to him, &#8220;I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son&#8221; (v. 10a). This indicates that the bringing forth of Isaac would be of the Lord&#8217;s coming. This may be compared to Mary&#8217;s bringing forth of Jesus being the coming of the Triune God. Eventually, Sarah did give birth to Isaac (Gen. 21:1-3).<p>God told Abraham to send Ishmael away, saying, &#8220;In Isaac shall thy seed be called&#8221; (Gen. 21:12). God never recognized Ishmael as Abraham&#8217;s heir, for He regarded Isaac as the unique son. Isaac as the unique son of Abraham was brought forth through God&#8217;s grace, not through the natural ability of either Abraham or Sarah. The producing of Isaac was altogether a matter of God&#8217;s grace, that is, of God Himself given to His chosen people to produce His many sons. Ishmael, on the contrary, was produced by Abraham&#8217;s natural ability and strength.<p>Let us now consider Galatians 4 in the light of Abraham&#8217;s experience in Genesis. In this chapter Paul tells us that Hagar signifies the law symbolized by the earthly Jerusalem and that Sarah signifies grace symbolized by the heavenly Jerusalem. Hence, Hagar and Sarah represent two covenants-the covenant of law and the covenant of grace. The law is a matter of man&#8217;s labor with man&#8217;s ability to produce something, whereas grace is God given to His chosen people to produce the many sons.<p>It was not God&#8217;s intention to make a covenant of law with Abraham. The covenant of law was something additional; it was not the original covenant. The original covenant God made with Abraham was the covenant of grace. In this covenant there is not the need for man&#8217;s ability or effort but the need for God&#8217;s grace to produce the many sons. This covenant equals the new testament. This means that the covenant God made with Abraham was actually the new testament. The new testament is, therefore, a continuation of the covenant God made with Abraham. All of Abraham&#8217;s genuine descendants, such as Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and David, were under this covenant, which is the covenant we are under today. They were not under the covenant of law. Although the covenant of law was given through Moses, he himself was not under that covenant. Rather, in the sight of God, Moses was under the covenant of grace. The covenant of law cannot produce anything for God; this covenant can only bring forth &#8220;Ishmaels.&#8221;<p>The new testament is a full continuation of the covenant of grace God made with Abraham to produce sons. The first of the sons produced by this covenant was Abraham himself. Abraham is the father of all those who believe (Rom. 4:11). But this father was the first son produced by the covenant of grace. Other sons in the Old Testament include Jacob, David, and Jeremiah but not Esau.<p>In Revelation 12:1 there is a vision of the universal bright woman, &#8220;a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.&#8221; This woman is the totality of God&#8217;s chosen people. In Genesis 37:9 Joseph in his dream saw the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars, signifying his father, his mother, and his eleven brothers. There the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars plus Joseph himself signified the total composition of God&#8217;s people on earth. Based upon the principle of that dream, the sun, the moon, and the twelve stars in Revelation 12:1 must signify the totality of God&#8217;s people, which is here symbolized by a woman. This woman is constituted of God&#8217;s people from three ages: the age of the patriarchs-the stars; the age of the law-the moon; and the age of grace-the sun. The totality of God&#8217;s people first includes the patriarchs as the stars and then the genuine Israelites as the moon and all the believers in Christ as the sun. According to Revelation 12, the universal woman also will produce a son, the man-child (v. 5).<p>Both Hagar and Sarah brought forth a child. Hagar, who signifies the old covenant, the covenant of law, brought forth an improper child-Ishmael; Sarah, who signifies the new covenant, the covenant of grace, brought forth a proper child-Isaac.<p>We have seen that Sarah signifies both the Jerusalem from above and the new covenant, the new testament. This indicates that the New Jerusalem is the new covenant. The New Jerusalem is many things, one of which is the new covenant. On the one hand, the New Jerusalem is the new covenant; on the other hand, the new covenant produces the New Jerusalem. This is what the Lord promised to Abraham, and this is what Abraham looked to and waited for.<p>Hebrews 12:22-24 says, &#8220;You have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the universal gathering, and to the church of the firstborn ones who have been enrolled in the heavens, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men who have been made perfect, and to Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks better than that of Abel.&#8221; The woman who is our mother in Galatians 4 is the new covenant. We have been born under the new covenant, and the Jerusalem from above is our mother. This woman is the new covenant and our mother, and our mother is the grace of God. In Hebrews 12 we have come to the church, which is composed of us as believers. Hence, by coming to the church we come to ourselves, for we are the church, and the church is we. We and the church are one. The principle is the same with the New Jerusalem as our mother in Galatians 4. The woman is the sons, and the sons are the mother. Furthermore, the mother is grace, and grace is the mother, because we all have been born of grace and through grace. This mother is also the new covenant, and the new covenant is the mother. Finally, the new covenant is also the holy city, Jerusalem from above.<p>Eventually, the mother, Jerusalem from above, is one with the Father. The Father is the grace-giver; the grace is the covenant; the covenant is the city, the Jerusalem above, who is our mother; the sons produced by the mother are the components of the mother; and the mother returns to the Father to be one with Him, having come out from the Father and then going back to the Father as the destination.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In this message we will consider some further matters regarding the Jerusalem above being the mother of the believers.<h2 class=head3>4. The New Covenant of Grace</h2><p>Galatians 4:26-28 and 31 reveal that the New Jerusalem is the mother of the believers. This mother is the Jerusalem above, the heavenly Jerusalem. In Galatians 4 Hagar symbolizes the old covenant of the law that condemns and brings in death, producing children unto slavery (vv. 24-25), whereas Sarah symbolizes the new covenant of grace that justifies and brings in life, producing children unto freedom (vv. 26-28, 31). The New Jerusalem, the heavenly Jerusalem, the Jerusalem above, is our mother, and this mother is the new covenant of grace. The new covenant is our mother because it brought us forth as children of freedom.<p>The children brought forth by the old covenant of the law are the children of Hagar. The new covenant of grace brings forth children of freedom by God as grace to enjoy the Triune God, not by human effort to keep the law. Furthermore, the children of the Jerusalem above, that is, the children produced by the new covenant, become the components of their mother. It surely is a mystery that the children of this mother become the components of the mother.<p>The center of the New Jerusalem, which is the mother of the believers, is God and the Lamb on the throne (Rev. 22:1). This is the Triune God as the center and element of the mother of the believers. The Triune God is also the element of the new covenant of grace. Grace is the processed Triune God for our enjoyment. Because the new covenant brings us God Himself for our enjoyment, it is called the new covenant of grace. Furthermore, the Triune God is the element, essence, and nature of the children of freedom. The Triune God is thus the element and substance of the components of the mother. Finally, the Triune God is the center, substance, element, and essence of the ultimate consummation of the Scriptures-the New Jerusalem.<p>From the foregoing we see that the mother of the believers, the new covenant of grace, the components of the mother, and the New Jerusalem are all one. The ultimate consummation of the divine revelation in the Holy Scriptures and of everything the Triune God has done and achieved is the New  Jerusalem, which is the composition of the Triune God mingling Himself with the redeemed, regenerated, and transformed tripartite man.<p>To receive the new covenant and to keep it is to come to the heavenly Jerusalem and to the church (Heb. 8:7-13; 12:22-23). The new covenant, the heavenly Jerusalem, and the church are one. In order to understand this we need to see the link between Galatians and Hebrews. Galatians deals with Judaism, warning the believers not to backslide into Judaism but to stay in grace. Hebrews charges us not to drift into the old covenant but to remain in the new covenant. Chapters seven through ten of Hebrews are on the better covenant, the new covenant. Hebrews 8 indicates that the old covenant is over and that the new covenant has come in to replace it. Then in Hebrews 12 Paul tells us that we have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, and to the church (vv. 22-23).<p>To come to the new covenant is to come to the New Jerusalem. Without Galatians 4 as a background, it would be very difficult to understand this. Galatians 4 reveals that the mother of the believers, who is the Jerusalem above, the New Jerusalem, is the new covenant of grace symbolized by Sarah. To come to the new covenant is to come not only to the New Jerusalem but also to the church (Heb. 12:23). To keep the new covenant is to remain in the New Jerusalem. This indicates that we are not going to the New Jerusalem but that we are in the New Jerusalem already. The tense of the verb in Hebrews 12:22 is the perfect tense, &#8220;have come,&#8221; not the future tense. We know that we have come to the New Jerusalem because the New Jerusalem is the new covenant. Because we have received the new covenant, we have entered into the New Jerusalem. The receiving of the new covenant is the entering into the New Jerusalem.<p>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God passing through the long process of His new covenant. Without the Triune God, the new covenant would be an empty shell. The Triune God in His new covenant is dispensing Himself into us, making us the components of His ultimate consummation. Hence, the ultimate consummation will not be the Triune God alone; it will be the mingling of the processed Triune God with His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed tripartite people. This will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.<p>In Galatians 4 Paul tells us that the two women-the maidservant Hagar and the free woman Sarah-are two covenants, the covenant of law and the covenant of promise. Each of these women brought forth a son. Hagar gave birth to Ishmael, and Sarah gave birth to Isaac. Ishmael signifies the produce of the covenant of the law, and Isaac signifies the produce of the covenant of grace.<h2 class=head3>5. The Father, the Grace, the Mother, the Sons, the City, and the Covenant</h2><p>Concerning the Jerusalem from above, there are six vital matters: the Father, the grace, the mother, the sons, the city, and the covenant. The covenant of promise is surely a matter of grace. It is clearly revealed in the New Testament that grace is God Himself, and God Himself is the Father. Hence, God the Father is the grace. According to Galatians 4, this grace, which produces the many sons of God, is the mother. How can the grace be both the Father and the mother? The answer is that the Father through grace becomes the mother. When the Father is given, He is the Father. When what He gives of Himself is used in function, it becomes the mother. The Father is the grace, and the grace becomes the mother, who produces the sons, and the sons are the components of the mother. Furthermore, the mother is the city, the Jerusalem above, and the city is the covenant. The covenant is a covenant of grace, for it is altogether a matter of grace. Therefore, we have God the Father, the grace, the mother, the sons born of the mother, the city, which is the mother, and the covenant, which is of grace and which is the embodiment of grace.<p>God the Father is the grace given to us. Before this grace came, it was promised. Hence, it was the promised grace, that is, the promise of grace. Just as the promise of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself, so the promise of grace is the grace itself. This grace promised is the producer, and this producer is the mother. The mother is the city, the Jerusalem above, and the city is the covenant. In Galatians 4 the two women are two covenants, and the two covenants refer to two cities, one of which is the city above, the Jerusalem above, who is our mother.<p>Eventually, the Father, the grace, the mother, the sons, the city, and the covenant will become one entity-the New Jerusalem. In the last two chapters of the Bible, Revelation 21 and 22, we see the New Jerusalem, a unique entity, in the center of the new heaven and new earth. The New Jerusalem is a composition of God, of God&#8217;s grace, of God&#8217;s covenant, of the mother, and of all her sons. All these combine to produce the one entity of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is produced by the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us as grace to bring us forth as God&#8217;s many sons. These sons compose the New Jerusalem, which is our mother.<h2 class=head3>6. A Matter of Dispensing, Mingling, and Expression</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a matter of dispensing, mingling, and expression. First, the processed Triune God is dispensed into His chosen people. Then the processed, consummated Triune God mingles Himself with His redeemed and regenerated tripartite people to perfect, transform, and glorify them. Eventually, there will be the universal and eternal expression of the processed and consummated Triune God. Therefore, with respect to the New Jerusalem, the words dispensing, mingling, and expression are very meaningful.<p>The Jerusalem above is the city Abraham was looking for (Heb. 11:10). This is also the city to which we have come (Heb. 12:22), the city which is the mother who has produced us as sons of God. This city, a unique entity in the universe, comprises the Triune God, the grace of God, the mother, the covenant, the believers, the church, and the kingdom. This city, the New Jerusalem, will be the ultimate consummation of the divine dispensing and the divine mingling for the eternal and ultimate expression of the processed Triune God. May we all have a clear view of this marvelous entity.<h2 class=head3>7. Not a Material City</h2><p>If we have a clear view and proper understanding of the Jerusalem above, the New Jerusalem, we will realize that such an entity cannot possibly be a material, physical city. A material city cannot be the covenant or the grace. Moreover, a material city cannot be the producing mother nor the composition of the many sons of God. With a material city there cannot be the divine dispensing or the divine mingling with humanity. Finally, with a material city there is no divine expression.<h2 class=head3>8. Our Ultimate Destination</h2><p>Throughout the centuries, the believers have not had a complete, overall view of the New Jerusalem. For this reason, the crucial matter of the New Jerusalem has been a mystery. The entire Bible consummates with the New Jerusalem. If we do not have the vision and proper understanding of the New Jerusalem, we will not have answers to our questions concerning our ultimate destination. Neither will we have the knowledge of genuine, biblical eschatology. However, if we have seen an overall vision of the New Jerusalem, we will know what our destination is. We shall realize that not only are we going to the New Jerusalem but that we have already come to it. The marvelous entity of the New Jerusalem is what Abraham was looking for and waiting for. He was looking for this, and we have come to it. Not only have we come to the New Jerusalem-we are parts, components, of the New Jerusalem.<p>The fact that we are parts of the New Jerusalem is indicated by the word in Revelation 21 concerning the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles. Verse 12 tells us that the city has &#8220;twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.&#8221; The names of the twelve tribes represent all the Old Testament saints. Verse 14 says, &#8220;The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.&#8221; The names of the twelve apostles represent all the New Testament saints. Therefore, the New Jerusalem is a composition of the Old Testament saints, represented by Israel, and the New Testament saints, represented by the apostles. Since the New Jerusalem is such a composition, we have a strong basis for saying that we are parts, components, of the New Jerusalem.<p>The use of the number twelve in the description of the New Jerusalem indicates multiplication and mingling. Multiplication is shown by the fact that the city is square, having four sides. On each side there are three gates (Rev. 21:13). The number twelve here is the product of three multiplied by four. This kind of multiplication is surely a mingling. The number three signifies the Triune God, and the number four signifies man as God&#8217;s creature. Therefore, the New Jerusalem is a matter of three multiplied by four, that is, a matter of divinity mingled with humanity to produce a marvelous entity for the eternal expression of the processed Triune God.<p>The New Jerusalem is the conclusion of the entire divine revelation. The New Jerusalem is also the central and ultimate consummated significance of the entire divine revelation. The record concerning this wonderful entity in Revelation 21 and 22 could not have been written by anyone other than the Triune God Himself. Only He has the wisdom to speak of an entity that is the tabernacle of God and also His wife. Only He could compose these chapters that speak of a city with twelve foundations and twelve gates, a city that is pure gold and that has the glory of God (Rev. 21:18, 11). The vision of the New Jerusalem was given to the apostle John, but this vision has a source, and the source is the Triune God. Therefore, we may have full assurance regarding the truth, the reality, of the heavenly Jerusalem presented in Revelation 21 and 22. The revelation concerning the New Jerusalem was put into writing by John, but for centuries it has not been properly and fully understood by God&#8217;s people. How we thank the Lord for giving us a clear view of the New Jerusalem! Having this view, we may be certain of our destination. Our ultimate destination is the heavenly city, the Jerusalem above, the New Jerusalem.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><p>In the two foregoing messages we saw that the New Jerusalem is the Jerusalem above, which represents the new covenant and which is the mother of the believers. In this message we will go on to see that the New Jerusalem is the city of the living God.<h2 class=head1>II. THE CITY OF THE LIVING GOD</h2><p>Hebrews 12:22 speaks of &#8220;the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem.&#8221; This is &#8220;the Jerusalem above&#8221; (Gal. 4:26), &#8220;the holy city, New Jerusalem&#8221; (Rev. 21:2; 3:12) which God has prepared for His people (Heb. 11:16). It is also &#8220;the tabernacle of God&#8221; in which God will dwell with men for eternity (Rev. 21:3). The patriarchs waited for this city, and we also should seek it.<h2 class=head2>A. The Heavenly Jerusalem</h2><p>According to Hebrews 12:22, the city of the living God is the heavenly Jerusalem. This verse does not say that Jerusalem is in the heavens but that it is the heavenly Jerusalem. This city is heavenly in nature.<h2 class=head2>B. The City Having the Foundations</h2><p>The New Jerusalem as the city of the living God is the city having the foundations (Heb. 11:10). These foundations, which are solid and unshakable, are composed of twelve kinds of precious stones represented by the twelve apostles (Rev. 21:19-20). As men created by God, the apostles originally were clay, but they were regenerated and then transformed into precious stones for God&#8217;s eternal building. Ephesians 2:20 tells us that the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. In Hebrews 11:10 we see that the city has the foundations, and in Revelation 21:19 and 20 we see the twelve foundations of the city.<h2 class=head3>1. Prepared by God</h2><p>The city of the living God, the city having the foundations, has been prepared by God. Hebrews 11:16b says, &#8220;He has prepared for them a city.&#8221; This preparation is the process which the processed Triune God has gone through, including incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. This preparation is also to bring forth the New Testament believers as the sons of God to be the components of the mother, who is the city, and to build them together with the divine element of the Triune God and the spiritual work of the Spirit of the Triune God. This preparation is just the eternal redemption accomplished by our very God in His divine trinity through the process He has gone through and the work consummated by Him according to His eternal economy.<h2 class=head3>2. Designed and Built by God</h2><p>This city was designed and built by God. Hebrews 11:10 tells us that the Architect and Maker of this city is God. The Greek word translated &#8220;architect&#8221; in this verse can also be translated as either &#8220;builder&#8221; or &#8220;artificer.&#8221; This indicates that God is a skillful designer and a top craftsman.<p>Ephesians 2:10 tells us that the church is God&#8217;s masterpiece. The Greek word for masterpiece is poiema which means something written or composed as a poem. The church is a poem written by God. Since poetry expresses the writer&#8217;s wisdom and since the church is God&#8217;s poem, God&#8217;s multifarious wisdom is made known through the church (Eph. 3:10). The New Jerusalem, the city of the living God, as the ultimate consummation of the church, is full of wisdom. God designed the New Jerusalem with His wisdom, and this city displays His wisdom. To say that the New Jerusalem is a material city is to depreciate God&#8217;s wisdom and to belittle Him as the eternal, wise Architect. God is a wise designer and artificer who has designed the New Jerusalem to be the full manifestation of His multifarious wisdom.<p>God&#8217;s design is revealed in the book of Ephesians. In this Epistle Paul tells us of God&#8217;s design of His city. In chapters one and three Paul speaks of God&#8217;s economy, which is God&#8217;s plan with a design. Surely, God has not designed a material city, and He has no intention of building a material city. God has designed and built a spiritual entity for His corporate expression.<h2 class=head3>3. Seen from Afar, Longed after, and Waited for by the Old Testament Saints</h2><p>The city of the living God was seen from afar, longed after, and waited for by the Old Testament saints (Heb. 11:13b, 16a, 10a). Speaking of Abraham and the other patriarchs, Hebrews 11:13 says, &#8220;All these died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them from afar and greeted them, and confessed that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;sojourners&#8221; may also be rendered &#8220;pilgrims,&#8221; &#8220;exiles,&#8221; &#8220;expatriates.&#8221; Abraham was the first Hebrew (Gen. 14:13), a river crosser, leaving Chaldea, the idolatrous land of curse, crossing the river (Josh. 24:2-3), and coming to Canaan, the good land of blessing. However, he did not settle there but sojourned in the land of promise as a pilgrim, even as an exile and an expatriate, longing after a better country, a heavenly one (Heb. 11:16). Isaac and Jacob followed him in the same steps, living on earth as strangers and sojourners and waiting for the God-built city of foundations.<p>In eternity past the Triune God made a plan, and throughout the centuries He has been carrying out His economy. The Son came through incarnation, lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, died on the cross, was resurrected, and then ascended. Since His ascension, the Spirit has been working out many wonderful things. Surely, as the conclusion of all this, God will not build a material city for His redeemed people to live in. The New Jerusalem is a city, but it is not a physical, material city. Nevertheless, some believers still insist that the New Jerusalem is a material city built of actual gold, pearl, and precious stones.<p>Those who hold this concept need to consider Paul&#8217;s word in 1 Corinthians 3. In this chapter Paul says that he laid Christ as the unique foundation, and then he charges us to take heed how we build on this foundation (vv. 10-12). We should build not with wood, grass, and stubble but with gold, silver, and precious stones. In this age, the church age, we should build the church with gold, silver, and precious stones. In the coming age, silver becomes pearl, and the materials in the New Jerusalem become gold, pearl, and precious stones. Today we should be building the church with gold, silver, and precious stones. This, of course, does not mean that we build with literal gold, silver, and precious stones. These are not physical materials; they are signs signifying various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God. Gold signifies the divine nature, the nature of the Father with all its attributes. Silver signifies the redeeming Christ with all the virtues and attributes of His person and work. The precious stones signify the transforming work of the Holy Spirit with all its attributes. All these materials, therefore, are the products of our experience and enjoyment of Christ in our spirit through the Holy Spirit. As signs, these materials signify the divine work of the Divine Trinity who is wrought into our being through His divine work. We are now building the church with God the Father&#8217;s nature, with God the Son&#8217;s redemption, and with God the Spirit&#8217;s transforming work.<p>The principle is the same with the New Jerusalem, which is the consummation of the building in 1 Corinthians 3. In 1 Corinthians 3 the building is in process and has not yet been consummated. The New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 is the consummation of that building. This is the city for which Abraham was waiting. He was waiting not for a material city but for a marvelous city built with the Father&#8217;s nature, the Son&#8217;s redemption, and the Spirit&#8217;s transformation.<h2 class=head3>4. The New Testament Believers Having Come to Her</h2><p>The New Testament believers have already come to the city of the living God. Hebrews 12:22a says, &#8220;You have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem,&#8221; referring to God&#8217;s habitation and the center of His universal administration.<p>Hebrews 11:14-16 reveals that the Old Testament saints longed after a better country, a heavenly country, and that God has prepared for them a city. In 12:22, however, the writer tells us that we have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem. This verse does not say that we will come to the heavenly Jerusalem but that we have come to this city. If the Mount Zion and the heavenly Jerusalem in 12:22 were material, how could we have come to them today? This would be impossible.<p>The fact that, according to Hebrews 12:22, we have already come to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, indicates that it is not a material city. Many Christians are waiting to go to the New Jerusalem, but we need to realize that we have come to the New Jerusalem already. The church is the house of the living God (1 Tim. 3:15). Hence, the church is God&#8217;s home, and it is also our home today. When the church is enlarged to be a city, it becomes a heavenly country. Our heavenly country is a city-the heavenly Jerusalem-to which we have already come.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1><h1 class=msg>(4)</h1><p>In the foregoing messages we have seen that the New Jerusalem is the Jerusalem above and the city of the living God. In this message we shall consider the New Jerusalem as a sign.<h2 class=head1>III. A SIGN</h2><p>If we would understand the significance of the New Jerusalem as a sign, we need to see the crucial importance of the first verse of Revelation. This verse is the key to open up the entire book. Without this key, the book of Revelation will be closed to us.<p>Revelation 1:1 says, &#8220;The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves what must swiftly take place; and He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave, John.&#8221; Here we see that the divine revelation is given to Jesus Christ and that He makes it known by signs. All the pictures in Revelation are signs. The revelation in the book of Revelation is composed mainly of signs, that is, symbols with spiritual significance, such as the seven lampstands signifying the churches and the seven stars signifying the messengers of the churches (1:20). Even the New Jerusalem is a sign, signifying the ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s economy. This book, then, is a book of signs, symbols through which the revelation is made known to us. John&#8217;s Gospel is a book of signs signifying how Christ came to be our life to produce the church, His bride. John&#8217;s Revelation is also a book of signs showing how Christ is now caring for the church and how He is coming to judge and possess the earth and to bring the church, His bride, into God&#8217;s full economy.<p>In the book of Revelation, which is the conclusion of the New Testament and even of the entire Bible, there are two great signs. In chapter one there is the sign of the golden lampstands, and in chapters twenty-one and twenty-two there is the greatest sign, the sign of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the aggregate of all the lampstands. At the beginning of Revelation, there are seven lampstands, the local lampstands in this age. At the end of Revelation, there is an aggregate, a composite lampstand, the universal lampstand in eternity. Therefore, Revelation begins with the lampstands and ends with the lampstand. The lampstands are signs of the churches, whereas the New Jerusalem is a sign of God&#8217;s eternal dwelling place and of Christ&#8217;s wife, His eternal counterpart.<p>The signs in the book of Revelation should not be interpreted literally. We should not think that the church is an actual lampstand with seven shining lamps. Likewise, we should not think that Christ is literally a lamb (Rev. 5:6). In the same principle, we should not consider the New Jerusalem a material city. The New Jerusalem is Christ&#8217;s wife, and He, of course, cannot marry a physical city. Since we do not take the other signs in Revelation literally, we should not interpret the New Jerusalem as a literal, physical city for us to dwell in. Such an interpretation is altogether natural. If we do not interpret the seven lampstands as meaning that the seven churches are literally golden lampstands, or the lamb as meaning that Christ is an actual lamb, we should not interpret the New Jerusalem as a material city. The lampstands and the lamb are signs, and the New Jerusalem also is a sign.<p>If the New Jerusalem were an actual city made of gold, pearls, and precious stones, this would mean that a material city was the conclusion of the entire divine revelation. This is not logical. God has been working throughout the ages, first creating the universe and man and then coming to earth to redeem man. The Lord Jesus, the God-man, lived on earth, He was crucified and resurrected, He ascended, and He poured Himself out as the Spirit upon His disciples. The disciples then went out to preach the gospel. As a result of the preaching of the gospel, throughout the centuries people have been saved and added to the church in order to be built up as the Body of Christ to express Him. To be sure, the final outcome of all this will not be a material city.<p>Just as the lampstands are not actual lampstands but signs of the churches, so the New Jerusalem is not an actual city but a sign of the ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s economy. The New Jerusalem is a great sign of the totality of all God&#8217;s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people.<p>The church today is the house of the living God (1 Tim. 3:15). This house is not an actual house but the totality of God&#8217;s people. This house is a sign signifying that the church&#8217;s function today is to be a house in which the Triune God can dwell. In eternity this house will be enlarged to a city-the New Jerusalem. Just as the church as God&#8217;s house is not an actual physical house, so the New Jerusalem is not an actual physical city. The city of New Jerusalem is a sign signifying the church&#8217;s function in eternity to be God&#8217;s dwelling place.<p>The New Jerusalem is the last and greatest sign in the Bible, and we all need the proper interpretation and understanding of this sign. As a sign the New Jerusalem indicates that God, through creation, incarnation, redemption, resurrection, ascension, and all His transforming and building work, will gain a living composition of His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people to be His dwelling place and His counterpart to fully satisfy and express Him for eternity.<h2 class=head2>A. The Aggregate of the Result of God&#8217;s Work of the New Creation in All the Dispensations within the Old Creation</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is a sign of the aggregate of the result of God&#8217;s work of the new creation in all the dispensations within the old creation. There are four dispensations: the dispensation of the patriarchs, the dispensation of the law, the dispensation of grace, and the dispensation of righteousness.<h2 class=head3>1. In the Dispensation of the Patriarchs on the Patriarchs</h2><p>From the time God created all things and mankind according to His eternal plan, His economy, He has used four distinct dispensations to do His work of the new creation on the man whom He created in order to accomplish the purpose of His eternal economy. The dispensation of the patriarchs was from the creation of Adam to the giving of the law by Moses (Rom. 5:14). This was the dispensation before law. Hence, it may be called the pre-law dispensation. In this dispensation God first put the created man under His direct government that man might receive Him as life. Man, however, became fallen. Thus, God caused fallen man, the function of whose conscience had been activated by the knowledge of good and evil, to receive His redemption in Christ. God also caused man to be governed by his own conscience and to be acceptable to Him through sacrifices according to the way of redemption that He ordained. Moreover, He caused man to enjoy His riches by calling on His name so that he might walk with God and work with God. Eventually, because man became repeatedly fallen, God made fallen man subject to the authority which He gave to man. This caused man to be ruled by man that he might live and be preserved and that God might have the opportunity to visit man. Finally, in the dispensation of the patriarchs, God called the new race out of the Adamic race, which had become fallen to the uttermost, and gave to this new race the promise of grace, leading them to hope in the Christ who would come to be a blessing to all the nations of the earth. In this way, God obtained the chosen patriarchs to be the first part of the new race in His new creation, signified by the crown of twelve stars worn on the head of the universal woman in Revelation 12, for the building of the New Jerusalem as God&#8217;s expression in eternity future.<h2 class=head3>2. In the Dispensation of the Law on the Children of Israel</h2><p>God&#8217;s original intention was to do the work of the new creation on the fallen man of the old creation according to His promised grace. However, because fallen man did not realize his impotence and his need of God&#8217;s grace, God temporarily changed His way of doing His work of the new creation on the fallen man of the old creation. God gave fallen man the law, which was established according to what God is. By doing this, He initiated another dispensation, the dispensation of law, which extended from Moses to the coming of Christ.<p>God&#8217;s intention in setting up the dispensation of the law according to His economy was to accomplish certain things through the law. First, through the law God kept His chosen people in custody that they might satisfy the requirements of the law through the offerings, which typified Christ, and thereby be guarded, as sheep are guarded in a sheepfold. Second, through the law God provided His chosen people a child-conductor that they might be led to Christ, that through the offerings they might be forgiven, and that through the temple they might enjoy God&#8217;s riches. Third, through the law God caused His chosen people to have the knowledge of sin and of themselves, and thereby realize and sense their need of God&#8217;s grace. As a result, God kept His chosen people in the custody of the law and brought Christ to the chosen people who waited for Him in the dispensation of law and to those who would believe into Him in the coming dispensation. In this way God obtained a group of people who are signified by the moon under the feet of the universal woman in Revelation 12, as the second part of the new race of the new creation, to constitute the New Jerusalem as God&#8217;s eternal expression in the new heaven and new earth.<h2 class=head3>3. In the Dispensation of Grace on the New Testament Believers</h2><p>When, at the fullness of time (Gal. 4:4), God determined that His purpose in decreeing the law had been attained and that the law had been used to its full extent, He became flesh, thus terminating the dispensation of law and inaugurating the dispensation of grace. At that time God again changed the way of His work of the new creation on the man of the old creation by replacing the demand of the law with the supply of grace. The dispensation of grace is from Christ&#8217;s first coming to His second coming, which will mark the beginning of the millennial kingdom. The dispensation of grace is also the dispensation of the mystery of the church.<p>When God inaugurated the dispensation of grace, the Triune God became flesh in the Son, who was born of a woman to become Christ, possessing both the divine nature and the human nature and bringing grace and reality (John 1:1, 14, 17). He passed through human life in humanity, experiencing every hardship and suffering. He also lived out the Triune God in humanity. He passed through the death of the cross in humanity, accomplishing an all-inclusive death and releasing the divine life for multiplication and increase to constitute the Body of Christ, which is the church. Moreover, the Triune God was raised from among the dead with a resurrected body in humanity, that the only begotten Son might be born the firstborn Son in His humanity in resurrection. At the same time, those who believed in Christ were regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3) to become His many sons. This Christ, who was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), breathed Himself into those who believed in Him (John 20:22) to be the reality of their spiritual life for their spiritual existence and living. Then the resurrected and glorified One was exalted in ascension. He was made both Lord and Christ to be a Leader and Savior (Acts 2:33-36; 5:31), that He might give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God&#8217;s chosen people. Moreover, in ascension He poured Himself out as the consummated Spirit of the Triune God (Acts 2:4; 10:44-45), baptizing those who believed and became His members in this consummated Spirit into one Body (1 Cor. 12:13), that they might be His fullness to express Him. These matters include mainly the person and work of Christ and constitute the gospel of God to be preached to sinners, calling those who were chosen of God to believe, to be saved, and to be regenerated. God then constitutes them to be the churches in different localities that the Body of Christ may be fully built up. In this way God obtains all those who believe in Christ in the new testament as the third part and the majority of the new race in God&#8217;s new creation, signified by the sun with which the universal woman in Revelation 12 is clothed, for the accomplishment of the constitution of the New Jerusalem to be God&#8217;s ultimate and full expression in eternity.<h2 class=head3>4. In the Dispensation of Righteousness on the Saved Israelites and on the Rest of the New Testament Believers Not Yet Perfected</h2><p>After the conclusion of the dispensation of grace, God will change for the last time the way of His work of the new creation on the man of the old creation. He will set up His kingdom on earth (Rev. 11:15) to carry out His administration, and by His absolute righteousness He will bring to a conclusion the different kinds of people among the human race, that He may accomplish His work of the new creation in the old creation. This dispensation is called the dispensation of the kingdom. In this dispensation righteousness will reign as a king. Hence, this dispensation is also called the dispensation of righteousness. It will cover a period of one thousand years (Rev. 20:4-6), beginning with the second coming of Christ and ending with the putting away of the old heaven and old earth, the old universe.<p>In this dispensation God, according to His righteousness, will use the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens to reward the just men perfected in the old testament and the overcoming believers in Christ in the new testament that they may participate in Christ&#8217;s kingship and joy. Moreover, according to His righteousness, God will perfect the immature believers in the new testament and also will deal with all the Israelites who repent and believe in Christ at His coming back.<p>The dispensation of the kingdom, which is the dispensation of righteousness, will be only an age of restoration (Acts 3:21), and as such it will still be a dispensation in the old heaven and old earth of the old creation. This dispensation will be used by God to chasten, to discipline, and to perfect the believers. This means that all the work of the new creation will be completed not in the new heaven and the new earth but in the fourth dispensation in the old creation. God, therefore, will use the last dispensation in the old creation to complete His work of the new creation on the man of the old creation. During this dispensation, God will cause the immature believers in the dispensation of grace to mature in life, and He will cause the repentant Israelites, after the termination of the dispensation of grace, to become constituents of the new race in His new creation. Thus, God will complete the work of the new creation on the man of the old creation in the old creation, a work that will produce and perfect a new race. The people of the new race will be the constituents of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth in eternity. They are the object that God intends to obtain in His work both of the old creation and of the new creation throughout the generations for the fulfillment of His economy. Therefore, as the aggregate of the result of God&#8217;s work of the new creation in all the dispensations within the old creation, the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man will be mingled as one to be a mutual dwelling place for His ultimate expression in eternity.<h2 class=head2>B. The Composition of All the Old Testament and New Testament Saints, the Sons of God Who Have God&#8217;s Life and Nature, to Inherit All That the Processed Triune God Is, Built Together as God&#8217;s Eternal Building</h2><p>Hence, the New Jerusalem is the composition of all the Old Testament and New Testament saints. All these saints have been regenerated by God and have become sons of God who have God&#8217;s life and nature. Through God&#8217;s life and nature, they have been transformed into the image and likeness of God that they may be matured and qualified to inherit all that the processed Triune God is and that they may be built together as God&#8217;s eternal building to be the mutual dwelling for God and for themselves. Thus, the New Jerusalem will be God&#8217;s rest, satisfaction, and expression in eternity.<h2 class=head2>C. The Mingling of All the Redeemed, Regenerated, Transformed, and Glorified Tripartite Men with the Processed, Consummated, and Triune God</h2><p>The New Jerusalem, as a composition of all the regenerated saints of both the Old Testament and the New Testament dispensations built together with God as God&#8217;s eternal building, will also be the mingling of all the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite men with the processed, consummated Triune God. In the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Triune God has been processed and consummated to be one with men, His chosen people. And through the generations in God&#8217;s dispensations, the tripartite men have been redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified to be one with the Triune God, who has chosen them in eternity past to be His counterpart, dwelling place, and expression in eternity future. What a wonderful and marvelous mingling of divinity with humanity this will be!<h2 class=head2>D. The Ultimate Manifestation of the Processed and Consummated Triune God for His Expression in Eternity</h2><p>In addition to all these, the New Jerusalem will be the ultimate manifestation of the processed and consummated Triune God for His expression in the regenerated, transformed, and glorified humanity in eternity.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1><h1 class=msg>(5)</h1><p>The New Testament reveals that the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God (Rev. 21:3) and also the wife of the redeeming Christ (v. 9). In this message we will consider these two aspects of the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head1>IV. THE TABERNACLE OF GOD</h2><p>Revelation 21:3 says, &#8220;I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be His peoples, and God Himself shall be with them.&#8221; In both the Old and New Testaments, God likens His chosen people to a dwelling place for Himself (Exo. 29:45-46; Num. 5:3; Ezek. 43:7, 9; Psa. 68:18; 1 Cor. 3:16-17; 6:19; 2 Cor. 6:16; 1 Tim. 3:15). God&#8217;s dwelling place is for His rest in expression. In the New Jerusalem God will have the utmost rest in expression for eternity.<h2 class=head2>A. Typified by the Tabernacle in the Old Testament</h2><p>The New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God is typified by the tabernacle in the Old Testament (Exo. 25:9; 26:6, 30). Whereas the ark typifies the individual Christ, the tabernacle typifies both the individual Christ, the Head, and the corporate Christ, the Body. The New Testament reveals clearly that the individual Christ is the Head, but this Christ must have a Body, which is the church (Eph. 1:22-23). In Exodus we have not only the ark-Christ but also the tabernacle-Christ, not only the individual Christ but also the corporate Christ.<p>Exodus 25:8 and 9 say, &#8220;They shall make for Me a sanctuary,  that I may dwell in their midst. According to all that I am showing you, the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furniture; even so shall you do.&#8221; This sanctuary was the tabernacle, which signifies God&#8217;s dwelling place. This dwelling place was not only for living but also for enjoyment. God&#8217;s dwelling place is the place for Him to be the enjoyment of His people, the place where God&#8217;s people may participate in the full enjoyment of God Himself.<h2 class=head2>B. Having the Incarnated Christ as Its Reality</h2><p>The tabernacle of God has the incarnated Christ as its reality. In Exodus we have the type, and in John 1:14 we have the fulfillment. The very God who was the Word (John 1:1) became flesh to tabernacle among us. Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is God&#8217;s tabernacle. This tabernacle is God&#8217;s dwelling place for His expression. It is also for us to enter into God so that we may enjoy Him.<p>The Old Testament tabernacle was a type, a prefigure, of the real tabernacle, which was Christ in the flesh. In the Old Testament God was in the tabernacle, for the tabernacle brought God to the children of Israel. In the time of the New Testament, Christ in the flesh was the tabernacle that brought God to man so that man might enjoy Him. Through incarnation God became a man, mingled Himself with man, and became His own dwelling place. In Christ, the real tabernacle, God was embodied for our enjoyment.<p>John 1:14 says, &#8220;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&#8221; Here we see that Christ, the incarnated Word, is a tabernacle. This tabernacle signifies the Word becoming flesh as God&#8217;s expression. The significance of the word expression here is the same as that of the gold in the Old Testament tabernacle. The tabernacle was built with boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold, which signifies God expressed. When Christ was on earth, there was with Him a certain kind of shining, and that shining was the expression of God typified by the gold of the tabernacle.<p>As the tabernacle, Christ shared in humanity. For the Word to become flesh means that the Word took on human nature. Humanity is typified by the acacia wood of the tabernacle (Exo. 26:15, 26). The gold and the acacia wood signify respectively the divine nature and the human nature of Christ.<p>Furthermore, as the tabernacle, Christ is God&#8217;s embodiment. &#8220;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily&#8221; (Col. 2:9). The fullness of the Godhead-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is embodied in the tabernacle, and this embodiment is God&#8217;s dwelling among men.<p>The fullness of the Godhead has been embodied in the tabernacle so that man may enter into God and enjoy Him. Originally, God was mysterious, invisible, and untouchable. But God has been embodied in a tabernacle that can be entered. This means that God is enterable; we can enter into Him and enjoy Him.<h2 class=head2>C. The Dwelling Place of God among Men-the Nations-in Eternity</h2><p>Revelation 21:3 and 24 indicate that the New Jerusalem will be the dwelling place among men-the nations-in eternity. Those people who do not follow the devil to rebel against God at the end of the millennium will be transferred to the new earth to be the nations living around the New Jerusalem and walking by its light. Hence, the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God will be the dwelling place of God among the nations in eternity.<p>Eventually, the New Jerusalem will be the dwelling place for both God and His serving ones. The picture of this in the Old Testament is very clear. The tabernacle was God&#8217;s dwelling place, but at the same time it was the priests&#8217; dwelling place, the place in which they served God. This indicates that in the New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of the tabernacle, God and His serving priests will dwell in the same tabernacle. To God the New Jerusalem will be His dwelling, and to us God will be our dwelling. Revelation 21:22 tells us that in the New Jerusalem there is no temple, &#8220;for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.&#8221; This means that God is not only the object of our service and worship but also our temple in which we serve Him. The New Jerusalem is God&#8217;s dwelling place, and the New Jerusalem as the temple is God Himself as our dwelling place. Actually, the New Jerusalem is a mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed people, and this mingling is a mutual dwelling for God and His redeemed. God lives in us and we live in Him. He and we become one mingled entity for eternity.<h2 class=head1>V. THE WIFE OF THE REDEEMING CHRIST</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is not only the tabernacle of God but also the wife of the redeeming Christ. In both the Old and New Testaments, God likens His chosen people to a spouse for His satisfaction in love (Isa. 54:6; Jer. 3:1; Ezek. 16:8; Hosea 2:19; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:31-32). In the New Jerusalem as the wife of the redeeming Christ, God will have the fullest satisfaction in love.<p>Revelation 21:9b and 10 say, &#8220;Come here, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb. And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.&#8221; Whereas the bride is mainly for the wedding day, the wife is for the entire life. The New Jerusalem will be the bride in the millennium for one thousand years as one day (2 Pet. 3:8) and then the wife in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. The bride in the millennium will include only the overcoming saints, but the wife in the new heaven and new earth will include all the redeemed and regenerated sons of God (Rev. 21:7).<p>The New Jerusalem will be one with the redeeming Christ, as Eve became one with Adam. Eve was builded from a rib that was taken out of Adam&#8217;s side, and then she was brought back to him to be one flesh with him-to be one with him in nature and in life (Gen. 2:21-24; Eph. 5:25-27, 29-32). The principle is the same with the New Jerusalem as the wife of the redeeming Christ. She will be one with her Redeemer in nature and in life. Once again we see that the New Jerusalem cannot be a material city, for a physical city cannot be one with Christ in nature and in life. The New Jerusalem will not only have the divine element added to it and the holy nature of God wrought into it but will also be one with the redeeming Christ in nature and in life.<h2 class=head2>A. Having the Church as Her Miniature</h2><p>The New Jerusalem as the wife of the redeeming Christ has the church as her miniature. This is revealed by Paul&#8217;s word in Ephesians 5:22-32, where he speaks of the church as the counterpart of Christ. The church is actually a part of Christ, for the church comes out of Christ and is unto Christ, just as Eve came out of Adam and was unto Adam.<p>In Ephesians 5:32 Paul says, &#8220;This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.&#8221; The fact that Christ and the church are one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17), as typified by the husband and wife being one flesh, is the great mystery. It surely is a great mystery that the church as Christ&#8217;s counterpart comes out of Christ, has the same life and nature as Christ, and is one with Christ.<h2 class=head2>B. Having Been the Bride of Christ in the Millennium</h2><p>In the new heaven and new earth Christ will have a wife, but in the millennium He will have a bride (Rev. 19:7-8; 21:2), consisting of the overcoming believers. At His coming back Christ will marry the overcomers. This marriage is described in Revelation 19:7-9.<p>Revelation 19:7 says, &#8220;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.&#8221; The marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. God&#8217;s economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life. By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be completed at the end of this age. Then the bride, who will consist of the overcoming believers, will be ready.<p>The words His wife in Revelation 19:7 refer to the church (Eph. 5:24-25, 31-32), the bride of Christ (John 3:29). However, according to Revelation 19:8 and 9, the wife, the bride of Christ, consists only of the overcoming believers during the millennium, whereas the bride, the wife, in Revelation 21:2 is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity.<p>Revelation 19:7b tells us that the wife &#8220;has made herself ready.&#8221; The readiness of the bride depends on both the overcomers&#8217; maturity in life and on their being built up together as a corporate entity. Therefore, the overcomers are not only mature in life but also built up together as one bride.<p>Revelation 19:8 says, &#8220;It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.&#8221; Here pure refers to the nature and bright, to the expression. The righteousnesses, or righteous acts, do not refer to the righteousness (which is Christ) we received for our salvation, a righteousness that is objective and that qualifies us to meet the requirement of the righteous God. The righteousnesses of the overcoming believers in Revelation 19:8 are subjective so that they may meet the requirement of the overcoming Christ. The fine linen, therefore, indicates our overcoming life. It is actually the Christ whom we live out of our being.<h2 class=head2>C. Constituted of All the Perfected Saints</h2><p>Ultimately, in the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem as the wife of the redeeming Christ will be constituted of all the perfected saints. After the millennium all the saints will have been perfected and constituted together to be the wonderful entity of the New Jerusalem.<p>The consummation of the church as the counterpart of Christ will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. Revelation 21:2 says, &#8220;I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&#8221; The New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the saints redeemed and perfected by God throughout all generations. This is the bride, the wife, of Christ as His counterpart. As the wife of Christ, the New Jerusalem comes out of Christ and becomes His counterpart. She is prepared by participating in the riches of the life and nature of Christ.<p>Revelation 22:17 indicates that Christ and the New Jerusalem as His wife will be a universal couple for eternity. The Spirit, who is the totality of the processed Triune God, becomes one with the believers, who are now fully matured to be the bride. Therefore, the consummation of the processed Triune God and the consummation of God&#8217;s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people will be one and will be a universal couple expressing the Triune God for eternity.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1><h1 class=msg>(6)</h1><p>We have seen that the New Jerusalem is the Jerusalem above, the city of the living God, a sign, the tabernacle of God, and the wife of the redeeming Christ. In this message we will begin to consider the many aspects of the New Jerusalem as the holy city.<h2 class=head1>VI. THE HOLY CITY</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is the holy city (Rev. 21:2, 10). The designation holy city signifies that the New Jerusalem is a city sanctified and separated unto God for the fulfilling of His purpose. As the holy city of God, the New Jerusalem is holy, sanctified, fully separated unto God, and thoroughly saturated with God&#8217;s holy nature to be His habitation. This holy city is thoroughly permeated and mingled with God. This great city is utterly separated unto God and saturated with Him. The New Jerusalem is both sanctified and separated unto God positionally and sanctified and saturated with God dispositionally. It is holy both extrinsically and intrinsically. It is an entity, entirely and thoroughly holy, that fits in with God&#8217;s holy nature for His expression to fulfill the desire of His heart.<p>In the New Testament the word holy means not only separated unto God but also saturated with God, whereas in the Old Testament to be made holy is only to be separated unto God. There is no saturation of God in the Old Testament, and the holiness, or sanctification, there is only positional, not dispositional. In the New Testament, however, we see both objective, positional sanctification and subjective, dispositional sanctification (Matt. 23:17, 19; Rom. 6:19, 22; 1 Thes. 5:23). In positional sanctification there is only a change of position, but in dispositional sanctification there is the transformation in nature and in element. The New Jerusalem as the holy city is holy not merely in the sense of the Old Testament but also in the sense of the New Testament. This means that the New Jerusalem is not merely a city separated unto God but also a city saturated with God.<p>Based upon this principle, we can see that the holy city, the New Jerusalem, cannot be a physical city since a physical city cannot be saturated with God. The New Jerusalem is a city composed of living persons who have been separated unto God and saturated with Him.<h2 class=head2>A. Built with All the Redeemed and Perfected Saints</h2><p>The New Jerusalem as the holy city is built with all the redeemed and perfected saints of both the Old Testament and the New Testament. This means that the New Jerusalem is a living composition of all God&#8217;s redeemed. The holy city is thus a living building.<p>All the saints of both the Old Testament and the New Testament are the components, the constituents, of the New Jerusalem for God&#8217;s expression. All the saints are God&#8217;s regenerated and transformed children. They are the sons of God spoken of in Revelation 21:7. Having God&#8217;s life and nature, they are different from the peoples spoken of in Revelation 21:3, who are the nations around the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21:24 and 22:2. The New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the aggregate of all the sons of God, who have been redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified for the building of the New Jerusalem as God&#8217;s ultimate manifestation for eternity.<h2 class=head3>1. The Names of the Twelve Tribes of Israel Representing All the Old Testament Saints</h2><p>The New Jerusalem is composed firstly of the Old Testament saints. In the New Jerusalem the names of the twelve tribes of Israel represent all the Old Testament saints. These names are inscribed on the twelve gates of the city. &#8220;At the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel&#8221; (Rev. 21:12b). Every gate bears the name of one tribe. This is a sign signifying that the gates are living people. The word Israel here indicates that the New Jerusalem is composed of all the redeemed saints of the Old Testament.<h2 class=head3>2. The Names of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb Representing All the New Testament Saints</h2><p>In the New Jerusalem the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb represent all the New Testament saints. Revelation 21:14 says, &#8220;The wall of the city had twelvefoundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.&#8221; The fact that the names of the twelve apostles are on the twelve foundations of the wall indicates that the New Jerusalem as the holy city is composed not only of the Old Testament saints, represented by Israel, but also of the New Testament saints, represented by the apostles. The New Testament believers are not for the gates; they are for the wall. The gates are for propagation and entrance, whereas the wall is for separation and protection.<h2 class=head2>B. The Twelve Gates on Four Sides, with Three Gates on Each Side, Signifying the Mingling of Man, Who Is One of the Four Living Creatures, with God, Who Is Triune</h2><p>Twelve is the number of the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem there are the twelve foundations with the names of the twelve apostles, twelve gates which are twelve pearls with the names of the twelve tribes, and twelve fruits of the tree of life (Rev. 22:2). With respect to space, the city proper is twelve thousand stadia (21:16), one thousand times twelve, in three dimensions, and its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits (21:17), which is twelve times twelve.<p>The twelve gates on four sides (21:12-13), with three gates on each side, signify the mingling of man, who is one of the four living creatures (4:6-7), with God, who is triune. Here twelve is composed of three multiplied by four. The number four refers to God&#8217;s creation. In 4:6 we see that the four living creatures represent all other living creatures (cf. Ezek. 1:5-14). Four refers to us as God&#8217;s creatures, and three refers to the Triune God. The number twelve in the New Jerusalem is not arrived at by addition but by multiplication. Multiplication is a blending, or a mingling. The number twelve is mingled, or blended, by three times four. This means that the entire New Jerusalem is a blending, a mingling, of the Triune God with us human beings. The processed Triune God is mingled with His creature, man, in His eternal administration in the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head2>C. The City Proper</h2><p>We come now to several matters related to the city proper.<h2 class=head3>1. A Mountain of Gold</h2><p>The New Jerusalem, the holy city, is a mountain of gold (Rev. 21:18). The entire city has one street (21:21; 22:1), yet this one street reaches all twelve gates. Also, the wall is one hundred forty-four cubits high (21:17), and the city itself is twelve thousand stadia high (21:16-one stadion equals about six hundred feet). These facts indicate that the city proper must be a mountain, a mountain of gold. On top of the mountain is a throne, from which the street spirals down to the bottom to reach the twelve gates. One street, descending from the top to the bottom, reaches and serves all twelve gates. The street, therefore, must be a spiral street, spiraling down the mountain until it circles around to all twelve gates.<p>As a mountain of gold, the New Jerusalem is the ultimate, unique, and eternal golden lampstand. Upon this stand is a lamp-Christ with God in Him as the light shining out through eternity. The holy city as a mountain of gold is the aggregate of all the lampstands (1:20), the totality of today&#8217;s lampstands, shining forth God&#8217;s glory in eternity in the new heaven and the new earth.<h2 class=head3>2. Of the Divine Substance, Element, and Nature</h2><p>The city proper, a mountain of gold, is of the divine substance, element, and nature. In typology gold signifies the divine nature. The city proper is composed absolutely of the divine nature, the nature of God. The New Jerusalem itself comes out of the divine nature.<p>As believers in Christ and children of God, we all are a part of the New Jerusalem as a mountain of gold. When we were regenerated, we received the nature of God, and now we are partakers of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). This means that a part of the golden mountain has entered into our being. We all have a part of the golden mountain, the New Jerusalem, within us. We need to realize that something within us is divine. A part of our regenerated being is &#8220;gold,&#8221; and this gold is the divine nature. If we see the vision of the New Jerusalem built with gold, with the divine nature, and if we realize that as the children of God partaking of the divine nature we have a part of the golden mountain, we will renounce everything that does not belong to the divine nature and reject anything that does not match it.<h2 class=head3>3. Square, Signifying That the City Is Perfect and Complete in Every Way</h2><p>Revelation 21:16a says, &#8220;The city lies foursquare.&#8221; The fact that the New Jerusalem is square signifies that the city is perfect and complete in every way, absolutely straight, and not in the least oblique.<h2 class=head3>4. Measured with a Golden Reed, Signifying That the City Is Tested and Approved according to God&#8217;s Divine Nature for God&#8217;s Possession</h2><p>Revelation 21:15 says, &#8220;He who spoke with me had a golden reed as a measure, that he might measure the city and its gates and its wall.&#8221; The reed is for measuring, and measuring signifies taking possession (Ezek. 40:5; Zech. 2:1-2; Rev. 11:1). The fact that the New Jerusalem is measured with a reed indicates that it is measured for possession. Notice that the measuring instrument is a reed, not a rod. A rod signifies or implies judgment, discipline, and punishment. According to Revelation 11:1, &#8220;a reed like a rod&#8221; is used to &#8220;measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship in it.&#8221; Because a rod implies punishment (Prov. 10:13; Isa. 10:5; 11:4), a reed like a rod indicates measuring with punishment. In Revelation 21:15, however, we have the reed but no mention of the rod. Here there is no implication of judgment, discipline, or chastisement, for in every respect the New Jerusalem is complete and perfect. This city has passed every test.<p>The reed used to measure the city proper is a golden reed. Since gold signifies the divine nature, the word golden here signifies that the measuring of the city, its gates, and its wall is according to the nature of God, according to the divine nature. Anything that does not match the nature of God does not belong to the New Jerusalem. God cannot possess anything that does not match His nature. The whole city, with its gates and wall, can pass the measuring and testing of the nature of God; hence, it is qualified to be possessed by God.<h2 class=head3>5. A Cube, the Measure of Which Is Equal in Three Dimensions</h2><p>Revelation 21:16b says, &#8220;He measured the city with the reed, at twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.&#8221; According to its measurements, the New Jerusalem is a cube, the measure of which is equal in three directions.<h2 class=head4>a. Like the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle and in the Temple</h2><p>The dimensions of the Holy of Holies, both in the tabernacle and in the temple, were equal in length, breadth, and height (Exo. 26:2-8; 1 Kings 6:20). The Holy of Holies in the tabernacle was a cube measuring ten cubits in each dimension, and the Holy of Holies in the temple was a cube measuring twenty cubits in each dimension. The fact that the length, breadth, and height of the New Jerusalem are equal indicates that the entire New Jerusalem as the holy city is the Holy of Holies. Therefore, the New Jerusalem is the Holy of Holies enlarged to the uttermost.<h2 class=head4>b. Twelve Thousand Stadia, Signifying the Absolute Perfection and Eternal Completion in God&#8217;s Administration a Thousand Times</h2><p>The length, breadth, and height of the New Jerusalem are all twelve thousand stadia. Twelve thousand is one thousand times twelve. Since twelve signifies absolute and eternal completion in God&#8217;s eternal administration, twelve thousand signifies a thousand times this.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1><h1 class=msg>(7)</h1><p>The ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s eternal economy, His eternal plan, is the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people. God is in this mingling, and His chosen people also are in this mingling. This mingling is God&#8217;s dwelling place; it is also the dwelling place of His chosen people. Hence, this mingling is a mutual dwelling place. Furthermore, this mingling is the counterpart of Christ, our eternal destiny, and the ultimate manifestation of the processed Triune God for His expression. This mingling will also be the kingship and the priesthood over the nations on the new earth for eternity to express God and to glorify Him to the uttermost. This mingling, therefore, is the ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s work in the universe, including His work both of the old creation and of the new creation.<p>The last two chapters of the Bible, Revelation 21 and 22, present the ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s eternal economy. These chapters are all-inclusive and cover nearly the entire Bible. For example, in the Old Testament we see the tabernacle, the temple, and the city. These three things are found also in the last two chapters of the Bible. Redemption, regeneration, transformation, glorification, conformation, and many other matters are symbolized in these chapters.<p>Concerning the New Jerusalem as the holy city revealed in Revelation 21 and 22, we have seen that this city is built with all the redeemed and perfected saints, that the twelve gates on four sides signify the mingling of man with the Triune God, and that the city proper is a mountain of gold. In this message we will consider the foundation of the holy city.<h2 class=head2>D. The Foundation</h2><p>Revelation 21:14 says, &#8220;The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.&#8221; These foundations are not &#8220;the foundation,&#8221; which is Christ, as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 3:10-11. Rather, the twelve foundations here are &#8220;the twelve apostles of the Lamb.&#8221; Today the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets (Eph. 2:20). Since in eternity there will be no more need of the prophets, the foundations of the holy city will consist only of the apostles.<h2 class=head3>1. Being the Twelve Apostles Representing the Grace of the New Testament, Indicating That Grace Is the Foundation of the Holy City</h2><p>The foundation of the New Jerusalem is the twelve apostles representing the grace of the New Testament, indicating that grace is the foundation of the holy city. This is the grace for which God made a covenant with Abraham. Grace is actually God Himself covenanted to His chosen people. When God is given to us, that is grace, and when grace is covenanted, it becomes a covenant. We can see this in Galatians 4, where the covenant of grace refers to the Jerusalem above (v. 26). The Jerusalem above is a producing mother who produces the sons of God. These sons are actually the components of the producing mother. In the New Jerusalem, the holy city, as the ultimate consummation, the foundation is the grace God covenanted to Abraham. This indicates, therefore, that grace is the foundation of the holy city.<p>As the foundation of the holy city, grace is the producing factor. Grace is the source, the means, and the element for the producing of the city. The entire city is produced out of grace, with grace, in grace, and through grace.<p>John 1:1 and 14 reveal that the Word, which is God, became flesh, full of grace. &#8220;The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ&#8221; (v. 17). Why did grace come through Jesus Christ? Grace came through Christ because He is the embodiment of God who is grace. Galatians 4 speaks of this grace and shows us that this grace has become a covenant. This covenant is the city, the city is the mother, and the mother is not only the producer of the sons but is also the composition of all the sons.<p>The book of Galatians concludes with a word concerning grace. &#8220;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers&#8221; (6:18). In Greek an expression such as &#8220;the grace of Christ&#8221; is an expression of apposition, with &#8220;Christ&#8221; in apposition to &#8220;grace.&#8221; This indicates that grace is Christ. The same is true of the expressions &#8220;the love of God&#8221; and &#8220;the life of God.&#8221; In the former &#8220;love&#8221; and &#8220;God&#8221; are in apposition, indicating that love is God; in the latter, &#8220;life&#8221; and &#8220;God&#8221; are in apposition, indicating that life is God. The same is true of the expression &#8220;the Spirit of God.&#8221;<p>We see three such appositions in 2 Corinthians 13:14, a wonderful verse concerning the Trinity. &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&#8221; &#8220;The grace of Christ&#8221; means that Christ is grace and that grace is Christ. Likewise, &#8220;the love of God&#8221; means that God is love and that love is God, and &#8220;the fellowship of the Holy Spirit&#8221; means that the Holy Spirit is the fellowship and that the fellowship is the Holy Spirit. Hence, grace is Christ, love is God, and fellowship is the Holy Spirit. Love as God is the source; grace as Christ, the embodiment of God, is the course; and fellowship as the Spirit is the flow in the course to reach us for application.<p>When Paul in Galatians 6:18 speaks of the grace of Christ, he is speaking of Christ as grace. To say &#8220;the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit&#8221; actually means &#8220;Christ as grace be with your spirit.&#8221; This is not a doctrine-it is a realization of what Christ is.<p>The Word that became flesh and tabernacled among us is a person, and this person is Christ as the embodiment of grace. Because He is the embodiment of grace, when He became flesh, grace became embodied in the flesh. The law was given through Moses, but grace came, and it came through and with the person of Jesus Christ. Now where Christ is, there grace is also.<p>The foundation of the New Jerusalem is grace, and this grace is all-inclusive. Such a grace is the processed and consummated Triune God embodied and expressed. The twelve apostles, whose names are on the twelve foundations of the holy city, are figures representing the embodied and expressed grace of God, which is God Himself. In Revelation 21:14 the twelve apostles are the representation of God&#8217;s embodied and expressed grace. Therefore, God Himself in the embodiment and expression of grace is actually the foundation of the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head3>2. Being the Foundation for the Building Up of the Church</h2><p>According to Ephesians 2:20 the apostles, along with the prophets, are the foundation for the building up of the church. This verse says, &#8220;Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone.&#8221; The foundation of the church is Christ (1 Cor. 3:11). Since the mystery of Christ has been revealed to the apostles (Eph. 3:5-6), the revelation they received is considered the foundation upon which the church is built. This corresponds to the rock in Matthew 16:18, which is not only Christ but also the revelation concerning Christ, upon which Christ will build His church. Therefore, the foundation of the apostles and prophets is not the apostles and prophets themselves but the revelation they received for the building up of the church. This is in contrast to Revelation 21:14, where the foundations are the very persons of the apostles.<h2 class=head3>3. Being Twelve Precious Stones</h2><p>The foundation of the holy city consists of twelve precious stones. &#8220;The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation, jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst&#8221; (Rev. 21:19-20). Precious stones are not created but transformed from things created. All the apostles were created pieces of clay, but they were transformed into precious stones for God&#8217;s eternal building. This regeneration and transformation is required for every believer who will be a part of the New Jerusalem.<p>The colors of the twelve precious stones of the foundation, which signify the twelve apostles, are as follows: the first is green, the second and third are blue, the fourth is green, the fifth and sixth are red, the seventh is yellow, the eighth is bluish-green, the ninth is yellow, the tenth is apple-green, the eleventh and twelfth are purple. The twelve layers of the foundation in the above colors give the appearance of a rainbow, signifying that the city is built upon and secured by God&#8217;s faithfulness in keeping His covenant (Gen. 9:8-17).<h2 class=head4>a. Produced by the Transforming Work of the Lord the Spirit</h2><p>It was through the transforming work of the Lord the Spirit that Peter and then the other apostles were transformed into precious stones. When Peter, the first of the twelve apostles, was brought to the Lord, He changed his name to &#8220;a stone&#8221; (John 1:42). Later, the Lord called him by this name when He spoke to him concerning the building of His church (Matt. 16:18). Gradually, Peter and the others were transformed by the Lord the Spirit into the embodiment of God&#8217;s all-inclusive grace.<p>Paul speaks of the Lord the Spirit in 2 Corinthians 3:18. &#8220;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&#8221; The Lord the Spirit may be considered a compound title like Jehovah God, Father God, Lord Jesus, Jesus Christ, and Lord Christ. The Lord the Spirit is the One who does the work of transformation. If we have not seen that today the Lord Jesus is the life-giving Spirit as the Lord the Spirit, we will not experience His transforming work. However, if we know that our Lord Jesus Christ is the life-giving Spirit and call on Him, saying &#8220;O Lord Spirit,&#8221; we will enjoy His transforming work.<p>If we would experience transformation, the Lord must be subjective to us as well as objective. The three matters of enjoying, experiencing, and expressing the processed Triune God are all subjective. Enjoying Christ as the bread of life is also a subjective matter, for this involves eating the Lord, and eating is surely subjective. The enjoyment of Christ as the bread of life is a matter that is altogether subjective.<p>The Lord the Spirit makes everything of Christ subjective to us. As we contact Him by calling on Him, He transforms us. He transforms us by dispensing His divine element into our being. The result of this dispensing is not an outward, corrective change but an inward, metabolic change. Even though our experience may be limited, we can testify from experience to the reality of the transforming work of the Lord Spirit.<h2 class=head4>b. Constituted with the Unsearchable Riches of Christ</h2><p>The precious stones are not only produced by the transforming work of the Lord the Spirit but also constituted with the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8). We have seen that grace is just Christ, the embodiment of Christ. Hence, to be constituted with grace is to be constituted with Christ as the constituent of the New Jerusalem. The more we experience Christ and gain Christ, the more we participate in the divine element of Christ, and the more we become constituents of the New Jerusalem to be built up together with all the God-chosen and transformed people, that we could be the holy city, God&#8217;s eternal dwelling.<h2 class=head4>c. Expressing Christ&#8217;s Divine Attributes in the Human Virtues in Various Aspects</h2><p>Revelation 21:11b says that the light of the New Jerusalem is like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal. This indicates that the holy city as the embodiment of and the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with the regenerated and transformed tripartite men shines with the preciousness and the beauty of Christ&#8217;s divine attributes in the human virtues in various aspects. Since Christ&#8217;s element has made His believers the constituents, the components, of the building up of the holy city, its shining should be the expression of Christ&#8217;s divine attributes in our human virtues in many different aspects. Thus, whatever the holy city expresses is the shining of Christ&#8217;s divine attributes expressed in our human virtues for the glory of the Triune God.<h2 class=head4>d. For the Completion of God&#8217;s Eternal Administration Signified by the Number Twelve</h2><p>The twelve precious stones are for the completion of God&#8217;s eternal administration signified by the number twelve. Twelve is the number of absolute perfection and eternal completion in God&#8217;s eternal administration. Hence, the twelve precious stones of the foundation of the New Jerusalem indicate that the foundation is absolutely perfect and eternally complete for God&#8217;s administration.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1><h1 class=msg>(8)</h1><p>The New Jerusalem as the holy city has many aspects. The next aspect we will consider is the wall of the city.<h2 class=head2>E. The Wall</h2><p>The New Jerusalem has a &#8220;great and high wall&#8221; (Rev. 21:12a). The wall is for separation and protection. The New Jerusalem as the holy city will be absolutely separated unto God and will fully protect the interests of God.<h2 class=head3>1. Built with Jasper</h2><p>Revelation 21:18a says, &#8220;The building material of its wall was jasper.&#8221; According to verse 11, jasper is &#8220;a most precious stone,&#8221; a stone that is &#8220;clear as crystal.&#8221; Its color is dark green, which signifies life in its richness. Jasper in 21:18, as in 21:11 and 4:3, signifies God&#8217;s communicable glory in His rich life (John 17:22, 2). It is the appearance of God, which is also the appearance of the holy city. The city&#8217;s wall and first foundation are built with it.<h2 class=head4>a. Produced by the Transforming Work of the Lord the Spirit</h2><p>Jasper is produced by the transforming work of the Lord the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17-18). Like all precious transparent stones, jasper is a transformed substance. It was first created and is then transformed. The principle is the same with us as the constituents of the New Jerusalem. None of us were created jasper. On the contrary, we were created clay (Gen. 2:7). However, we have been regenerated and are now in the process of being transformed. Eventually, we all will be jasper, possessing the life of God and bearing the appearance of God. We will have both the element of God and the appearance of God.<h2 class=head4>b. Constituted with the Unsearchable Riches of Christ</h2><p>Jasper signifies a substance transformed by the Holy Spirit. The element of this substance is the riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8). It is with the riches of Christ that the Holy Spirit transforms the believers, whose natural element is of clay. After we have been regenerated with Christ as the divine life, we begin to be transformed by the Holy Spirit with the element of Christ&#8217;s divine life to be the material for the building up of the wall of the holy city.<h2 class=head3>2. Expressing God&#8217;s Image in His Glory</h2><p>The jasper wall of the New Jerusalem expresses God&#8217;s image in His glory. We have seen that, according to Revelation 4:3, jasper is the appearance of God. The fact that the building material of the wall of the holy city is of jasper indicates that the New Jerusalem, as the corporate expression of God in eternity, bears the appearance, the expressed glory, of God, expressing God&#8217;s image in His glory. Furthermore, the wall of the city is unified in appearance on all four sides. This indicates that all differences have vanished and that the city is the unique expression of the Triune God. The wall of the holy city is the expression of the jasper God, and the jasper God is expressed in the jasper city through the jasper wall. The church life will consummate in the coming New Jerusalem with its unique expression-the expression of the divine image through transformation and building.<h2 class=head3>3. In Resurrection, Signified by the Measure of a Man as an Angel</h2><p>Revelation 21:17 says, &#8220;He measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, a measure of a man, that is, of an angel.&#8221; It is in resurrection that man will be like the angels (Matt. 22:30). Hence, &#8220;a measure of a man, that is, of an angel&#8221; signifies that the wall of the city is not natural but in resurrection. The principle of resurrection is that the natural life is killed and the divine life rises up in its place. This is resurrection. The wall of the city is not only measured according to the divine nature but is also according to resurrection.<h2 class=head3>4. A Hundred and Forty-four Cubits, Signifying the Absolute Perfection and Eternal Completion in God&#8217;s Eternal Administration Twelve Times</h2><p>The city proper is a golden mountain with a height of twelve thousand stadia, but according to Revelation 21:17, the measure of the wall of the city is a hundred forty-four cubits. A hundred forty-four is twelve times twelve. Twelve signifies absolute perfection and eternal completion in God&#8217;s eternal administration. Twelve times twelve signifies absolute perfection and eternal completion of absolute perfections and eternal completions, that is, the holy city&#8217;s absolute perfection and eternal completion in God&#8217;s eternal administration is times twelve. How perfect and complete is the wall of the holy city in God&#8217;s eternal administration!<h2 class=head3>5. Being Great and High for a Complete and Perfect Separation of God&#8217;s Holiness</h2><p>The wall of the New Jerusalem is &#8220;great and high&#8221; (21:12) for a complete and perfect separation of God&#8217;s holiness. The wall surrounding the city separates what is in it from all other things. This separation in the New Jerusalem is the absolute sanctification. The designation &#8220;the holy city&#8221; means the separated city, a city that is separated from anything other than God. This city, as the embodiment of the processed Triune God, is a separated, sanctified, holy city.<p>Although the wall of the holy city is mainly for expression, spontaneously it becomes a separation and a protection. Anything that is separated is also preserved and protected. The wall separates us from everything common (21:27), protects us, and keeps us in the realm of God&#8217;s expression.<h2 class=head2>F. The Gates</h2><p>Having considered the wall of the holy city, we will now go on to consider its gates. The New Jerusalem has twelve gates (21:12). The twelve gates of the holy city are for communication, for coming in and going out. Since twelve is the number of absolute perfection and eternal completion in God&#8217;s administration, the twelve gates indicate that the communication in the New Jerusalem is absolutely perfect and eternally complete for God&#8217;s administration.<h2 class=head3>1. Being the Twelve Tribes of Israel Representing the Law of the Old Testament, Indicating That the Entrance into the Holy City Is Justified by the Law</h2><p>Revelation 21:12b tells us that the city has &#8220;twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.&#8221; Israel here represents the law of the Old Testament, indicating that the law is represented at the gates of the New Jerusalem. The law watches and observes to insure that all the communications, the comings in and the goings out, of the holy city meet all its requirements. Thus, all the communications of this city are according to the law of God.<p>We should not think that the law is useless. Nothing in the hand of God is useless. The law is not useful in producing sons, but it is useful in proving whether or not we are genuine sons of God. Grace is the mother who produces the sons, and the law checks out these sons to prove that they are genuine and thus entitled to receive the inheritance.<p>The twelve gates of the holy city were produced according to the law. Christ died for our sin according to the law, and, in a very positive sense, He was also resurrected from among the dead for the complement of the law. Even our repentance was according to the law, for we repented because we had violated the law, and we confessed our sins according to the law. Thus, the law was the basic factor in Christ&#8217;s death and in our repentance and confession. This means that the twelve pearl gates are absolutely according to the law and have fulfilled the requirements of the law. Our entrance into the holy city did not break the law; rather, it was according to the law and even a fulfillment of the law. Whatever the law required was fulfilled in our entering into the holy city. Our entrance into the New Jerusalem was altogether legal, lawful, and justified because Christ, by His death and resurrection, completely fulfilled the requirements of the law.<h2 class=head3>2. Being the Entrance for All the Saints to Enter and Participate in the Holy City</h2><p>The gates of the New Jerusalem are for all the saints to enter and participate in the holy city. Revelation 22:14 says, &#8220;Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city.&#8221; To &#8220;enter by the gates into the city&#8221; is to enter the New Jerusalem as a realm of God&#8217;s eternal blessing by regeneration through the death-overcoming and life-imparting Christ.<h2 class=head3>3. Having Twelve Angels, Ministering Spirits in God&#8217;s Salvation, Keeping the Gates according to the Grace Which Has Fulfilled the Righteous Requirements of the Law</h2><p>Revelation 21:12 tells us that at the gates of the holy city there are twelve angels. In God&#8217;s eternal economy, angels are ministering spirits (Heb. 1:14) rendering service to those who inherit salvation and participate in the eternal blessing of the New Jerusalem, the center of the new heaven and new earth. The angels will be the gatekeepers of our possession, while we will be the ones enjoying the rich inheritance in God&#8217;s eternal economy. This is all in the significance of the number twelve.<p>The twelve angels keep the gates according to the grace which has fulfilled all the righteous requirements of the law.<h2 class=head3>4. On Four Sides toward the Entire World in Four Directions to Accommodate All the Peoples with the Most Available Entrance into the City</h2><p>The holy city &#8220;lies foursquare&#8221; (Rev. 21:16) with three gates on each of the four sides: &#8220;On the east three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates&#8221; (v. 13). The gates on the four sides are toward the four directions of the earth, signifying the availability of the entrance of the holy city to all the peoples of the earth (5:9).<h2 class=head3>5. Having Three Gates on Each Side, Signifying the Threefold Entrance Composed of the Triune God</h2><p>The three gates on each side of the holy city signify that the three of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit- work together to bring people into the city. This is indicated by the three parables in Luke 15. These parables concern the shepherd and the lost sheep, the woman and the lost coin, and the father and the returned prodigal son. The shepherd refers to the Son; the father, of course, refers to the Father; and the woman signifies the Spirit. In order for a sinner to be brought back to the Father&#8217;s house, there is the need of the Son, the shepherd, to bring back the lost sheep; there is the need of the Spirit to enlighten the hearts of people that they may repent; and there is the need of the Father to receive the returned and repentant prodigal son. Hence, the Triune God is the entrance to God&#8217;s dwelling, the holy city.<p>The fact that the Triune God is working to bring people into the holy city is also implied in the Lord&#8217;s word in Matthew 28:19: &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Being baptized into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is the entrance into the holy city. Therefore, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the three gates on each side of the city.<p>The three gates are not on three sides respectively; instead, there are three gates on each of the four sides repeatedly. The gates on any one of the sides are exactly the same as the gates on the other three sides. This indicates that the Triune God is available to people in all four corners of the earth.<h2 class=head3>6. Bringing In the Mingling of Humanity with Divinity Signified by Four (Man) Multiplied by Three (God) to Form Twelve</h2><p>Three gates on each of the four sides, constituting the number twelve, implies the mingling of the Triune God with man, God&#8217;s creature. The number four signifies the creature (Rev. 4:6), and the number three, of course, signifies the Triune God. The number twelve does not denote addition but multiplication. Three multiplied by four to make twelve indicates that the Triune God mingles Himself with His creature, man, to produce a composition, a compound.<h2 class=head3>7. Being Twelve Pearls</h2><p>Revelation 21:21 says, &#8220;The twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl.&#8221; These pearls are the produce of Christ with Himself as the life-essence through His all-inclusive life-releasing death and life-secreting resurrection.<p>The gold of the holy city signifies the divine nature, and the precious stones signify what is produced by the transforming work of the Holy Spirit. The significance of the pearl is found in the way it is produced. Pearls are produced by oysters in the waters of death. When an oyster is wounded by a particle of sand, the oyster secretes its life-juice around the sand and makes it a precious pearl. This depicts Christ as the living One coming into the death waters, being wounded by us, and secreting His life-essence over us to make us precious pearls for the building of God&#8217;s eternal expression.<p>The fact that the twelve gates of the holy city are twelve pearls signifies that regeneration through the death-overcoming and life-secreting Christ is the entrance into the city. This entrance meets the requirements of the law as represented by Israel and as observed by the guarding angels. Hence, the pearl is the entrance into the city.<p>Each gate is, respectively, of one pearl. This indicates that the entrance into the city is unique and once for all; that is, it is only through the once-for-all regeneration by Christ&#8217;s overcoming, life-releasing death and His life-secreting, life-imparting resurrection. The entrance of the New Jerusalem as the holy city, therefore, is Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God to be the grace under the watching angels to fulfill all the requirements of the law. Such an entrance is altogether legal and legitimate. Praise the Lord for this marvelous entrance!<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1><h1 class=msg>(9)</h1><p>In this message we will consider four more aspects of the New Jerusalem as the holy city-the temple in the city, the light and the lamp, the street, and the throne.<h2 class=head2>G. The Temple in the City</h2><h2 class=head3>1. The City Being the Temple</h2><p>Revelation 21:22a says, &#8220;I saw no temple in it.&#8221; This verse clearly indicates that in the New Jerusalem there will be no temple. In the Old Testament the tabernacle of God was a precursor of the temple of God. Before the temple appeared, there was the tabernacle. But when the tabernacle came into its fullness, it became the temple. In keeping with this principle, the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God (v. 3) will be the temple of God. This indicates that in the new heaven and new earth the temple of God will be enlarged to be a city. Since the city itself will be the temple, there will be &#8220;no temple in it.&#8221;<h2 class=head3>2. The Inner Temple, the Holy of Holies</h2><p>The Greek word for temple in verse 22, naos, does not denote the whole temple in a common way including the Holy of Holies and the Holy Place. Rather, it denotes the inner temple, the Holy of Holies. This indicates that the entire city of New Jerusalem is the Holy of Holies. The three equal dimensions of the city (v. 16) also indicate that the whole city is the Holy of Holies, the inner temple.<h2 class=head3>3. Being the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb</h2><p>Revelation 21:22b says, &#8220;Its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.&#8221; This reveals that the temple is not material or physical. On the contrary, the temple is a personal temple, even the Triune God Himself. The expression &#8220;the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb&#8221; refers to the redeeming Triune God. Thus, the temple is a person, and this person is the Triune God, the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. Our God today is the Redeemer as well as the Triune God. This redeeming Triune God is our temple.<p>Since God and the Lamb are the temple, They cannot dwell in it, and it is not Their dwelling place. Rather, it is the dwelling place of all the redeemed saints, who serve the Triune God by dwelling in Him. On the one hand, the New Jerusalem, which is composed of all the redeemed saints, as the habitation of God, is the tabernacle; on the other hand, the New Jerusalem, which is constituted of the processed Triune God, as the dwelling place of all the redeemed saints, is the temple. Therefore, the New Jerusalem is the mutual dwelling of both the redeeming God and His redeemed. It is both the tabernacle and the temple. The tabernacle is the redeemed, and the temple is the redeeming God. This indicates strongly that the redeeming God is mingled with His redeemed, through the processes through which He has passed and the procedures in which they have shared, for His eternal expression.<p>In John 15:4 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you.&#8221; This abiding is actually a matter of dwelling. Here we have a mutual abiding, a mutual dwelling. When we take the Lord as our dwelling place, we become His dwelling place. How marvelous! The New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place, for we will dwell in God that He may dwell in us.<h2 class=head3>4. A Dwelling Place for All the Redeemed and Perfected Saints to Dwell In and Serve God in Eternity</h2><p>The temple being the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb signifies the processed Triune God as a dwelling place for all the redeemed and perfected saints to dwell in and serve God in eternity. Moses had this realization. In Deuteronomy 33:27 he said, &#8220;The God of old is your habitation,&#8221; and in Psalm 90:1 he said, &#8220;Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.&#8221; This indicates that while Moses was traveling in the wilderness with the children of Israel, according to his deep feeling he was dwelling in God.<p>Psalms 27:4 and 36:8 and 9 also refer to the saints&#8217; experience of dwelling in God. Psalm 27:4 says, &#8220;One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple.&#8221; This indicates that in the temple the saints beheld the beauty of the Lord and inquired of Him. Psalm 36:8 and 9 say, &#8220;They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.&#8221; This reveals that the saints were abundantly satisfied with the riches of God&#8217;s house, drinking of the river of God&#8217;s pleasures, enjoying the fountain of life, and receiving the divine light. This is a pre-picture of our dwelling in the Triune God in eternity.<h2 class=head2>H. The Light and the Lamp</h2><h2 class=head3>1. The City Having No Need of the Sun nor of the Moon</h2><p>Revelation 21:23 says, &#8220;The city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.&#8221; In the millennium the light of the sun and of the moon will be intensified (Isa. 30:26). But in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth, there will be no need of the sun nor of the moon. The sun and the moon will be in the new heaven and new earth, but they will not be needed in the New Jerusalem; for there God, the divine light, will shine much more brightly.<h2 class=head3>2. There Being No Night There</h2><p>In the New Jerusalem there will be no night, for &#8220;night shall be no more&#8221; (Rev. 22:5a). &#8220;Night shall not be there&#8221; (21:25b). In the new heaven and new earth there will still be the distinction between day and night, but in the New Jerusalem there will be no such distinction. Outside the city there will be night, but within the city there will be no night because the city will have an eternal, divine light, God Himself.<h2 class=head3>3. The Glory of God Illumining the City as the Light of the Divine Life, and the Lamb Being the Lamp Shining Out the Divine Light through the Transparent City as the Glory</h2><p>Revelation 21:11 and 23 tell us that the New Jerusalem has the glory of God and that her light is like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal. In the New Jerusalem Christ, as the lamp of the holy city, will shine with God within as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, the expression of the divine light. &#8220;The city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb&#8221; (v. 23). The glory of God, which is God expressed, illumines the New Jerusalem. Hence, the glory of God, with God as its substance, essence, and element, is the light of the New Jerusalem which shines in the Lamb as its lamp. The expressed glory of God, or the God of glory expressed, is the light shining in Christ as the lamp through the jasper wall of the New Jerusalem like the most precious jasper, which bears God&#8217;s appearance rich in life (v. 11). The appearance of God rich in life goes with the shining for God&#8217;s expression in His final and consummated manifestation.<p>In 21:23 we see that God is the light and Christ is the lamp. This indicates that God and the Lamb are one light. God is the content, and the Lamb, Christ, is the light-bearer, the expression. This means that God who is the light will shine in Christ as the lamp throughout the city. This is a matter of the divine dispensing, for the shining of the divine light is actually the dispensing of the processed Triune God into the believers.<p>God, the divine light, needs a lamp. Without the Lamb being the lamp, God&#8217;s shining would kill us. However, with the redeeming Christ as the lamp, the divine light does not kill us but instead illumines us. First Timothy 6:16 says that God dwells in unapproachable light. In Christ, though, God becomes approachable. Apart from Christ, God&#8217;s shining would be a killing, but in Christ God&#8217;s shining is an illumining. Because the divine light shines through the Lamb, the Redeemer, it has become lovable and touchable. Through the Lamb as the lamp God&#8217;s light becomes an enjoyable shining for God&#8217;s dispensing.<h2 class=head2>I. The Street</h2><p>Revelation 21:21 says, &#8220;The street of the city was pure gold as transparent glass.&#8221; The gates are for entering the city, whereas the street is for the daily walk, the daily living. The entering into the New Jerusalem as the holy city is through Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection, whereas the daily walk, the daily living, in the city is according to the divine nature, signified by the street being pure gold. This indicates that following the entrance of regeneration, the daily life and walk of the saints must be in the way of the divine nature.<h2 class=head3>1. A Unique Street Spiraling Down throughout the City to Reach All of the Twelve Gates</h2><p>The street in the New Jerusalem is uniquely one. There is no maze, no leading astray, and no getting lost. No matter through which gate a believer enters, he will find himself on the unique street. On this unique street we are one.<p>The street of the New Jerusalem is a spiral, coming down from the throne of God to reach all God&#8217;s chosen. Because the unique street is a spiral, it reaches every gate. This street also leads us from the gates to the throne.<h2 class=head3>2. Of Pure Gold, Signifying the Nature of God</h2><p>Revelation 21:21 tells us that the street of the holy city is pure gold. The street is part of the city proper, and every part of the city proper is gold. We have seen that gold signifies the nature of God. After we enter into the New Jerusalem, we must walk on the divine nature as our way. As we walk on the golden street, we are spontaneously regulated, for a street regulates. In the New Jerusalem everyone is regulated by the unique street, by the golden nature of God within us.<h2 class=head3>3. Like Transparent Glass, Signifying without Any Opaqueness</h2><p>The pure gold of the unique street in the New Jerusalem is &#8220;as transparent glass,&#8221; signifying without any opaqueness. The golden street is crystal clear, without any opaqueness. This indicates that if we take God&#8217;s nature as our unique way, we will be pure, without any mixture, and transparent without opaqueness.<h2 class=head2>J. The Throne</h2><h2 class=head3>1. The Center of the City</h2><p>Revelation 22:1 says, &#8220;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.&#8221; The throne here is the center of the New Jerusalem. Every nation has a center. The center of a nation is its capital, the place where the central government is located. The New Jerusalem also has a center, which is the throne of our redeeming God, the throne of God and of the Lamb.<p>According to the context of this portion of the Word, the throne of God and of the Lamb is the center of the New Jerusalem, on which the redeeming God, as indicated by the expression &#8220;God and the Lamb,&#8221; carries out His administration based upon His redemption, in His eternal kingdom in the new heaven and new earth, to keep everything in the universe in the order that serves His purpose.<h2 class=head3>2. God in the Redeeming Christ Sitting on the Throne</h2><p>The One sitting on the throne is God in the redeeming Christ. In 22:1 there are not two thrones, one for God and another for the Lamb. Rather, God and the Lamb are sitting on one throne. However, They are not sitting side by side. Instead, as indicated by 21:23, which reveals that God as the light is in the Lamb as the lamp, God is in the Lamb. The very God is in the Lamb as the lamp and shines out through Him. In the New Jerusalem God in the redeeming Christ is sitting on the throne.<p>The throne of God and of the Lamb, one throne for both God and the Lamb, signifies that God and the Lamb are one-the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, God the Redeemer. In eternity, the God who will sit on the throne is our redeeming God, from whose throne proceeds the river of water of life for our supply and satisfaction. This depicts how the Triune God- God, the Lamb, and the Spirit (symbolized by the water of life)-dispenses Himself into His redeemed ones under His headship (implied by the throne) for eternity.<h2 class=head3>3. For the Administration of the Triune God in Eternity</h2><p>The throne in the New Jerusalem is for God&#8217;s administration. God is the One who had a purpose and who made a plan in eternity past and who created all things for the fulfillment of His plan. The Lamb is the One who redeemed us, the One who accomplished a full redemption to fulfill God&#8217;s plan. Thus, the throne of God and of the Lamb denotes that this throne is to carry out God&#8217;s plan through Christ&#8217;s redemption. Both God&#8217;s plan and Christ&#8217;s redemption are being carried out through this throne. The throne is the source from which the river of water of life flows, and the river flows with the tree of life growing in it (22:2). The throne for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s eternal purpose is to flow out God Himself that by this flow of life His purpose may be accomplished.<p>All that the redeeming God administrates is for the purpose that He might be expressed. In the New Jerusalem the throne of the redeeming God is the center of the city, and His expression extends to its circumference. Therefore, the redeeming God administrating on the throne is the God both of administration and of expression. His administration serves the purpose of His expression in His eternal manifestation.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1><h1 class=msg>(10)</h1><p>In this message we will consider the four remaining aspects of the New Jerusalem as the holy city: the river, the water of life, the tree of life, and the kings and priests within the city.<h2 class=head2>K. The River</h2><p>Revelation 22:1 says, &#8220;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.&#8221; This river, as typified by the rivers in Genesis 2:10-14, Psalm 46:4, and Ezekiel 47:5-9, signifies the abundance of life in its flow. It is one river, flowing through the four directions of the holy city like the four heads of the one river in Genesis 2:10-14. This one river with its riches becomes many rivers in our experience, as indicated in John 7:38.<h2 class=head3>1. Flowing from the Throne of the Redeeming God-from the Redeeming God in His Administration</h2><p>The river in the New Jerusalem flows from the throne of the redeeming God, from the redeeming God in His administration. Hence, the flowing of the river of water of life has much to do with God&#8217;s administration.<p>This flowing from the throne is a matter of the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us. God is flowing out of Himself into His redeemed ones. This dispensing of the processed Triune God issues from God&#8217;s administrating throne. Therefore, God&#8217;s dispensing depends on His administration. The dispensing of the life supply and of God&#8217;s all-sufficient grace issues from the throne of God&#8217;s administration. In the New Jerusalem this dispensing will reach every part of the city, and the entire city will be filled, saturated, and permeated with the processed Triune God for His expression.<h2 class=head3>2. The Flowing of the Triune God as the Water of Life</h2><p>The river in the New Jerusalem as the holy city is the flowing of the Triune God as the water of life. In 22:1 we see the Triune God-God, the Lamb, and the river, which signifies the Spirit. God, the Father, is the source; the Lamb, the Son, is the course; and the river is the Spirit, the flow. Hence, we have the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow. This is the flowing of the Triune God as the water of life.<h2 class=head3>3. Flowing in the Middle of the Street, Flowing in the Way of the Divine Nature</h2><p>In 22:1 we are told that the river flows in the middle of the street of the New Jerusalem. The street of the holy city is gold, which signifies the divine nature. The river of water of life proceeding in the middle of the golden street indicates that the divine life flows in the divine nature as the unique way for the daily life of God&#8217;s redeemed people. Where the divine life flows, there is the divine nature as the holy way by which God&#8217;s people walk; and where the holy way of the divine nature is, there the divine life is flowing. The divine life and the divine nature as the holy way always go together. The river of life is available along the divine way, and we enjoy it by walking in the divine way.<p>As those who have been baptized into the Triune God, we are on the unique street. If we do not walk on this street, we will not sense the divine flow. But if we walk on this street, caring for the divine nature, we will sense the flow of the Triune God within us. In order to experience the flow of the Triune God, we must take the divine nature as our way.<h2 class=head3>4. Bright as Crystal, Having No Darkness or Opaqueness</h2><p>Revelation 22:1 also tells us that the river of water of life is &#8220;bright as crystal.&#8221; The fact that the river of water of life is bright as crystal means that it has no darkness or opaqueness. Nothing is more clear than the flow of the river of water of life within us. The more this river flows in us, the more it purifies us and makes us transparent.<h2 class=head2>L. The Water of Life</h2><p>The water of life is the flowing of the divine life. Life is actually the flowing out of God. Revelation 22:1 and 2 speak of the river of water of life flowing out of the throne of God, and of the tree of life which is in the river of water of life. Here we see that the divine life is that which flows out of God. According to His eternal nature, God Himself is life. However, if God does not flow out, although with respect to Himself He is life, yet to us He is not life. Only when God flows out is He life to us. Therefore, the life we receive as the water of life is the flowing out of the Triune God Himself.<h2 class=head3>1. The Content of the Flow of the Triune God</h2><p>The water of life is the content of the flow of the Triune God. The flow of the Triune God has a content, and this content is the divine life, the life of God.<h2 class=head3>2. The Consummated, All-inclusive, Life-giving, and Dispensing Spirit, as the Consummation of the Triune God, to Saturate and Satisfy the Entire City</h2><p>The water of life is the consummated, all-inclusive, life-giving, and dispensing Spirit, as the consummation of the Triune God to saturate and satisfy the entire city of New Jerusalem. The flow is the Triune God as life flowing within us, and this life is the consummated, all-inclusive, life-giving, and dispensing Spirit spoken of in John 7:38 and 39.<p>In verse 38 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&#8221; These rivers of living water are the many flows of the different aspects of the divine life, which is God&#8217;s Spirit of life.<p>John 7:39 goes on to say, &#8220;This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.&#8221; The Spirit of God was there from the beginning (Gen. 1:1-2), but the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7), the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9), and the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19) was &#8220;not yet&#8221; when the Lord Jesus spoke the word in John 7:38, because He had not yet been glorified through resurrection (Luke 24:26). When the Spirit was the Spirit of God, He had only the divine element. When He became the Spirit of Jesus Christ through Christ&#8217;s incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, He had both the divine and human element, with all the essence and reality of the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ. Hence, He is now the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ as the living water for us to receive.<p>With such a consummated, all-inclusive, life-giving, and dispensing Spirit there is the bountiful supply (Phil. 1:19). As this Spirit flows within us, He dispenses all the riches of the processed Triune God into our being. This Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. He is the Triune God reaching us and flowing within us to saturate and satisfy the entire city of New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head2>M. The Tree of Life</h2><h2 class=head3>1. Signifying Christ, the Embodiment of the Triune God, as the Divine Life</h2><p>Revelation 22:2 says, &#8220;On this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month, and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&#8221; The tree of life signifies Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9), as the divine life for our food. Because God and life are abstract, the abstract God needs an embodiment, and this embodiment is Christ. Christ is the embodiment of God as life. As such an embodiment, Christ is the tree of life for God to dispense Himself into us.<p>We need to differentiate between Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God and the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God. The embodiment came first. After Christ as the embodiment passed through all the steps of the process, He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God. Whereas Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is the tree of life, the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God is the water of life.<h2 class=head3>2. Growing on the Two Sides of the Flow of the Triune God</h2><p>Revelation 22:2 tells us that the tree of life is &#8220;on this side and on that side of the river.&#8221; This indicates that the tree of life grows on the two sides of the flow of the Triune God.<p>The fact that the one tree of life grows on the two sides of the river indicates that the tree of life is a vine, spreading and proceeding along the flow of the water of life for God&#8217;s people to receive and enjoy. It fulfills, for eternity, what God intended from the beginning (Gen. 2:9). The tree of life was closed to man due to his fall (Gen. 3:22-24), but was opened to the believers by the redemption of Christ (Heb. 10:19-20). Today the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life is the believers&#8217; common portion (John 6:35, 57). In the millennial kingdom the overcoming believers will enjoy Christ as the tree of life as their reward (Rev. 2:7). Eventually, in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth, all God&#8217;s redeemed will enjoy Christ as the tree of life as their eternal portion (Rev. 22:14, 19).<p>Since the tree of life grows on the two sides of the river of life, it does not grow upward but spreads like a vine. For this reason, it is available along the flow of the water of life. Christ, as the tree of life, is the life supply available along the flow of the Spirit as the water of life. Where the Spirit flows, there the life supply of Christ is found. This is all in and with the divine nature as our holy way, as signified by the golden street. This is both the supply of the city and the way the city is supplied.<h2 class=head3>3. Producing Twelve Fruits, Yielding Its Fruit Each Month, Feeding and Nourishing the Entire City</h2><p>Revelation 22:2 also tells us that the tree of life produces &#8220;twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month.&#8221; The fruits of the tree of life will be the food of God&#8217;s redeemed for eternity. These fruits will be continually fresh, produced every month, twelve fruits yearly.<p>The mention of &#8220;each month&#8221; indicates that in the new heaven and new earth the moon will still be there to divide the twelve months. The sun will also be there to separate day and night into periods of twelve hours each.<p>The fact that there are twelve fruits means that the fruit of the tree of life is rich and sufficient for the completion of God&#8217;s eternal administration. The number twelve signifies completion in God&#8217;s administration for His economy eternally. Thus, the twelve fruits are for the eternal completion in God&#8217;s administration for His economy.<h2 class=head3>4. Christ&#8217;s Deeds, Signified by the Leaves, Healing the Nations on the New Earth to Keep Them Existing for Eternity</h2><p>The last part of 22:2 says, &#8220;The leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&#8221; In the Bible, leaves are a symbol of man&#8217;s deeds (Gen. 3:7). According to the record of the Bible, the first time man used leaves was to make a covering for himself. The leaves of the tree of life symbolize the deeds of Christ. The regenerated believers will eat the fruit of the tree of life, receiving Christ as their life and life supply inwardly, that they may enjoy the divine life for eternity. The restored nations, however, will be healed by the leaves of the tree of life, taking the deeds of Christ as their guide outwardly, that they may live the human life forever. When the nations look at the way the Lord Jesus does things and behaves Himself, His deeds will become a source of healing to them, and this healing will maintain their human life forever.<h2 class=head2>N. The Kings and Priests within the City</h2><h2 class=head3>1. All the Redeemed and Perfected Saints</h2><p>In the New Jerusalem as the holy city, all the redeemed and perfected saints will be the kings and priests. Whereas during the millennium only the overcoming believers will reign with Christ, in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth, all the saints will have been perfected and matured in God&#8217;s life and thus will be the kings reigning over the nations as the people. The New Jerusalem will actually be a body of kings and priests. All the redeemed and perfected saints from both the Old Testament and the New Testament will be a royal and priestly body ruling over the nations as kings and serving God and Christ as priests.<h2 class=head3>2. Reigning Over the Nations on the New Earth for Eternity</h2><p>Those in the New Jerusalem &#8220;shall reign forever and ever&#8221; (Rev. 22:5). The New Jerusalem will reign over the nations by its shining, for &#8220;the nations shall walk by its light&#8221; (21:24). After the millennial kingdom, a part of the nations, deceived by the devil, will rebel against the Lord and will be consumed by fire from heaven (20:7-9). The rest will be transferred to the new earth as the nations and will live around the New Jerusalem and walk by its light. They will be the peoples mentioned in 21:3 and 4.<h2 class=head3>3. As Slaves of the Redeeming God, Serving Him in Eternity</h2><p>In the new heaven and new earth for eternity, all the redeemed and perfected saints will participate in the service of God. Concerning this, the last part of 22:3 says, &#8220;His slaves shall serve Him.&#8221; The pronoun Him here refers to God and the Lamb, that is, to the redeeming God, the One whom we will serve for eternity in the New Jerusalem. To serve God and the Lamb will be a blessing to God&#8217;s redeemed in eternity.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1><h1 class=msg>(11)</h1><p>Having covered the various aspects of the New Jerusalem as the holy city, we will consider in this message two other matters related to the New Jerusalem: the enjoyment in the New Jerusalem and the New Jerusalem as the conclusion of the entire divine revelation and the central and ultimate consummated significance of the entire divine revelation.<h2 class=head1>VII. THE ENJOYMENT IN THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2><h2 class=head2>A. To Participate in the Holy City as the Embodiment of All the Blessings of the Processed and Consummated Triune God; Only Those Who Are Written in the Lamb&#8217;s Book of Life Having the Right to Enter</h2><p>The first aspect of our enjoyment in the New Jerusalem will be to participate in the holy city as the embodiment of all the blessings of the processed and consummated Triune God. Revelation 22:19 says, &#8220;If anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.&#8221; This indicates that having a part in the holy city means a great deal to us.<p>Revelation 22:14c speaks of our entering &#8220;by the gates into the city.&#8221; To enter by the gates into the city is to enter the New Jerusalem as a realm of God&#8217;s eternal blessing by regeneration through the death-overcoming and life-imparting Christ. As Revelation 21:27 tells us, only those who are written in the Lamb&#8217;s book of life have the right to enter into the holy city.<p>The holy city in which we will participate and which we will enjoy is the processed and consummated Triune God mingled with all His saints. In this one entity, the holy city, we will enjoy not only the Triune God but will also enjoy the Triune God in all the saints. This means that we will enjoy the Triune God in one another and that we will enjoy one another in the Triune God.<h2 class=head2>B. To Feed on the Tree of Life as the Embodiment of the Divine Life with All Its Unsearchable Riches</h2><p>The second aspect of our enjoyment in the New Jerusalem is the tree of life. The tree of life is nothing less than Christ, the Son of God, the redeeming Lamb, as our life supply. This tree is rich, fresh, and refreshing. We have been redeemed that we may have the right to come to the tree of life.<p>Revelation 22:14a says, &#8220;Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life.&#8221; This may be regarded as a promise of the enjoyment of the tree of life, which is Christ with all the riches of the divine life.<p>After his creation, man was put before the tree of life (Gen 2:8-9), indicating that he was privileged to partake of it. But due to the fall of man, the tree of life was closed to man by God&#8217;s glory, holiness, and righteousness (Gen. 3:24). Through Christ&#8217;s redemption, which has fulfilled all the requirements of God&#8217;s glory, holiness, and righteousness, the way to the tree of life has been opened again to the believers (Heb. 10:19-20). Hence, the believers who wash their robes in the redeeming blood of Christ have the right to enjoy the tree of life as their eternal portion in the holy city, the paradise of God in eternity (Rev. 2:7; 22:14).<h2 class=head2>C. To Drink of the Water of Life Flowing from Its Spring (Christ) as the Flow of the Processed and Consummated Triune God</h2><p>Another aspect of the enjoyment of God&#8217;s redeemed in eternity is the water of life (Rev. 22:17; 21:6). The water of life of the life-giving Spirit is our eternal drink, and the life-giving Spirit is actually the processed and consummated Triune God flowing Himself out to be our drink. We need to both eat and drink, for it is not pleasant to eat without having anything to drink. We praise the Lord that for eternity in the New Jerusalem we will have food, the tree of life, and drink, the life-giving Spirit.<p>In the New Jerusalem all of God&#8217;s redeemed will drink the water of life as their eternal portion. This indicates that even in eternity future we will still need the supply of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. That dispensing will be the spring of the water of life. The spring is God Himself in Christ, and the water of life is the flow of the life-giving Spirit. In the New Jerusalem the Triune God Himself will be flowing as the water of life for our supply eternally.<p>The water of life as our eternal drink is clear as crystal (22:1). In the life-giving Spirit there is nothing opaque. As we drink this eternal Spirit, everything becomes crystal clear.<h2 class=head2>D. To Live in the Divine Light of the Divine Life Embodied in the Redeeming Lamb</h2><p>In the New Jerusalem God&#8217;s redeemed will live in the divine light of the divine life embodied in the redeeming Lamb (Rev. 21:23). The divine light is the divine life embodied in the redeeming Lamb operating within us. The Lamb as the lamp shines with God as the light to illumine the New Jerusalem.<p>Revelation 22:5 says, &#8220;Night shall be no more; and they have no need of the light of a lamp and the light of the sun, for the Lord God shall illumine them.&#8221; Being illumined by the Lord God is another aspect of the eternal enjoyment in the New Jerusalem. We will have no need of a lamp, the light made by man, nor of the sun, the light created by God. God Himself in the Lamb will shine upon us, and we will live under His illumination.<h2 class=head2>E. To Dwell in the Processed and Consummated Triune God as the Temple</h2><p>In the New Jerusalem we shall dwell in the processed and consummated Triune God as the temple. Revelation 21:22 says, &#8220;I saw no temple in it, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.&#8221; This indicates that the processed Triune God will be the holy city as the temple, which will be the eternal dwelling of all His redeemed people, where they will live with Him and serve Him. In the coming eternity, the holy city will be the tabernacle as God&#8217;s eternal dwelling and the temple as our eternal dwelling. Eventually, it will be a mutual dwelling of God and us.<h2 class=head2>F. To Partake of the Divine Kingship and Priesthood</h2><p>In the New Jerusalem we will partake of the divine kingship and priesthood. Revelation 22:5b says, &#8220;They shall reign forever and ever.&#8221; This is a matter of the divine kingship. In the New Jerusalem for eternity we will reign as kings over the nations that will be on the new earth.<p>The last part of Revelation 22:3 says, &#8220;His slaves shall serve Him.&#8221; The pronoun &#8220;Him&#8221; in this verse refers to God and to the Lamb; God and the Lamb are one in eternity. In eternity we shall serve God and the Lamb. This verse indicates that we will serve God as priests. For eternity in the New Jerusalem, all the believers will participate in the priesthood.<h2 class=head1>VIII. THE CONCLUSION OF THE ENTIRE DIVINE REVELATION AND THE CENTRAL AND ULTIMATE CONSUMMATED SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ENTIRE DIVINE REVELATION</h2><p>I would like to conclude this message by giving a further word on Revelation 21:1-8. These eight verses present a clear picture of the new heaven and new earth. These verses may also be considered an outline of Revelation 21 and 22.<p>Verse 1 says, &#8220;I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more.&#8221; In eternity past God purposed to have a corporate expression that He might be fully expressed and glorified, and for this purpose He created the heavens, the earth, and mankind. After the millennium, the old heaven and old earth will pass away through fire and be renewed into the new heaven and new earth (2 Pet. 3:10-13), into which the New Jerusalem will come for God&#8217;s eternal expression.<p>Revelation 21:2 speaks of the New Jerusalem. &#8220;I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&#8221; We have strongly emphasized the fact that the New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the saints redeemed by God throughout all generations. It is the bride of Christ as His counterpart and the holy city as God&#8217;s habitation.<p>Revelation 21:3 and 4 speak not of the New Jerusalem but of the peoples on the new earth. &#8220;I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be His peoples, and God Himself shall be with them. And He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more; nor sorrow, nor crying, nor pain-they shall be no more; for the former things have passed away.&#8221; The word peoples in verse 3 indicates that these verses apply not to the saints but to the restored nations on the new earth. As God&#8217;s redeemed, we are His unique people (1 Pet. 2:9; Titus 2:14), whereas the restored nations are His peoples, those for whom the kingdom was prepared from the foundation of the world (Matt. 25:34) but not before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4). God Himself will tabernacle among His peoples, even as the Lord, in His incarnation, tabernacled among us (John 1:14). Therefore, we should not misapply these verses in Revelation 21 by applying them to the saints in the New Jerusalem. Verse 4 refers not to the blessings we will enjoy in the New Jerusalem but to the blessings to be enjoyed by the restored nations on the new earth.<p>If we read Revelation 21:1-8 carefully, we will realize that verse 5 begins a new paragraph and introduces a new subject-the sons of God in eternity. Verses 5 through 7 say, &#8220;He who sits upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He said, Write, for these words are faithful and true. And He said to me, They are come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely. He who overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he shall be a son to Me.&#8221; The word inherit in verse 7 is important, for it indicates that in eternity the sons of God will have an inheritance. However, in verses 3 and 4 there is no indication that the restored nations will have an inheritance.<p>Verse 7 tells us that the sons of God will inherit &#8220;these things.&#8221; These things are the spring and the water of life mentioned in verse 6. The spring and the water of life will be our inheritance for our eternal enjoyment.<p>The one who inherits the spring and the water of life will be a son to God. The sons of God are the components of the New Jerusalem. As such, they are a different category from the peoples, the restored nations.<p>In 21:7 we have the conclusion of the entire revelation in the New Testament concerning the divine sonship. Ephesians 1:5 says that we were predestinated unto sonship; Romans 8:29, that we, who once were sinners but have been made sons by God, are being conformed to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son; and Hebrews 2:10, that God is leading many sons into glory. Hence, the New Testament reveals that God&#8217;s intention is to produce sons and that the New Jerusalem is the totality of the divine sonship. In Revelation 21:7 we have the concluding word of the revelation in the New Testament concerning the divine sonship.<p>In 21:8 we have a word concerning the perished in the lake of fire. &#8220;But the fearful and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolators and all the false, their part shall be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.&#8221; Here we have the third category of people in eternity. The first category consists of the peoples, and God will tabernacle among them. The second category is the sons of God, who constitute the New Jerusalem and who will inherit the spring and the water of life for their enjoyment. The third category is the perished in the lake of fire. Satan, the demons, and all rebellious human beings will be swept into the lake of fire, the universal &#8220;trash can.&#8221; This means that on the new earth there will be the New Jerusalem, the restored nations surrounding the holy city, and the lake of fire containing all the rebellious ones.<p>In Revelation 21:1-8 we have a brief and clear presentation of biblical eschatology. Here, in the new heaven and new earth, we see the New Jerusalem composed of God&#8217;s sons, the restored nations as the peoples, and the lake of fire. The lake of fire will, in a negative way, show forth God&#8217;s righteousness, for all who are in it will suffer God&#8217;s righteous judgment. But the New Jerusalem will, in a positive way, show forth God&#8217;s holiness and shine with His glory. This is a clear picture of the eschatology in the New Testament.</body></html>
