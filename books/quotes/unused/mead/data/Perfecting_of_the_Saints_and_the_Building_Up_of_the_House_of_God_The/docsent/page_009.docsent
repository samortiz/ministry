   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CHURCH DEPENDING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ON THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS PERFECTING THE SAINTS FOR THE BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The principle for the practical building up of the church is revealed mainly in Ephesians 4:11-16: He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error, but holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The wind of teaching in verse 14 should not be understood as a wind of heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this verse the word teaching is used according to its common meaning in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It does not imply heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A teaching may be scriptural but still distract the believers and carry them away from God s central purpose, which is to build up the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a teaching is a wind of teaching sent by Satan to entice the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this portion of Ephesians the phrase building up is used twice.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is first used in verse 12 and then in verse 16.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 16 building up refers to the Body itself; that is, the Body builds itself up directly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we have only verse 12 but not verse 16, we will not be clear whether the building up in verse 12 is by the gifted persons spoken of in verse 11 or by the Body itself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without verse 16, verse 12 is not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are many debates among Bible translators concerning how to punctuate Ephesians 4:12.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Translators of the Bible differ in their views concerning how to punctuate this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One view is that verse 12 should be punctuated with semicolons: For the perfecting of the saints; unto the work of the ministry; unto the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Another view is that commas should be used instead of semicolons.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Chinese Union Version uses commas.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The original text of the Bible does not have any punctuation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the way a verse is punctuated depends on how the Bible translators understand the text.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not think that the punctuation used in a verse is an insignificant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When semicolons are used to punctuate verse 12, the three things listed are carried out by the gifted persons referred to in verse 11.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The gifted persons perfect the saints, they do the work of the ministry, and they build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The punctuation of the Chinese Union Version gives a different understanding: The gifted persons perfect the saints, and the perfected saints do the work of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the perfected saints do the work of the ministry, they build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is a significant difference in meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If verse 12 is punctuated with semicolons, the gifted persons build up the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if this verse is punctuated with commas, the gifted persons do not build up the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead, the saints who are perfected by the gifted persons build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the punctuation is an important factor in determining the meaning of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of the strong arguments concerning the use of both punctuation marks, I have spent much time considering how to punctuate this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A careful study of Ephesians 4:12 shows that it is more accurate to punctuate this verse with commas than with semicolons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to consider the goal of perfecting the saints, the function of the saints after they are perfected, and whether the perfected saints have a function.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is it possible for the gifted persons to continue to do the work of the ministry and build up the Body of Christ while the perfected saints are idle?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Are the perfected saints unable to do the work of the ministry and build up the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The gifted persons perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the perfected saints take part in the work of the ministry because they are perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since the perfected saints are members of the Body of Christ, the result of their participating in the work of the ministry is the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This explanation is according to the truth, and it is logical.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Otherwise, the perfected saints do not function, and the gifted persons continue to do the work of the ministry and build up the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This explanation is not logical.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Another reason for using commas is in verse 16, which states clearly that every member of the Body operates and functions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This function corresponds to the work of the ministry in verse 12 and issues in the Body building itself up.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, according to verse 16 the building up of the church in verse 12 should be directly by the perfected saints and not by the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These two reasons are based on the text of Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A third reason is found in the teaching of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The apostles, including Paul, rarely stayed in one place for a long time to build up the church in that place Acts 8:25; 14:20-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Most of the time there were no apostles in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some may wonder how a local church can be built up if the gifted persons spoken of in Ephesians 4:11 are not present.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church must be built up, but how is the church built up, and who builds it up?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The local church is built up through the operation in the measure of each one part.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the way the local church builds itself up.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The teaching of the New Testament also proves that the building up in verse 12 is not only by the gifted persons; it is by the saints whom the gifted persons perfect.</S>
