   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FORTY-SEVEN THE PROPITIATION 2 Scripture Reading: Lev 16:17-34</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider further the details concerning the propitiation in Leviticus 16.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>WHEN AARON WENT IN TO MAKE PROPITIATION IN THE HOLY OF HOLIES, NO MAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE TENT OF MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"No man shall be in the tent of meeting when he goes in to make propitiation in the holy of holies until he comes out, and has made propitiation for himself, for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel" v. 17 . This signifies that the Lord Jesus alone can make propitiation for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only the Lord Jesus was qualified to die for us and for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only He was qualified to accomplish redemption for our sins in the holy of holies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Concerning this, the type in Leviticus 16 is definite and clear.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>XIII.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>AFTER MAKING PROPITIATION FOR HIMSELF, FOR HIS WHOLE HOUSEHOLD, AND FOR THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD OF ISRAEL, AARON COMING OUT TO THE ALTAR AND MAKING PROPITIATION FOR IT A. Putting the Blood of the Bull and the Blood of the Goat on the Horns of the Altar All Around</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Then he shall go out to the altar which is before Jehovah and make propitiation for it: he shall take some of the blood of the bull and some of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar all around" v. 18 . The bull was for Aaron and his household, and the goat was for the entire people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The four horns were toward the four directions of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Putting the blood of the bull and of the goat on the horns of the altar all around signifies that the efficacy of the redemption on the cross is toward the four corners of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. With His Fingers Aaron Sprinkling Some of the Blood on the Altar Seven Times</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"And with his finger he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it seven times" v. 19a . This signifies that the full efficacy of the blood shed on the cross by Christ is so that the sinner may be at peace in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we sinners look at the blood sprinkled on the altar, we know that our sin and sins have been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Knowing that the problem of sin has been solved, we have peace in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whereas the blood sprinkled on the altar is for our peace, the blood sprinkled on the propitiatory cover is for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First the blood was sprinkled on the propitiatory cover within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was for God to see.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then the blood was sprinkled on the offering altar in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is for us to see.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is for our satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both God and we are satisfied through the blood of the redeeming Christ.</S>
