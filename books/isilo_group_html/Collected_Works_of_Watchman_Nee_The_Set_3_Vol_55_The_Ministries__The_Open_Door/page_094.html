I only now dare to write a little bit.</p><p>In the summer of 1948, there were sudden, terrible landslides into the river in the region of Nansha, Xiaoshan in Chekiang province (including the localities of Jiazaowan, Shi-Er-Dai, Dangshanwan, Meilinwan, Sinwan, Toupeng, and Sanchadai. This is the region along the river in Nansha.) The areas worst hit were Shi-Er-Dai and Dangshanwan. In less than two months several thousand Chinese acres of land slid into the river. The homes of the brothers living on this land were carried away to the east. Some of these brothers had no place to live, and some were willing to submit to the authority of the church and wait for the church's arrangement. They dared not loosely seek their own way. With the exception of a small number who moved away, the rest were temporarily placed by the church in homes of the brothers whose houses had not slid into the river. At that time, it seemed outwardly that the church had met with a great difficulty, but this was really the beginning of God's move to carry out His plan.</p><p>One afternoon, I was talking with a brother when he suddenly said, "Let us move to Kiangsi." From that day God began to operate in us for His work because we were inexplicably caught by this idea. At first we did not want to tell anyone about this matter because we thought it was impossible. We thought it was nothing more than something we had talked and thought about. Later, we privately told a few brothers who pursued the Lord and who had learned lessons in the service about this constant inward burden. Who would have thought that once we mentioned it, they would receive the burden also? In this way, it spread from one to another until many brothers knew about this matter. Nevertheless, we dared not speak about it publicly because we were afraid of going contrary to God's will, not to mention that this was a very difficult proposition. However, the outward difficulties could not suppress the inward burden, and because we did not have the confirmation from the Word, we dared not hold on to the inward burden.</p><p>We were caught in a dilemma of not knowing what to do. During that time Brother Witness Lee held a ten-day conference in Hangchow (October 25 to November 3, 1948). We brought up this matter during one of the discussion meetings one day. Praise the Lord. Through the mouth of His apostle, the Lord publicly announced the message about migration for the gospel in the conference. Brother Lee also told us how the brothers in Chefoo had met with great suffering because they migrated too late. He told us clearly that the church had not progressed because a group of old Christians were unwilling to leave. They were occupying the place of others. As a result, for many years it was hard for newly saved ones to be added to the church. Today if God's children are willing to leave their homes at all cost, God will immediately raise up a group of saved ones to fill the empty seats. The ones who go out will be able to raise up another group of people as well, so the church will be raised up everywhere, and God's will can be accomplished everywhere. God's requirement today is that His children go out. If the brothers from Shi-Er-Dai leave, perhaps the land will stop sliding into the river. (This word came to pass later.) Therefore, leave quickly! Brother Lee confirmed this word with the verse: "Go [migrate] into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation" (Mark 16:15)....At this point, we could only believe, submit, and worship. We quickly made a long-distance phone call to the brothers in Shi-Er-Dai to tell them that migration was God's requirement. We asked them to wait in peace before God. (At that time the river banks were sliding terribly, and brothers' houses were dropping off one by one.) Praise the Lord! He prevailed in this step.</p><p>After the conference we hurried home and told the brothers the details of the message God had preached through His apostle. We also asked them to pray much for God to accomplish His desire. After awhile, we had them sign up to migrate on one Lord's Day afternoon. Praise the Lord! About twenty brothers (representing their families) signed up. The work of migration formally started that day. We felt that the first step should be to go to Kiangsi to see the situation, just as Moses sent twelve spies to spy out the land when the Israelites were about to enter Canaan (Num. 13:1-20). I invited five brothers to go with me. On the trip we paid attention to the hand of God to see if He would confirm His will for us to migrate to Kiangsi. We stayed in Brother Fan Chi-hung's home in Guali for the first night. (Brother Fan was one of the brothers who went along.) We prepared to get up at 11:00 in the night to hire a boat to take us to Xiaoshan to catch the early train. Before we slept, we prayed that the Lord would make us watchful so as to not waste His time. As we wakened from our sleep and were lying quietly in bed, we suddenly heard a clock clearly striking 11:00. We hurriedly got out of bed and dressed. Just as we were going out the door, we looked at the clock on the wall and were surprised to see that it had stopped at 9:00 at night. We marveled and rejoiced. Although the clock did not work, God did not sleep. Oh! He kept us from napping by day and sleeping at night. We could only fall down and worship Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_093.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_095.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministries & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 94</div><br></body></html>
