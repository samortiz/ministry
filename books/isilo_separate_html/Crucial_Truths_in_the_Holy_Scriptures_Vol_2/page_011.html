for Receiving the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>The second kind of laying on of hands is for receiving the Holy Spirit. This kind of laying on of hands is similar to the laying on of hands for acceptance, which also involves receiving the Holy Spirit. These two kinds of laying on of hands are actually one, and the results of their two functions are connected. The function of receiving people into the Body of Christ is connected to the function of receiving the Holy Spirit because when a person is received into the Body of Christ, he spontaneously receives the Holy Spirit, who is on the Body. Similarly, when a person receives the Holy Spirit, he becomes a part of the Body (1 Cor. 12:13).</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He had not yet fallen upon any of them...Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 8:16-17).</p>
<p>The Samaritan believers believed and were baptized into Christ, but the Holy Spirit did not fall upon any of them until Peter and John came and laid their hands upon them. Therefore, the apostles&rsquo; laying on of hands caused them to receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?...And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 19:1-6).</p>
<p>The Ephesian believers, like the Samaritans, did not receive the Holy Spirit until the apostle laid his hands upon them. Paul laid his hands on them, causing them to receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Ananias...laying his hands on him...said, Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me...so that you may...be filled with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 9:17).</p>
<p>The Lord sent Ananias to lay his hands on Saul so that Saul could be filled with the Holy Spirit, that is, so that he could receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The preceding three passages speak of representatives of the Body of Christ laying their hands on new believers so that the anointing on the Body of Christ could flow to them and so that they could receive the Holy Spirit who is on the Body of Christ. These representatives of the Body of Christ were living in the Body and had the Holy Spirit, who is on the Body, on themselves. Therefore, when they laid their hands on the new believers, they not only represented the Body to receive the new ones, but they also communicated the Holy Spirit who was upon them to the new believers. The Holy Spirit upon them was like electricity that could pass to those whom they laid their hands on, causing them to receive the Holy Spirit and to participate in the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Laying On of Hands<br />
for the Impartation of Gifts</h2>
<p>The third kind of laying on of hands is for the impartation of gifts by which a person with a gift imparts his gift to another through the laying on of hands.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 1:6).</p>
<p>Paul, through the laying on of his hands, imparted his gift into Timothy. The gift in Paul was transmitted to Timothy through the laying on of hands.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The gift which is in you...by means of prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 4:14).</p>
<p>This must refer to the matter in 2 Timothy 1:6. Paul laid his hands on Timothy with the elders in the church in order for Timothy to obtain a gift. Paul was an apostle, and an apostle represents the universal church. The elders of the church represent the local church. The apostle and the elders together represent the entire church, the Body of Christ. Christ gave all His gifts to the Body, the church (cf. Eph. 4; Rom. 12; 1 Cor. 12). The apostle and the elders joined together to lay hands on Timothy and were the representatives of the Body so that the gifts given by the Head to the Body could be dispensed to one of the members.</p>
<p>In ancient times Moses dispensed his glory and honor to Joshua through the laying on of his hand (Num. 27:18-20), and the angel Gabriel gave Daniel insight with understanding through the laying on of hands (Dan. 9:21-22, Chinese Union Version). In principle, these instances of the laying on of hands were for the impartation of gifts.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Laying On of Hands for Appointment</h2>
<p>The fourth kind of laying on of hands is to appoint someone to do something.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Appoint over this need...Whom they set before the apostles; and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 6:3, 6).</p>
<p>In the early church in Jerusalem, the apostles appointed seven brothers in the church to be responsible for the daily dispensing of food; after praying for them, they laid their hands on them. The apostles&rsquo; laying on of hands was related to their appointment for the daily dispensing of food. This kind of laying on of hands can be called the laying on of hands for appointment. However, we must never think that the laying on of hands for appointment is some kind of ordination ritual. The purpose of this kind of laying on of hands is for fellowship and identification. When the early apostles laid their hands on the seven brothers, they were having fellowship with them, causing them to receive the grace needed for the daily dispensing of food. Simultaneously, they were joined to them, participating in their service and bearing the responsibility for this ministry with them in spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
