   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE LIFE AND HEART OF A DEPUTY AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: Mark 10:35-45 DRINKING THE LORD'S CUP AND PARTAKING OF HIS BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the Lord was on the earth, He rarely taught others how to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is because His goal on earth was not to establish authority among men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Mark 10:35-45 contains the clearest teaching concerning how to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anyone who wants to be an authority must read this passage; it is the Lord's own teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here He shows us the way to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We know that the conversation was initiated by James and John; they wanted to sit on the right and left of the Lord in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They knew that such a request was somewhat blunt, and they were too shy to mention it to the Lord directly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead they said, "We want You to do for us whatever we ask You" v. 35 . They said this to first secure a promise from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the Lord did not answer them immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He asked, "What do you want Me to do for you?" v. 36 . Since He did not know what they wanted, He could not promise them anything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At this point they said, "Grant to us to sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory" v. 37 . This request implies two things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, they wanted to be near the Lord, and second, they wanted authority in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was proper for them to desire to be near the Lord; such a request was properly directed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But that was not all they wanted; they wanted authority in glory as well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They wanted to be over the other ten disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What did the Lord say to them?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First, He said that He did not know what they wanted Him to do.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then He said that even they themselves did not know what they were asking v. 38a .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They thought that sitting on the right and the left was something that the Lord could grant or dispense to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the Lord told them that it was not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They wanted to be near the Lord and to have authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord did not say that their request was wrong, nor did He say that it was wrong to desire to be at His right and left side.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He told them that in order to be on His right and left, they had to drink of His cup and be baptized with His baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>James and John thought that they would acquire the place merely by asking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the Lord told them that it was not a matter of asking but a matter of drinking the cup and partaking of the baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not a matter of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not a matter of trying to sit on the right or left side of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If one does not drink of the Lord's cup and is not baptized with His baptism, his asking is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a man does not drink of the Lord's cup and is not baptized with His baptism, he cannot be near Him nor can he have any authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord is not free to grant position and authority to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only those who drink His cup and are baptized with His baptism are given position and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Drinking and baptism are the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the foundation is wrong, there cannot be the right superstructure.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose a child goes up to the mountain to pick flowers and then plants the flowers back in the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even though he thinks that he has planted a garden, the flowers have no roots.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>James and John were wrong in the root matters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to be near the Lord and have authority in glory, they needed to drink His cup and be baptized with His baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the disciples did not drink His cup and were not baptized with His baptism, they could neither be near Him nor receive authority and position.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is something that they would understand shortly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is something that has to do with today, not just with the future.</S>
