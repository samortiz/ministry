   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE PRINCIPLE OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ASSISTING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If a believer desires to walk according to the spirit, he must know the laws of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only those who know the laws of the spirit are able to understand the various senses of the spirit and their meaning and walk according to the demand of the senses in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All of the demands of the spirit are expressed through its senses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ignoring the senses of the spirit will cause us to miss the demands of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, understanding and walking according to the laws of the spirit are very crucial in our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, in addition to understanding the laws of the spirit, believers who walk according to the spirit have to know another matter: the principle of the mind assisting the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This principle is no less important than the laws of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the pathway of walking according to the spirit, this principle has to be constantly applied.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Understanding the laws of the spirit without understanding the principle of the mind assisting the spirit will still cause us to fail.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The laws of the spirit only explain to us the various senses of the spirit, their significance, and the way to fulfill their demands.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever we have the sense of the spirit, we can walk according to the sense of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the condition is normal, we can walk accordingly; if abnormal, we can adjust our way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But we may not always have the sense of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The spirit may not always speak; sometimes it remains silent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the experiences of many believers, the spirit often does not speak for many days.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At this time, it seems that the spirit is inactive and sleeping within us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the spirit remains inactive for a few days, should we not do anything for a few days and wait until the spirit moves?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Should we sit quietly for a few days without praying, reading the Word, and working?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our spiritual common sense will answer, no, we should not waste time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, if we do anything, are we not doing it outside of the spirit and in the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is when we should apply the principle of the mind assisting the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How does the mind support the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the spirit is sleeping, we should use our mind to work in place of the spirit, and before very long, the spirit will also join in to work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The mind and the spirit are closely related; they are a help to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times the spirit gives forth a sense which makes the mind understand and makes the person take action.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, sometimes the spirit does not move.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, it is necessary for the believer to activate the spirit by exercising his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the spirit does not move, the mind must activate the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After the spirit moves, the believers are able to move according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Activating the spirit by the mind is called the principle of the mind assisting the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is a principle in the spiritual life: in the beginning we should use the sense of the spirit to perceive the knowledge given to us by God; later we should guard and apply this knowledge with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For instance, according to previous knowledge from God, if you see a great need, you should pray and ask God to meet this need.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, when you see a particular need, your spirit may not have a sense to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You should apply your mind to pray; do not wait for the sense of the spirit to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All needs are a call to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If in the beginning you ignore the silence of the spirit and keep on praying, before long you will sense something rising up within you your spirit is now joining in the praying.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When our spirit is oppressed by Satan, or when we are entangled by our natural life, we sometimes do not even sense where our spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The spirit sinks to such a low position that we do not even have any sensation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can sense our soul and body, but the position of the spirit seems void.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we wait for the sense of the spirit to pray, there probably will not be an opportunity for prayer, and the spirit will also not be liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, the way to pray is according to the truth which we know and remember in our mind, standing against the principality of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although we do not sense the spirit, we should pray according to what we know in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This activity of the mind will stimulate the spirit to move.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The prayer by understanding 1 Cor 14:15 will stir up the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although at the beginning it may seem that we are only praying with empty and rather meaningless words, if we exercise our mind to resist by praying, the spirit will ascend after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then both the spirit and mind will cooperate to work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since we have learned some truths about the battle and the way to pray, even though we do not sense our spirit, we can still use our mind so that the spirit will join in because of the stirring in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As soon as the spirit comes, we will feel that our prayer is very meaningful and free.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The harmonious co-laboring of the spirit and mind is a normal state of the spiritual life.</S>
