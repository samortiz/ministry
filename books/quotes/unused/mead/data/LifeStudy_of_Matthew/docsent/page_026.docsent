   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Cast Out Demons</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The name of Jesus is also good for casting out demons Acts 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To know the power of the name of Jesus, use it to cast out demons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Demons know the power of the name of Jesus better than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Demons are subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From our experience in China, where there were many cases of demon possession, we have learned that when we cast out demons, we must tell them that this Jesus is not the ordinary, common Jesus, but that He is the designated Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must say, Demon, I come in the very name of Jesus, the Son of God, who was incarnated to be a man, who was born of a virgin in Bethlehem, who was raised in Nazareth, who died on the cross for my sins and for the sins of this person that is possessed, who was resurrected from the dead, and who has ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I come in the name of this Jesus, and I command you to leave!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Immediately, the demon will depart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, if you say, I cast you out in the name of Jesus, the demon will not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Demons know the power of the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When you cast out a demon, there is no need to pray that much.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Simply say, I come in the name of the designated Jesus, and you must go!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Jesus comes, demons must flee.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>j.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To Preach</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The name of Jesus is for us to preach Acts 9:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we preach, we must preach in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Preaching in the Lord s name must be done in the Spirit, for the Spirit is the Person of the Lord and the reality of His name.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we preach in His name, we need the Spirit to make it real.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through all the things that can be done in the name of Jesus, we see that whatever we do and whatever we are must be in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Never forget the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His name is a sweet name, a rich name, a powerful name, a saving name, a healing name, a comforting name, and an available name.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the name that is exalted, honored, and respected.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And it is the name feared by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Satan s Hatred of the Name of Jesus a. Attacking This Name</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Satan hates the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1935 the church in my home town was revived, and we were all burdened to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every night we went to the streets to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One night, as we were preaching on a street corner, a man about thirty years of age was very bold to scoff at the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A brother went up to him in a very nice way and asked if they could have a little talk.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When he agreed, the brother asked, Have you ever met Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He said, No. Then the brother asked, Have you ever heard of Jesus? Again, he said, No. After that, the brother said, Has Jesus done something bad to you? He said, Never.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then the brother inquired, You have never met Jesus, and He has never done anything bad to you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why then do you hate Him?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He replied, Although I ve never met Him and although I ve never been damaged by Him, I still hate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the brother asked, Why don t you hate me?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The man answered, I don t hate you; I hate Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why? inquired the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I don t know, said the man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then the brother asked, Sir, may I relate a fact to you?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The man consented and the brother said, Let me tell you, you do not hate Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is someone else who hates Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because you have never met Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not you!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the man asked the brother who it was who hated Jesus, the brother answered, It is the Devil within you who hates Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By all this we see that Satan utilizes people to attack the name of Jesus Acts 26:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a believer, you probably have had the following experience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When you are about to talk to others about Plato or Abraham Lincoln, you do not feel ashamed; but whenever you talk to people about Jesus, a strange feeling comes over you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the Chinese speak about Confucius, they feel glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should also feel glorious whenever we speak to others about Jesus, but often we do not have a glorious feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead, we have a rather strange feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is devilish!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this universe and on this earth there is a devilish element that is against Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You have no problem as long as you are talking about the world situation, the economy, science, and so many things; but whenever you talk about the name of Jesus, you have a strange sense.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This comes from the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because Satan and all his demons hate the name of Jesus, we must proclaim it all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must be bold with this name and say, Satan, Jesus is my Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Satan, stay away!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to shout the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Preventing Speaking in This Name</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you read the book of Acts, you will see that in the early days the religionists attacked the name of Jesus, forbidding the believers to preach or teach in that name Acts 4:17-18; 5:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Pharisees warned Peter and John not to preach in the name of Jesus, not to do anything or say anything in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It was all right to preach the Bible, but not to preach in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Satan hates the name of Jesus because he knows that God s salvation is in this name.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The more we preach in the name of Jesus and the more we pray to Jesus, the more people will get saved.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the reason Satan hates this name.</S>
