<p>Let us now consider the history of the recovery in the Far East. We are also a part of God&rsquo;s work of recovery. During the past thirty to forty years, the focus of this work has been the Word. I believe that the Lord would allow us to say that since the time Christianity was brought to the Far East two hundred years ago, the Word of God has not been released as it has been released among us. Not only so, in certain aspects we have excelled beyond Western Christianity. In relation to the work, the churches that have been raised up in the localities are the fruit of the Word. The co-workers, elders, deacons, and those bearing responsibility in the churches are also the product of the Word. In brief, we have been built up by the Word. Many saints were saved and raised up in the last ten years. The work and the churches in Taiwan were built up by the Word. By our preaching and releasing God&rsquo;s Word and by our reading and studying His Word, not only have the work and the churches been raised up, but co-workers and various responsible ones have been produced. Everything has been brought forth through the Word of God. Hence, we say that we are built up by the Word.</p>
<p>Not only so, the words that God has given us are full of the Spirit and contain the riches of the Spirit. Brother Nee is a good example. He was raised up by the Lord, and those who listened to his messages sensed the presence of the Spirit. When he gave a message, he would speak for one and a half hours, but those listening sensed the flowing out of living water. No one could deny that his words were of the Spirit. That was the situation among us in the beginning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DANGER OF HAVING ONLY THE WORD</h2>
<p>However, we must be careful. If we emphasize only the Word, after an extended period of time we will not have much of the Spirit. Initially, the ministry of the word can be full of the Spirit, but gradually the Spirit will be lost, until the words we speak no longer convey the Spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery begins with the Word, but we cannot stop with the ministry of the word. The Spirit must match the Word. The supply in the church depends on the Word as well as on the Spirit. In a normal condition the supply from the Word is the supply of the Spirit. If we have the Word but neglect the Spirit, the words we utter will not convey the Spirit, and we will be left with dead letters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EMPHASIZING THE SPIRIT MORE</h2>
<p>We need to know the distinction between the supply of the Word and the supply of the Spirit. It is a mistake to depend merely on the ministry of the word or to lean heavily on the supply of the Word. We must rely on the Word as well as the Spirit. If we must emphasis something, it is better to emphasize the Spirit.</p>
<p>In Acts 6:4 the apostles said, &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.&rdquo; Prayer is mentioned before the ministry of the word. Prayer is related to the supply of the Spirit, and the ministry of the word is related to the supply of the Word. This verse shows the sequence of these two matters. In Acts the apostles emphasized prayer; they prayed first. In their move, the Spirit was first and then the ministry of the word followed. Prior to Pentecost the apostles did not preach the word; rather, they prayed for ten days (1:13-15). Undoubtedly, their prayers were of a priestly nature with the release of the spirit; that is, they prayed by blending in spirit. They did not pray in the mind or according to regulations. The apostles prayed in spirit, in the Holy of Holies. We should believe that their times of prayer were not unplanned; rather, they would have prayed at scheduled times, ministering in the presence of God, just as the priests in the Old Testament ministered to God day and night, according to their course. Moreover, their prayers should not have been individual prayers but corporate prayers; about a hundred and twenty disciples prayed as one entity. The prayers of the disciples in the ten days prior to the day of Pentecost were the fulfillment of the burning of incense by the Old Testament priests when they ministered to God. The issue of such prayers was the pouring out of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit came first, and then Peter stood up to release the word. Acts was a new beginning; it was not a recovery. Thus, this example shows that the Spirit is first and is followed by the Word. During the time of recovery, the desolate situation requires that people&rsquo;s concepts be corrected and that their understanding be opened. Hence, God recovers first with the Word and then with the Spirit.</p>
<p>Even though I am busy working, I often go before the Lord to consider and observe these matters. The more I observe, the clearer I become. The recovery of the Word is not lacking among us, but we lack the supply of the Spirit. It does not match the supply of the ministry of the word; hence, the supply of the Word has diminished. We have more of the Word and less of the Spirit. There is an insufficient flow of the water of life and an inadequate blending in spirit. This is our condition. We must see that God works first through the Spirit and then through the Word. Although the Word is first in the work of recovery, the Word must be followed by the Spirit. The Word is for initiating and opening, but it must be followed immediately by the Spirit. This is the proper way.</p>
<p>We must humbly admit that we still do not have sufficient knowledge of the Word of God. Not to mention the intrinsic significance, many portions of the Bible are still beyond our grasp. Furthermore, there is a great amount of light that has yet to be released from the portions that God has given us understanding. However, we still have more of the Word and less of the Spirit. We are like bakers who have plenty of flour but who are short of water and oil. We do not despise the flour, because without flour we cannot make bread or pasta. However, without water and oil, we still cannot make bread and pasta.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> </body></html>
