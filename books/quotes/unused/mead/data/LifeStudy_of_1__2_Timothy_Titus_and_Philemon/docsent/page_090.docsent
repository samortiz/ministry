   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DEALING WITH A FACTIOUS MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Titus 3:10 and 11 say, "A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse, knowing that such a one has been perverted and sins, being self-condemned."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A factious man is a heretical, sectarian man who causes divisions by forming parties in the church according to his own opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Gnostic Judaism referred to in the preceding verse must be related to this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The divisiveness is based on differing teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the reason that verse 10 comes after verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Certain believers may have insisted on the teaching of the law and in so doing became divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 10 Paul charges Titus to refuse a factious man after a first and second admonition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to maintain good order in the church, a factious, divisive person, after a first and second admonition, should be refused, rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because such divisiveness is contagious, this rejection is for the church's profit that contact with the divisive one be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 11 Paul speaks a severe word, saying that a factious man has been perverted, that he sins, and that he is self-condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Literally, the Greek words rendered "has been perverted" mean turned out of the way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is more than being turned away from the right path Titus 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One who has been perverted in this way is spoiled, damaged, destroyed, with respect to God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul tells us that factious persons are self-condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a factious person is alone, deep within he may become conscious of a feeling of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He knows that he does not have genuine peace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With his tongue he may say that he is not condemned, but deep in his heart he has questions and a sense of uneasiness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some of those who left the Lord's recovery argued strongly about various things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But deep within they did not have true peace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, they were self-condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If they did not have a feeling of condemnation within, they would not struggle to vindicate themselves and to convince others they are right.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Their efforts at self-vindication are a sign of their self-condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE BOOK A. The Apostle's Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verses 12 and 13 Paul says, "When I send Artemas to you or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Zenas the lawyer and Apollos send forward diligently that nothing may be lacking to them."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nicopolis was a city in the southwestern corner of Macedonia, where this Epistle was written.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Artemas and Tychicus were intimate fellow-workers of Paul; Zenas and Apollos worked independently of him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet Paul still charged Titus to care for them, showing there was no jealousy between the two groups of co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul's word in verse 14 is related to what he says in verse 13: "And let those also who are ours learn to maintain good works for necessary needs, that they may not be unfruitful."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They were to take care of the needs of the Lord's servants and to help them on their way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>B. Greetings</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 15 Paul concludes, "All who are with me greet you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Greet those who love us in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Grace be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The faith here is subjective and denotes our believing act which brings us into organic union with the Lord John 3:15; Gal 3:26 and operates through love Gal 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is in the element and operation of this faith that the saints who were one with the Lord in His concern loved the suffering and faithful apostle.</S>
