   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NOUS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>AND A CHRISTIAN</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How is the nous related to a Christian's living, work, service to God, walk, etc.?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who believe in the Lord Jesus have a new spirit and a new heart.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a fact and cannot be overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No matter how weak or strong a believer is, he is born of God, and he has a new spirit and new heart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That is why he can love someone, serve God, and do everything from his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But even though the heart may be a new heart, the part in the heart which belongs to the nous is not renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to human reasoning, one would think that since the heart has been made new, the conscience and the mind, which are included in the heart, must also have been renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For instance, the part of the conscience in the heart was new when we were saved, but it is not necessarily always new afterwards, nor is it necessarily new every day.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When a dress is bought, it is new, but it is not going to stay new forever.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One must put in a certain amount of work for it to stay new.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When you were saved, your mind was new.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But it is not necessarily true that it will remain new after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is an experience common to many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let me tell you that once a man believes in the Lord and is saved, his conscience is new.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The function of his conscience is recovered to its original state, so that he now hates sins and dislikes sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But can the conscience always remain so new?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No, it cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If one sins, or if he tolerates sins over and over again and does not listen to his conscience, after repeated sins the conscience will no longer rebuke; it will lose its function.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Just as the conscience can lose its feeling or be renewed, the same is true of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, I want to speak concerning the matter of the nous because this has a crucial relationship to the believer's position and living.</S>
