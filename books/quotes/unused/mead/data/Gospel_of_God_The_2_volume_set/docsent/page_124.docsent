   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PLACE OF REPENTANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING IN FAITH AND SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How then is man saved?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Gospel of John tells us clearly that it is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The books of Romans and Galatians also tell us clearly that it is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Galatians tells us that it is only by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the whole New Testament, there are only these three books that deal with the question of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All three books tell us that salvation is by faith only and is not of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Repentance does not come into consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What place then does repentance hold?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we read the Bible, we will find out that repentance is never detached from faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Repentance is never separated from faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This does not mean that one is saved by faith and repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Repentance is included in faith and is included in salvation already.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a man believes in the Lord Jesus, the element of repentance is included there already.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If one says that he is saved, then his salvation includes repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Repentance is never detached from faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is always included in salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now, let us consider if repentance is a condition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the New Testament, by the time of the book of Acts, the Holy Spirit had come and the full gospel was preached.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The book of Acts seems to show us that repentance is a condition for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many have misunderstood the matter because they have not seen the place of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No doubt, the Old Testament speaks of the teaching of repentance also.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jonah preached to the men of Nineveh that unless they repented, God would destroy them Jonah 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They repented, put on sackcloth, sat in ashes, and fasted.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was for their past deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The putting on of the sackcloth and the sitting in ashes were not for future behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they were for future acts, what did sackcloth and ashes have to do with it?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Repentance is to feel sorry for and to condemn one's past behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One puts on sackcloth and sits in ashes because he realizes that he is wrong before God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Formerly, he thought he was living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now, he knows that he was dead.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, he mourns for his past wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was what Jonah preached.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before the gospel of the Lord Jesus came, we did not see salvation by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What we had then was only repentance for past deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Later, John the Baptist came.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He did not preach faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He only preached repentance, that is, a repentance for past actions and past wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Matthew 3:8, he said one very good thing: "Produce then fruit worthy of your repentance."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He also said that "he who has two tunics, let him share with the one who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise" Luke 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to realize that this is not repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, this is the fruit of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Repentance is for the past, and the fruit of repentance is for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At John's time, the complete gospel was not yet preached, and the light of the truth was not fully revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to lead men to God, he had to bring them to a different view of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Following this, the Lord Jesus Himself came.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Gospel of John is different from the other three Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first three Gospels talk about what the Lord Jesus did in time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Gospel of John talks about what He does in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every reader of the Bible knows that the Gospel of John does not talk about things in time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, it talks about things of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It begins with "the beginning" and ends with the receiving of eternal life 1:1; 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The first of the three books speaks of the Son of David, the Son of Abraham Matt 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It shows us the Christ in time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>John tells us about the Christ in eternity 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The first three books are transitional.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, they talk about repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But why did the Lord talk about repentance also Matt 4:17 ?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It was because the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Because the kingdom has drawn near, we have to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But in the Gospel of John, after the full gospel has been preached, there is no more mention of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Acts, some verses also say that salvation must be by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Acts 16:31 says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, in a few places in Acts, repentance is mentioned by itself; there is no mention of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is why some believers misunderstand repentance as a condition for salvation.</S>
