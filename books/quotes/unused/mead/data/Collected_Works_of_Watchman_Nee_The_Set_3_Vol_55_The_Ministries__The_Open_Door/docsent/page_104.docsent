   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Past Year and a Half Yuyao</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We began to have prayer meetings in November 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We also had gospel meetings for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, we were unable to start regular meetings because we did not have enough light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There was a long conference at Ninghai in December 1949, and one of the brothers among us attended.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After he returned, we felt burdened to start meetings on the Lord's Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By the Lord's mercy, we began on January 29, 1950.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There were about twenty people in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since then we have had two conferences by the brothers from Ningpo.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>More than thirty brothers and sisters were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We started the Lord's table on June 18 the Lord's Day and began to break bread to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we look back on the past, we see that the Lord's mercy and leading have been with us until today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must give honor and glory to our God!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We truly feel weak and immature; indeed, we need the supply of prayers from the brothers and sisters in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We hope that we could be notified when the churches near us have conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Mailing Address: Christian Meeting Hall, Xiao-An Street, Yuyao</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Gradual Inward Enlightenment</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord has shown me much mercy during this past year as I have been learning to serve God in coordination with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am still studying at Tsinghua University.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word I received at Kuling has given me gradual, inward enlightenment, and I have begun to have some experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As I consider this, I feel that it is the Lord's great mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are now more than twenty brothers and sisters in school.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have prayer, fellowship, edification of new believers, and sporadic gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although there are many difficulties, they just bring in more of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Increasingly, we feel the importance of the edification of the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If these basic matters are not learned well, these new ones have no future.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the brothers and I are going over the lessons, and we are begging the Lord to bring us into the spiritual reality of these lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have seen the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After we spoke about rising early, I called the brothers the next morning and tried to get them up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Despite much encouragement, they could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We prayed specifically about this matter in a prayer meeting and asked the Lord to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone confessed, repented, and begged the Lord for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The next day everyone made a turn and got up early.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This really was the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brother Caleb recently asked me to learn the science of farming and ranching, and to pick up some practical skills in preparation for migrating to the Northwest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the Lord leads, I am willing to go to a spiritually strategic location with a large population where there is a future for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If I migrate, the edification of new believers will be an even more important subject in my service among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As long as a local church is able to, it should have such classes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I heard more than half of the messages concerning the edification of new believers at Kuling, and I was able to secure notes on the rest, but my notes are incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Could you give me a printed copy of what was shared at Kuling?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A young member,</S>
