When we walk through the valley, we do not fear any evil, for the pneumatic Christ is with us (Matt. 28:20b; 2 Tim. 4:22). His presence is a comfort, a rescue, and a sustaining power to us. When we are in the valley, we should simply remain there and rest in the Lord.

These are the twelve apostles of the Lamb (v. 14), each of whom is signified by a precious stone. Peter, the first of the twelve apostles, was originally named Simon. When Simon was brought to the Lord, the Lord changed his name to Peter, meaning a stone (John 1:42). Later, the Lord called him by that name when He spoke concerning the building of His church (Matt. 16:18). Precious stones are not created but are produced by the transforming of things created. All the apostles were created as clay, but they were regenerated and were transformed into precious stones for God's eternal building. Every believer needs to be thus regenerated and transformed that he may be a part of the New Jerusalem.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
