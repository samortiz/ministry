IN LIFE FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul says, &ldquo;I have fed you...&rdquo; (v. 2, KJV). The way to receive his feeding is to eat. Thus, calling is in chapter 1, but eating is in chapter 3. Then in chapter 3 we see that we have to grow. Paul says that he fed the saints. Then he says, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth&rdquo; (v. 6). By feeding and by eating we have the growth, and the growth is for the building. Verse 9 says, &ldquo;You are God&rsquo;s cultivated land, God&rsquo;s building.&rdquo; The growth in life issues in the transformation in life into precious materials. First, you are plants, but eventually you become gold, silver, and precious stones (v. 12).</p>
<p>Petrified wood is a good illustration of a plant being transformed into stone. It was a plant first. But eventually it became a piece of stone, petrified, transformed. The precious stones are for the building (1 Pet. 2:5). This is the only way that the Lord can build the church. If we mean business with the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for the building up of the church, we have to realize that we are the plants and we have to grow. We can grow by taking in and absorbing the nourishment. By this growth we will be transformed, and by being transformed, we become the materials for the building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING CHRIST AS OUR PASSOVER AND OUR FEAST</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 5 tells us that Christ is our Passover (v. 7). He is the Passover lamb. When those in Christianity use the passover lamb for gospel preaching, they always stress the blood. We have a good hymn, the chorus of which says, &ldquo;When I see the blood,...I will pass over you&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #1005). But we need to see that with the passover lamb there is something in addition to the blood. That is the meat. The blood had to be shed, and the meat of the lamb had to be eaten. The striking of the blood was for the eating of the meat. They applied the blood to the house, and then in the house they ate. The striking of the blood was not the goal; the eating of the meat was. Christ is the real Passover lamb, and He has been sacrificed for us, not only to redeem us but also to satisfy us. His blood redeemed us, and His life satisfies us.</p>
<p>The Israelites were under the tyranny, the bondage, of the Egyptians. The blood that covered them only dealt with God&rsquo;s judgment. God saw the blood and passed over them. But they needed the energy, the strength, to walk out of Egypt and cross the Red Sea. So under the covering of the blood, they ate the lamb. They ate in a way ready to walk out. They ate quickly with their loins girded, with shoes on their feet, and with a staff in their hand (Exo. 12:11). They were filled up with the lamb. Then after eating they said, &ldquo;Rise up. Let us all go out!&rdquo; They all walked out of Egypt and walked through the Red Sea. The blood covers and redeems us, but it does not strengthen us. We need Jesus to be our meat. We need to eat Jesus. We can receive Jesus into us as our meat by calling on Him. The calling is the eating.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 5:8 goes on to say, &ldquo;Let us keep the feast.&rdquo; We are not keeping the good teachings of the passover. We are keeping the feast. A feast is full of the enjoyment of eating. During the Feast of Unleavened Bread as the continuation of the passover, the Israelites did nothing but eat. They cared only for eating for seven days. Today we are feasting on Jesus, and the way to feast on Him is to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus. O Lord Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the real Christians are, at least to some extent, callers on Jesus. Some may still oppose this calling, but sometimes they have called also. They will not call on the Lord Jesus in a regular way but in a special way. When they have a car accident or they are sick, they will call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; In the Far East a brother, who opposed calling very much, was riding a bicycle. At the corner a car hit his bicycle and knocked him into the air. When he was in the air, he called, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; When he fell on the ground, he would not stop calling. When he was in the hospital lying in bed, he called, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; He called on the Lord all day.</p>
<p>We should not call on the Lord, however, only in such special circumstances. We must call on Him all the time. Calling is the way to eat Jesus. Do not wait until you are sick and then start to eat. That is too late. You have to eat regularly. You may think that since you are a distinguished person, such as a professor or a father of a family, calling on the Lord is too childish for you. It is so good for your children to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; but you feel that you have to maintain your position. You may keep your position, but you will be hungry with nothing to eat. Instead, you have to take the lead in your family to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus. O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Calling on the Lord gives you the top enjoyment. Some dissenting ones have said that calling is altogether a matter of psychology. But if you call on the name of Confucius, Plato, George Washington, or Abraham Lincoln, nothing happens. However, we can testify that when we call on the dear name of Jesus, He is truly rich to all who call upon His name (Rom. 10:12). The more you call, the more you get.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DRINKING ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12 speaks of drinking the Spirit (v. 13). This requires us to call on the Lord continually and draw water with joy from Him as the fountain of living water (Isa. 12:3-4; John 4:10, 14). I do not care for the gifts. I care for the drinking of Jesus as the Spirit. We all have been given to drink one Spirit. Many people pay attention to baptism, but we need to notice that in 1 Corinthians 12:13 both baptism and drinking are covered: &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be baptized is to be put into the water. To drink is to put the water into you. Do you have to be immersed in water all day? If I immersed you in water for the whole day, you would drown. But to drink is a continual matter. We drink many times throughout the day. We all have been baptized in the Spirit. That is one aspect. Another aspect is our being given to drink one Spirit. That means we are positioned to drink. Although we have been positioned, many of us would not drink. Instead, we are thinking, not drinking.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:3 says that no one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit. This means that whenever you say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; you are in the Holy Spirit, and you are drinking. The way to drink Jesus is to call on Him. First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; You were given to drink one Spirit, and the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit in 15:45b is surely the one Spirit in 12:13. We were given to drink of Jesus as the life-giving Spirit. Thus, we all have to be Jesus callers, and His callers are His eaters, His drinkers, and His breathers.</p>
<p>We have to call on the Lord all day, every day, every moment, and on every occasion. When you are washing your face, you have to say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; When you are driving a car, you have to say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; All day you have to call on Him. By calling on Him, you breathe Him, drink Him, and eat Him. Then you get the enjoyment and the nourishment, which causes you to grow and be transformed. In this way you will grow as plants to be transformed into precious material to build up the church. This is the way to have the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to build up the church. I hope this is not a mere teaching. We all have to see this. This concept is not only in the Gospels but also in the Epistles. We have such a wonderful way to enjoy Jesus for God&rsquo;s building.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Greatest Prophecy in the Bible and Its Fulfillment &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
