Israel Being Jehovah's Witnesses<br>and the Servant Whom He Has Chosen</H2><P>Verses 10 and 11 say, "You are My witnesses, declares Jehovah,/And My servant whom I have chosen,/In order that you may know and believe Me/And understand that I am He./Before Me there was no God formed,/Neither will there be any after Me./I, even I, am Jehovah;/And there is no Savior besides Me." How can it be proved that only Jehovah is God? This can be proved only by a group of people who are God's witnesses. Those who are God's witnesses are also His servants. Christ is God's Witness and His Servant. Today, we, the church people, are one with Christ as God's witnesses and servants.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Israel Not Calling to Mind<br>the Former Things,<br>nor Considering the Things of Old</H2><P>In verse 14 we are told that for Israel's sake God sent to Babylon and "will bring down all of them as fugitives." Then in verses 18 through 21 Jehovah tells Israel not to call to mind the former things nor to consider the things of old. He wanted Israel to forget their seventy years in Babylon and to know that He was about to do a new thing. "Behold, I am doing a new thing;/It will now spring forth;/Do you not know it?/I will even make a way in the wilderness,/Rivers in the desert./..This people I have formed for Myself;/They will show forth My praise" (vv. 19, 21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Jehovah Wiping Away<br>Their Transgressions for His Own Sake<br>and Not Remembering Their Sins</H2><P>In verses 22 and 23a Jehovah tells Israel that they have not called upon Him, but have grown weary of Him. They have not brought Him a sheep for their burnt offerings, and they have not honored Him with their sacrifices. Indeed, they have burdened Him with their sins and wearied Him with their iniquities (v. 24b). Nevertheless, in verse 25 Jehovah declares, "I, even I, am He who wipes away your transgressions for My own sake,/And I will not remember your sins."</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_109.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_111.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 110</div><br></body></html>
