   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Precious and Exceedingly Great Promises</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third category of great things given to us by God is the precious and exceedingly great promises.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The promises in 2 Peter 1:4 are mainly related to our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These are promises for the inner life and the outward expression of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One such promise is in Ephesians 3:20, which says, "But to Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This promise to do above all that we ask or think is not concerning the material things of the present life, but concerning the spiritual things for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord is going to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think for the church life, according to the inner working power that operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Other precious and exceedingly great promises are in Matthew 28:20; John 6:57; 7:38-39; 10:28-29; 14:19-20, 23; 15:5; and 16:13-15.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>FIVE GROUPS OF THINGS FOR THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the basic categories of faith, the divine power, and the precious promises, there are also five groups of things for the experience of life in 2 Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, we have all things that relate to life and godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Life is within, while godliness is without.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Life is the inward substance, and godliness is the outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Godliness, according to its New Testament usage, refers to our Christian living, our Christian daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is the outward expression of the inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is a living that is the expression of God 1 Tim 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Godliness is God-likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Christian life should be a life which expresses God and bears God's likeness in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The divine power has given to us all things relating to our inward life and our outward living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Second, through the promises we become the partakers, or enjoyers, of the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Third, there are the spiritual virtues vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>5-7 , which are the issue of the development of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These divine virtues are virtue, knowledge, self-control, endurance, godliness, brotherly love, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Fourth, God has called us not merely by His gospel, His grace, or His mercy, but He has called us to His own glory and virtue v. 3 . Fifth, there is the entrance into the eternal kingdom of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second Peter 1:11 says, "For so shall be richly and bountifully supplied to you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The entrance is conditional; it will be supplied based upon certain terms and conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>ADDING ALL DILIGENCE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 2 Peter 1:5, Peter says, "And for this very reason also, adding all diligence, supply bountifully in your faith ."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word "supply" in this verse can also mean "develop."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Develop is a better word because it implies growth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When a seed grows, it first develops the stem, then the branches, the blossom, and ultimately the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must develop seven items: in faith develop virtue, in virtue develop knowledge, in knowledge develop self-control, in self-control develop endurance, in endurance develop godliness, in godliness develop brotherly love, and in brotherly love develop love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have faith within us as the seed, we have the divine power, and we have the holy Word with its promises.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now based upon what God has given, Peter says that we must add all diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The manna in the wilderness is a good illustration of our need to cooperate with God's giving Exo 16:4-5, 14-15, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Manna came each morning and had to be gathered early because it melted when the sun became hot.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The manna was sent by God, but the children of Israel had to exercise themselves diligently to rise up early to go out and gather the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God could send the manna to the earth, but He would not put the manna directly into the mouths of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The children of Israel had to do their part.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is gracious, yet regardless of how gracious He is and how sufficient His grace is, we still need to exercise ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The children of Israel not only had to gather the manna, but they also had to take it home and cook it Num 11:8; Exo 16:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God sent the manna, but He would not cook it for them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God has given, but we must cooperate with His giving.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Second Corinthians 9:10 says, "Now He who bountifully supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed and cause the fruits of righteousness to grow."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God gives the seed and the fruit, and in between the seed and the fruit is much development.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The development between the seed and the fruit is our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God gives the seed, but He would not sow the seed or till the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To sow the seed and till the ground is our part.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, Peter charges us to develop something out of the seed that we already have.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On His part God has given us many exceedingly great things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now we must do our part by adding all diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Genesis 2:5 God did not send the rain because there was not a man to till the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God's part needs our part.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God has done His part, and now we must do our part to cooperate with Him.</S>
