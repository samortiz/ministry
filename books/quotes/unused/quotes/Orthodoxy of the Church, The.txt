He not only takes the commission of the spiritual life, but also bears the burden of the practice of the church life
Have not noticed the oneness of each and every local church in each and every locality as recorded in the Bible
The 'Exclusive Brethren' exceed the boundary of locality, while the 'Open Brethren' are smaller than the boundary of locality
Because they have not realized the importance of the teachings in the Bible concerning the locality, divisions have resulted
It was in 1937 that the ground of locality was revealed to us and the term the ground of locality began to be used among us
What we urgently need today is to come back to the orthodoxy of the beginning and stand firmly on the ground of locality
John wrote at the time when the Gnostics were confusing the Word of God his writings bring men to heaven to see Gods eternal fact in heaven
The Epistles of John specially speak of these two points, bringing us back to the fact behind the scene in the beginning
John brought us into the condition behind the scenes of the future to let us know how God regards the situation of this world
The church in her appearance has many manifestations in history, but what way, what condition, is the Lord's desire?
The first seven Epistles speak of the church in a time of normality; the latter speak of the churches in a time of abnormality
The first seven Epistles contain the truth the church must know; the last seven epistles show the way the church must take
The first seven Epistles were written before the last hour, while the last seven epistles were written either during or after the last hour
Today the outward appearance of the church is desolate if we have not seen this fact, there is no need for us to read Revelation
In this kind of circumstance, the children of God must seek one thing; that is, how should we follow and serve the Lord?
Everyone knows that it is a book of prophecies, but if we ask whether the seven churches are prophetic, they dare not say
Chapters one through twenty-two show us that the special feature of Revelation is that it is a book of prophecy in nature
Not only are the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven vials prophetic, but even the seven epistles are prophetic
The nature of the book of Revelation, we must note, is firstly prophetic; secondly, since it is prophecy, it will be fulfilled
When he was on the isle of Patmos, he saw only these seven churches because these seven represent all the others
There are only seven lampstands in heaven, because the history of the seven churches constitutes the complete history of the church
Between John and us there is a common principle; that is, this prophecy is for us to keep to keep from beginning to end
In reading Revelation 2 and 3, we must see not only that this is a prophecy for us to keep, but also that the Lord is the Lord of judgment
The first half of Revelation 1 is the preface to the whole book of Revelation; the last half is the preface to chapters two and three
Its light burns day and night; therefore, the priest must continually trim it and add oil to it in the Holy Place
The Lord Jesus is the High Priest who walks in the midst of the churches to see which lamp is lighted and which one is not
Christ walks in the midst of the churches doing the work of judgment, and today's judgment is seen from eternity
Every one of God's children must one day meet the Lord's fearfulness and holiness; then they will no longer reason
The farther a person is from the Lord, the greater is his self-confidence; but it is impossible for him to bear the light of God
The first part of each epistle tells us who the Lord is, and the word that follows is based on this revelation of the Lord
The church is the continuation of the cross; there is no such thing as knowing the cross yet not knowing the extension of the cross
These seven epistles were written to the angels of the seven churches, differing from the first seven Epistles written by Paul
Paul wrote to the churches although we see that there were all the saints overseers and deacons especially in the book to the Philippians
Today a group of people is a messenger in the eyes of the Lord; thus, the nature of the church today is entrusted to them
The church in Ephesus is prophetic concerning the condition of the first stage of the church after the apostles
Although the Israelites were worthless in the sight of men, God said through Balaam that He did not behold iniquity in Jacob
If the children of God are enlightened by the Lord, they will see that their many weaknesses and failures are lies
The Lord says something about trying the apostles, which proves that after the apostolic age there are still apostles in the church
If there were only twelve apostles, then all they would have to ask is whether or not the professed apostle was John
If he was not John then he would not be an apostle because by that time all the other eleven apostles had passed away and only John was left
The necessity for the apostles to be tried proves that there were still more apostles after the twelve apostles
The churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are not only churches in prophecy but also churches that were actually in seven localities in Asia
The conduct of climbing over and above the common believers as a mediatorial class is what the Lord detests; it is something to be hated
God ordained in the beginning that the whole nation be priests, but the incident of worshipping the golden calf occurred not long after
At that time the Levites came to stand on the Lord's side, and as a result, three thousand Israelites were slain on that day
The rest of the people of Israel could not be priests, and they had to depend on the Levites to be the priests on their behalf
In the New Testament, Peter said, 'But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession'
After the apostles, this condition began to change; men began to lose interest in the matter of serving the Lord
When the Roman Catholic Church began , there were few who were saved but many who were baptized; thus, unbelievers filled the church
Please remember, in Taoism the Taoist priests chant the liturgy for people; in Judaism the priests manage the things of God for men
In the history of the church, the churches during the apostolic age and immediately after were greatly persecuted
Many people have only seen 'living,' but they have not seen 'living forever and ever' ; neither have they seen 'lived again'
Once all those who are alive go into death, they cannot come out again, but the Lord Jesus cannot be held by death
Many people are finished upon encountering certain matters contrary to their wishes; for them it is just like encountering death
The brothers all say that this time we are finished, but not long after, we rise, and the life of God comes forth from us again
If you read the history of martyrdom by Fox, you will see how the church has suffered persecutions and afflictions
Since he was eighty-six years old, they could not bear to put him to death, and they were especially lenient towards him
These sisters witnessed many being devoured by beasts and they said again, 'Many have testified with their blood
The entire church in Smyrna was persecuted, but the life which has died and is now living again can break through all these persecutions
In the epistle to Pergamos, the teaching of Balaam is referred to, and in the epistle to Thyatira, Jezebel is referred to
The special feature of the church is that there is no place and no temple, because we, the people, are the temple
Someone once calculated the total value of the Jewish temple it was enough to afford all the people in the world a monetary share
Today some people say, 'If you do not go to the solemn and magnificent temple, at least you need a church' building'
If Gods children wish to walk in His way they must ask God to open their eyes so that they may see that the church is spiritual not material
If the Holy Spirit disagrees, whatever we may say avails nothing; if the Holy Spirit agrees, whatever we may say also avails nothing
Judaism has priests, but Christianity has strict fathers, clergymen who are not as strict, and ordinary pastors in the pastoral system
God's promises to them are also promises of earth, that among the nations on earth they may be the head and not the tail
The church does not teach how much we shall gain before God, but how much we will be able to let go before God
Today these four items the material temple, the outward laws, the mediatorial priests, and the worldly promises are in the church
In Revelation 2:9 the Lord speaks a very strong word: 'Those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan'
The word synagogue is especially related to Judaism just as shrine is related to Buddhism monastery to Taoism and mosque to Mohammedanism
A certain brother said that we should not call our meeting place a church assembly hall, but a Christian synagogue
If so, when a Jew passed by, he would greatly misunderstand; for synagogue is a term used exclusively in Judaism
If we could only know that it is done by the enemy, the problem would be solved and our heart could immediately rest before the Lord
When the servant wanted to take Rebecca with him, Rebecca's brother and mother requested that she stay with them for at least ten days
On one hand, this means that there are certain days for our suffering, and that our days of suffering are counted by the Lord
Gibbon, a historian, said that if they had killed all the Christians in the city of Rome, the city would have become uninhabited
The world not only ceased to oppose the church, but even the greatest empire on this earth Rome accepted Christianity as the state religion
It is said that Constantine had a dream in which he saw a cross with the words written on it, 'By this sign conquer'
He encouraged people to be baptized, and whoever was baptized was given two white robes and a few pieces of silver
In the previous chapter we read that the church of Smyrna was the church of suffering and that the Lord had nothing to say against her
We cannot find his name in history; therefore, since this is a prophecy, we must discover the meaning from the name itself
Regarding this faithful man who is slain, in verse 13 the Lord said, 'You hold fast My name and have not denied My faith'
In religion it is sufficient to accept teachings, but in the church it is meaningless if one does not believe in the Lord
Not only so this name also tells us that He has been here and has gone back He died and lives again therefore He leaves a name in our midst
You hold fast My name and have not denied My faith' these two points are the things for which the Lord praised her
Balaam coveted the money offered to him and was desirous to go, and though God hindered him at first, He later permitted him
These Gentile women also brought their idols with them causing the people of Israel not only to commit fornication but also to worship idols
The method of Balaam is to destroy the separation between the church and the world, and the result is idol worship
In the flesh these are the two things which God hates, and in spiritual things these are also the two things which God hates
Today the children of God all want to be great, to have more, and to pay no attention to holiness and cleanliness
Do you think it would be possible for the church at Corinth to invite Paul and yet first discuss the matter of reward?
Do you think the church in Jerusalem signed a contract with Peter for a certain amount of compensation every year?
The Lord shows His disapproval of the teaching of Balaam; in the same way the Lord disapproves of the teaching of the Nicolaitans
The Lord said that whoever wants to be great among you shall be your servant; whoever is the servant is the chief
When Constantine accepted Christianity, the teaching of Balaam occurred and the teaching of the Nicolaitans appeared
At the same time there are high officials in the Vatican, and many countries are represented by ambassadors and ministers
Those who have position and reputation in the world must be careful not to bring the things of the world into the church
When you are sitting among the brothers and sisters, and yet you cannot be a brother or sister, then the Nicolaitans appear
The word laos in the original Greek word nikaolaos not only means laity , but it also means laymen in contrast with experts and specialists
The church in Ephesus only has the behavior of the Nicolaitans, while the church in Pergamos has the teaching of the Nicolaitans
Not only did he think that it was all right to take a concubine, but he also brought out examples in the Bible to cover his sin
We have already said that after Constantine accepted Christianity as the state religion, the church became married to the world
Many of those who became church members did not know the Lord Jesus at all; therefore, those who knew the Lord Jesus became the experts
For the ordinary, common people, it is enough just to attend the meetings; they need not care about other things
If the children of God are not willing to return to the position of that in the beginning, no matter what they do, it will not be right
If they will not repent, He will punish them with the sword of His mouth that is, He will punish and judge those who rebel against Him
If we have the opportunity to see the 'hidden manna,' then we will be able to review the 'daily manna' once more
Those who have never seen the manna will not have any recollection of it when they see the hidden manna on that day
Four is the number of the creature of God it is the number of the world including the four directions the four winds the four seasons etc
Madame Guyon, Tauler, and Fenelon were all in the Roman Catholic Church, and we can mention many more of the best names
In the history of the Jewish nation up to 1 Kings 16, no one had ever led the people of Israel to sin in such a way as Ahab
In Matthew 13:33 the woman who took the leaven and hid it in three measures of meal is also the Roman Catholic Church
God never acknowledges the marriage between His people and the Gentiles as proper; God says that this is fornication
She sends out ambassadors and ministers to various nations, and in important world crises she stands up to speak
Today there is a group of people who think that they can bargain with others since they have such a large membership
The facts are placed before us; there is not one church that is like the Roman Catholic Church with so many idols
There is an image of the Father and an image of the Son; there are images of the apostles and images of the ancient saints
In the Roman Catholic Church, what matters is what the church says, not what the Bible says or what the Lord says
The people in the Roman Catholic Church do not read the Bible, because they are afraid of misunderstanding what God means
Basically the Roman Catholic Church is the preaching of the woman who decides what the children of God should do
She pays attention to the thought that people must listen to the church and pope, not that people must listen to the Lord
In church history there were persecutions by the Roman Empire, and there were also persecutions by the Roman Catholic Church
The Lord said that the failure of Thyatira is due to the fact that she allows the teaching of Jezebel in her midst
In China there is not one newspaper published by a Protestant church, yet the Roman Catholic Church owns a paper
These words probably refer to God's destroying of the Roman Catholic Church through the Antichrist and his followers
When Jezebel lived on this earth, there was Elijah; in the Roman Catholic Church there have also been many who belonged to the Lord
Thank the Lord, there are still those who 'do not have this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they say'
The Lord will not put any other burden upon those who do not have this teaching, but they must hold fast to that which they already have
The word 'shepherd' means that something is not accomplished all at once but rather done by beating one by one as the need arises
That is why the iron rod must be used to shepherd the nations and break in pieces all the things that come out of men
At the darkest hour, just at the time the day is breaking, it appears for a little while, and then the sun arises
One day the Lord will be seen by the whole world, as recorded in Malachi 4:2: 'The Sun of righteousness arise'
In the first three epistles the calling to the overcomer comes after the phrase, 'He who has an ear, let him hear'
The first three all came and went, but the last four emerge gradually and continue together until the Lord comes back
After the behavior of the Nicolaitans, we have seen how Pergamos sinned greatly by bringing the world into the church
These prophecies have not yet been fulfilled; they will be fulfilled at the time of Babylon's fall in Revelation 17
The history of Thyatira began from the time Jezebel improperly brought idols into the church and will continue until she receives judgment
The epistle to Ephesus says that His right hand holds seven stars, while the epistle to Sardis says that He has the seven stars
Sardis is similar to Thyatira in that she includes a long period of time, from the reformed churches until the Lord comes back again
It is all a matter of what the mother church says: All the people of the Roman Catholic Church listen to the mother church
As a result, wherever the doctrine of justification by faith and the open Bible went, a state church was established
By the time of justification by faith and the return of the open Bible, the Protestant churches had not yet seen what the church should be
Luther himself said that we should not think 'justification by faith' is enough; there are many more things to be changed
Formerly, there was the international church of Rome; now it is the state church of England or the state church of Germany that is all
The Reformation did not bring the church back to the condition of the beginning; it only caused the world church to become state churches
Thyatira is condemned for putting the church in the world; likewise, Sardis is condemned for putting the church in the states
The church was established not because someone knew what the church is; rather, the church was established according to a system
These two kinds of Protestant churches the state and the private the Lord says, have not gone back to the purpose in the beginning
In the whole history of Sardis these were about to die therefore the Lord said Establish the things which remain which were about to die
Today in the Protestant churches, the regulations of men are still in force, even though the Bible is already opened
The advantage of doing this is that it keeps the grace, and the disadvantage is that there is just one cup of blessing
They began to argue with other denominations as to whose cup was better, though all the cups were worthless for drinking
Is a matter of principle: The students of Wesley could never be equal to Wesley, nor could the students of Calvin match Calvin
The schools of the prophets seldom produced prophets all the great prophets were chosen by God from the wilderness
The Protestant churches have revivals continuously, but the Lord says they are not perfect, they have not gone back to the beginning
It does not say that they continued in the apostles' breaking of bread and the prayers, but in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles
The fellowship of Christ is the fellowship of the apostles; the teaching of Christ is the teaching of the apostles
God only counts the fellowship of the apostles as fellowship; He only counts the teaching of the apostles as teaching
But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white because they are worthy'
We do not put on Christ here; rather, we put on 'fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints'
Those whom the Lord confesses will participate in something; those whom the Lord does not confess will not participate
All the names are recorded in the book of life, but he who is not confessed by the Lord is like one who is marked out with a circle
She is neither the Roman Catholic Church nor the Protestant churches, but continues the church at the age of the apostles
Now we will spend some time to see what Philadelphia is, hoping that we may be clear regarding what she signifies
It is indeed remarkable that the words spoken by the Lord to Philadelphia are quite similar to those which were spoken to Smyrna
To Smyrna He said I will give you the crown of life while to Philadelphia He said Hold fast what you have that no one take your crown
Philadelphia in Greek is composed of two words: The first means 'love one another,' and the second means 'brother'
If we have to inquire concerning a certain matter, we cannot ask God ourselves; we must ask them to inquire of God for us
In the Protestant churches there are the extremely strict state churches, and there are also the scattered private churches
Concerning the system of the priestly class, whether it is called fathers, clergy, or pastors, it is something which is rejected by the Lord
Although in the Protestant churches no one is called a father, yet the clergy and pastors are exactly the same in principle
Even if we change their name and call them workers, as long as they are standing in the same position, they have the same flavor
Remember that the beginning of the mediatorial class was at Pergamos and the practice of the mediatorial class was in Rome
A great recovery transpired after Sardis: The brothers loved one another, and the mediatorial class was abolished in the church
They began to see that in the Scriptures God says there is but one Body of Christ, regardless of how many sects men may divide her into
They further read the Scriptures and saw that the system of one man administering the church and one man preaching was not scriptural
They believed that all true believers had the office of the priest and could freely enter into the Holy of Holies
They were able to depart from the two sins of the clergy system offering sacrifices and one man preaching the Word
He also met frequently with the brothers, although at that time he still wore the uniform of the Anglican clergy
Originally what the brothers saw was rather limited, but when Darby joined, the light of heaven poured down like a torrent
In many aspects the work of Darby was similar to that of Wesley, but his attitude toward the Anglican Church was entirely different
In this book Darby clearly declared that the brothers had no intention of setting up a new denomination or union of churches
Let them go their way forth by the footsteps of the flock, if they would know where the good Shepherd feeds His flock at noon
Later, many places in the United States had meetings, and in the continent of Europe there were also many meetings
Not long afterwards, in almost every place in the entire world, all those who loved the Lord were meeting in this way
They were attracted by the Lord and thus met together; because of their love toward the Lord, they spontaneously loved one another
It was they who also opened up the prophecies for the first time, causing us to see that the return of the Lord is the hope of the church
It was they who opened the book of Revelation and the book of Daniel and showed us the kingdom, the tribulation, the rapture, and the bride
It was they who showed us the sin of the denominations, the unity of the Body of Christ, and the unity of the Holy Spirit
In the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant churches, this difference could not be readily seen, but they made us see it anew
It was also they who showed us the sin of the mediatorial class, how all the children of God are priests, and how all can serve God
Griffith Thomas said, 'Among the children of God, it was they who were most able to rightly divide the word of truth'
The Reformation was brought about with sword and spear, while the movement of the brothers was brought about by preaching
They left not only the psychological world, but also the world of Christianity, which is represented by the Protestant churches
From their time men knew that the church is the Body of Christ that the children of God are one church and that they should not be divided
A man is a brother because he receives the life of Christ; a woman is a brother because she receives the life of Christ
It is not that one receives more life because he is a master, or that one receives less life because he is a slave
The fighting went on in the continent of Europe for scores of years and then in Great Britain for scores of years
It is not a matter of force of arms, it is not a matter of advertising, but it is a matter of opening the door
Although some know the teachings in a deeper way and some shallowly, the position of the brothers is still the same
God spoke through the minor prophet, saying that they should not despise the day of small things, for it was the day of recovery
When compared with the days of Pentecost, the testimony of the church in the world today is that this is the day of small things
The Lord acknowledges them for two things: not denying the name of the Lord and not denying the word of the Lord
There has never been an age in church history in which there were men who knew the Word of God as much as the brothers
They hear this word in their midst quite often: 'Is the name of Christ not enough to separate us from the world?
Saying that you are a Christian means nothing; you have to say what kind of Christian you are in order for it to be meaningful'
Many think they need the name of a denomination; they think they must have another name in addition to the name of the Lord
In the whole world, whether in Bible exposition or gospel preaching, no group of people has had the opportunities they have had
In the whole Bible there are only two passages which speak of the promise of rapture: Luke 21:36 and Revelation 3:10
Those in Philadelphia are pleasing to the Lord because they love one another and are faithful to the Lord's word and the Lord's name
They were divided into two divisions: 'Exclusive' and 'Open,' and within the two divisions there are many sects
Once love is in distress, people will also be proud of themselves and envious of others, which produces controversy and strife
As a result, the former is but a oneness in outward appearance, while the latter is an idealistic oneness that is, in fact, divisive
Both have not noticed the oneness of each and every local church in each and every locality as recorded in the Bible
The 'Exclusive Brethren' exceed the boundary of locality, while the 'Open Brethren' are smaller than the boundary of locality
Strangely enough, today's inclination is to change the words spoken in the Bible to the local church to words spoken to the spiritual church
When some brothers set up the church, they set up a church that is smaller than the locality the 'house' church is a case in point
God's Word clearly reveals that one locality can have only one church, and there can only be one church in one locality
The difficulty of the Brethren in those days was that they were not clear enough regarding the teaching in the Bible on locality
Because they have not realized the importance of the teachings in the Bible concerning the locality, divisions have resulted in both cases
The Lord also does not permit taking one meeting as the boundary of unity that is too free it is licentious having no restriction or lesson
With just one word of disagreement, another meeting is formed immediately with three to five as a group, and this is counted as oneness
If our consecration to the Lord is absolute and we ourselves are humble, it may be that we will receive mercy to be kept from error
There are three names written on the overcomer the name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and the Lord's new name
Some think of learning lessons from her as individuals; some consider her as referring to the general, desolate condition of the church
It is composed of two words: laos, meaning 'laymen' , and dicea, which may be translated as 'customs' or 'opinions'
Please remember one thing: If the children of God do not stand in the position of Philadelphia, they will fall and fail
Once a person has seen the truth of the brothers, he can no longer go back to the Protestant churches, even if he wants to
Since he is not able to stand firmly in Philadelphia, he retrogresses from Philadelphia to become, as here, Laodicea
Sardis comes out of Thyatira, and Philadelphia comes out of Sardis; likewise, Laodicea goes out of Philadelphia
Everyone comes back to the word of the Lord to obey the Lord's word and to obey what the Holy Spirit has spoken through the word of the Lord
Now in Laodicea it is neither the Holy Spirit exercising the authority nor the pastoral system, but the laymen
In other words it is not the fathers who rule, nor the pastors, nor the Holy Spirit, but the opinion of the majority that counts
Laodicea does not stand in the position of brothers; rather, it is men who are according to the will of the flesh
Many must acknowledge in their hearts that in the entire world, no one can teach the Bible as well as the brothers
When we hear this kind of talk, we should immediately recall what the Lord says regarding those who say, 'I am rich'
On an island in the Atlantic Ocean, there was a hurricane which destroyed many houses, including the homes and meeting halls of the brothers
Richness is the condition of Philadelphia, while boasting of their richness is the distinguishing mark of Laodicea
It is better to leave this to the feeling of others and not to feel it ourselves; let others know about it, not ourselves
If you have spiritual authority, that is all right, but if you know you have spiritual authority, that is not all right
Following this, the Lord points out three reasons why they are wretched and miserable: They are poor, they are blind, and they are naked
You must pass through all manner of trials so that the words which you have heard will be useful in a practical way
The Lord says, 'And white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested'
There are many activities and many motives in which we sense many impurities once we touch them; they are not white
Many times it is merely an increase in doctrine, an increase in knowledge, yet without seeing anything before God
If someone pays too much attention to the objective truth then he can be seen mounting the clouds and riding the mists which is impractical
The greatest failure of the Brethren was their excessive stress on the objective truth and neglect of the subjective truth
The objective becomes the subjective; that is, He will change what you have of the objective into the subjective
In the Old Testament there were many prophets whose work had no other purpose than to show us how things will be in the future
After Judah perished, Gentile nations would be raised up one by one in the following 2,500 years until the coming again of the Lord Jesus
In addition to the prophecies concerning Judah and the Gentiles, there is still the church of God in God's plan
They have not seen who is sitting upon the throne, and they have not seen the different aspects of the glory of the Lord and His virtues
Those who only know a little of God have little revelation of God and are more tolerant with presumptuous things
For each one who stands before the Lord, the Lord removes the toleration for that which is not according to His will
We know that if we want to be holy, we will have the Lord; if we do not want to be holy, we will lose the fellowship of the Lord
Our lack of faithfulness to the Lord is due to the fact that we still do not have revelation to know the Lord who condemns this as sin
When the Protestant churches appeared, the Roman Catholic Church had been present for more than a thousand years
If we were born before the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, we would have no other way but to be in the Roman Catholic Church
If we were born in the eighteenth century, we could choose to belong to either the Roman Catholic Church or the Protestant churches
In the following century, in 1825, Philadelphia appeared and the brothers rose up; so we would have had three to choose from
Although this prophecy is placed in Revelation 2, the need to decide whether or not to choose it no longer exists
There is a difficulty in the fact that many brothers do not know that the problem of choosing the Protestant churches is also over
Through literature which we continually received, we knew there was a very great movement going on, filling all the countries in the world
Although they may not say that they are the Brethren Assembly, yet there is an invisible boundary placed there
On the negative side, we can eliminate these two; but on the positive side, are we Philadelphia or still Laodicea?
The Lord wants us to learn to exalt His name, for where two or three are gathered together in the Lord's name, there He is in their midst
Today if you have left the denominations and have seen the church, then only the Word of God can be the standard
He is a brother if he knows the truth clearly, and he is still a brother if he does not know the truth clearly
The difficulty lies in the fact that Philadelphia includes all the brothers, yet some are not able to include as much
The basis of fellowship is the blood and the life of the Holy Spirit, not knowledge, not even the knowledge of the Bible
Paul, a new believer, arrives in a certain place; someone has brought him there, and he really has a testimony
If we only love the brothers who are the same as we are, we are sectarian, and this is contrary to the testimony of brotherly love
Because they must maintain their organization, they will say that if you act in this way, you do not love your brothers
You must be clear: Loving the brothers themselves and loving the denominations which these brothers love are two different things
We must realize that loving the whole church is simply based upon whether or not one is a brother; if one is a brother, we love him
Although Sardis has nothing complete in herself, the Lord says that whoever is clothed in a white garment is the overcomer
To Philadelphia, although she has trials and hardships, the Lord remarkably says to hold fast that which she has; she has already overcome
Whoever attains to the standard of God is an overcomer; whoever does not attain to the standard is not an overcomer
Remember, overcoming is the minimum degree; overcoming is not to rise above the level, but to come up to the level
The following three names are special: 'The name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem,
Although we were born in an age in which the condition of the church is exceedingly confusing, thank God, we can be those of Philadelphia
His friend replied, 'You are crazy; the cars in the street are making so much noise, we can hardly hear ourselves talking!
