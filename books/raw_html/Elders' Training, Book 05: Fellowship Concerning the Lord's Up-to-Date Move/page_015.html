<h2 class="head1">THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We must now consider the home meetings, the meetings of the small groups. The traditional way for the Christians to meet is to have a gathering, to gather the members of the church or perhaps some unbelievers. At least one or two learned speakers will speak, while all the rest sit and listen. This is commonly called the service. In a sense we have improved this. At one time, Brother Nee strongly insisted on cancelling the Sunday morning meetings so that the saints could preach the gospel. However, Brother Nee never got through. To tear down any kind of tradition is hard. Some among us may say, &ldquo;Today almost all the nations are accustomed to having a holiday on Sundays. This is the best time to gather the people, either to preach the gospel or to teach the truth. All the people today are accustomed to gathering together to have a service.&rdquo; Some may argue that even the unbelievers like to go to church on Sundays to attend the service, and that we should take advantage of this. In a good sense this is quite logical. Therefore, even until now we still could not annul the Sunday morning meeting. We all have to admit that even today we consider the Sunday morning meeting to be the top meeting. It is &ldquo;the meeting.&rdquo; Recently, due to my study, I became bold, even to revolutionize our practice. But wherever this news went, some may have considered it to be too much. They may have considered that to put away the Sunday morning service is to commit suicide.</p>
<p>In Brother Nee&rsquo;s book, <em>The Normal Christian Church Life,</em> there is a section on the home meetings (pp. 195-200). I was there under that ministry. I listened to those messages, and in a good sense I helped in giving those messages. This had never before been brought forth. Brother Nee tried, but he could not get through. If we were to have divided the total congregation into small groups in the homes, there would just have been an absolute silence in each place. We were too used to the big meetings to go directly into the home gatherings. As a bridge between the big congregations and the home meetings, Brother Nee proposed to have a brothers&rsquo; fellowship meeting and a sisters&rsquo; fellowship meeting. On Saturdays the brothers would come together, and the sisters would come at another time. These meetings were not for teaching or for praying, but for fellowshipping. We began to practice this way. In the first two or three weeks Brother Nee said that the best way to have these fellowship meetings was to give testimonies. We should learn to speak by testifying. We all could have some testimony, testimonies of our repentance, testimonies of our salvation, or testimonies of our daily walk. We all took this word and practiced it. For a few weeks we had testimonies. However, after all these testimonies were exhausted, we came back again silent. This became a hardship to the leading ones. They had to consider what they should do in the meetings, whether to call a hymn or give a prayer. Eventually, the report went to Brother Nee that they were not able to have such meetings.</p>
<p>Later we came to Taiwan. By that time we had learned a lot. I myself had eighteen years of experience. We dropped some of the things we practiced on the mainland which I had learned were not practical. We had a new start in Taiwan which was prevailing. Within six years we increased from about four hundred people to forty thousand, a hundredfold increase. At that time we began our meeting and our work in one hall in Taipei. After one year, we began to meet in a few halls. Then we found out that simply by using the halls, we could not fulfill our purpose. Therefore, we began to have small groups. The church had a number of halls. Under each hall there were a number of small groups. This way worked very well. It was through those small groups that a great number of people were brought in. After being brought in, they were cared for by the small groups. By 1960 the number of saints in Taipei alone was over twenty thousand.</p>
<p>In 1961 I left Taipei and stayed in the United States for four years. For the next twenty years I returned to Taipei only once in a while. Gradually the work in Taiwan with all the churches was in an unnoticeable decline. They did not drop the small group meetings altogether, but without realizing it, there was an unnoticeable decline. By 1984 the church in Taipei had twenty-one halls. However, their membership came down from over twenty thousand to at most eleven or twelve thousand. Among these, about one-third was always present in the meetings. Only about four thousand people were gathered in twenty-one halls. They only practiced the large gatherings. Rarely did they have some small meetings. Very few of the saints paid attention to the small meetings. Their burden was mainly to train twenty-one speakers to take care of the twenty-one halls. In principle, they had gone back to the traditional way of meeting. They cared mainly for the large Sunday morning meetings and neglected the fact that after twenty-three years their numbers had decreased from more than twenty thousand to less than twelve thousand.</p>
<p>Around 1980 I began to notice that the work and the churches there were not going up, but were instead going down. From 1980 to 1984 I had serious talks with the leading ones there, telling them that they should consider their way. Their present way was not working. However, once we get into something, it is hard for us to get out of it. Outsiders may have a clear view, but we ourselves may be veiled by what we practice.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 1984 I realized that I had to go back to Taiwan. I could not forget about the work there. I could not go immediately, though, because of the writing of the notes on the New Testament, the outline, and all the annual trainings. In October of that year I finished the last of the notes on the New Testament. Then I said, &ldquo;Now I must go back to Taiwan,&rdquo; and I went. When I went back, I was frank, faithful, and bold with them, because they were mostly people who were raised up through my ministry. I proposed that they have a revolutionizing change. First, the present number of saints was divided into small groups, not more than eight or ten in a group. They formed three hundred ninety-nine groups. Secondly, at that time in that church of nearly twelve thousand, with around four thousand meeting in twenty-one halls, there were only less than six elders. The younger ones were considered to be not qualified. No more than four or five were brought into the eldership. The elders mentioned the brothers by name, saying they were all not qualified. However, I told them that this was the time to change our system and add more elders. To some extent they realized that their system was wrong and that they needed to have a new start. On that same night over fifty elders were established. Each of the twenty-one halls had either one, two, or three elders. Many among them are just a little over thirty years old. I saw their fathers and their mothers before they were saved, and I saw the fruit of those marriages. These young fruit now are elders. This is wonderful.</p>
<p>It is not easy to change our ways. Recently, however, in Taipei during one weekend eleven hundred and four were baptized. This is good news, but I am also waiting to see another positive aspect&mdash;that all the saints speak in the meetings. The eleven hundred and four were brought in not by preaching but by speaking. While I was in Taiwan I told the saints to go out to speak the gospel. This is not a preaching in an official way, but rather a speaking in a regular way in the daily life. I told them to speak the gospel to their friends, colleagues, relatives, neighbors, and everybody. These eleven hundred and four newly baptized believers were brought in by just about ten percent of the church in Taipei. Only a little over three hundred practiced the speaking of the gospel, yet at that time they were baptizing people every day. All of this came about through only one-tenth of the saints. Of course, it would be better if one hundred percent would practice in this way. Now I am waiting to see if all of them would speak in the meetings. The home meetings are the major burden of this elders&rsquo; training.</p>
