   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE EATING IN THE GOSPELS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One of the complaints brought against the Lord Jesus was, "This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them" Luke 15:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This criticism of His eating with sinners drew forth the three parables in Luke 15.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The publicans and sinners were the lowest class in Jewish society.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The publicans were Jews who collected taxes from their countrymen for the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They were much despised for their disloyalty and dishonesty.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet Jesus chose to feast with them and with those who were commonly called sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This eating declared that the Savior would not only save them but also spread a feast for them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such behavior offended the Pharisees and scribes, who were part of high society in Jewish culture.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Who is eligible for God's salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What standing do you take when you come for salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God does not offer salvation to Pharisees, nor kings, nor presidents, nor even gentlemen.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Salvation is only for those who come down and take the position of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THREE PARABLES</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These three parables give us a threefold picture of God's seeking of man, with the last one the consummate one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The parable of the lost sheep tells how the shepherd leaves his ninety-nine sheep and goes in search of the one missing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a picture of the Son as the good Shepherd, accomplishing redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the second parable the woman lights a candle and sweeps her house in order to find her lost coin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We sinners, chosen by God, are the coin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We were God's possession, but we got lost.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The woman is the Holy Spirit, sent to enlighten the house, our inner chamber, in order to find us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The last parable, that of the prodigal son, brings in the Father, who received the returned sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit's enlightening work is based on the foundation of the Son's redemption, just as the Father's receiving of the repentant sinner is the fruit of the Spirit's seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we pointed out in the previous message, it was not until the third stage of eating that the promised goal of God came into view.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The two earlier stages were not complete without it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With these three parables, the same principle applies.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not until we come to the third parable do we see a complete salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A REPENTANT SINNER</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A son left his father, squandered his inheritance, and eventually found himself in the fields feeding pigs while he himself was starving.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He returned to his father in repentance, saying, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son" Luke 15:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The father's reception of his son illustrates the full salvation which is ours in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE BEST ROBE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The prodigal son came home as a beggar, with bare feet and pathetic in every respect.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet "when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him" v. 20 . Interrupting the son's confession that he had sinned and was no more worthy to be called a son, "the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe lit., a robe, the first , and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet" v. 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The way the father referred to this robe makes it seem likely that he had especially prepared it beforehand for the son to wear whenever he might return.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By being covered with this robe, he was qualified to enter the father's splendid home, no more a beggar but a justified son, matching his father in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The best robe signifies Christ as our righteousness, covering us and justifying us in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But notice that the robe only takes care of the outward cover.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It represents an objective righteousness; Christ is not within us at this point.</S>
