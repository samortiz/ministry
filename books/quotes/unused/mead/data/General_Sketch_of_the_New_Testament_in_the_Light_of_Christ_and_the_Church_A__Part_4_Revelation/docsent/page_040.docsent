   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Foundations of the Wall</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Different in Color and Brightness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the city proper there is only one kind of gold, but in the foundations of the wall there are twelve kinds of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The experiences of Christ within each of us are different.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The divine nature is common to us all, but the expression of the divine nature through us is different.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Peter, John, and Paul each had their own spiritual characteristics and were different in color and in brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, we should not try to make others uniform with us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not try to convince others to be the same as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, we need to appreciate their color and thank the Lord for their brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Built Vertically in the Proper Order</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The different precious stones are built up together as the foundations of the wall in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Are the twelve foundations twelve blocks built horizontally or twelve layers built up vertically?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A vertical layering gives a better arrangement of the colors of the twelve stones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In addition, a horizontal building has no order, but a vertical arrangement keeps a proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Anything built vertically is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our physical body, for example, is living and strong when it is vertical, but a horizontal body is dead, or at least sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is difficult to keep a dead or sleeping person vertical; only a strong, living person stays vertical.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Body of Christ is vertical in three dimensions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This maintains a proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must always keep our position in the right order, appreciate and respect others experiences, and try our best to coordinate and fit in with others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the Lord s way to build up His church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not have any kind of organization, but we do need an order in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A sister may desire to bear responsibility like a brother, and a brother may desire to be free from responsibility like a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may compare this to the eyes, nose, and teeth on a face all wanting to line up horizontally.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What kind of a face would that be?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There would be no beauty or proper function in such a face.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the human thought, the lips are lower than the nose, and the nose is lower than the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, it is not a matter of being lower or higher; it is a matter of proper position and function.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to learn to keep a vertical order.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no organization in a living organism, but there is a living order.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When all the members of the church are fitly framed, everyone keeping a right position in order, there is real beauty, strength, and function.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Beauty, strength, and function come from the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Having the Enlarged Appearance of God</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Based on His Faithfulness</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to its colors, the foundations of the wall of the city have the appearance of a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 4:3 God, who has the appearance of jasper, is sitting on the throne surrounded by a rainbow, while in chapter twenty-one there is a city with the appearance of jasper surrounded by the foundations of the wall in the colors of a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The rainbow is a sign of God s covenant, reminding us that God will keep His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This city is built upon an unshakable foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is built upon God s unchangeable covenant, His unchangeable faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Its foundation is as sure as God s faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In chapter four there is the appearance of jasper surrounded by a rainbow, and in chapter twenty-one there is also the appearance of jasper surrounded by a rainbow, but it is now enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Earlier, only God Himself had the appearance of jasper, but now God with a Body has this appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God s appearance and testimony have been enlarged, but His faithfulness remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Entering into the City</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>by the Death and Resurrection of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 21 says, And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every gate was a pearl of great size.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The materials of the New Jerusalem are gold, precious stones, and pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These three kinds of materials are also found in Genesis 2:11-12.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As we have seen, gold signifies God s divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In addition, precious stones signify the inner work of life by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Pearls are produced by an oyster in the waters of death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand and the grain remains in the wound, the oyster secretes its life-juice around it and makes it into a precious pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This depicts the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ as the living One came into the death waters and was wounded by us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As we remain in His wound, the secretion of His resurrection life transforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Originally, we were only small grains of sand, but now we are regenerated and are being transformed into precious pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The three materials of the city signify the threefold work of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Gold signifies God the Father as the nature of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Pearl signifies God the Son who died and resurrected, by whose death and resurrection we have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Precious stones signify the work of the inner life by the Holy Spirit by which we are being transformed into something precious.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The entrance into the city is the gates of pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We enter into the spiritual things, into the kingdom of God, by regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Through Christ s death and resurrection we have been regenerated, affording us an entrance into God, into the spiritual things, and into God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Moreover, through our experience of the death and resurrection of Christ we have an entrance and opening for the increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The more we experience His death and resurrection, the more we will be broken to produce an opening for the increase.</S>
