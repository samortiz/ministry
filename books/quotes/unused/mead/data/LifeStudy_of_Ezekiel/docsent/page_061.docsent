   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Predicting Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this section on God s judgment, God, in His mercy, predicted something concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A Twig Becoming a Cedar Tree</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 17:22-23 the house of David, the royal household, is likened to a cedar tree.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, a branch of the tree, Jehoiachin, was cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later, another branch, Zedekiah, was set up and was also cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, this chapter tells us that on the top of this cedar tree there was one tender twig, one tender branch, which was cropped and planted on the top of the mountain, becoming a high cedar.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we read carefully, we will realize that this tender twig is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ, who belongs to the house of David and who was born as a descendant of the house of David, is a tender branch of the cedar of David.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As such a tender branch, He was cut off by being crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When He was nailed to the cross, He, the tender One, was cropped.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But by His resurrection He was planted on the mountaintop and eventually became a great cedar tree.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man cropped this tender One, but God caused Him to be resurrected and to ascend.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this way God planted Christ in a high place, and Christ became a majestic cedar under which many people will dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was not only a prophecy but also a promise given by God to the discouraged people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time the house of David was fully discouraged and disappointed, but Ezekiel predicted that out of the house of David there would be a tender twig set upon the mountaintop and this twig would become a great cedar tree.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was an encouragement and a promise to the house of David concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the house of David was cropped because of their corruption and thus became desolate and lowly, one day they will be revived in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because they will be joined to Christ, they will become majestic once again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The principle is the same with us in our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because of certain wrongdoings, we may be cropped and thereby become lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But because God has caused us to be joined to Christ and to be one with Him, we will become majestic in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Scepter of Judah</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ezekiel 21:10 is another verse which many students of the Word believe refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This verse is difficult to translate, but the best rendering is, The scepter of my son despises all trees.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This word is surely based on Genesis 49:10, which speaks regarding the scepter of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The scepter of Judah is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Ezekiel s time the cedar tree, the house of David, was cut off and burned.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some, however, still made mirth and were joyful, saying, The scepter of my son despises all trees.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that while Ezekiel was prophesying, telling the people that God was about to burn the people of Israel, including the house of David, which belonged to the tribe of Judah, some of them made mirth, saying, We have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have the scepter of God s Son, who despises and surpasses all trees.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s reply was to ask a question: Since He was going to burn everything, should they make mirth by saying this?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, this verse refers to Christ, the scepter of Judah; that is, it refers to the power and authority of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The One Who Has the Right</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>to Inherit the Kingdom of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ezekiel 21:27 indicates that Christ is the One who has the right to inherit the kingdom of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that time God was overturning the kingdom and the nation of Israel, but eventually the One who has the right to inherit the kingdom of Israel will come.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This One is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Horn of the House of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ezekiel 29:21 says, In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is the horn of the house of Israel which will bud forth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God will bring forth this horn of the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At Ezekiel s time other nations had conquered and oppressed the people of Israel, and they had no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But God promised that one day a horn will spring forth from the house of Israel to be against all the nations and to overcome the authorities on earth so that the nation of Israel may be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ will become the horn to deliver them from all oppression and bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we can see that while the judgment of God was upon His people and while they experienced much disappointment, God prophesied that Christ was their hope and encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although they were under the judgment of God, there was no need for them to be disappointed, for they were able to be encouraged by Christ and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This should also be our experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If while we are under God s judgment we are faithful to Him, we may be encouraged with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have God s mercy, and we have God s Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yes, we may be under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, even under God s judgment there is still the mercy of God and the encouragement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hallelujah for God s mercy and for God s Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The final result of God s judgment upon the Israelites was to cause them to turn to Christ and to gain Christ so that Christ would be everything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because they will be joined to Christ, they will ascend from being lowly to being very high, having Christ as the authority to surpass all the nations and authorities on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because of Christ, the nation of Israel will be restored and Christ will be the King.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In that day Christ will become the horn to deliver them from oppression and bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, everything is based on Christ and is received in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The principle is the same with the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The result of God s judgment upon the church is to gain a group of people who return to Christ and gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christ becomes their cedar tree to be their authority, and Christ becomes their horn of salvation.</S>
