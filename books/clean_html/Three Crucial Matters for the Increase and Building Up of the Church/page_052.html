<h1 class="title">THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 4:10; 5:10; 2 Pet. 1:2; 3:18; Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20</h1>
<p>We should all speak whenever we come together. We should not speak idle words, human words, or negative words. Instead, we should speak words of God, that is, words of Spirit, light, life, grace, blessing, and wisdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NORMAL, PROPER CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2>
<p>Concerning the home meetings, we have considered a life of pursuing the truth and the importance of being filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word in our living. When we rise early in the morning, we should first contact the Lord and fellowship with Him. We should then enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s Word in order to be filled with His speaking during the day. This will enable us to preach the gospel at work and to live a meeting life in the evening. We will be able to speak the Lord&rsquo;s words to one another in the meetings, and the words we speak will be words of truth.</p>
<p>May we all be led into a proper, normal Christian life. The most important thing in such a living is to call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo; the moment we wake up in the morning. As soon as we get out of bed, we should fellowship with the Lord. We can enjoy two verses from the Word, and we can read while praying and pray while reading. All day long we should be soaked in the Lord&rsquo;s word; then spontaneously we will live Christ.</p>
<p>We all have a heart and a burden to preach the gospel. We should not preach the gospel in an ostentatious way but in a spontaneous way. In other words, preaching the gospel is our living and our occupation. If someone asked me what my occupation is, I would say that I am a gospel preacher. I hope that all the brothers and sisters can also say that they are gospel preachers. Preaching the gospel is our main occupation. The jobs that we do to meet the necessities of our living are side jobs; they are secondary. The most important goal in our Christian life is to preach the Lord Jesus and bring people into the Lord so that they can follow Him. This will bring in the kingdom of the Lord.</p>
<p>After fellowshipping with the Lord in the morning, we should stay saturated with the Lord&rsquo;s word, live Christ, and preach the gospel during the day. In the evening we should not merely &ldquo;attend a meeting&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;go and meet&rdquo; in order to offer our portion. Through preaching the gospel, our relatives, classmates, and colleagues may be brought to salvation. If we feel to visit someone in the evening, we should go. We may miss a meeting, but we will be meeting with someone. At another time we may feel burdened to meet with our family at home. Whether we go out or stay home, we should come together to enjoy the Lord.</p>
<p>The words <em>attend a meeting</em> imply that we do not need to do anything but simply sit, listen, and look around. But the words <em>go and meet</em> mean that we are active participants, not spectators. If we are going to play basketball, we do not &ldquo;attend&rdquo; basketball; we play basketball. The difference is crucial. We should not attend a meeting; we should go to meet. We should not attend a prayer meeting; rather, we should go to a prayer meeting. To go to a prayer meeting means that we go to pray. There is a great difference in these two expressions.</p>
<p>We should all study the Word every day. We should also pray, sing, and speak the truth to others. We should not speak idle words; we should speak the Lord Jesus and the gospel. In addition to this, we should have an occupation as a side job to cover the needs of our living. If we are able to cover our livelihood by working eight hours a day, we should not work more hours even if we are offered a higher salary. We are not slaves to this world, and the world is not worthy of us (Heb. 11:38). Every evening we can visit our relatives or friends. If we do this for several hours in the evening, we may save two people or edify four. This is much better than working overtime and having an increase in salary.</p>
<p>This is the normal living of a Christian; this is the genuine, proper Christian life. We are not here for our education, our career, or for money. We are those who spend our energy on the Lord Jesus. This means that we labor on the Word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S WORD AS GRACE<br />
NEEDING TO PROSPER, GROW, AND MULTIPLY</h2>
<p>First Peter 4:10; 5:10; 2 Peter 1:2; and 3:18 can be grouped together into one category because they all speak of grace. First Peter 4:10 says, &ldquo;Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God.&rdquo; We are stewards ministering grace. It is a pity that the Chinese Union Version translates the word <em>grace</em> as &ldquo;gift.&rdquo; It says that we are &ldquo;good stewards of the varied gifts of God.&rdquo; In the original Greek, the meaning of the word <em>varied</em> implies more than a large amount; it also implies a large variety. Therefore, <em>varied</em> implies a large variety as well as a large quantity. For example, one hundred small cakes may be a large quantity, but there may not be a large variety of cakes. But if the one hundred cakes consist of British biscuits, Danish pastries, and German bread, then there are many varieties. For this reason, the Recovery Version of the Bible translates the phrase as <em>varied grace,</em> implying that there is largeness both in number and in variety.</p>
<p>First Peter 5:10 says, &ldquo;The God of all grace.&rdquo; Our God is a God of all grace, and this grace multiplies. For this reason, 2 Peter 1:2 says, &ldquo;Grace to you and peace be multiplied.&rdquo; The Chinese Union Version translates <em>be multiplied</em> as &ldquo;be added bountifully.&rdquo; The word <em>bountifully</em> is an adverb or an auxiliary in the Chinese, but in Greek this word is a verb meaning to multiply and to increase. It refers to the grace that is multiplying in us. This means that grace will multiply and increase in us. Eventually, the apostle Peter admonishes us to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (3:18). Grace is varied, all-inclusive, and multiplying; it is inexhaustible. Therefore, we should grow in this grace.</p>
<p>Acts 6:7; 12:24; and 19:20 belong to another group which says that the Lord&rsquo;s word grows and multiplies. Acts 6:7 says, &ldquo;The word of God grew.&rdquo; Anything that grows must have life; hence, the Lord&rsquo;s word has life since it can grow. A rock that is planted will never grow. However, any kind of seed will grow if it is planted. Just like a planted seed, the Lord&rsquo;s word grows in us. Acts 12:24 says, &ldquo;The word of God grew and multiplied.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s word not only grows but also multiplies. Acts 19:20 says, &ldquo;Thus, the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we put these two groups of verses together, we can see the relationship between grace and the Word. In the Bible the Word is God, the Lord Himself. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (John 1:1). The Bible also shows that grace is God Himself. John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; In this verse the Word and grace are connected. This verse also shows that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. The Word came to dwell in us as grace. This grace is the embodiment of the Word; hence, the Word is also called the word of His grace (Acts 14:3; 20:32). The genuine, proper Christian life is a life that spends time in the Word and enjoys the word of His grace. The Word is God, and grace is also God. Hence, we should enjoy God and grace every day.</p>
