   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HANDING ONESELF OVER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Date:Evening, February 4, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong HANDING ONESELF OVER FOR</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE BUILDING UP OF THE GLORIOUS CHURCH,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>USHERING IN THE LORD'S SECOND COMING</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All servants of God as well as all Bible students pay much attention to the state of glory which the church must reach before the second coming of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the church does not reach this state of glory, the Lord's coming will be delayed indefinitely.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Revelation 5 John saw a scroll in the hand of God; it was a sealed scroll.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John knew that it was God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's plan could not be fulfilled unless the scroll was opened.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that juncture an angel proclaimed that no one was worthy to open the scroll or to break the seal, and John wept vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We read the Bible often, and we know God's plan, but do you weep?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Are we anxious for the fulfillment of God's plan?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of all the prophecies in the Bible, only two raise apprehensions within me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not know if you have ever been apprehensive about them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are Ephesians 4 and 5.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It seems as if these two chapters will never be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ephesians 4 speaks of the church being built up and growing into the full measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ v. 13 . It seems very hard for the church to reach this state.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But there is more.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It seems that this chapter is not as hard to attain to as the previous one, but the requirement is certainly more stringent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this chapter we are told that when the Lord comes back, the church will be without spot as far as its very nature is concerned and that it will also be without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means it will not have any mark from previous wounds and sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church will also be blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if it is presented before all men and is subject to open scrutiny and criticism, no one will be able to find any fault v. 27 . The church will be so prepared that it will become absolutely blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I must ask the Lord to forgive me for saying this word: Today we can only look at the church with our eyes closed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once we open our eyes, we will see many areas in which the church is not blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can only give it a score of fifty out of a hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some people are not willing to give it even a score of five.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, the church will be without wrinkle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A wrinkle is a mark of oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There was a time when there was no wrinkle on our face, but now wrinkles have appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that we have grown old.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After two thousand years the church must still be young; it must still not have any wrinkle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is truly the hardest thing to achieve in the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>During the past five hundred years, there have been gradual recoveries in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church was once steeped in idol worship; even images of God Himself were made.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There were images of Christ, images of Mary, and images of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Worshipping images means that the church tolerates sin; this is degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have spent four to five years studying Ephesians 4 and 5.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every time I came across these passages, I shook my head and prayed, "Lord, this is impossible."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I admitted that I could not climb that high; my heart could not believe what I read.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church was wonderful at the beginning; it was indeed powerful, but what about now?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seems as if it has become desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, during the past two thousand years, the church has been advancing as well.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From Catholicism to Protestantism, there was clearly a recovery in the revelation of God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Truths were recovered, such as justification by faith, sanctification by faith, Christ as our life, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even teachings on faith and prayer were recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There was also the recovery of gifts, not to mention the recovery of the power of the Holy Spirit to cast out demons.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But before 1923 no one knew the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Preachers did not pay attention to the church; they only paid attention to revival meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One revival meeting saw two thousand five hundred persons saved, but only sixty-six people were willing to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many people thought that it was enough to be saved and to go to heaven; they did not think that it was necessary to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everyone wanted to take the easy way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They did not pay attention to the matter of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But thank the Lord that there were still some who were concerned about the matter of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This shows us that God has been taking the way of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Why do we have to hand ourselves over?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why do we have to consecrate in an absolute way?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is because God's children must stand on His side before the church can move on to perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The church must pay the price to gain God's riches before Ephesians 4 and 5 can be realized and before the Lord can find a way to come back.</S>
