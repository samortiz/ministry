It seems that unless two or three people pray, or all the brothers and sisters come together to pray, God will not answer
We have two kinds of answers to prayers: One is answer to individual prayers, and the other is answer to assembly prayers
Many brothers and sisters can testify that they understand more of God's Word in the meeting than when they study it individually
If we do not meet with others, the most we can have is individual grace; we will miss a great part of the corporate grace
After that they continued steadfastly in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers
If all the called out ones are separated from one another, we will not have the church; the church will not be produced
After we have believed in the Lord there is a basic need we must take care of, that is, to come together with other children of God
Chapter twelve speaks of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and chapter fourteen also speaks of the gifts of the Holy Spirit
According to these two chapters, it seems that the mutual functioning of the members of the Body is expressed in the meeting
There was sunlight in the outer court, and there was the lamp with olive oil burning before the veil in the Holy Place
The more compelling and powerful presence is experienced only in the meeting; we cannot experience such a presence individually
Although individually we can have the Lord's presence, this presence is never as great or as powerful as His presence in the meetings
We have to learn to meet together with the brothers and sisters because it is in the meeting that we experience the Lord's special presence
It is impossible to find a 'self-taught' Christian who can experience this kind of powerful presence of the Lord
We do not go to a meeting to visit certain brothers or sisters, nor do we go because we are attracted by certain brothers or sisters
They have a message in their heart which they want to preach, and they must speak it when they come to the meeting
They have a hymn in their heart which they like to sing, and they will do anything to find an opportunity to sing it
In the meeting, if we take care of the needs of others and try to build up others, the Holy Spirit will be honored
Your speaking must be for the benefit of the meeting, and your silence must also be for the benefit of the meeting
We need to learn to speak for the purpose of building up others and we need to learn to be silent also for the purpose of building up others
If you are not sure whether your speaking will build up others, the best thing to do is to check with more experienced brothers
Whenever we meet and whenever we fellowship with one another mutually, we should remember that, as believers, we are one in Christ
There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus'
There cannot be any distinctions because we have put on the new man; we are being constituted into one new man
In the new man there cannot be Greek or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian or Scythian, slave or free man
The Jews should not boast that they are descendants of Abraham and God's chosen people, and they should not despise all foreigners
If you bring the idea of kinship and regional flavor into the church, you do not know what the church of Christ is
Often the church suffers because many people try to bring their natural flavor and peculiar traits into the church
Whether you are quick or quiet cold or warm intellectual or emotional once you become a brother or a sister you must put off these things
When you bring your disposition and temperament into the church, you will make yourself the standard and the criteria
Those who get along with your character will be deemed right and those who do not get along with your character will be deemed wrong
Paul wrote the Epistles of 1 Corinthians, Galatians, and Colossians during the Roman era when slavery was practiced
In Christ and in the new man, the male and the female have the same status; there is no distinction between them
Bread-breaking and the laying on of hands have spiritual meanings, but they can also become marks of piety in the flesh
We may use these things to separate God's children, boasting about marks which others do not have, and the result is disunity
If we do this, we have downgraded these matters from their spiritual level and made them mere physical marks in the flesh
If we differentiate between God's children based on these things, we have made distinctions according to the flesh
God's children should not allow physical marks to damage the oneness in the Lord and the oneness in the new man
If we do this, there will be no division in the meeting of the church of God and in the fellowship between the saints
We have to pay attention to these matters in the meeting, and we have to live out such a life in our daily walk
