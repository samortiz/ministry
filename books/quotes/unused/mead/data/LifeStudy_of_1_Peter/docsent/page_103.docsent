   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CASTING OUR ANXIETY ON GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 7 Peter goes on to say, Casting all your anxiety on Him, because it matters to Him concerning you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word casting here means throwing upon, that is, committing to, giving up to.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The verb denotes a once-for-all act.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The words all your anxiety indicate that the whole lot of our anxiety throughout our entire life, our whole life with all its anxiety, should be cast on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to learn how to throw the burden of our anxiety upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It may now be on our own shoulder, but we should cast it from our shoulder to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the verb casting indicates a once-for-all act, because we are weak, we may need to cast our anxieties upon God again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes we cast our anxieties upon Him only to secretly take them back a while later.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This has been my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I may cast my anxiety upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But a few days later I may realize that I have taken this anxiety back upon myself, and therefore I need to pray, O Lord, forgive me for taking this anxiety back from You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once again, I would cast my anxieties upon You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes I have said to the Lord, Lord, I cast not only today s anxiety upon You, but all the anxieties I expect to have in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, I anticipate that much anxiety will be coming.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All this coming anxiety I will now give to You.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Greek word for anxiety also means worry or care.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In persecution the believers sufferings cause worry and anxiety to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They need not only to be humbled, to be brought low from their pride, their haughtiness, but also to throw their life with its care upon God; for He is not only mighty and just, but also loving and faithful concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may use the landing of airplanes at a busy airport as an illustration of the coming of anxiety upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you watch the airplanes making their approach to land, you will see that they usually come in one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But sometimes they come in pairs or even in a parade.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Anxiety may circle around us like an airplane circling an airport, waiting for the time to land.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who are involved with people will usually have more anxiety than those who live alone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, an unmarried brother will probably have much less anxiety than a married brother with several children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The married brother s concern for his wife and children causes him to become anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First his wife becomes a source of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then as each child is born, he has another reason to be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The causes of anxiety may increase as the children grow up, get married, and have children of their own, for then the grandchildren become a source of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Likewise, the property or possessions we have may cause anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are the owner of one house, you may be anxious concerning the care of that house.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if you own a second house, you will also be anxious about that house.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The same is true about your bank deposits.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The money you have in the bank may also become a source of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From experience I can testify that the more things I have, the more anxiety I have, the more the airplanes of anxiety circle above my head.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all must learn to cast all our anxiety upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not cast our anxiety upon Him, we shall not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps little children under the age of four do not have any anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the older we are, the more anxiety we have, because more airplanes of anxiety are waiting to land at our airport.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What, then, shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although it is not easy, we need to cast our anxiety upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we find that we take back the very anxiety we have given the Lord, we need to cast it upon Him again.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The reason we may cast all our anxiety on the Lord is that it matters to Him concerning us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The words it matters to Him concerning you may also be rendered, He cares for you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The disciplining and judging God has a loving concern for the believers, especially the persecuted ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He cares for them faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They can cast their care upon Him, especially in their persecution.</S>
