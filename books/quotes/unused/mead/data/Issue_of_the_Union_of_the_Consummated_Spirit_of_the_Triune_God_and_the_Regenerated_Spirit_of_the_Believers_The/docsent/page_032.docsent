   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, You are the Alpha and You are also the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You are the Beginning and also the End.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>May You speak to us again until You have completed speaking Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When You appeared to Abraham, he waited before You and walked with You, waiting for Your last word, until You had completed Your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>O Lord, this is the last meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From deep within we are waiting for You to speak to us the final word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The final word is the deciding word, the word most in Your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>May we here have not only excitement but also an ambition and a great purpose of heart toward You.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not for ourselves but for Your eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We want to be Your overcomers in this generation, to walk with You, to live together with You, and to work together with You so that we can terminate this age and bring in the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is what You desire and what You want to obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, hear our prayer and take care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are a group of people who need Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our condition really needs Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>May You have mercy on us in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the previous chapters we have seen a number of great and profound matters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this chapter we will go back to look at the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The speaking Spirit of the Lord within the minister of His word is most sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He knows what to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Within me is a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am concerned that you might have been in the Lord's recovery for many years, yet you still do not know what the Lord's recovery is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although you may know the Lord's recovery in term, you may not know its real significance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From 1933 to 1935 there was a publication among us that reported and fellowshipped concerning the situation of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That publication was called "A Collection of Newsletters."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Later the brothers reported and fellowshipped in that publication primarily matters that concerned minor issues, such as leaving the denominations, baptism, head covering, etc., and not much attention was paid to the central messages given by Brother Nee concerning Christ as life and Christ having the preeminence in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of this, Brother Nee was forced to suspend that publication in 1935 and to tell the co-workers strongly that they needed to be awakened and not continue in that way but have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today I am concerned about the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord has been speaking continuously in His recovery for seventy-three years, from Brother Nee's publication of literature in 1922 up to today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord's speaking among us has never stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today the Lord's speaking has reached the high peak concerning God's economy, which is God becoming man in order to make man God in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, does our condition match this?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am afraid that many people take "man becoming God" only as a slogan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why we must look specifically at what the Lord's recovery is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I. THE FIRST ASPECT OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE REVELATION OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Simply, the Lord's recovery has three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first aspect is the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The revelation of God is the speaking of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From Moses in the Old Testament until the apostle John in the New Testament, God spoke for more than fifteen hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His speaking collectively became the completed Bible, which is in our hands today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, the last book of the Bible, Revelation, says at the end that no one should add to these words or take away from these words 22:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even before the first group of apostles passed away, the church had already veered from the word of God, the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was why the apostles wrote the second Epistles, such as 2 Peter, 2 Timothy, the Epistles of 2 and 3 John, etc. All these second Epistles are books of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church had lost the truth and had left the position of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The apostles wrote the second Epistles to bring the church back.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What they wrote also became a part of the truth, a part of the Bible, to be a warning to the future generations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At that time the church had greatly deviated from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, some denied the deity of Christ, saying that Christ was merely an honorable man and that because of His high honor He was later deified.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There were also some who said that Christ was not God incarnated as a real man; He was merely a phantom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first Epistle of John deals with these heretical teachings 2:22; 4:2-3 .</S>
