BY WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p><em>Question: What should our attitude be toward Christians in denominations and toward people such as Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses or Mormons? Should we contact them or stay away from them?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We must learn to walk according to the spirit when we contact people. Whether we should contact someone does not depend on outward circumstances but on the sense in our spirit. Sometimes the person we contact is not open and rejects us; hence, we do not have the chance to speak. In Acts 13 Paul and Barnabas were preaching the gospel in Pisidian Antioch, and most of the city was gathered together to hear the word of God (v. 44). When the Jews saw the crowds, however, they were filled with jealousy and contradicted the things being spoken by Paul and blasphemed (v. 45). The Jews incited the women of high standing who worshipped God and incited the chief men of the city to raise up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and to cast them out from their borders (v. 50). Paul and Barnabas, however, shook off the dust of their feet against them and went to Iconium (v. 51). Because the Jews thrust the word away and did not judge themselves worthy of eternal life, Paul and Barnabas turned to the Gentiles (v. 46). Therefore, if people reject us, we do not need to compel them to receive. In Matthew 7:6 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Do not give that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the hogs, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn and tear you.&rdquo; Hence, when we contact people, we need to pay attention to their reaction and to the sense in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NAME OF JESUS BEING CONNECTED<br />
TO THE PERSON OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p><em>Question: According to my experience, calling on the name of the Lord is very practical. The more I call on His name, the more my faith is strengthened. Many saints obtain subjective experiences of the Lord by calling on His name. Can you give us further fellowship concerning calling on the name of the Lord?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When we call on the name of the Lord, we must be clear that we are not calling on an empty name. The name of the Lord Jesus is connected to the living person of the Lord. If I repeatedly call someone&rsquo;s name but get no response or if I call on a name that is fake, then I am calling on an empty name. When a person responds after I call his name, I know that the name is connected to a person. The Lord&rsquo;s name is connected to His person. When we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; He, as the Spirit, immediately comes to us. Jesus is His name, and the Holy Spirit is His person.</p>
<p>Christianity neglects the divine Spirit and the human spirit. People opposed us when we began calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name and paying attention to the Spirit, and they opposed us when we began pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word and paying attention to life. Such opposition was out of Satan, because he does not want us to enter into life or to touch the Spirit. We must see through Satan&rsquo;s stratagem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE HABIT<br />
OF EATING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD</h2>
<p><em>Question: I was deeply impressed with the fellowship concerning the washing of the water in the word. We have often heard such a word, and we know the importance of this experience, but it is hard for us to put it into practice. How can we build up the practice of eating the Lord&rsquo;s Word every day?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We must build up the habit of eating the Lord&rsquo;s Word. Some people are careless regarding their eating. Either they do not eat, or they eat in an unrestrained manner. As a result, they build up a bad habit. Other people eat a set amount of food at set times every day. They even eat their food in a certain order. It takes time to build up such a good habit. There is a need to give messages on eating the Lord regularly. Such messages will help the saints build up a good habit of eating the Lord&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<p>When a person builds up a good habit of eating at set times, his appetite will increase. Therefore, this question is related to habit. If new believers do not yet have an appetite for the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we need to spend time to help them pray-read the Word. It will not be sufficient to help them only once. After bringing a person to salvation, we need to spend one to two months leading him to pray-read the Word. As he gains a taste for pray-reading, his appetite will increase. We should not avoid or neglect spending such time with new believers. In principle, if the saints do not know how to pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, the church life in that locality will not be strong. It is better to reduce our work in other areas in order to spend more time to bring the saints, one by one, into the habit of pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word. This is more profitable.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> </body></html>
