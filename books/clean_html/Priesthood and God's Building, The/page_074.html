<h2 class="head2">Concerning Words of Enlightenment</h2>
<p>Another category of words in the Bible concerns words of direct enlightenment. These are words that specifically shine upon us. When we read words in the Bible that shine upon us, we need to have a receiving spirit. In our prayer we should express our willingness to receive the light. For example, the Lord said to the disciples, &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself&rdquo; (16:24). This seems to be a word of teaching and instruction, but it can also shine upon us to expose our unwillingness to deny ourselves. There are also words of exhortation in the Bible. For example, James 1:21 speaks of &ldquo;putting away all filthiness.&rdquo; Under the shining of this word, we may realize the need to keep ourselves pure before the Lord. We can be enlightened concerning our condition when we read words of exhortation, and when we are enlightened, we need to pray, confessing our mistakes to receive the benefit of the enlightenment. It is not enough to pray, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for showing me that I should deny myself and put away all filthiness&rdquo;; we also need to accept the Lord&rsquo;s enlightenment, saying, &ldquo;Lord, in the light of Your word, I see that I still love myself. I do not even abhor what is filthy in me. I still am full of filthy things that have not been put away completely.&rdquo; When we encounter the Lord&rsquo;s direct enlightenment in our reading of His words, we need to respond.</p>
<p>After we receive enlightenment, we need to confess our sins. This is necessary. Words of enlightenment will cause us to see our shortages and to sense our need of confession. After we confess, we should seek forgiveness and apply the efficacy of the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood by faith so that we can go on, knowing that God has forgiven us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Our Responsibility before God</h2>
<p>Another category of words in the Bible concerns our responsibility before God, or God&rsquo;s requirement of us. When we read such words, we should express our willingness to meet the Lord&rsquo;s requirement. For example, the Bible explicitly says that we need to leave all and follow the Lord (cf. Matt. 19:27-28), and that we need to present our &ldquo;bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God,&rdquo; which is our reasonable service (Rom. 12:1). Words like these speak of God&rsquo;s requirements and of our responsibility to fulfill them. Therefore, when we pray-read such words, we need to express our willingness to meet these requirements and to pay the price. We cannot read these words with an unwilling attitude. We should even acknowledge our agreement to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;You have asked us to present our bodies, and I am presenting my body. You have asked us to leave all, and I am willing to say yes.&rdquo; After we express our willingness, we also need to entrust ourselves to Him, saying, &ldquo;Even though I am willing, I cannot do this by myself. I entrust myself to Your hand and to Your ability to fulfill it in me. Be my supply.&rdquo; We need to utter words of agreement and dependence in order to digest these requirements and responsibilities.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Our Fellowship with the Lord</h2>
<p>There are also words concerning our fellowship with the Lord, such as waiting for God (Psa. 130:5-6), panting for God, thirsting for God, and appearing before God (42:1-2). These words help us to fellowship with God, cause us to rejoice, and allow us to see God&rsquo;s light in fellowship. As we are digesting words related to fellowship, we should have the same attitude of those who uttered these words, praying to the Lord with the same words: &ldquo;My soul pants for You, O God. Here I wait for You. I come and appear before You.&rdquo; We should utter and digest words of fellowship with the same attitude, the same spirit, and the same words as those who spoke these words in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Patterns in the Bible</h2>
<p>There are many patterns mentioned in the Bible, such as Abraham and Enoch in the Old Testament and the apostles in the New Testament. When we read words concerning patterns, we need to thank God for the patterns. For example, the Bible speaks of how Paul was faithful, lived before God, did not account his own life as precious for the gospel of God, and cared for and loved the church. When we read these words, we need to pray, &ldquo;Thank You for giving us such a pattern. You chose Paul, and You equipped him, supplied him, established him, and presented him as a pattern for us.&rdquo; Then we need to ask for grace to follow these patterns, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I am willing to receive the same grace. If it pleases You, grant me the same grace so that I may follow Paul&rsquo;s pattern.&rdquo; We should praise, and then we should beseech the Lord concerning our willingness to receive the same grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning the Promises of God</h2>
<p>There are also words in the Bible concerning God&rsquo;s promises. When we read words of promise, we need to give thanks in order to digest these words. We need to thank the Lord and say, &ldquo;Thank You for giving us these precious, sweet, and rich promises. Thank You for these words.&rdquo; Then, with an attitude of receiving, we need to say, &ldquo;Lord, I want to receive these promises.&rdquo; However, we also need to acknowledge our limited faith, even our inability to believe. Since we do not have the ability in ourselves to believe, we need to say, &ldquo;Lord, all of my believing ability comes from You. I am unable to believe Your promises in myself. I need You to be my believing ability. I entrust myself to You and receive You into me as my believing ability.&rdquo; We should praise and thank the Lord for His words of promise, and then we should receive His words with a believing attitude by acknowledging Him as the believing One in us.</p>
<p>I hope that the saints will receive more help to enjoy the supply of the divine word in the Bible through pray-reading in this way.</p>
