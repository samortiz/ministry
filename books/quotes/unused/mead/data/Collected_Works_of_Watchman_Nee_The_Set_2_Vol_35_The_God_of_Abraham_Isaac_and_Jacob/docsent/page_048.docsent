   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Meaning of Peniel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some may ask, "What is the meaning of Peniel?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can Jacob's Peniel be applied to us?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can answer this way: You may have a stubborn disposition which has been dominating your life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This disposition has become the principle of your life and the lodging ground of your natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At ordinary times, you do not notice it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But God provides many opportunities in which this natural strength is exposed once, twice, ten times, or even a hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet you are still unaware of it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One day, at the crossing at Jabbok, you will have exhausted your ability and the very seat of your natural life will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time, God's hand will touch you and show you where your natural strength lies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You will realize your most ugly, evil, and filthy disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What you have been boasting about, what you have gloried in and taken satisfaction in, and what you have considered excellent and superior are now under the shining of God's light and found to be nothing but the fleshly life, which is filthy, corrupted, and despicable.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The light has killed you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the meaning of Peniel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God shows you that the very things that you once boasted in, considered admirable, were proud of, and that distinguished you from others are the very expressions of the fleshly life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God touches your life in this way, you become weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the meaning of Peniel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Your natural strength needs to be dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But before you see the light, you consider this strength as something precious and worthy of boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brothers and sisters, you have to be careful with your boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The strength of the natural life is hidden within the boasts of many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is hard to find one Christian who does not have his natural life lurking behind his boasts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, you have to be particularly careful about your boasts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The things that you boast in are often the very things that God will deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps these very things are the hollow of your thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God will shine on you and touch the hollow of your thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When He touches this spot, you will become very ashamed and say, "How could I have made my greatest shame my glory?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All those who know a little about the experience of Peniel can testify that when God touches the hollow of their thigh, they are not only weakened but ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They exclaim, "How could I have been so foolish?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I thought that this and that were good.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually they were all shameful things!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They feel that they are the most ugly person before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brothers and sisters, once God touches you, you will see that everything you did before was ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You will wonder how you could have considered them your glory and your virtues, and how you could have considered others inferior to yourself!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When this happens, God has touched you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The name Peniel means "the face of God" in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's face is God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the past, God touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh with His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today He is touching our natural life with His light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once we are enlightened by God's light, we will realize that the things we once considered to be good, glorious, and outstanding are but shameful and foolish things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This light will give us a mortal blow and deplete us of all strength.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers and sisters, one day we will have to pass through Peniel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God must touch our natural life before we can become useful persons in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The day will come when we will pass through such an experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Of course, we cannot hasten its coming by being anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, we can commit ourselves to the faithful Creator and pray that He will work things out in the environment and lead us to the realization that our boasts are just our shame and foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May the Lord be merciful to us, and may He give us light so that His work may be fulfilled in us through the enlightening of Peniel the face of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No Pretense in Dealing with the Natural Life</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The natural life must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yet we cannot pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Pretension is not Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christianity does not make us persons we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we are adults, we will spontaneously have the appearance of adults.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we are children, we will spontaneously have the appearance of children.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The same is true with God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is He who touches our natural life and removes its strength.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a result we cannot do anything by ourselves any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to allow the Holy Spirit to manifest Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We do not want to be natural, yet we do not want to be pretentious either.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is an uncomely sight for a child of God to pretend to be spiritual; it frustrates his natural life from being dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many Christians pretend to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The more humble they appear, the more uncomfortable they make others feel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>With many Christians, it would be better for them to speak of worldly things because they would at least be somewhat genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But the minute they talk about spiritual things, others cannot help but pray, "Lord, be merciful to him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is talking about things that bear no reality at all."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many Christians appear very meek, but one cannot help but pray, "Lord, forgive this man's meekness; we do not know where this meekness comes from."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Indeed, nothing frustrates the Christian life more than pretension.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to be unpretentious and genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we want to smile, we should smile.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we want to laugh, we should laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must never perform and never pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord deals with the natural life, and the Holy Spirit accomplishes this work.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must never exhort others to be what they are not.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If a man is humble, he is humble.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If he pretends to be humble, his pretension is worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If a Christian pretends to be spiritual, his natural life will become even harder to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God does not need this kind of person, because his pretension is a frustration to God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the last century, there was a brother who was greatly used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>One day he was a guest at another person's house.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>A young sister was also invited as a guest.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The sister was surprised to find that this brother was also a guest.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>She wondered if this brother would put butter on his bread.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>She thought that a spiritual person would surely be different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But to her disappointment, he did not fit her expectation of what a spiritual person should be.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He appeared to be just a normal man!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>She was disappointed that he was merely a man!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>She observed that he buttered his bread just like everyone else and chatted while he ate.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>She did not see much difference in him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>She wondered why such a spiritual man would be the same as others.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>She did not realize that his difference did not lie in eating unbuttered bread or in restraining himself from conversation at mealtime, but in his special knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>What was special about this man was his experience in the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We should never think that dealing with the natural life is pretending to be a special kind of person, one who is found neither in heaven nor on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We do not need to pretend or imitate.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It is God who touches our natural life and God who deals with us.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God touches the seat of our natural energy.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He strips us of our own ways so that we can struggle no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Peniel is God's work; it is not something that we conjure up.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Lord wants us to be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We should neither strive to become genuine nor "act" genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>One sister appeared very genuine before others.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>But while she appeared to be "genuine," her heart was saying, "See!</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>How genuine am I!"</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This kind of "genuineness" has no value before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>She was faking her genuineness; it was a kind of self-boasting genuineness.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We have to remember that the natural life is not touched when we pretend to be what we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>God alone can deal with our natural life; we cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We need to be unpretentious.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We should be what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>God will deal with our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Brothers and sisters, we have to be thoroughly clear that there is a big difference between anything that comes from ourselves and anything that comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Anything that comes from God counts, while anything that comes from us is worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Anything that comes from ourselves only makes us someone we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Only that which comes from God will make us Israel.</S>
