   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the prophecy of the kingdom, the Lord told His disciples that in two days the Passover was coming and that the Son of Man was being delivered up to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The significance of the Lord's word here Matt 26:1-2 is that His crucifixion is the fulfillment of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Matthew 26:3-5 reveals that the Lord Jesus was plotted against by religion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel together how they might seize Jesus by craftiness and kill Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although the religionists hated the Lord Jesus, His disciples loved Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>6-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must love the Lord and grasp the opportunity to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The story of the gospel is that the Lord loved us, and the story of Mary is that she loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must preach both the Lord's loving us and our loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One is for our salvation, and the other is for our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verses 14 through 16 we see that the Lord Jesus was betrayed by the false disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The idea of betraying the Lord Jesus did not originate with Judas, but with the enemy, the devil John 13:2, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The keeping of the Passover and the establishing of the table are revealed in Matthew 26:17-30.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>20-25; Luke 22:14-18 .</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we see the bread at the Lord's table, we need to realize that it is a symbol both of the Lord's physical body and His mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, when we break the bread and eat it, we have the fellowship of the Lord's Body 10:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Concerning the Lord's table v. 21 , the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, it is called the cup of blessing v. 16 . In this cup are all the blessings of God and even God Himself as our portion Psa 16:5 . Moreover, the product of the vine Matt 26:29 within the cup of the Lord's table also is a symbol, signifying the Lord's blood shed on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His blood was required by God's righteousness for the forgiveness of our sins Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord's blood, having satisfied God's righteousness, enacted the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The blood is the price Christ paid for us, the covenant is the title deed God made to us, and the cup is the portion we receive from God.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then He was pressed in Gethsemane, arrested by religion, judged by the Sanhedrin, and denied by Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because we all are the same as Peter, we should not try to follow the pathway into the kingdom by our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No matter what kind of mind or will we may have, we cannot succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only after we have passed through all the tests and have suffered all the defeats and failures will we realize our need for another life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Truly, only the life of Jesus is good for the kingdom.</S>
