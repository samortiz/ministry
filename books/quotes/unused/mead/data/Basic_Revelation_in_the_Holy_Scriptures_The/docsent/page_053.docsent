   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REGENERATED MAN,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD'S BUILDING MATERIAL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For God to have a building, the center of His creation, man, needs to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Regenerated man becomes God's building material.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God did not impart Himself into any item of His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In His old creation He did breathe the breath of life into man Gen 2:7 , but that breath was not something of His essence or nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was only His breath.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That breath of life, neshamah Heb , became the spirit of man; as Proverbs 20:27 says, "The spirit neshamah of man is the lamp of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nothing of God's essence was imparted into man until the New Testament time and the completion of the full redemption of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then God came to impart not only something of Himself, but also Himself into man that man might be regenerated by Him John 3:5 , born of Him John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we were born of our earthly father, our father's essence and nature were imparted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are now regenerated persons, the offspring of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are children born of God, not sons adopted by an adopting father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have been begotten of a begetting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whatever the Father is has been imparted into us, His children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The only thing of His which we do not have is His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even though we were born of Him, we do not participate in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To say we are deified in the sense of having His Godhead is blasphemy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But we ourselves are not the object of any man's worship and never can be.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That would be blasphemous.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, we should have the boldness to say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have God's life Col 3:4; 1 John 5:12 and God's nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In life and in nature I am the same as my God, because I have been born of Him."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His life is our life, and His nature is our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are the excellent children of God Rom 8:16; 1 John 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The last verse of Hymn 608 says that with God we "differ not in life in any way."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The natural material out of God's creation is not qualified to be used for His building material because it has nothing of God's essence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What God uses for His building must have His essence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A GOLDEN MOUNTAIN</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In our daily life we are bothered by dust.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I like Texas, but one thing I do not like is that it is too windy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Too much wind brings dust.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we are in the New Jerusalem, though, there will be no dust.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The New Jerusalem, the holy city, is a golden mountain Rev 21:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This mountain is about thirteen hundred fifty miles high, the approximate distance from New York to Dallas.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The New Jerusalem is twelve thousand stadia high Rev 21:16 ; one stadion equals six hundred feet.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Have you ever seen such a high mountain?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It would take fifty days to climb it on foot, if you traveled twenty-seven miles a day.</S>
