   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Especially His God-seeking Mother</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>with Her Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The origin of Samuel was especially his God-seeking mother with her prayer vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>9-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Her prayer was an echo of the heart's desire of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Her prayer was a human cooperation with the divine move for the carrying out of God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should no longer pray old prayers in a formal way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, we need to pray something that is an echo of what is on God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that what we say in our prayer is exactly what God wants to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a prayer is the speaking out of God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hannah's prayer was like this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God wanted a Samuel, yet He needed Hannah's cooperation to pray to Him, saying, "Lord, I need a son."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This prayer was very human, yet it was a cooperation with the divine move for God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. The Moving God with His Answer</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>to the Prayer of Samuel's Mother 1.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to God's Desire and Intention</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>for His Move among His Elect</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In a very particular way, the origin of Samuel was the moving God with His answer to the prayer of Samuel's mother vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After such a prayer as Hannah prayed, it was easy for God to do something, because man's cooperation had become a base on which He could move.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The moving God answered the prayer of Samuel's mother according to His desire and intention for His move among His elect.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Keeping with the Principle</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That God Needs Man's Cooperation</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's move in response to Hannah's prayer was in keeping with the principle that God needs man's cooperation with His move in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To Produce a Nazarite Who Was Absolute</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>for the Fulfilling of His Desire</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's move with His answer to Hannah's prayer was to produce a Nazarite who was absolute for the fulfilling of His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A Nazarite is one who is consecrated to God absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A Nazarite could never cut his hair or drink wine.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Bible, long hair signifies the headship, the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A Nazarite's keeping his hair long was a sign that just as a female takes her husband as her head, he takes God as the Head, considering God his Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, a Nazarite is one who submits himself to God, taking God as the Head, the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why Hannah prayed that if the Lord would give her a boy, no razor would come upon his head v. 11 . In the Bible, to drink wine is to enjoy the worldly pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A Nazarite not only submits to God as the authority but also has no interest in the enjoyment of worldly pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even before he was born, Samuel was consecrated by his mother to be such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a great thing, for it was Samuel who brought in a new age.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The New Testament age was brought in by another Nazarite John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus was a Nazarite, as were Peter and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, everyone who remains in the line of life is a Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we would be today's Nazarites, we must take God as our Head and Husband, submitting to Him, and have no interest in worldly pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to be impressed with Samuel's origin, with his source.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because he came out of such a strong source, he could not be an ordinary, worldly person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, he was the one who replaced the waning priesthood and brought forth David, who brought forth Christ.</S>
