To be regenerated is to receive the life of God into our spirit. We must grow in life daily until we are fully matured in life. Because this matter is a daily life-long process, we must focus our full attention on this crucial point. First, we must see what people mistakenly assume to be the growth of life. Second, we need to discern the true meaning of the growth of life. Third, we need to see how to grow in life.
