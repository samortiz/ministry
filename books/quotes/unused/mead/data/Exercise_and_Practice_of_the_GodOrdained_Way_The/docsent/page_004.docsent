   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If you would have this kind of patience, this kind of spirit, surely within three years you would gain one.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you would have D. L. Moody's spirit, even within three months you would gain one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It would be easy for you to gain four per year.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today, most of us are not living in small villages but in big cities.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These big cities are big fishing ponds.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes I feel that the fish are just longing to be caught, but we do not act, we do not move.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So, we must pick up this new way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are priests of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must touch people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must bring people to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every year we should bring forth one or two spiritual children that we may present them to the Lord as a present, an offering, a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since I saw and began to speak concerning the new way, there has been much opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But, thank the Lord, most of the churches and most of the saints in the recovery have accepted the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, to accept the new way is one thing; to practice it is another.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because of this, I am burdened to urge all of you who are in this meeting and all the other saints who are in the recovery throughout the world to practice the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all have to learn to practice the new way that the Lord may have a way to go on among us today for the carrying out of His New Testament economy in building up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Luke 14 the Lord says, "Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled" v. 23 . Have you ever compelled, forced, somebody to believe in the Lord Jesus? Some people are too spiritual, saying: "We cannot save people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let the Lord do it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not force people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not compel people."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet the Lord Jesus tells us to "compel them to come in."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It seems more spiritual to say: "Just wait.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let the Lord do it."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But according to the Bible this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are too many things we can see in the New Testament that we do not practice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the New Testament, we first have to see that we are priests of the gospel and that we need to offer some sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please do not say that you are only a sister, that you are old, that you are weak, that you are sick, or that you are not a professional preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus would never let you take any of these excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, as a priest of the gospel, you must take action with patience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not so easy to get one person saved, and it is not easy to raise up one person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have heard that some have brought many to the Lord, yet they were not able to bring one into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If this is your case, it is because you did it without patience and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you have the patience and faith, surely at least one of them will be brought to the Lord and will be brought into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you do not have the patience and faith, when you go to visit people, surely they will not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may think: "This one is too shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no need to bring him into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And that one is very rude."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When you want to save a person, you must love that person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without love, without care, you cannot bring people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whether this one is lame, crippled, blind, or deaf, you must love him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some of the saints among us in the past did not like these kinds of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They liked "perfect persons," so they did not have the patience and faith that they could eventually bring people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must learn to exercise our patience and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God has assigned us to be priests, but we do not have patience and faith to keep practicing the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we have to pick up the priesthood and practice it with patience and faith that we may eventually offer some saved sinners as sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must practice this by endeavoring with endurance, with longsuffering, with patience, with love, with care, and with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A blind American sister, Fanny Crosby, wrote the hymn, "Rescue the perishing, care for the dying" Hymns, #921 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That hymn really inspires me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But for you to sing this hymn is only thunder without rain.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You only sing; you do not go out to rescue anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Jehovah's Witnesses have the patience to spend over six thousand hours to get one person.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have the pure gospel, the highest gospel, yet we do not have the increase because we do not go out to get it with patience and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You must go out.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In one week you may gain nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In one month you may gain nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But by the end of one year, you will gain one, at least one drop of rain.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet this is not too little.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You have to treasure this one.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is good that the Lord has given us a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As priests of the gospel, we all have to go out and practice our New Testament priesthood.</S>
