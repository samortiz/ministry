	 <h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY<br />
OF LEAVING ORGANIZATIONS</h2>
<p>The fourth recovery is leaving, or coming out from, organizations. Leaving organizations refers to leaving the organizations of Christianity. Thank God that the gospel, the truth, the Bible, the Lord, the Lord&rsquo;s name, and His salvation came to China through the Western missionaries. We thank God for this, and we also thank the missionaries. However, after we were enlightened, we saw that the missionaries also brought organizations with them. Anyone who was saved within a certain organization was spontaneously brought into that organization. All the denominations and missions are like this. Problems in the church that cannot be resolved by the believers themselves must be taken to a mission board or denominational headquarters for a solution. Moreover, when a person receives the gospel and is baptized among a particular group, he becomes a member of that organization.</p>
<p>In 1922 the brothers in Foochow received the Lord&rsquo;s leading to leave organizations. They were outside of organizations and served the Lord in a clean, pure way. Regrettably, they did not have enough light; thus, a problem arose among them when a brother wanted to be ordained. This problem resulted in division. The situation of division in Foochow was not fully resolved even when we left mainland China. Brother Nee published <em>The Christian</em> from 1925 until 1927, and in it he severely criticized the organizations in Christianity, based upon the light that he had seen. In 1934 the move to leave the denominations reached a high tide; we saw people everywhere leaving the denominations. Some were overzealous in the way that they left, but in principle, they all were correct.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF<br />
INDIVIDUAL FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>The recovery of individual fellowship with the Lord includes individual reading of the Lord&rsquo;s Word, keeping morning watch, and prayer in the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Although I was not present at the beginning of this recovery, I heard that it was very good. Most of the believers involved in this recovery were young people. As students, they would habitually play sports together, and later they would gather in groups in the shade of trees to read the Bible and pray. Thus, individual fellowship with the Lord was a strong recovery. These practices are part of our heritage and still exist among us. We should not emphasize other things while neglecting individual fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF SERVICE AND<br />
OF ZEAL FOR THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Formerly, when a person believed in Jesus, he merely became a church member; the better believers made monetary offerings, and the best ones entered seminaries. Therefore, all matters of service fell to the pastors. Although some believers testified and brought others to believe in the Lord, the matter of all the saints preaching the gospel and serving was not recovered until we were raised up. The brothers recovered the functioning of all the saints; there was no need for a believer to be a member of the clergy in order to serve and preach the gospel. Students could preach the gospel after classes, and other saints could preach the gospel whenever they went out. Now when we preach the gospel, all the brothers and sisters participate. This is truly a recovery.</p>
<p>Several times the brothers and sisters have mistaken me for a gospel friend. Once as I was walking from the bus stop to Hall 3 and was still somewhat far from the meeting hall, a brother invited me to come hear the gospel. There were many ushers along the road, and they welcomed me warmly. I was not recognized until I reached the door of the meeting hall. The same thing happened another time as I went to Hall 4; before I arrived at the meeting hall, the brothers and sisters began urging me to come and hear the gospel. Inwardly, I rejoiced, because their actions showed that they preach the gospel voluntarily and bring many people to salvation. Although we did not know each other, the whole situation was very encouraging. This blessing was left to us by the brothers who went before us and who recovered the service and the zeal for the gospel; it is our spiritual inheritance.</p>
