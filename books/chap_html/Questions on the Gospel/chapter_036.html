<h1 class=msg>QUESTION THIRTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>CONCERNING JOHN 1:12-13 AND REVELATION 22:17</h1><p>How can we reconcile John 1:12-13, which says that receiving life is not of the “will of man,” and Revelation 22:17, which says that whosoever will can take life?<h2 class=head1>ANSWER</h2><p>Since ancient times, this question has been debated by many theologians. One school claims that salvation is wholly a matter of man’s will, whereas another school claims that salvation is wholly a matter of God’s will. We must realize that there are often two sides to God’s truth. If we are not careful, we can become unbalanced. There is a tendency for man to hold on to one extreme or the other.<p>Is the matter of salvation entirely a matter of man’s will or God’s will? Actually, it involves both aspects. Without God’s will to save, no one could be saved. At the same time, if man is not willing to be saved, God has no way even though He has the will. Therefore, not only does God have to be willing, but man must also be willing. The Lord Jesus said, “How often I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you would not!” (Luke 13:34). These are the two sides of God’s truth. It takes a willingness on both sides. With only one side, salvation cannot be accomplished. If we want to know the truth, we should not lay hold of only one side of the truth. When Satan tempted the Lord, he said, “It is written,” but the Lord replied, “Again, it is written.” No doubt it is written, but we must also pay attention to what is written again. Just laying hold of one or even a few verses to prove a side of the truth is inadequate. We must realize that there are many verses which confirm the other side of the truth. For example, once Christians are saved, they remain saved forever. This is one side of the truth. At the same time, Christians who sin after their salvation and do not repent will still be punished. Even though they will not pass through the second death, the Bible says that they will suffer the hurt of the second death. This is also the truth.<p>Some have asked why the Bible says, on the one hand, that whosoever will may take the water of life freely and whosoever believes in the Lord Jesus should not perish but have eternal life and, on the other hand, that God predestinated man to be saved? Someone has given a very good answer that the word “Whosoever” is written on the outside of the gate of heaven meaning “whosoever will may enter.” But once the gate has been entered, we can turn around and see that “You are predestinated” is written on the inside of the gate. This statement expresses the two sides of God’s truth. Our experience can confirm this. When I first believed in the Lord, all I did was believe. After believing in Him, I looked back and wondered why I was saved when there were so many others who were better than I who were not saved. I was ignorant and did not know why it happened. I could only say that my salvation was predestinated by God.<p>No matter who we are, as long as we believe, we will be saved. This is the word for unbelievers. For the believers the word is God’s selection and God’s predestination. It is a big mistake to speak a word to unbelievers which is meant for believers. The Lord told His disciples, “You did not choose Me, but I chose you” (John 15:16). We cannot say this to the unbelievers.<p>Once a student of theology went to a servant of God and asked, “The Bible says God predestinated man to salvation. But when I preach, sometimes I look into someone’s face and wonder, ‘What if God has not predestinated this one to be saved and yet I convince him to be saved?’” The servant of God replied, “Just keep on preaching. If you are able to persuade him to be saved, he must have been predestinated by God.”<p>We should realize that God tells believers that their salvation is predestinated in order to create a thankful heart in them. When I realize that, even though there are still many unbelievers, I am saved, I can only say that God has chosen me from among the millions. Hallelujah! I am saved not because of my own merit but because God has saved me. All I can do is thank Him!<p>Revelation 22:17 is spoken to unbelievers, and John 1:12-13 is spoken to believers. Our salvation is altogether God’s doing and not our own working. In this way the truth is balanced.
