   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE LIFE AS SEEN IN GENESIS 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 1:1-31 THE EARTH BECOMING WASTE AND VOID</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 1, strictly speaking, is not a record of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is an improper concept.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Genesis 1 is a record of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was young, I was taught that verse 1 was the subject of this entire chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But verse 2 begins with the conjunction "and."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This conjunction proves that verse 1 is not the subject, but just the beginning of the record.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 1 says, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 2 continues, "And the earth became waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And the Spirit of God brooded over the face of the waters" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Hebrew word for "became" is the same word used in Genesis 19:26, which says that Lot's wife became a pillar of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lot's wife was a woman, but she became something else.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The earth was originally created by God in a good form, but it became without form; it became waste and void.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Isaiah 45:18 tells us that God did not create the earth "in vain."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Hebrew word for "in vain" is the same word for "waste" in Genesis 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God did not create the earth a waste, but it became waste.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was due to the rebellion of Satan, which is recorded in Isaiah 14 vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>9-14 and Ezekiel 28 vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>12-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Due to Satan's rebellion, the whole universe was judged by God, and through that judgment the earth became waste and void.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Genesis 1:2 there are four words describing the desolation of the earth under God's judgment: waste, void, darkness, and deep.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The earth became waste and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the surface of the earth was the deep, and on the face of the deep was darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This tells us that there was no life but death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The earth becoming waste and void with darkness on the face of the deep is a picture of death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE BROODING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With this background of death, the Scripture continues, "And the Spirit of God brooded over the face of the waters."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word for brood is the same word as "flutters" in Deuteronomy 32:11.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This verse says that God is like an eagle who spreads her wings and flutters over her young.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit of God was brooding, stretching out His wings, over the death situation for the purpose of producing life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The brooding of a hen over eggs is to produce some living things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Bible the Spirit of God is first mentioned as the brooding Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This brooding of the Spirit indicates that Genesis 1 is not merely a record of God's creation but a record of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit of God was brooding over the death waters for the producing of life.</S>
