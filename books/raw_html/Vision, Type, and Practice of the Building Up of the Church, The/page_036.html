        <h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF THE BOARDS</h2>
<p>Each board was built with two tenons that were inserted into two sockets of silver (36:22, 24). A board needed two tenons in order to stand firm, just as a person needs two feet to stand firm. The two tenons signify testimony, that is, of not being alone. This means that we cannot do anything by ourselves. We cannot even stand by ourselves; other saints must stand with us as our confirmation. A brother may have the feeling to work in a certain place. But if no one confirms his desire, he has only one tenon, and his stand is not firm. When the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples, He sent them two by two (Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1). This is the principle of testimony in mutuality. Hence, each board having two tenons indicates that no one can be alone.</p>
<p>As boards of wood being overlaid with gold, we must learn to always have two tenons. For example, although we express our opinions, we still need to ask the saints to express their views. After the brothers speak in the coordination meeting of the church, the sisters also need to speak, and then the brothers should speak again. If only the brothers speak or only the sisters voice their opinions, there will be problems, and the church will be weak. A brother who always insists on his view cannot be built. Although such a brother may know Christ as life and as light and may be accepted by God, he will be a lone individual who cannot be built with others because he is just one tenon.</p>
<p>The boards were united by bars that passed through the rings of gold (Exo. 26:26-29). This refers to the oneness of the Spirit, the uniting of the Holy Spirit. In Genesis 24 the first item of gold that Abraham&rsquo;s servant gave Rebekah was a golden ring (vv. 22, 47). The golden ring typifies the Holy Spirit that God gave us as a pledge, a guarantee, upon our salvation (Eph. 1:14). This golden ring and the rings of gold on the boards refer to the same thing. As boards, we rely on the pledging Spirit to be joined with other believers. This is the significance of the bars passing through the rings of gold on the boards. We need rings of gold in order to be joined with the brothers and sisters around us. If we all have rings of gold, we will be built up together, and the church will be one. Then God&rsquo;s dwelling place will be manifested.</p>
<p>May all God&rsquo;s children see these points. First, we need to know that Christ is in us to be our life. Second, we need to be mingled with God, to experience gold overlaying acacia wood, so that we may become boards for the building. Third, we cannot stand alone, having only one tenon; we must learn to have two tenons, that is, to have the confirmation of others. Fourth, we must learn to depend on the Holy Spirit whom God has given us as a pledge, as a guarantee, to be joined with the saints around us and built with them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BUILT ACCORDING TO<br />
THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>The picture of the tabernacle in the Old Testament is much clearer than the plain text of the New Testament. The serving ones must learn to experience everything in the tabernacle and live in this reality. If we have rich and thorough experiences of the tabernacle, we will be able to lead people according to what we have experienced. We will know their spiritual condition, and we will know how to do a building up work in them.</p>
<p>We cannot simply preach an objective gospel without touching people&rsquo;s actual condition if we want to lead them to salvation. We must be able to touch people&rsquo;s problems and help them step by step according to their situation. For example, if we meet a person who does not believe in God, we first need to deal with the existence of God. If we meet a person who believes that God exists but has not yet believed that Jesus is God the Savior, we need to deal with this and help him. If a person does not consider himself to be a sinner, we need to help him and give him a sense of his sin so that he is subdued to confess before God that he is a sinner. Those who do not know the cross need to see the work of redemption accomplished on the cross. Those who do not have living faith are not assured of their salvation, and they need help to hold firmly to God&rsquo;s Word. Preaching the gospel is not merely a matter of giving a message on the gospel but of touching people&rsquo;s condition and using specific steps to lead them to salvation.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to our building up of the church, that is, to bringing the saints into the practical building up. It is vain to merely talk about building up. We first must have the experiences portrayed in the tabernacle. Then when we contact the saints, we will touch their condition and render them practical help. For example, if there are brothers who have not adequately experienced the bronze altar, that is, do not have much experience of dealing with sin, we need to lead them to be judged and convicted in the light of the cross. A sister who has experienced the altar and the laver and knows what it means to be righteous and blameless before both God and men can still be self-righteous and complacent. This indicates that she does not know the inner life. Therefore, we need to lead her to know Christ as life and to have two tenons so that she may be joined with others through the gold rings. Only when we know where people are in their experience of the tabernacle can we render appropriate help for their building up.</p>
<p>We cannot give gospel messages without knowing how to lead people to salvation. In such a situation people can hear the gospel for years but never be saved. In the same principle, we cannot talk about building up without practically building up the believers. If we lack the practical building up, the saints will not know what building up is even after hearing many messages. I hope that the serving ones will learn the experiences typified by the tabernacle and also bring others into these experiences. If we would do this, we will know the situation of a saint as soon as we touch him, and we will be able to lead him to be built up.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
