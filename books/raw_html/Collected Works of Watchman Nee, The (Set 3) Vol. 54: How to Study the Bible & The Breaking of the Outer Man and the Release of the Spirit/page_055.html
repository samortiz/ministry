<p>Section Eight&mdash;The requirements for our calling:</p><ol class="decimal"><li>Remaining in it (1 Cor. 7:20, 24).</li><li>Walking according to it (1 Cor. 7:17).</li><li>Counted worthy of it (Eph. 4:1).</li><li>Counted worthy of the God who calls us (1 Thes. 2:12).</li><li>Being diligent (2 Pet. 1:10).</li></ol><p>Section Nine&mdash;The encouragement of our calling:</p><ol class="decimal"><li>Hope (Eph. 1:18; 4:4).</li><li>Reward (Phil. 3:14).</li></ol><p>Section Ten&mdash;The guarantee of our calling:</p><ol class="decimal"><li>God's nature&mdash;faithfulness (1 Cor. 1:9; 1 Thes. 5:24).</li><li>God's plan (Rom. 8:30).</li><li>God's grace (Rom. 11:29).</li></ol><p>All these verses contain the word calling. This brother compiled all these verses together and grouped them into ten sections. Once this is done, we have a clear picture of our calling. If we pick up several dozens of these terms, we will establish a foundation in the knowledge of the Bible for ourselves.</p><p>In reading Genesis we have to pay attention to the word generation. For example, 5:1 says, "This is the book of the generations of Adam." In reading Exodus we have to pay attention to the phrase the Lord commanded. In Leviticus we find the word holy being used frequently. In Psalms we find the expressions Thy word, the enemies, wait, and selah used quite frequently. In Proverbs we find the words wisdom, lies, evil, sloth, pride, heart, mouth, lips, and eyes used frequently. In Ecclesiastes we find the words vanity and under the sun used frequently. In Song of Songs we find the words love and myrrh used frequently. In Matthew we find the words righteousness and the kingdom of the heavens used frequently. Consider the word mountain; Matthew uses the word mountain at least eight times: 4:8; 5:1; 14:23; 15:29; 17:1; 24:3; 26:30; 28:16, and every time something significant happens. In Mark we find the word immediately. In Luke we find the words the Son of Man. In John we find the words sent, world, Father, and abide. In Acts we find the word spirit. In Romans we find the words death, faith, and righteousness. Galatians uses the word love sparingly and never speaks of holiness at all. Ephesians, however, uses the words love and holiness more frequently. We have to pay attention to all these facts and should not gloss over them. Sometimes the same word is used a few times within one portion or a few portions of the Word. For example, 1 Chronicles 16 and Psalm 71 use the word continually seven times: 1 Chronicles 16:6, 11, 37, 40; Psalm 71:3, 6, 14. Psalm 86 uses for eight times, Joshua 23 speaks of Jehovah your God thirteen times, and Ezra 7 speaks of seven things related to God (God's hand, God's law, God's house, God's will, the altar of God's house, ministers of God's house, and God's wisdom). Paul said whatever you do three times in his Epistles. "Whatever you do...do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus" (Col. 3:17). "Whatever you do, work from the soul as to the Lord" (3:23). "Whatever you do, do all to the glory of God" (1 Cor. 10:31). The Gospel of John together with John's Epistles speak of joy "being full" six times: John 3:29; 15:11; 16:24; 17:13; 1 John 1:4; 2 John 12. Paul's Epistles use thanks be to God five times: Romans 6:17; 7:25; 1 Corinthians 15:57; 2 Corinthians 2:14; 9:15. The words overcome in Revelation, precious in Peter's Epistles, and joy in Philippians all have very particular meanings and purposes in their usage. In reading the Bible, we have to dig out these particular words and organize them into an outline of doctrines. This will bring us great benefit.</p>
