<h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Hsu Jung-jieh</h2><p>I will set off tomorrow for Wei-Si. Today I received the tent. Thank the Lord for His grace! I will work first among the Yi tribes. I will also go to Sikang if the Lord opens the door. Everything is in the Lord's hands. When will Brother Nee arrive in Shanghai? I am always thinking of him. Give my regards and greetings to the co-workers and saints in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, May 10</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chang Kwang-rong</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Since the meetings at Bai-Sha, I stayed with Brother Hsu in Fan-Shan for a month. On April 26 we left Fan-Shan for Shi-Ping, and on May 5 we went to Yang-Fu-Ling. On the thirteenth we went to Jin-Shiang. The churches in Ping-Yang are growing more rapidly than in other places, and the work is plentiful. We wish some experienced co-worker sisters would take some young co-worker sisters along and come to help the sisters in Pin-Shun, Tai-Shun, and Fu-Ding. Ping-Yang and Tai-Shun are poor areas and have been more so recently because of the war. But thank the Lord that the poor are able to hear the gospel. Since meeting Brother Hsu in Hu-Shan, I have been working with him. More and more I have felt that it is better for two to work together than for one to work alone. The co-workers in Ping-Yang and Tai-Shun would like to have a meeting for co-workers after Brother Nee returns. It would be even better if Brother Nee could come for some meetings in Ping-Yang. Has Brother Nee arrived in Shanghai yet? Please give my greetings to the brothers.</p><p>Brother Chang Kwang-rong, May 30</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Brother Hsu has gone to Ba-Chao from Jin-Shiang. I am still staying in Jin-Shiang and learning to be with the Lord by myself. Please pray for us.</p><p>Brother Chang Kwang-rong, June 7</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chen Jai-seng</h2><p>Thank the Lord for leading me to go with Brothers Chai and Chen to north Fukien to learn to serve the Lord. Although the itinerary was tight, I received much help and teaching concerning the work. I intended to stay longer in north and west Fukien to be trained by the Lord in those places, but the Lord did not open the way circumstantially. I had to turn from Nan-Ping to Foochow and Chang-Loh with Brother Chai to visit the saints in those places. We met Brother Chen Ke-san again in Bai-Ya-Tan. After the prayer meeting we returned to Pu-Tien. The next day the road was destroyed, and the order for dispersal came. During the past month, although there have been bombings, the brothers and sisters in the Lord have been preserved in safety. We give thanks unceasingly for the Lord's grace!</p><p>Transportation is difficult, and it is difficult to work in the cities and towns. But thank the Lord that this enables us to be burdened for the souls in the villages and mountain regions. Otherwise, when would the people who are sitting in darkness receive the light, and when would the footsteps of the apostles accumulate dust from their places? We see the Lord's good will even in these circumstances. Praise the Lord! May the Lord empower me so that I will not become a lazy servant.</p><p>This is a time when the harvest is ripe and the workers are few. Yet the workers have been restricted by distance and language and are holding out in their different corners. The work has been like a pan of scattered sand! Lately, I have been deeply aware of the preciousness of working together and the importance of praying together. I also see the danger of acting independently and the evil of walking in an unrelated manner. The flesh is exposed as being more and more evil, and our spiritual life has become more and more hungry. One as immature as I am truly needs prayer from all sides. If Brother Nee has returned, please give my greetings to him.</p><p>Brother Chen Jai-seng, May 29</p>
