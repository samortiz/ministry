JEHOVAH'S JUDGMENT<br>ON THE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL</H2><P>In 9:8&#151;10:4 we see God's judgment on the kingdom of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. On Their Pride and Haughtiness</H2><P>God's judgment was on their pride and haughtiness (9:9-10). Ephraim (the kingdom of Israel) and the inhabitants of Samaria (the capital of Israel) said in their pride and haughtiness of heart, "The bricks have fallen, but we will build with cut stone;/The sycamores have been felled, but we will put cedars in their place" (v. 10). In their pride they said that they would build with something stronger than bricks and that they would replace the sycamores with cedars.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah's Judgment&#151;Exalting the Adversaries<br>and Goading On the Enemies</H2><P>Jehovah exalted the adversaries of Rezin against Israel and goaded Israel's enemies on (9:11). Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west devoured with an open mouth. But by all this Jehovah's anger was not turned; His hand was still outstretched (v. 12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. On Their Not Turning<br>to Jehovah nor Seeking Him</H2><P>Jehovah's judgment was on their not turning to Him nor seeking Him. Verse 13 says, "Yet the people do not turn to Him who strikes them,/Nor do they seek Jehovah of hosts."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Jehovah's Judgment&#151;<br>Cutting Off from Israel Head<br>and Tail and Those Who Mislead This People</H2><P>Jehovah cut off from Israel head (the elder and the highly regarded) and tail (the prophet and the teacher of falsehood) and those who mislead this people (vv. 14-16). Because of this the Lord would not rejoice in their young men and would not have compassion on their orphans and widows. All of them were profane and evildoers, and every mouth spoke foolishness. By all this Jehovah's anger was not turned; His hand was still outstretched (v. 17).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> </body></html>
