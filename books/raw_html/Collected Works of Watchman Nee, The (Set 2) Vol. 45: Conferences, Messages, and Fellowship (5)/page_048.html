<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">CONSECRATION LEADING TO<br />THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD'S WILL</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: Lord's Day morning, December 15, 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1-2</h1><p>Prayer: Lord, in the past You have not been able to gain much in us. May we gain something of You today so that You can gain something in us. We are poor, defiled, empty, and weak. We come to You with a sober heart, looking to You for Your mercy. Lord, be merciful to us, even today. In Your name we pray, amen.</p><p>Romans 12 shows us that God's compassions are the starting point of all spiritual things and God's will is the terminating point. We are saved through God's compassion, forgiven through God's compassion, and receive eternal life through God's compassion. God's compassion has put us in this way and leads us on in this way until in the end, we can prove God's will, that which is good, well pleasing, and perfect.</p><p>During the past few days, many people have asked how we can know God's will. Many people think that knowing His will is a matter of technique. They think that as long as they have the right technique, they can know God's will. But the knowledge of God's will is not a cheap thing. It is a very precious thing, and it demands a great price from those who want it. The more precious a thing is, the higher the price one has to pay in order to have it. Many of God's children ask, "How can I know God's will?", but they never ask, "What kind of person is qualified to know His will?"</p><p>Romans 12:1-2 speaks of three things: (1) consecration&mdash;presenting of oneself as a living sacrifice, (2) transformation by the renewing of the mind, and (3) knowledge of the will of God. This shows us that there are conditions to knowing God's will. I have a heavy word within my heart, which I will tell you if you allow me. There is no way I can help some people to know God's will; helping them to know God's will is like helping this table to know God's will. You can give a person a set of formulas for knowing God's will, but the man himself will still not know His will. You can explain the way to know God's will, but he will still not know it.</p><h2 class="head1">CONSECRATION</h2><p>First, we have to realize that God's will is not for an unconsecrated person. If a man has not seen God's goal and not realized that God's redemption is for the purpose of reaching His goal and if he continues to live for himself, he cannot know God's will.</p><p>In the Old Testament one could be either a priest or a sacrifice. He could not be a priest and a sacrifice at the same time. But in the New Testament, a man can be both a priest and sacrifice at the same time. You may ask, "What is a living sacrifice?" A living sacrifice means a person who is killed, laid on the altar, and burned to ashes. The most important issue for those who are serving the Lord is not how much they have done. That is not real service. The most important thing is being a living sacrifice. What a man does can never surpass what is laid on the altar. Even the most holy and acceptable service to God cannot surpass one's service on the altar. It is not a matter of our words, works, zeal, miracles, gifts, or even tears. It is a matter of the cross operating within us.</p><p>Friends, the day will come (I have said this many times) when God will break the backbone of your natural life. You may say, "I have heard this many times." However, it is not a question of how many times you have heard this, but of whether or not your backbone has been dealt with by God.</p><p>Many people realize that their self is a troublesome thing. Often when I pray with others or when I listen to others praying, they weep as they confess their destitution, defeat, flesh, and carnality. They tell the Lord that they want to be dealt with. But even though they pray this way, they are still not dealt with. I have seen people who are very cautious about themselves; they read the Bible and pray every day, and they make resolutions concerning this and that. But day after day they remain weak and defeated. Even the humility of some people is an ugly thing. The problem is they have never become a sacrifice. If I pluck off a few hairs from a bull or cut its skin a little, that is, if I deal with it a little here and a little there, I will only fill my neighbors' ears with the bull's cry. In reality this has no real effect. The whole bull must be offered on the altar, killed, and burned, before there can be a sacrifice. Our dealings before God must not be fragmentary; we are not here to deal with ancillary things. We are not here to deal with a little temper here, a little pride there, or a little something here and a little something there. These kind of dealings have no spiritual value. The important thing is having our backbones broken once and for all.</p><p>Romans 12 says that we have to present our whole body. It is not a question of how many times we have offered ourselves. This presenting is not a fragmentary offering where we offer a little here and a little there. This is a once and for all total offering, in which the whole person is laid on the altar. If a man is constituted with only that which is visible, he has nothing but outward, manufactured behavior. This is counterfeit spirituality, and there is no spiritual reality behind it at all. Some say that they are useless, but one cannot find others who have more self-esteem than these ones. Some speak in a humble way, but one cannot find others who have more pride than they. Brothers and sisters, have you experienced God's thorough dealing? This kind of thorough dealing can save God much trouble. Many people experience isolated dealings from the Lord, and these dealings make them prouder than they were before. But those who have gone through a fundamental dealing cannot be proud even when they want to. Only those who are willing to present their bodies as a living sacrifice to God are well pleasing to Him.</p><p>Many people are talking about their ministries, but no ministry can match the ministry of the cross. When we present ourselves to be a sacrifice, we are not offering ourselves to plow the field or to bear burdens, but to be a sacrifice, to be slain. An ox is a beast of burden or a beast for tilling. But after it is offered up and has become a sacrifice, its ministry is no longer the bearing of burdens or the plowing of fields. Its ministry is to be slaughtered. Real service is the service of sacrifice. The knowledge that we have of the cross cannot exceed the ministry of the cross in us. When the Lord was on earth, He served God with the cross. Humanly speaking, He did not do anything before the age of thirty. But remember: His public ministry began with His baptism. The cross is the starting point of our work. Everything that exists before the cross has no spiritual value. If a man has not experienced Golgotha, his life, work, spiritual pursuit, and progress are all works and things. Only that which has passed through the altar constitutes a sacrifice, and only that is well pleasing to God. A Christian must go through a basic dealing of the cross at least once. You can call it by whatever name you want, but every Christian needs a fresh start. How hard it is for one to drop his own will and stand for God's will!</p><p>Not long after I was saved, a sister said, "When you pray, you have to pray for what God wants, not for what you want." I answered, "If I do not ask for what I want, why do I need to pray at all?" Later, God dealt with me, and I became different. I was not as bothersome as before, asking God for this and that all the time.</p>
