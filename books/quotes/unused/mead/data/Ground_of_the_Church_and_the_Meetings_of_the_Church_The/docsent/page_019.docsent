   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORSHIP TO THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth main point concerning the Lord's table is the worship to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Holy Spirit always brings people to Christ, the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we are inspired by the Holy Spirit, we say, "Jesus is Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1 Cor 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the same way, the Son always brings people to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you have the Son, then you have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First John 2:23 says, "He who confesses the Son has the Father also."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The principle here is that when we are touched by the Holy Spirit, we realize something of Christ, the Son, and when we experience the Son, He brings us to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, after we have experienced the Lord at His table, we should not close the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the principle, when we have experienced the Son, He brings us to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not right to close the Lord's table meeting without coming to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hebrews 2:11b and 12 say, "He is not ashamed to call them brothers, saying, I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.'"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When does the Lord Jesus praise the Father in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It must be after the saints in the church have had the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After we have experienced the Lord, the Son brings us to the Father to praise the Father in the midst of His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matthew 26:30 tells us that after the Lord established His table, He came to the Father to contact the Father by singing a hymn with the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the principle to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever we enjoy the Lord, we have to be brought to the Father through the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why after we enjoy the table, we have to follow the Lord to worship the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first part of the table meeting is to remember the Lord by partaking of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After partaking of the Lord, then the second part of the meeting is a time to worship the Father, following the Lord as the firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are the many sons following Him to worship the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All these four main points are mostly neglected in today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Neither the Catholic Church nor the so-called reformed churches pay attention to these matters when they have the "holy communion."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are going to have the Lord's table, we must learn these four main items.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We come to the table to partake of something of the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we have to prepare our spirit, to cleanse ourselves, and to exercise the spirit to contact the Lord and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we learn the technique of how to sense the present atmosphere of the meeting and follow the flow in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we all act as one "team," we will enjoy the Lord adequately and properly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Out of this enjoyment in the spirit, we have the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then the Lord as the Son of the Father leads us to the Father, and we follow Him to worship the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this way we will have a full meeting in two parts for two purposes: to remember the Lord and partake of Him, and to worship and praise the Father.</S>
