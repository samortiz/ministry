   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although we have seen many things concerning the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, I have the burden in this message to help you realize that this Spirit has been wrought into us and that we have also been put into this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, I need to say a further word regarding God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>AND GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's economy, or dispensation, is absolutely not a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christianity has been utilized by the subtle one to the extent that it has become a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the human concept, religion is a good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Religion teaches people to worship God, to behave in a way that is pleasing to God, to do things for God, and to glorify God so that they may have a good future, and it encourages them to do all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Apparently, this is very good; actually, it is against God's economy in a subtle way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This kind of religion has been a thick veil covering God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today's Christianity is a heavy veil covering many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After reading the past seven messages on the life-giving Spirit, you can see the difference between the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What a difference there is!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit is genuine; religion is a counterfeit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit is the reality; religion is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>GOD PROCESSED IN HIS ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His economy God has processed Himself in order that He may become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word "processed" sounds strange to religious ears.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, in His economy God has processed Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One day the very God became incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although He was God, He came into man and became a man, He lived a human life on earth for thirty-three and a half years, and He passed through much suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, He was arrested, judged, and put to death by being crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was buried and remained in the grave for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then He came out of the grave in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Are not all these events part of a process?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yes, they are.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word process is not used in the Bible, but all these events are certainly part of a process.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our God has passed through a long, meaningful, and profitable process, beginning with the incarnation, continuing through human living and crucifixion, and concluding with resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today He is the One who has ascended to the heavens, having passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now, having passed through such a process, what He is, is different from what He was before the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before the incarnation, He was merely God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But after having passed through this long process, He is not only God, but God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In fact, He is a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>With this God-man there is incarnation, human living, the all-inclusive crucifixion, the resurrection, and the ascension.</S>
