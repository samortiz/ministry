   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HIS PREDESTINATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following His selection, God predestinated us Eph 1:5; Rom 8:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Darby s New Translation of the Bible translates this word predestinated in Ephesians 1:5 as marked out beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Have you ever realized that before the foundation of the world you were marked out?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You cannot escape God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have tried a number of times, but I never made it!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The more I tried, the stronger He grasped me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Where will you go to escape God?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Wherever you go, He is there Psa 139:7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes you may have been bored with coming to the church meetings and decided to go somewhere else.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you got there, the Lord Jesus was waiting for you!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows that you have been marked out.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>GOD S CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After God s good pleasure, after His plan arrangement, administration. economy . after His selection, and after His predestination, He came to His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The record of God s creation of man is very brief.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are only two verses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Genesis 1:26 is God s own word, and the following verse is Moses record.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In these two verses are three crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Council</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>of the Divine Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First, verse 26 indicates the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word Elohim God is plural, and in God s own conversation He uses the pronouns us and our : Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The pronouns referring to God are plural.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is easy to realize that this implies the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some teachers have pointed out that when God said, Let us make man..., it was a conversation in a council.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The divine Trinity had a council to consider the creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In creating other things there was no such conversation recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The making of man, then, must have been crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To create the heavens and the earth was not as important as the making of man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Man is the focus of God s purpose in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Creation of Man</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>in God s Image, after God s Likeness</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second, only man was made in the image of God and after God s likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The tiger was not made in God s image; nor was the elephant made after His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Genesis 1:26 says, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Image refers to the inward being; likeness refers to the outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may refer to Colossians 1:15, which speaks of Christ as the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How can an invisible God have an outward likeness?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I cannot explain this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is like John 1:14, which says that God as the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Genesis 18, however, He appeared to Abraham as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Abraham prepared water for Him to wash His feet and prepared a meal for Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>4-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He appeared again in Judges 13, this time to Samson s mother.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She saw this Man, who, after talking to her and her husband, ascended v. 20 . Here is an ascension before Acts 1! How can we reconcile these portions of the Old Testament with the New? We cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the same way it is a wonder, a mystery, that God created man in His image.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says we are being transformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Romans 12:2 says we are transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These verses indicate that the image is something inward, made up of the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The thinking organ, the loving organ, and the deciding organ comprise the inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Man is wonderfully made.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even after the fall, man is still marvelous Psa 139:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are marvelous beings because we were created by God in this way.</S>
