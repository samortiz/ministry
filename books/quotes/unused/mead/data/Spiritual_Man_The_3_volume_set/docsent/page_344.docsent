   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SICKNESS AND SELF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All of our bad and hostile environments expose our true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These environments will not bring out sins that we do not have.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They will only expose the true conditions within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sickness is one of these environments, and it makes us understand our own true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We never know how much we live for God and how much we live for self.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we become sick, especially during a long illness, we find this out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At other times, we can say that we are totally willing to obey God and that we are satisfied no matter how God treats us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, when we become sick, we find out whether or not our previous words were true.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What God wants to accomplish among His children is that they would consider His will as their satisfaction and take His ordained will as their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God does not want them to murmur against His will especially His arrangement on account of their own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He occasionally allows sicknesses to come upon His beloved children in order to see their attitude toward His ordained will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is most unfortunate when a believer who is under God's trial complains because of his own desires and questions why he has fallen into such a state.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He does not consider what God has given him as the best.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we say God gives sicknesses, we mean that God allows them to come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Satan is the one who causes sickness directly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the sickness comes to us through God's permission, and it comes with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The experience of Job is the best example.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His heart is filled with many hopes for an early recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, God has to prolong the period of sickness on his body because He will not remove His means until His goal is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's goal in communicating with the believers is for them to obey Him unconditionally, so that no matter how He treats them, they would obey willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is not pleased when He sees a believer praising Him during favorable times but murmuring against Him, doubting Him, or misunderstanding His works during troubled times.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God wants a believer to obey Him to the extent that he will not resist even if he is to be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God wants His children to realize that everything that befalls them is given by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regardless of how precarious the conditions of the body and environment are, they are all measured by His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everything that has to do with them is under His will; even the falling of a strand of hair is no exception.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a believer resists the things that come upon him, he inevitably resists the God who permits such things to come upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If he becomes bitter through the suffering of his illness, he will inevitably resist the God who permits such illness to come upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not a question of whether or not a believer should become sick, but whether he should resist God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God wants a believer to forget his sickness while he is sick and simply look to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the Lord wants you to be sick this way and continue to be sick in the future, are you willing to take it or not?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Can you obey His almighty hand and not resist?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Will you crave for health outside of His present will during your suffering?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Can you obey until He has accomplished all that He wants to accomplish and only then ask for healing according to His will?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you are disciplined, will you refrain from seeking after healing apart from Him?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At times of extreme suffering, will you try unwittingly to have what He will not give you?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All these questions should deeply pierce the heart of every sick believer.</S>
