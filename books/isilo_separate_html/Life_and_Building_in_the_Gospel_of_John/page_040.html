<p>Among Christians today, there is still a need for this revelation and light. Few have the realization that the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus on the cross does not emphasize delivering people from the lake of fire but taking away the barrier of sin between man and God. These two views are as far apart as the highest heaven and earth. The first view is not wrong, but it falls short of God&rsquo;s intention. First Peter 2:24 says, &ldquo;Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness.&rdquo; The work of the Lord on the cross does not emphasize delivering people from the lake of fire, but it emphasizes that believers, having died to sins, live to righteousness, which is to draw near to God. As the Lamb, the Lord came to take away the sin of the world, thus eliminating the barrier of sin and the distance between us and God so that we can be mingled with God. Peter does not say that God caused the Righteous to suffer on behalf of the unrighteous so that we could be rescued from the lake of fire. Rather, he says, &ldquo;That He might bring you to God&rdquo; (3:18). We absolutely believe that there is a lake of fire for God&rsquo;s judgment, but the Lord Jesus did not shed His blood on the cross merely to rescue people from the lake of fire. In Christianity today many equate redemption only with deliverance from the lake of fire. This thought is especially strong due to the influence of religious concepts.</p>
<p>The Lord died and resurrected and is now the Spirit in order to enter into man as life so that God and man and man and God can be mingled as one. Man has not merely passed out of death into life but even more is mingled with God. The Lord became a Lamb to eliminate the distance and barrier of sin between man and God; furthermore, He came with a dove so that man can enter into God and also God can enter into man and that man and God and God and man can be mingled as one.</p>
<p>I hope all God&rsquo;s children will truly see that we were saved when we believed in Jesus; however, our understanding of salvation should be based on God&rsquo;s revelation, not on our natural concepts. Salvation means nothing less than God entering into man and man entering into God because the barrier of sin has been taken away. This is God&rsquo;s salvation in the Bible.</p>
<p>If we believe that Jesus is a Savior who gives prosperity and peace, we will be disappointed. Many believers of the Lord do not have much outward peace. The apostle James was killed by the sword (Acts 12:2), John was exiled to the island of Patmos (Rev. 1:9), and Peter was nailed upside down on a cross. Saul persecuted Christians, but after he was saved, he too was put in chains, imprisoned, and eventually martyred for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. James, John, Peter, and Paul were all witnesses of the Lord. The word <em>witness</em> in the original Greek means &ldquo;martyr.&rdquo; To testify for the Lord Jesus is to be a martyr. Hence, receiving outward peace is not the purpose of believing in the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus came to be a Lamb to eliminate the barrier of sin between God and man; furthermore, He came as a dove to work God into man so that man would receive God and live in God. Since the world does not want God, it will oppose those who believe in the Lamb and receive the dove. If the world opposes such ones, where is there hope for outward peace? The only way that we can have peace and prosperity in the world is to compromise with the world and live in darkness. If we stand against the corrupted age, evil, and darkness and if we live for God and the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, it will not be easy for us to have outward peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>The Word became incarnated as a Lamb, and on the cross He eliminated the barrier of sin and the distance between us and God. In resurrection He became the Spirit as a dove to come upon and enter into us who believe in Him. He also brings us into Himself so that we and He, He and we, are mingled as one. Eventually, we will be mingled to such an extent that we do not know anything except God. We will have no expectations of peace and prosperity, nor will our expectations be limited to avoiding the lake of fire and going to heaven. We will know only one thing: God is mingled with us, and we are mingled with God. This will be our joy, peace, and prosperity. Our joy, peace, and prosperity will be God Himself. Some may have regarded John&rsquo;s exile to the island of Patmos as a great misfortune, but it was an honor to John. Some may have regarded Peter&rsquo;s upside-down death on a cross as a great suffering, but it was an unparalleled blessing to Peter. Some may have regarded Paul&rsquo;s imprisonment as a sad ending, but it was a supreme glory to Paul. Religious concepts differ greatly from God&rsquo;s revelation. What people regard as a treasure, Paul regarded as dung. What people regard as suffering, Paul regarded as joy.</p>
<p>Today we need to be like those who followed the Lord after Pentecost and who were delivered by God from their religious concepts. We must be more than nominal Christians, who attend meetings and pray occasionally but who are not much different inwardly from those in the world and those who are religious adherents filled with religious thoughts. Some people preach the gospel, saying, &ldquo;A noble person should not be without a religion. The most noble religion is Christianity. If you believe in Christianity, you will receive peace and prosperity.&rdquo; If a person becomes a &ldquo;believer&rdquo; because he is convinced by this kind of speaking, he will merely be a &ldquo;peace and prosperity believer,&rdquo; not a believer in Christ. Believers in Christ want only Christ. He is the Lamb with the dove. He takes away man&rsquo;s sin so that man can receive God. He causes God to enter into man and man to enter into God so that man and God can be mingled together as one. This is too glorious! In the universe nothing is more glorious than this. This is the Savior in whom Peter, John, James, and Paul believed, and this is the salvation that they received and enjoyed. Our Savior is the Lamb of God with the dove.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> </body></html>
