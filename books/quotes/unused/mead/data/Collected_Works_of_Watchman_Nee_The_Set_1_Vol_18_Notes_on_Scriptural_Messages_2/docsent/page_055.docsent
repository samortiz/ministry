   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WIDOW, THE WIFE, AND THE VIRGIN Issue No. 41 Scripture Reading: Luke 18:3; Rev 18:7; 17:1; Rom 7:2-4; 2 Cor 11:2-3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The verses today tell us that the church or Christians have three kinds of circumstances before God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before speaking about these three circumstances, I want to relate one thing first: there is a line from Genesis to Revelation of women being used by God to typify His children, His people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the verses which I have read today, God likens His children to women.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In one case He likens them to a widow; in another case He likens them to a wife; in the third case He likens them to a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every Christian who lives in the world is a widow, a wife, and also a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the world, there are great differences between a widow, wife, and virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet in the Bible, Luke says that a Christian takes the position of a widow 18:3 , Romans 7 says that a Christian takes the position of a wife vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2-4 , and 2 Corinthians 11 says that a Christian takes the position of a virgin vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every Christian is a widow towards the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the same time, he is a wife with respect to the enjoyment of the riches of Christ, and a virgin with respect to his restriction for the sake of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I. WIDOW</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"And there was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him, saying, Avenge me of my opponent" Luke 18:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"As much as she has glorified herself and lived luxuriously, as much torment and sorrow give to her; for she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and I am not a widow, and I shall by no means see sorrow" Rev 18:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits upon the many waters" Rev 17:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One thing that moves my heart very much is that on earth today, our heart is a widow's heart!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not love the world because the world is not attractive or because the Bible forbids us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not because the world and the lusts of it will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The world is lovely, and the things, objects, and people of the world are lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although the Bible has sixty-six books, only one book, Ecclesiastes, says that all things are vanity under the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A Christian does not love the world because the world is vain, but because our Lord was crucified in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consequently, our heart is a widow's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the one you love is in a certain place, the place becomes lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The place where he is becomes paradise to you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But since He is not here, our heart is a widow's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This world has become a void to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are not attracted by the world because the world is unattractive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is comfortable and pleasurable to dress and eat well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if our heart is drawn to the One we love, all these things will become nothing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since He is not here, our world has become bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a woman can still dress and eat well after her beloved husband passes away, those around her may criticize her, saying, "What kind of a heart does she have!"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Is it wrong for her to dress well and eat well?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not wrong, but since her husband is not here anymore, her heart should no longer care for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not that these things lose their taste in themselves, but they no longer have the same taste within her.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not that the world has become more unattractive, but that we do not have a heart to love it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Among the vast sea of humanity, I feel lonely because He is not here.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I am alone, my heart is on fire because I think of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I walk by the seashore, see the waves, and hear the sound of the tides, I do not feel lonely or isolated because He comforts me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brothers and sisters, there may be many things in the world which can attract you, but if the Lord fills your heart, all those things will be counted as nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When He was in the world, He was killed by men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He left only a cross and an empty grave.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our Lord has died; therefore, we are widows.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not that the world is evil or unattractive, but that He is not here.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brothers and sisters, we are truly widows in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our Lord is not on this earth anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a result, the world can no longer attract us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If there is a brother or a sister who feels no need for the Lord to satisfy their heart, I do not know what kind of heart they have.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Luke 18 the Lord says, "And there was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him, saying, Avenge me of my opponent."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our condition in this world is that of a widow, one who is being ridiculed and insulted by others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Revelation 18 Babylon typifies the fallen church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>She says in her heart, "I sit a queen, and I am not a widow, and I shall by no means see sorrow."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only fallen ones do not consider themselves as a widow.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever you become fallen, you will lose the characteristics of a widow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Oh, if we want to serve the Lord faithfully in this world, we have to be a widow with respect to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to maintain a widow's attitude toward the world daily.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once the disciples of John came to Jesus, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Matt 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Jesus said unto them, "The sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn as long as the Bridegroom is with them, can they?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But days will come when the Bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast" v. 15 . Oh, today He is no longer here.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the time for us to fast.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Are we fasting with respect to the world?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This earth is not our home; we have no happiness on this earth because He is not here.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today the bread of the Lord's table tells us that He is not here.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The cup also tells us that He is not here.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The bread tells us that He was killed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The cup tells us that His blood was shed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because He is not here, our heart is not here.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What can replace Him in our heart?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Nothing can replace Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We want to be free from the world because the One we love is not here, not because the world is unattractive.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>For where our treasure is, there our heart is.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Since my treasure is not here, my heart is not here.</S>
