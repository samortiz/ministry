   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Reigning as Kings by the Reigning</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Life of Christ to Conquer All Persons,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matters, and Things Contrary to God and</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Be the Overcomers of the Lord in This Age</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 5:17 and 21 say that we who have received the abundance of grace should reign in life through this abundance of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1938 I stayed in Peking for two months.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One day a sister came to me and said, "Brother Lee, my husband loves to watch movies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He often watches them until midnight, and he even wants me to accompany him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What do you say I should do?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I said, "You tell me, what do you do?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She said, "When he comes home knocking on the door, I do not open the door for him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When he knocks again, I still do not open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A long time later I open the door for him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once I open the door, I just walk away.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not pay attention to him."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then I said, "You are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When he wants to go to watch movies, you should take him there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you arrive at the entrance, you should say to him, Sorry, you know that because of the Lord I cannot go into the theater.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Please excuse me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Peace be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I will be waiting for you at home.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I will cook you the best refreshments.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you do not come home, I will not go to bed.'</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When he comes home, once you hear the sound of his footsteps, do not wait until he knocks; immediately open the door for him and present the refreshments for him to eat."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She went and did as I told her.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, her husband repented and believed in the Lord because of the way she treated him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This sister was reigning as a king in life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we live the God-man life, we can reign as kings by the reigning life of Christ to conquer all persons, matters, and things that are contrary to God and be the overcomers of the Lord in this age Rom 5:17, 21; Rev 2 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE THIRD ASPECT OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH A. The Universal Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Being the Universal House of God</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>and the Kingdom of God As Well</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Finally, we need to see the third aspect of the Lord's recovery, that is, the practice of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, the church as the universal Body of Christ is the universal house of God and also the kingdom of God Eph 1:23; 1 Tim 3:15-16; Matt 16:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These three the Body of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God are just one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Body of Christ is the house of God, and the house of God is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>B. Appearing in Various Cities as Local Churches, with One City Having Only One Church in Order to Keep the Oneness and Prevent Division</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The universal Body of Christ is the house of God, that is, the kingdom of God, appearing in various cities as local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible shows us that one city should have only one church for the sake of keeping the oneness and preventing division Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev 1:4, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Deuteronomy 12:5-18 clearly tells us that when the Israelites arrived in the good land, they could not choose a place of worship as they liked.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They needed to go to the place where God had placed His name, which was the place where God would build His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Israelites needed to worship God there.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Old Testament God chose Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, although the twelve tribes of Israel were scattered throughout the land of Israel, all their males had to go up to Jerusalem three times a year to worship God there.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No one dared to set up another worship center besides Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Later, Jeroboam rebelled.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He set up Dan in the north and Bethel as worship centers and thus was cursed and punished by God, with the result that all the kings of the kingdom of Israel were rejected by God and excluded from the record of 2 Chronicles.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today the practice of the church that God desires is the same as this in principle, that is, one city having only one church for the keeping of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One cannot say that he is not satisfied with the church in a certain locality and then start another meeting on the next street with a few of his more intimate brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because Christianity is not willing to be restricted by one city having only one church, today's situation has become confused and divided.</S>
