THE ENDING OF SAMUEL'S MINISTRY</H2><P>In chapter eight we see the ending of Samuel's ministry.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Making His Sons Judges over Israel</H2><P>Samuel made his sons judges over Israel (vv. 1-3). However, they did not follow in his ways (v. 3a) but went after unjust gain and took bribes and perverted justice (v. 3b). This was evil in the sight of God (Exo. 18:21; 23:8; Deut. 16:19) and contrary to their father's pure and just way in his whole life (1 Sam. 12:3-5). Hence, the sons of Samuel should not be considered judges among the people of Israel, and their father Samuel should be considered the last judge. Hence, Samuel terminated the judgeship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Giving the People of Israel<br>Cause to Ask Him to Appoint a King<br>to Judge Them like All the Nations</H2><P>The unjust ways of Samuel's sons gave the people of Israel cause to ask him to appoint a king to judge them like all the nations. The elders of the people said to him, "Behold, you are old, and your sons do not follow in your ways. Appoint now for us a king to judge us like all the nations" (8:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. By Asking Him to Appoint a King,<br>the People of Israel Displeasing Samuel</H2><P>By asking Samuel to appoint a king to judge them, the people of Israel displeased him and caused him to pray for them (v. 6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Samuel Not Liking to See God's Elect<br>Rejecting God as Their King</H2><P>Samuel did not like to see that God's elect would reject God as their King. From the first generation of the human race, man has been rejecting God as the King, the Head, and the Husband.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Samuel Not Wanting to See God's Elect<br>Following the Way of the Nations</H2><P>Samuel also did not want to see that God's elect would follow the way of the nations. Israel had been chosen by God to be a particular people on earth, and therefore they should have been absolutely different in every respect from the nations. Yet, they took the way of following the nations by rejecting God.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 & 2 Samuel &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
