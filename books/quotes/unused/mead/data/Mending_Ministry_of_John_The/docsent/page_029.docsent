   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING CHRIST BY FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We live Christ by fellowship; that is to say, we live Him by His moving in us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we were saved, we were alone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may have had lots of schoolmates and relatives, but we were actually by ourself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even after we were married and had our spouse with us, we were still by ourself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once we got saved, however, we were never again alone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now wherever we go and whatever we do, we have another Person with us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes we are pleased with Him and love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Other times we are annoyed with Him and secretly wish He would go away and leave us alone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are times when we want to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once in a while we like to go off by ourself and take a little break.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When it comes to other people, we can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This One, however, our Christ, we cannot escape from.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After we are saved, we may still want to go to a movie.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even if we do go, we do not go alone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ accompanies us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No Christian is single.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may not yet be married, but if we are saved, the Lord Jesus is always with us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is impossible to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ wants to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Formerly we were one person, but now we are two.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With one person there is no fellowship, but with two there is the possibility.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we want to live Christ, we must not do anything by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To do even the best thing by ourselves is to fail to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We live Him by fellowship, which includes mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are not single.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are two of us; between us there is a mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>NOT ACTING ALONE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I say that the way to live Christ is by fellowship, I am referring to this mutuality between Him and you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Never do anything by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you keep this one principle, it will be easy for you to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are about to talk with your wife, you must do so with another Person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brothers, let us all learn not to talk to our wives by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sisters, you must not go shopping by yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not write a check by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not talk to others by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do everything by fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Always have this other Person with you in whatever you do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then you will live Christ, not yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is especially important in your talk.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you want to pass on the news that a certain sister is pregnant?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You may find that before the words can leave your mouth, that other One will not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You do not realize how accustomed you are to doing things by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As soon as you meet someone you know, you begin to talk about who is about to get married or who is having what kind of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By whom?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Never.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is by you when you are living yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You would not think of stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You know this is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You need to realize that in the Lord's eyes to do things by yourself is ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It may not be sinful, but it is ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Always keep in mind that you have a Partner who is with you; in fact, He is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He says, "Abide in Me and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is your position and your status, but you neglect it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In your daily life, you would not tell lies, but it may not bother you to gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You may think of it as common to pass on information to others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You may look at such things in that way, but what does your Partner say</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You may be encouraged to love others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is right to have love for others, but you must check whether you love them by yourself or by fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not a matter of love or of hatred; it is a matter of living Christ or living yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Either you live, or Christ lives out of you.</S>
