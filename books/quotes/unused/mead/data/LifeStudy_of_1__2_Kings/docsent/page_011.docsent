   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My burden in these messages on 1 and 2 Kings is concerned not with the historical facts but with the intrinsic revelation in these books.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can know the historical facts simply by our reading.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, to know the intrinsic revelation conveyed and hidden in the holy Word, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation Eph 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need a spirit of revelation to see the intrinsic content of the holy Word and a spirit of wisdom to understand it, to interpret it, and even to present it to others.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the other hand, because I have seen the intrinsic revelation in the Scriptures, I feel sorry for Solomon, who eventually had a great failure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was a wise king, and the nations came to listen to his word of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The reign of Solomon was, therefore, a time of glory and splendor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But Solomon loved many foreign women; he had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, and he built worship places for them 1 Kings 11:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Such a thing, which is beyond our understanding, led to the loss of the good land.</S>
