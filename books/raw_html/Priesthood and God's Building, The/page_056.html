        <h2 class="head3">The Lord Being the Word of God</h2>
<p>We should also speak concerning the matter of knowing the Lord as the Word of God. John 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.&rdquo; Verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; Revelation 19:13 says, &ldquo;His name is called the Word of God.&rdquo; When the Lord is spoken of in this verse, He is also revealed as the One who is called Faithful and True, who is sitting on a white horse, and who judges and makes war in righteousness (v. 11). <em>Word</em> in verse 13 in the original language does not refer to ordinary words but to a longer portion, either spoken or written. He is the Word of God for explaining God.</p>
<p>The words of a person express the person. A person is defined and his thoughts are revealed through his words. If we meet a person who does not open his mouth to speak, it will not be possible to truly know him. We may have some thought concerning him based on his appearance, but this is not sufficient. All real knowledge of a person is based on his words. Once his words come forth, his person comes forth. Being the Word of God means that the Lord Jesus is God&rsquo;s expression and explanation. Conversely, we can say that the Lord Jesus is God expressed, God explained. The Word of God is God expressing Himself and explaining Himself. In other words, the expressed God, the explained God, the God who reveals Himself, is the Word.</p>
<p>John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; The Word of God is the expression of God; He is also God expressed. The Lord Jesus is the full expression of God. When God speaks to man, He speaks through the Son; hence, the Son is the Word of God. When God created the universe, He expressed Himself through the things that were created. This is the reason that all things came into being through the Word (v. 3). When God created the universe, He did so through the Son as the Word (Heb. 1:1-3). All these verses show that the Word is the expression of God, the explanation of God. The Lord Jesus is the Word of God; He is God expressed, God explained. One day the expressed God, the explained God, became flesh.</p>
<p>John 1:14 does not say that &ldquo;God became flesh&rdquo;; it says that &ldquo;the Word became flesh.&rdquo; God could become flesh only by being the expressed God, the explained God. If God were unwilling to express Himself, explain Himself, or manifest Himself, He could not have become flesh. God became flesh so that He could express and explain Himself to man. Hence, 1 Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit.&rdquo; <em>He who was manifested in the flesh</em> emphasizes manifestation, expression, and explanation. The Word becoming flesh refers to the fact that the God who speaks, the God who desires to express, declare, and explain Himself, has manifested Himself in the flesh.</p>
<p>God created the universe through the Word, revealed Himself through the spoken and written Word, and accomplished redemption through the incarnated Word. He will also carry out His judgment in the future through the Word. In these four stages&mdash;creation, revelation, redemption, and judgment&mdash;God does everything through the Word. Through creation God declared His eternal power and divine characteristics (Rom. 1:20), through revelation God explained Himself (Heb. 1:1-2; 2 Tim. 3:16), through incarnation and redemption He declared Himself even more, and through judgment in the future, He will further declare Himself in righteousness. Hence, whether in creation, revelation, redemption, or judgment, everything is done through the Word, the declared God. The Lord Jesus is God&rsquo;s explanation, God&rsquo;s declaration; He is the explained and declared God.</p>
<p>In spiritual matters, nothing can be done apart from the Lord as the Word or without words. Every time we speak concerning the Lord Jesus, preach the Lord Jesus, or supply others with the Lord Jesus, we must use words. Every time we give praise or thanksgiving, we must use words. Without words, God cannot be expressed. I rejoice that there are words in the universe and that God created man with the ability to speak. If God did not create man with the innate ability to speak and understand words, the universe would be a silent place, and we would not be able to understand God in His expression and explanation of Himself; neither would we be able to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire that we would speak shows His desire for us to be His children, and that we, like the Son, would be an expression and declaration of all that He is. If Adam had not fallen and, instead, would have partaken, along with his descendants, of the tree of life, what would be the content of our speaking? Surely the words that we would speak would be filled with Christ Himself. If human beings had not fallen and sin had not entered into man, we would have received the tree of life and would have been filled with God Himself. Then, every word we speak would be Christ. Christ is the real word. The more we love the Lord and the more we know Him, the more our words will be filled with the glorious Christ. He is the Word in eternity past, and His name will be the Word of God throughout eternity future. He is the Word that speaks God and expresses God, and when we speak Him, God is glorified.</p>
<p>The Lord is the Word of God, the declaration of God, and the declared God. Every time we preach the Lord Jesus, we are preaching the God who declared Himself, and every time we speak the Lord Jesus, we are speaking the God who has spoken forth Himself. If God were not the Word, we could not know Him. Although God is hidden and invisible, He is the Word, and He has been spoken of, declared, and expressed. The God who has been expressed is Christ. Romans 10:8-9 says, &ldquo;&lsquo;The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart,&rsquo; that is, the word of the faith which we proclaim, that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.&rdquo; If a person wants to be saved, he only needs to say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus.&rdquo; He does not need to ascend into heaven or descend into the abyss to look for the Lord. As soon as a person calls upon the Lord&rsquo;s name, He receives the Lord and is saved (vv. 6-7, 13).</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
