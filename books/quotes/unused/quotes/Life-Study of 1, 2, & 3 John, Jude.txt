It is important for us to realize that this is especially true of John's writings, writings that are concerned with divine things
The Gospel of John, the three Epistles of John, and the book of Revelation reveal matters that are beyond our ability to imagine
Many marvelous divine things have been concealed, but we may experience an unveiling and have these things revealed to us
Only in our regenerated spirit are we qualified to see a revelation of the mysterious things in the writings of John
Thank the Lord that we have a regenerated spirit, even a mingled spirit, our regenerated spirit mingled with the divine Spirit
When some hear about digesting God, they may be bothered and ask how it is possible for God to be digested by us
The revelation of the divine things in the writings of John is supplementary to the revelations of the other holy writings
The Gospel of John opens with the words, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
Do you know any books of ethics or philosophy that have such an expression as 'in the beginning was the Word'?
John says not only that the Word was in the beginning, but also that the Word was with God and that the Word was God
We know from John 1:14 that this One, who was the Word in the beginning, became flesh and tabernacled among us
We know from the book of Exodus that the tabernacle in the Old Testament, a type of Christ, was a mutual dwelling place for both God and man
When we put verse 14 together with verses 1 and 4, we have the Word, God, life, light, flesh, tabernacle, grace, reality , and glory
How can the wonderful God Himself become flesh, and how can the incarnated God, God in the flesh, be the tabernacle?
A writing such as this is not merely human, and it is not something religious, moral, ethical, or philosophical
Many readers of the New Testament love the Gospel of Luke because it has many parables and presents the cases of sinners who are saved
As the Gospel of John supplements the synoptic Gospels, so the Epistles of John supplement the other New Testament Epistles
His Gospel completes the Gospels, his Epistles complete the Epistles, and his Revelation completes the whole Bible
In these verses, John says that the apostles report eternal life to us so that we may have fellowship with them
According to the Scriptures, we can say that because we have been begotten of God, we are children of God with the divine life and nature
In the parable of the sower in Matthew 13 we see that the Lord Jesus came as a sower to sow Himself as the divine seed into the human heart
At present it is sufficient to see that everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world and the evil one does not touch him
In John's writings there is a word telling us that we have been begotten of God and that the Devil does not touch us
The Devil knows that his efforts will be in vain if he touches one who has been begotten of God and who is keeping himself
May we all see the marvelous revelation contained in these verses and be able to testify boldly concerning them
As we go on, we shall see that John's writings are mysterious to human understanding and all-inclusive concerning the Person of Christ
Matters such as the divine life and the divine fellowship , the anointing , and the divine birth certainly are mysterious
One heretical teaching was that Christ was God but not man, and another heresy was that Christ was man but not God
Because of such a situation, John was burdened to write concerning the Person of Christ in an all-inclusive way
The writings of John reveal that Christ is all-inclusive, that Jesus is the Christ, and that He is both God and man
We have pointed out that John was polemical against the heresies of the Gnostics, Cerinthians, and the Docetists
Such writings were needed not only for the first century but have also been needed throughout all the centuries
If we do not see the revelation of the divine things contained in Johns writings we cannot be complete mysterious allinclusive or polemical
If we see this revelation, we shall be mysterious, all-inclusive, and polemical, and we shall be inoculated against all heresies
He was with God, and He was God in eternity past , not only coexisting but also coinhering with the Father all the time
If the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are regarded as separate persons, how can the Third of the Godhead be the eyes of the Second?
Even though we should be polemical in our fight for the truth, we still need to speak with others in a proper way
Although we are of different races, colors, and nationalities, we enjoy the one fellowship in the manifested divine life
In chapter two of Revelation we see that we may eat of Christ as the tree of life in God's paradise and also as the hidden manna
The tree of life, the hidden manna, and the feasting with the Lord all indicate that Christ is our life supply
We in the churches are a lampstand constituted of the life supply of the Lord Jesus as the tree of life, the hidden manna, and the feast
Another mystery in the book of Revelation is that of Christ as the center of the universal administration of the Triune God
If we do not have this basic and central view, we may see many other things in the Epistles of John, but we shall nevertheless miss the mark
The apostle John uses the expression 'that which' to open his Epistle and unfold the mystery of the fellowship in the divine life
The fact that he does not use personal pronouns here in reference to the Lord implies that what he intends to unfold is mysterious
In his Gospel, as the consummation of the Gospels, the mysteries of the Person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ are unveiled
In the beginning traces back to eternity past before creation; from the beginning proceeds forward from the creation
In his Revelation he unveils the consummation of the eternal life as the believers' full enjoyment in eternity
The phrase 'from the beginning' is used twice in the Gospel of John, eight times in this Epistle, and two times in 2 John
John's writings are not mainly for study and understanding; they are primarily for the enjoyment of God's children
We should come to John's writings-to his Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation-regarding them as courses of a spiritual feast
The answer is that no other writings in the Bible emphasize the matter of eating as much as John's writings do
Through the redemption of Christ, the way to touch the tree of life, which is God Himself in Christ as life to man, has been opened again
According to these verses, the tree of life is the life supply available along the flow of the Spirit as the water of life
Those who wash their robes in the redeeming blood of Christ have the right to enjoy the tree of life as their portion
We need to come to John's writings for nourishment, that is, to eat and digest the spiritual food they contain
By looking at his face you will know that he has been eating nourishing food, for the food he eats causes him to have a healthy appearance
The concept of eating God, a divine thought, is absolutely according to the Bible, although religious people often miss it
When we eat God as life and digest Him, in our experience this life becomes the Word to define, explain, and express the very God we enjoy
These expressions indicate that the Word of life is not only mysterious, but is also tangible because of being incarnated
In his first Epistle John points out that the apostles heard the Word of life and then saw, beheld, and handled this Word
As we shall see in a forthcoming message, it is through fellowship that we enjoy the riches of the divine life
We have pointed out that the eternal life is eternal not only with respect to time, but also with respect to quality
Eternal life is neither temporary nor limited; rather it is everlasting with respect to time and unlimited with respect to space
It is an endless life being the eternal divine uncreated life and the resurrection life which has passed through the test of death and Hades
The eternal life which is the Son was not only with the Father, but was living and acting in union and communion with the Father in eternity
The apostles saw eternal life, the life that was manifested, and then testified and reported this life to the believers
In Titus 1:2 Paul speaks of 'the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal'
It must have been that in eternity past the Father promised the Son that He would give His eternal life to His believers
The eternal life that was released from within Christ through His death has been imparted into the believers through His resurrection
When some hear this, they may say, 'You ignore Bible doctrine and uplift calling on the Lord and eating the Word
They may not be short of doctrine or Bible knowledge but they are short of the calling on the name of the Lord and of the eating of the Word
If you are nourished through pray-reading the Word, the eternal life in you will reign as a king over negative things
Certain believers who have received eternal life enjoy it to some extent; however, they do not enjoy it to the proper extent
To miss the enjoyment of the divine life in the coming kingdom is to miss the enjoyment of eternal life during that dispensation
If we live this life according to the Lord's desire, we shall also enjoy the divine life in the coming age of the kingdom
In other words, if we would experience the divine life, we need to pay close attention to the fellowship of this life
By virtue of the eternal life, the apostles have enjoyed fellowship with the Father and with His Son, the Lord Jesus
Because the divine life is organic, rich, moving, and active, it has a particular issue, a certain kind of outcome
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
When there is the proper contact, there will be a two-way traffic, and this traffic is fellowship, a common participation
Through the flow of electricity the lights are brought into a fellowship with one another for they are all in the one flow of electricity
As the electrical lights in the ceiling of a room have a current flowing within them, so we all have the divine current flowing within us
In 1:3 only the Father and the Son are mentioned, not the Spirit, because the Spirit is implied in the fellowship
In this Epistle joy is the third matter of major importance to be covered coming after the divine life and the fellowship of the divine life
In 15 John says And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all
In the preceding verses, the Father and Son are mentioned with clear words, and the Spirit is implied in the fellowship of the eternal life
God is mentioned for the first time in this Epistle, and He is mentioned as the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Spirit denotes the nature of God's Person; love, the nature of God's essence; and light, the nature of God's expression
When this divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when this divine light shines upon us, it becomes truth
In his Epistle it is we, the children, in the fellowship of the Father's life, coming to the Father to participate in His love and light
His entire Epistle discloses to us this one thing, that is, the enjoyment of the divine life by abiding in its fellowship
Now we go back to the Father and contact Him as the source of grace and truth, and this source is love and light
In the fellowship of the divine life, we are being brought back to God to enjoy love as the source of grace and light as the source of truth
When we are brought back to the Father we meet Him and enjoy Him as love which is the source of grace and light which is the source of truth
In the fellowship of the divine life we join with the apostles and the Triune God for the carrying out of God's purpose
John's word in 1:3 indicates the putting away of private interest and joining with others for a certain common purpose
Gods purpose is to have every child of His grow in the divine life and live a life of righteousness and love to overcome all negative things
Eventually, this testimony will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the complete and eternal expression of the Triune God
In the foregoing messages we have considered two mysteries-the mystery of the divine life and the mystery of the divine fellowship
For this reason, the apostle John does not pass over the conditions that must be fulfilled if we are to remain in the divine fellowship
As we shall see, there are two main conditions covered in 1:5-2:11: the confessing of sins and the loving of God and the brothers
Paul says that sin enters , reigns , lords it over people , works death in us , and is something that is quite alive
Some oppose us for teaching that sin dwells in our flesh and that this sin dwelling in us is something personified
The New Testament deals with the problem of sin by using both the word sin in the singular and the word sins in the plural
Sins' refer to the sinful deeds, the fruits of the indwelling sin, which are dealt with in the first section of Romans, 1:18 to 5:11
Such sin defiles our purged conscience and needs to be cleansed away by the blood of the Lord in our fellowship with God
Regarding this 2 Corinthians 521 says Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become Gods righteousness in Him
Romans 8:3 says, 'God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh'
As we consider these four verses, we realize that the Lord Jesus died on the cross to deal with sin, the very sin that dwells within us
As we have pointed out, we have not only the problem of sin in our flesh, but also the problem of the many sins we have committed
By these verses we see that when the Lord was on the cross, He not only dealt with our sin, but also bore our sins
Receiving the Lord Jesus as our Redeemer includes receiving Him as both the sin offering and the trespass offering
Now that we have believed in Christ, we have Him as the Redeemer, the One who is our sin offering and trespass offering
Those who teach this use certain verses in 1 John 3 and 5 as their basis: 'Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin
Those who follow the teaching of eradication say that these verses prove that sin has been rooted out of our being
The younger brothers were bothered by the fact that one who taught the eradication of sin could behave in such a way
Eventually, he came to the church meetings and was made clear about the mistaken teaching concerning the eradication of sin
Even though they sin only occasionally, not habitually, their sinning is an adequate proof that they still have sin working within them
John says that those who say that they do not have sin are deceiving themselves, are leading themselves astray
Even though we have been saved and regenerated and are under the transformation of the Holy Spirit, it is still possible for us to sin
In 1:6 John says, 'If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth'
The former is unconditional and has been settled once for all; however, the latter is conditional and may fluctuate
In 15 John says And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all
More than three hundred years ago, when the King James Version was translated, in English the word 'abide' did have the connotation of dwell
We have pointed out that Spirit is the nature of Gods Person love is the nature of Gods essence and light is the nature of Gods expression
When we follow this light, we shall by no means walk in darkness , which according to the context is the darkness of sin
When we walk and live in the light of God, we have jointly the co-enjoyment of the Triune God and the co-participation in His divine purpose
To walk habitually in the darkness is to live, behave, and have one's being in the nature of Satan's evil works
When we do not have the divine light but are rather in darkness, we have the sense that everything is vanity and emptiness
As we walk in the light, Christ, the Spirit, the church, the Body, and the members of the Body are all real to us
Although the elder had no intention of offending her, nonetheless something he said offended her because she is sensitive
If she stays in darkness, she will eventually find that Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life are no longer real to her in her experience
If we would be in the divine fellowship, we need to abide in God as light, and we need to walk in the divine light
You do not need to consider whether what an elder says is right or wrong, but consider whether you are in light or in darkness
Let us read all of 1:6: 'If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth'
As the divine truth is the expression of the divine light, so the satanic lie is the expression of the satanic darkness
There is no need for us to make up our minds to breathe or to try to energize ourselves to breathe, for breathing is natural and habitual
In a similar way, when we abide in God as light and when we walk in the divine light, we spontaneously practice the truth habitually
We have seen that the believers' relationship in life with God is unbreakable, but their fellowship with Him can be broken
Related to this first condition are the matters of abiding in God as light, walking in the divine light, and practicing the divine truth
When we walk in the light, which is God Himself, we have the co-enjoyment of the Triune God and the co-participation in His purpose
When we are in the divine fellowship, we are in the light, and when we are in the light, we are exposed by the light
As we walk in the light and practice the reality in the light, the light shines within us, upon us, and through us
It is when we are in the fellowship and under the light that we see our failures, mistakes, wrongdoings, impure motives, and evil intentions
The title 'Jesus His Son' is also used by John as an inoculation against the heresies concerning the Lord's Person
We have just pointed out that the name Jesus refers to the Lord's humanity and that the title 'His Son' denotes His divinity
The Lord's divinity indicated by the words 'His Son' is a guarantee, a surety, that the efficacy of the blood of Jesus will remain forever
The words 'the blood of Jesus' indicate that Jesus was a genuine man, and the words 'His Son' indicate that He is divine
As we confess our sins, spontaneously and continuously the blood of Jesus the Son of God will cleanse us from all sin
If we are exposed by the light and confess our sins, our sins will be washed away, and our broken fellowship with God will be restored
John says, 'If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth'
As the divine truth is the expression of the divine light, so the satanic lie is the expression of the satanic darkness
In Galatians 5:13 Paul says, 'For you were called to freedom, brothers; only do not turn the freedom into an occasion for the flesh
In Galatians 5:1 Paul says, 'For freedom Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore and do not be again entangled with a yoke of slavery'
According to John's word, if we say that we have fellowship with God and walk in darkness, we take the way of the Antinomians
The instant and constant cleansing of the blood is typified by the purification of the ashes of the heifer for a water of separation
The cleansing in 1:7 is not the eternal cleansing before God; rather, it is the continuous cleansing in our conscience
In our Life-study of 1 John we need to insert at this point, as a parenthesis, some messages on the divine light and the divine truth
In 15 John says And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all
As we have indicated, the divine light is the nature, the essence, of God's expression and the source of the divine truth
If you ask them concerning the meaning of light, truth, and life, they may answer that they do not know the meaning of these things
The divine light that issues in truth and shines in life is embodied in the Person of the Lord Jesus, who is God incarnate
If we would understand the meaning of truth in the Bible, we need to go beyond the traditional and common understanding of what truth is
When we read the word 'truth' or 'reality' in the New Testament, we need to realize that it refers first to God and also to Christ
In the New Testament, reality refers to the contents of our faith and to the contents of the entire New Testament
If we would know the actual situation concerning God and the universe, there is no need for us to guess or make inferences
We simply need to come to the Scriptures, for in the New Testament we have the truth concerning God, the universe, and man
In God's creation we can see certain aspects of the truth concerning God, man, and man's relationship with God
According to this concept, we should worship God not only in our spirit and with our spirit, but also worship Him in sincerity
When we enjoy God as our reality, this enjoyment will have a certain outcome, and this outcome is truth, reality
In typology the place chosen by God typifies the human spirit, where God's habitation is today , and the offerings typify Christ
The Lord Jesus answered, 'Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father'
The Lord went on to say that God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit, not in a certain place
The Lord also told the Samaritan woman that the true worshippers must worship the Father not only in spirit, but also in reality
For the proper worship of God they had to come to the place designated by God, and they had to bring their offerings
Proper worship in the Old Testament is a matter of coming to the right place-Mount Zion in Jerusalem-and with the right things-the offerings
After the offerings were presented to God, those who offered them could also enjoy them with God by eating a portion of them
Proper worship includes coming to the right place, presenting the offerings to God, and eating the offerings in the presence of God
After the offerings were offered to God at the place designated by God they were enjoyed by the offerers in the presence of God and with God
We should come to the meetings of the church in spirit and with the Christ whom we have been experiencing in our daily living
In the church meetings we should worship God in our spirit and with the very Christ whom we have experienced as the offerings
Suppose certain brothers in the church life are indifferent concerning Christ and idle with respect to the experience of Christ
Because they do not have any experience of Christ in their daily living, when they come to the church meetings, they come empty-handed
We have indicated that some Christians have been taught that to worship God in truth is to worship Him in sincerity
To interpret the word truth in John 4:23 and 24 as sincerity is to expound the Word of God in a way that is natural and religious
The Christ we have experienced is our sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering
Because you experience Christ in this way, You may come to the church meeting with Christ as your meal offering
The peace offering is based upon and constituted of the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, and the meal offering
If we experience Christ as these four offerings, certainly we shall enjoy Him as our peace with God and also as our peace with others
He will be able to testify that he has peace with God, with those in his family, with the Body, and even with everything in his environment
The reason for this anger is that we are lacking in the experience of Christ, and, as a result, we do not have Christ as our peace
We should also worship God with the very Christ whom we experience day by day, with the Christ who has become our personal reality
The Christ whom we experience daily becomes our personal virtue, with which we can offer God a pleasant, acceptable worship
After the divine virtue is experienced by us, it becomes our virtue, a virtue that is an issue of the divine reality
What is revealed in and conveyed by the Word is the content of our Christian belief and also the content of the New Testament
Through our experience of Christ this reality becomes our human reality, that is, it becomes our human virtue with which we worship God
All the different realities revealed in the New Testament are related either directly or indirectly to the unique reality-the Triune God
If several thousand saints can be trained with the truth, the prevailing truth will accomplish much for the Lord's purpose
With Romans 1:18-20 as the basis, we may say that truth denotes the reality concerning God, the universe, and man
In Romans 220 Paul goes on to say An instructor of the foolish a teacher of babes having the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law
The point concerning the truth we have considered in Romans 1 and 2 is very different from the meaning of truth in the Gospel of John
Whatever is revealed concerning God through creation is a truth, a reality, and we need to hold on to this truth
Let God be true and every man a liar, as it is written, That You should be justified in Your sayings and will overcome when You are judged'
In verses 5 and 6 Paul continues, 'But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say?
Of saying 'the truth of God,' Paul could have said, 'the faithfulness of God,' since truth here equals faithfulness
John 3:18 tells us to love in truth: 'Little children, let us not love in word nor in tongue, but in deed and truth'
With the help of the note on the word truth in 1 John 1:6, we can discern how this word is used in different verses
As we have pointed out, the Greek word for truth, aletheia, is used in the New Testament more than one hundred times
By studying this word in its context, we shall be helped to have a proper understanding of truth in the New Testament
Even though they sin only occasionally, not habitually, their sinning is an adequate proof that they still have sin working within them
The Greek words rendered 'we are deceiving ourselves' can also be translated 'we are leading ourselves astray'
It denotes especially our sinful condition after regeneration under the enlightenment of the divine light in our fellowship with God
Confession here denotes the confession of our sins, our failures, after regeneration, not the confession of our sins before regeneration
Such forgiveness of God for the restoration of our fellowship with Him is conditional and depends on our confession
In verse 8 John says that if we say that, after we have been regenerated, we no longer have indwelling sin, we are deceived
In verse 10 John tells us that if we say that, after we have been regenerated, we have not sinned, we make God a liar
These verses indicate clearly that after regeneration we still have indwelling sin, and it is still possible for us to sin
They were deceived in thinking that because they had experienced the baptism of the Spirit they no longer had sin dwelling within them
Even if you experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit and speak in tongues, the sinful nature is still within you
The sinful nature will remain in our flesh until the Lord Jesus comes back and by His divine power transfigures our fallen body
Some who teach perfectionism use the Lord's word in Matthew 5:48 about being perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect
It is not correct to teach that we Christians may have a so-called second blessing and thereafter become sinlessly perfect
The Lord's word in Matthew 5:48 about being perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect indicates that we can be perfect in this way
Some believers have either exaggerated their experience of perfection or have gone too far in describing what they experienced
Before the Lord Jesus comes back to transfigure our body, we cannot be permanently in a condition of sinless perfection
We need to admit that after regeneration we still have sin; that is, we still have indwelling sin in our sinful nature
In the gospel, which is the new covenant, God promises that He will forgive us our sins because of the redemption of Christ
Now whenever we confess our sins to God through the blood of the redemption of Christ on the cross, God must forgive us
Sins refer to offenses, and unrighteousness is the mark, the stain, on our behavior caused by the committing of an offense
In verse 6 he says, 'If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth'
In verse 8 he goes on to say, 'If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us'
God is faithful in His word to forgive our offenses, and He is righteous in His acts to cleanse away the stain of unrighteousness
You need to confess that you still have indwelling sin and that you still commit sins, even though you do not sin habitually
To make such a confession to the Lord is to offer Christ to God as your sin offering and as your trespass offering
We have the promise in 1:9 that if we do sin, we may be forgiven and cleansed, provided we make confession of our sin to God
By now we all should be clear that after regeneration we still have sin in our nature and that it is still possible for us to commit sin
Do not believe that because you have been regenerated you no longer have sin in your nature or that you can no longer sin
We have pointed out that we should not believe that we can be forever perfect before the Lord comes to transfigure our body
We need to be in fear and trembling and on the alert lest we be damaged through the sin that dwells in our flesh
These words and the words 'if anyone sins' in the following sentence indicate that the regenerated believers may still sin
Though they possess the divine life, it is still possible for them to sin if they do not live by the divine life and abide in its fellowship
In chapter one John shows us that we have received the divine life and that this life has brought us into the divine fellowship
We need to realize that we still have the problem of indwelling sin, and regarding this sin we need to be on the alert
We may say that in chapter one we have a warning, a reminder, and a charge concerning our need to be on the alert
We have received the divine life, and the divine life is now our enjoyment, issuing in the fellowship with the Triune God
If we do not realize that sin still dwells in our flesh but instead are deceived regarding this matter, we shall certainly sin
Because he did not want the believers to lose the enjoyment of the divine life, he told them in 2:1, 'I write to you that you may not sin'
In chapter one John speaks concerning the redeeming blood of Christ that constantly cleanses us as we walk in the light
We may say, therefore, that with electricity there are two ends: one end in the power plant and the other end in our homes
As the electricity flows from the power plant, where it is stored, to our homes, where it is applied, these two ends are connected
In the heavens we have the Lord Jesus Christ as our Comforter, and in our spirit we have the Spirit as another Comforter
For this reason, the Greek word parakletos is used for both the Comforter in the heavens and the Comforter in our spirit
Because the troubled disciples were in need of comfort, it is correct to render parakletos in John 14:26 as Comforter
According to the usage in ancient times, this Greek word may refer to a person who functions as an attorney, a legal advocate
The situation in 1 John 2:1 is different from that in John 14:16; it is a situation that requires an advocate or attorney
In his note he explains that the word patron is used in the sense of a Roman patron, who maintained the interest of his client in every way
When we are in a particular kind of situation, we may give the entire matter over into the hands of an attorney
It implies the thought of helping and nourishing, the thought of counseling, and also the thought of consoling
The answer to this question is that the 'case' of our sins after regeneration is a matter involving the Father and the family 'law court'
A child may have the mistaken idea that because his father loves him, he can do anything he wants at home with his family
On the one hand, the title Father is a sign of love; on the other hand, the title Advocate is a sign of righteousness
Please notice that John does not say that we have an Advocate with God, or that we have the Son with the Father
His righteous act on the cross fulfilled the righteous requirement of the righteous God for us and all sinners
Jesus Christ certainly is the One who is right, the right One, and only this right One can be our Advocate with the Father
In 22 John goes on to say And He is a propitiation concerning our sins and not concerning ours only but also concerning the whole world
In Hebrews 2:17 the Lord Jesus makes propitiation for our sins to reconcile us to God by satisfying God's righteous demands on us
The propitiatory or expiatory sacrifice, which foreshadowed Christ, satisfied all the requirements of God's righteousness and glory
The Lord Jesus Christ has offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins , not only for our redemption but also for God's satisfaction
John says in 2:2 that Christ is the propitiation not only concerning our sins, but also concerning the whole world
According to chapter one of this Epistle, we have received the divine life, and we are enjoying it in the fellowship of life
We were in need of the cleansing blood; therefore, He provided us with His own blood for redemption and cleansing
In the same principle, the divine life we have received through regeneration is our basic inheritance in God's salvation
In this fellowship we enjoy God, we enjoy the apostles, we enjoy the believers, and we enjoy the church and even the churches
All this enjoyment depends on the fellowship of the divine life, and this fellowship issues out of the divine life itself
We also lose the enjoyment of the apostles, the enjoyment of the believers, and the enjoyment of the church life
Unbelievers do not have God, and they have nothing to do with the enjoyment of the apostles, the believers, and the church life
When we enjoy the fellowship of the divine life, we enjoy God, we enjoy the apostles, we enjoy the believers, and we enjoy the churches
Whenever our fellowship is broken, we lose the enjoyment of God, the apostles, the believers, and the church life
Realizing the situation, the children should make confession to the Father, who is ready to forgive them and cleanse them
Suppose the children in a particular family offend the father, peace is lost, and now there is turmoil in that family
On the other hand, she may turn to her husband and say, 'Isn't it wonderful that the children have repented and have confessed to you'
As a result, the peace between the father and the children is restored through the mother's being the propitiation, the peacemaker
Day by day, we who have the divine life and the enjoyment of this life in fellowship need to be on the alert concerning sin
Through Christ as our Advocate and propitiation, we again have peace with the Father and we enjoy fellowship with Him
John says in 2:2, 'He is a propitiation concerning our sins, and not concerning ours only, but also concerning the whole world'
According to its biblical meaning, propitiation leads to enjoyment, for it ushers in fellowship between God and us
According to Paul's word in Romans 3:25, God has set forth Christ a propitiation-cover through faith in His blood
Christ as the propitiation place is the place where God and His redeemed people may converse, have fellowship, and enjoy one another
In the first section on the conditions of the divine fellowship , the problem that affects our fellowship is sin
In His faithfulness and righteousness, the Father will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from unrighteousness
As we consider this matter, we shall realize that this is not merely a doctrine but is something very experiential
From experience we know that when we confess our sins, we have the sense that the blood has cleansed us and that the Father has forgiven us
Dealing with sin is the first condition, the first requirement, of keeping ourselves in the fellowship of the divine life
If we say that we have known the Lord, yet we are not keeping His commandments, the truth is not in us, and we become a liar
These New Testament commandments are the commandments of the Lord Jesus given directly by Him or the commandments given through the apostles
If we say that we know the Lord experientially in the New Testament way, then we should keep the New Testament commandments
If we do not keep these commandments, this is a sign that actually we do not know Him, even though we say that we do
God's love is His inward essence, and the Lord's word supplies us with this divine essence with which we love the brothers
It is perfected and completed in its manifestation when we express it in our living by habitually loving one another with it
In our reading of verse 5 we may wonder whether the love of God here refers to God's love or to the love with which we love God
If we consider the Greek text and also take care of the context we shall realize that this expression in verse 5 denotes our love toward God
On the one hand, this is the love with which we love God; on the other hand, this love is produced by God's love, which is enjoyed by us
We have seen that this love is God's love enjoyed by us and also that it is the love produced in us with which we love God
We have pointed out that in verse 5 John speaks of the love of God being perfected in the one who keeps His word
Although we may have this love and may love God with this love, our love is still very limited and far from perfect
The love that is produced in us through our experience and enjoyment of God's love needs to grow, increase, and be perfected
Now we know that the love of God here refers to the divine love experienced by us and becoming our love for God
The love with which we love God, the love produced by our enjoyment of God's love, certainly needs to be perfected
We have seen that 2:1 and 2 are a conclusion to the word in 1:5-10 regarding our confession and God's forgiveness of our sins
The words 'in this' in the last sentence refer to the matter of keeping the Lord's word and having the love of God perfected in us
If we read the context of these verses, we shall realize that it is an important matter to have a sign indicating that we are in the Lord
When John speaks of knowing God , he speaks of knowing Him not doctrinally but experientially, by keeping His commandments
We should not merely know in a doctrinal way that God is almighty and that He created the heavens and the earth
Because God's holy nature does not allow you to participate in that form of entertainment, you refrain from doing so
They may tell you, for example, that there is nothing wrong with spending some time engaging in a certain kind of amusement
Because we have the Lord as our life and because we enjoy His nature, we also have the taste that comes with the divine nature
Because we know God subjectively, often we shall not have any desire to vindicate ourselves or argue in our own defense
It is in this way that we know God experientially, and this knowing is a strong sign that we are in Him and one with Him
We thank the Lord that those in the Lord's recovery do have the testimony in their daily life that they are in God
On the negative side, this requires that we deal with our sins; on the positive side, this requires that we keep His word
When we are abiding in the Lord, having fellowship with Him, our abiding in Him spontaneously issues in love for God and for the brothers
God's love is His inward essence, and the Lord's word supplies us with this divine essence, with which we love the brothers
One difference between God's love and our natural love is that it is very easy for our natural love to be offended
Because natural love may have such a result, those who are wise in a human way are slow and careful in loving others
Many divorces and separations are the result of a foolish natural love that is easily offended and leads to enmity
It is not very likely that you will regard as your enemy a person unknown to you that you see walking on the street
May we all see that we need to love God and others with the divine love that has become our experience and enjoyment
Far in these messages we have covered sixteen verses from 1 John, ten verses from chapter one and six verses from chapter two
Praise the Lord for the blood, the faithfulness of God, the righteousness of God, His forgiveness, and His cleansing!
In this message we shall consider 2711 the last portion of the first Epistle of John concerned with the conditions of the divine fellowship
We have pointed out that this phrase is used twice in the Gospel of John, eight times in this Epistle, and two times in 2 John
As long as that injunction is something uttered by the Lord something that proceeds out of His mouth it is a word that supplies us with life
It should refer to the fact that the old commandment of brotherly love is new in the believers' Christian walk
Many who read verses 7 and 8 are bothered by what John says concerning an old commandment and a new commandment
Is the new commandment a commandment other than the old commandment, or is it the old commandment becoming new?
If we read these verses carefully in context, we shall see that actually the old commandment and the new commandment are one
John indicates that the Lord's commandment, as His living word, shines as the dawning sun, and this shining swallows up darkness
The Lord's commandment, as His living word, always gives us a new beginning because His word shines anew and afresh again and again
Now we can understand why the apostle John says, 'I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment
In verse 9 John continues, 'He who says he is in the light and is hating his brother, is in the darkness until now'
In chapter 1 of this Epistle John speaks about light and darkness with respect to the first condition of the divine fellowship
In verse 10 John goes on to say, 'He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause of stumbling in him'
If we deal with sin by confessing it and experiencing God's forgiveness and cleansing, we shall be in the light
In order to confess our sins, we need to realize that we still have sin dwelling in our flesh and that it is always possible for us to sin
We have pointed out that the Lord's word is not merely a command or injunction; it is also a supply of life to us
His commandment is not merely an injunction requiring us to do something; it is also a word that always supplies whatever it demands
If we would fulfill the second condition of the divine fellowship-the requirement that we love God and the brothers-we must know God
On the negative side, we need to deal with sin; on the positive side, we need to exercise ourselves to love God and the brothers
If we want to maintain our fellowship with God, we need to deal with sin, and we need to love God and love the brothers
In verses 9 and 11 of chapter two John says that the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness
In verse 10 he says, 'He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause of stumbling in him'
In this fellowship we enjoy the riches of the divine life, but for what purpose do we enjoy these riches in this fellowship?
Whenever the New Testament speaks of the apostles, the church is implied, for the apostles represent the church
In 1:3 John says that the fellowship which the apostles have is the fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ
Only the Father and the Son are mentioned here, not the Spirit, because the Spirit is implied in the fellowship
The fact that the divine fellowship is also a fellowship of the Spirit means that this fellowship is carried out by the Spirit
The fellowship is not only carried out by the Spirit, but also that the Spirit is the fellowship that is carried out
As a result, when the switch is on, all the lights in the ceiling have 'fellowship' in the current, the flow, of electricity
The current of electricity is the fellowship of electricity, and this fellowship includes the power plant, the meeting hall, and the lights
The saints who attended that conference spoke different languages, and the hymns were sung in all the languages
We may say that the wires are the container of electricity and the means through which it is conveyed from the power plant into a building
Because the Lord's word is the channel that brings us the divine supply, we need to take His word into us in a living way
The divine supply that comes to us through the Word has a particular expression, and this expression is the divine light
Whenever we receive the Lord's word into us, the essence of the divine supply comes in with light as its expression
May we all have this love, the love of God, perfected in us so that we may maintain the divine fellowship for the church life
In this message we come to the second section and to the second basic matter-the teaching of the divine anointing
The anointing is the function of the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit, who is the processed Triune God
In that chapter we have a revelation of the compound ointment that was used to anoint the tabernacle and the priesthood
In keeping with this principle, the word 'anointing' used by John in chapter two refers to the ointment in Exodus 30
In the Life-study of Exodus, Messages 157-163, we considered the basic elements of the compound ointment and the measure of these elements
The ointment in Exodus 30 is a full type of the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit, who is the processed Triune God
If we do not have a spiritual and heavenly view of these verses, we shall not see that the Trinity is covered here
The teaching of the divine anointing concerns the Divine Trinity, but this teaching is according to our growth in life
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
We see that the mysterious book of Revelation opens with the Trinity, for in this book also the Trinity is the basic structure
If the Divine Trinity were removed from the Scriptures, there would not be any reality of the divine revelation in the Scriptures
To be a student is a matter of knowledge, and to be a follower is a matter of participating in a certain activity
In verse 12 John says, 'I write to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you because of His name'
If we believe in the name of the Lord and call on His name, the first blessing we receive is the forgiveness of sins
In verse 13 John goes on to say, 'I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning
Now we see that some of John's little children are fathers, others are young men, and others are young children
The One who is from the beginning is the eternal, preexisting Christ, who is the Word of life from the beginning
Rather, he says that they have known the One who is from the beginning; they have known Christ as the eternal, preexisting One
It was to the fathers that he ascribed the qualification of knowing through experience the One who is from the beginning
Just as a child of a human father knows his father, so the young children in the divine life know their Father
Although egrapsa, according to more recent manuscript discovery, is more authentic, grapho, which is taken by the King James Version and J
In the following verses, verses 14 through 27, he addresses each of the three classes again, but all in the aorist tense
In verse 14 John continues, 'I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning
It means that he repeats what he has written to them in the preceding verse to strengthen and develop what he has said
Many among us are strong young men who have overcome the evil one and who have the word of God abiding in them
We have seen that in 2:12-27 John writes concerning the Divine Trinity according to the believers' growth in life
He addresses all the believers as his little children, those whose sins have been forgiven because of the Lord's name
John's classification of the believers is according to their spiritual age, not according to any other criterion
The use of these terms indicates strongly that these verses in particular were written by the apostle John based upon the growth in life
If we are not in the line of life pursuing the growth in life, we shall not be able to understand anything concerning the Divine Trinity
When this is ministered to the seeking ones who are growing in life, they can understand what is ministered and are helped by it
They are very responsive when we speak concerning the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit, who is the processed Triune God
When we hear the heavenly melody regarding this wonderful Triune God, we rejoice, and we are very happy in the Lord
The word in 2:15-16, strictly speaking, is not to the fathers nor to the young children; it is a word given to the young men
For those who love material things according to their lustful desires, Satan will appear wearing the mask of the world
Whereas the young men in the divine life should overcome the world, the young children need to beware of antichrist
In Matthew 25:34; John 17:15; Acts 17:24; Ephesians 1:4; and Revelation 13:8, it denotes the material universe as a system created by God
In John 1:29; 3:16; and Romans 5:12, it denotes the fallen human race corrupted and usurped by Satan as components for his evil world system
As in John 15:19; 17:14; and James 4:4, it denotes an order, a set form, an orderly arrangement, hence, an ordered system , not the earth
Every thing, every one, and every matter have been systematized by the evil one, the adversary of God, and made a part of his world system
Since every thing, every one, and every matter have been systematized by Satan, we need to flee to the Triune God and His Word
We know from our experience that when the word of God abides in us and we stay in the Word as our refuge, we are protected from the evil one
Those in the world are unconscious of the fact that they are lying on the 'surgery table' of the evil one and that he is 'operating' on them
Because the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil has entered into the human race, our body became fallen and corrupted
We have seen that the vainglory of life is the empty pride, boast, confidence, assurance, and display of material things of the present life
We have seen that the world in 2:15 denotes an evil, satanic, anti-God system that is constituted of the things created by God
The problem is with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and, in particular, with the vainglory of the present life
The problem, therefore, is not with the car itself; the problem is with the lust of the eyes and the pride of life
The problem is not with the car they need; the problem is with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life
The problem is with the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life for these are the contents of Satans evil system
According to the Bible, the world is against the Father , the Devil is against the Son , and the flesh is against the Spirit
In verse 17 John goes on to say, 'And the world is passing away, and its lust, but he who practices the will of God abides forever'
As the world is against God the Father, so the things in the world , which are its lust, are against the will of God
According to John's word in verse 17, the world is passing away and its lust, but he who practices the will of God abides forever
In verses 18 through 27 John writes a much longer word to the young children in order to confirm what he has already written to them
On the positive side, this further word is concerned with the anointing; on the negative side, it is concerned with the antichrists
The words 'young children' here refer to the young children in verse 13 as the third class of the recipients of this Epistle
In verse 20 John speaks to the young children concerning the anointing: 'And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know'
John's word here also indicates that all the saints in the church life need to receive the teaching of the anointing
We have seen that the anointing is the moving of the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit, who is the processed Triune God
We also may say that the elements of the compound Spirit teach us the various matters concerning the Triune God and His activities
Only through the Triune God becoming the anointing Spirit can we be taught concerning the Triune God and His activities
All these elements have been compounded to become the compound Spirit whose anointing teaches us concerning the things of the Trinity
To baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit means to baptize them into the Person of the Triune God
Vincent says also, 'Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with Him'
Day by day, as we are in the organic union with the Triune God, we enjoy Him, we experience Him, and we live in Him, with Him, and by Him
We may use eating food as an illustration of learning the things of the Triune God in the way of enjoying and experiencing Him
Isaiah 9:6 says that a Son has been given to us, yet His name is called the everlasting Father, or the eternal Father, or Father of eternity
We need to be impressed with the fact that the anointing is the moving of the Triune God enjoyed and experienced by us
John's word concerning the anointing here was written to the young children, to those who are the youngest in the divine life
In these verses John seems to be saying, 'Do not listen to all these false teachings about the Person of Christ
Do not give heed to what the antichrists say, but listen to your experience of the Triune God's moving as the anointing within you'
In verse 21 John says I have not written to you because you do not know the truth but because you know it and because no lie is of the truth
If we consider verses 20 and 21 together, we shall realize that the anointing surely must have something to do with the truth
The anointing is the moving and working of the truth, which is the reality of the Divine Trinity, especially of the Person of Christ
We have the anointing, then the truth related to the anointing, and then the statement that Jesus is the Christ related to the truth
In these three verses we have four crucial matters: the anointing, the truth, Jesus being the Christ, and the Father and the Son
We are fighting for the genuine experience of Christ so that Christians may enjoy Christ in order to grow in life
From experience we know that to grow in life is to grow by the ingredients of what the Lord is as our nourishment
When the Lord Jesus said that he who eats Him will also live by Him, this implies both living by Him and growing by Him
Denying that Jesus is the Christ is the heresy of Cerinthus, a first century Syrian heresiarch of Jewish descent, educated at Alexandria
Since the Father and the Son are one with Christ and since Jesus and Christ are one, Jesus, Christ, the Father, and the Son are all one
We all have heard that Jesus is the Christ, but have you ever heard that, according to 2:22, Christ is both the Father and the Son?
We need to be impressed with the fact that here John says that to deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny the Father and the Son
If Christ were only the Son and not also the Father, how would denying Christ mean that we deny both the Father and the Son?
In verse 23 John continues, 'Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also'
Since the Son and the Father are one , to deny the Son is to be without the Father, and to confess the Son is to have the Father
To deny the Son here refers to the heresy that denies the deity of Christ, not confessing that the Man Jesus is God
Because the Father and the Son are one, we cannot separate the Son from the Father nor the Father from the Son
To deny the Son is to deny both the Son and the Father, and to confess the Son is to confess both the Son and the Father
That which you heard from the beginning' refers to the Word of life-the eternal life which the believers heard from the beginning
Not to deny but confess that the Man Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God is to let the Word of the eternal life abide in us
In so doing we abide both in the Son and in the Father, and we are not led astray by the heretical teachings concerning Christ's Person
In this eternal life we have fellowship with God and with one another , and in it we have our being in our daily walk
In 2:24 John refers to the Word of life abiding in us, and says that if the Word of life abides in us, we abide in the Son and in the Father
The Son did not do His own work and will, He did not speak His own word, He did not seek His own glory, and He did not express Himself
Rather, He always did the Father's work and will, spoke the Father's word, sought the Father's glory, and expressed the Father
The Son was one with the Father and could not be separated from the Father, neither could the Father be separated from the Son
The singular pronoun 'He,' referring to both the Son and the Father in the preceding verse, indicates that the Son and the Father are one
According to the context of verses 22 through 25, the eternal life is just Jesus, Christ, the Son, and the Father
The eternal life in verse 25 is the Word of life, and the Word of life is Jesus, Christ, the Father, and the Son
With these elements we have all the ingredients of the compound ointment divinity humanity incarnation crucifixion resurrection and life
To be in the Triune God is also to be in the divine compound, the compound ointment, which is the all-inclusive Spirit
There is still a distinction between the Three of the Godhead, a distinction between the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
Although there is no separation between Jesus and Christ, there is a distinction between these two titles Jesus and Christ
The title Christ denotes the Lord as God's anointed One and especially what He is in resurrection and ascension
Although this Person is inseparable, there is nevertheless a distinction between the two titles Jesus and Christ
Although the Son and the Father are one, we should not say that there is no distinction between the Father and the Son
We have seen from 2:20-27 that Jesus, Christ, the Father, the Son, the Word of life, and eternal life all are one
The truth of the Triune God is twofold; that is, it has two sides or two aspects, the aspect of one and the aspect of three
In order to be balanced we need to emphasize both aspects of the Trinity-the aspect of the three and the aspect of the one
The terms are not explanatory, but only approximately correct, as must necessarily be the case with any attempt to define the Nature of God
Some have used sunlight as an illustration: the sun is the Father, the ray is the Son, and the shining is the Spirit
Another illustration is that of ice, water, and vapor, with these three respectively representing the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Such illustrations may be used for temporary help; they should not be pressed too far or they will lead to error
Verses 23 and 24 say, 'Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also
These verses in 1 John mean that if we do not have the Son as the way, we shall not be able to reach the Father as the destination
According to verse 24, if we take the Son as the way to reach the Father, eventually we reach both the Son and the Father
It may sound logical to say that Christ as the Son is only the way for us to reach the Father as the destination
Here it says that if we take the way, we shall have not only the destination, but we shall have both the destination and the way
John indicates that we shall abide not only in the destination but also in the way, that is, both in the Son and in the Father
The Son is both the way and the destination, both the way to enter into the dwelling place and the dwelling place itself
If there were no distinction, there would be no need for John to say, 'abide both in the Son and in the Father'
Although there is a distinction between the Son and the Father, there is no separation, because the Father and the Son are one
According to verse 27, the anointing of the all-inclusive compound life-giving Spirit teaches us concerning all things
According to the context, 'all things' refers to all things concerning the Person of Christ related to the Divine Trinity
The teaching of the anointing concerning these things keeps us that we may abide in Him , that is, in the Son and in the Father
The anointing within us of the compound Spirit as the composition of the Triune God who is true , is a reality, not a falsehood
It is also to abide in the fellowship of the divine life and to walk in the divine light , that is, to abide in the divine light
We should practice this abiding according to the teaching of the all-inclusive anointing so that our fellowship with God may be maintained
We have seen that the teaching of the anointing concerning the Divine Trinity is according to the believers' growth in life
The Greek word for Christ is Christos, which means the anointed one, and the Greek word for anointing is chrisma
In 2 Corinthians 1:21 Paul says, 'But He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God'
Because we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are spontaneously anointed with Him by God
Through that anointing Christ has received the ointment, and eventually He, the anointed One, became the anointing One
Whenever someone denies that Jesus is the anointed One and thereby denies that He is the anointing One this person also denies the anointing
Now we need to see that to deny the anointing is to be anti-anointing, the accurate meaning of the title antichrist
God's intention is to work Himself into us as our life and our everything to make us His counterpart for the expression of Himself
In order to accomplish this it was necessary for God to pass through the process of incarnation human living crucifixion and resurrection
Today many have a religion with doctrines and regulations, but they neglect the inward teaching of the anointing of the all-inclusive Spirit
We may do this without having the effectiveness of Christ's death imparted into our being through the anointing Spirit
All that God is, all that God has, and all that God has attained and obtained, are included in the life-giving Spirit
We should have the subjective God, a God who is substantiated in our spirit through, by, in, and with the all-inclusive Spirit
We thank the Lord that, by His mercy, we are experiencing and enjoying the wonderful anointing of the all-inclusive Spirit within us
As such painted persons, we should go forth to paint others with the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit
John shows us that in the divine life there is the enjoyment of fellowship, and in this fellowship we enjoy the teaching of the anointing
John is saying that if the Son is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming
The word addressed to the three groups of recipients in 2:13-27 concludes in the charge to 'abide in Him' as the anointing has taught us
In verse 28 John says that if we abide in Him, 'we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming'
The second use of the word 'know' is a translation of the Greek word ginoskete, from ginosko, the outward objective knowledge
It is all due to the divine birth, which is indicated by the word 'has been begotten of Him' and the title 'children of God' in 3:1
John's writings on the mysteries of the eternal divine life place much emphasis on the divine birth , which is our regeneration
It is the greatest wonder in the entire universe that human beings could be begotten of God, and sinners could be made children of God!
Through such an amazing divine birth we have received the divine life, which is the eternal life , as the divine seed sown into our being
We have pointed out that certain pronouns used in these verses indicate that to abide in the Lord is actually to abide in the Triune God
In order for us to dwell in God, we need to realize that we have had a divine birth, that we have been born of God
We may say that this human life came from the sowing of a human seed, that the child's being came from a human seed
Eventually he will go back to standing on four feet and spontaneously live according to the dog nature within him
Because a dog has not had a human birth, he does not have the human life, the human seed, to enable him to abide in humanity
The more the paint is applied to the cloth, the more the cloth soaks the paint in until it is saturated with it
All these elements have been compounded into the all-inclusive Spirit, who is the divine paint with which we are being painted
Some regard the Spirit merely as a force; others claim that the Spirit is in the believers to represent the Father and the Son
In this kind of teaching concerning the Spirit there is no place for the elements that are included in the life-giving Spirit
According to this kind of understanding, at most the Spirit is merely a force or power or a representative of the Father and the Son
When this indwelling Spirit anoints us, He saturates our being with all the elements of the processed Triune God
Eventually, this food will cause an inner transformation, an organic, metabolic change, that will be expressed in a healthy complexion
Through this anointing the very fibers of our being will be saturated with all that the processed Triune God is
For a dog to try to stand upright on two legs and walk like a man would not be a practice but an attempt to act like a human being
As children of God, we practice righteousness spontaneously, habitually, automatically, continually, and without a purpose
Because He is righteous, we shall continually express the divine righteousness by practicing righteousness habitually and unintentionally
The divine birth brings us the divine seed, and through this seed we partake of the divine nature for our growth in the divine life
We can live a life that practices the divine righteousness, loves the brothers, and overcomes all negative things
We can practice the divine righteousness through the abiding in the divine fellowship according to the divine anointing
To practice the divine righteousness is to do righteousness habitually and unintentionally as our daily living
Of doing a particular act of righteousness for a certain purpose, we practice righteousness as our common daily life
As we have pointed out, this is not an act done for a purpose; it is the flow of life from within the divine nature of which we partake
John 3:1 says, 'See what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and we are
The love of God is manifested by sending His Son to die for us so that we may have His life and thus become His children
For the reason that we are the children of God by a mysterious birth with the divine life, the world does not know us
In 3:2 John goes on to say, 'Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we shall be
Although it has not been manifested what we shall be, we know that when the Son is manifested, we shall be like the Triune God
The hope spoken of here is the hope of being like the Lord, the hope of bearing the likeness of the Triune God
There Christ as the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world, the sin which came into the world through Adam
In verse 6 John continues, 'Everyone who abides in Him does not sin; everyone who sins has not seen Him nor known Him'
Not to have seen or known the Lord is not to have received any vision of Him or to have any realization of Him
In verse 7 John says Little children let no one lead you astray he who practices righteousness is righteous even as that One is righteous
To be righteous is to be pure, without any stain of sin, lawlessness, and unrighteousness, even as Christ is pure
In verse 8 John goes on to say, 'He who practices sin is of the Devil, because the Devil sins from the beginning
To not practice sin does not mean that we do not commit sin in occasional acts; it means that we do not live in sin
The reason a child of God does not practice sin is that 'His seed abides in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God'
If instead of living in the spirit we live in the flesh or do things according to the flesh, we are likely to commit sin
We have two natures within us: the fallen nature in the flesh and the new nature of the divine life in our spirit
If we are on the alert, fellowshipping with the Lord and living in our spirit by the divine life, we shall not sin
If we are careless and move and act in the flesh, there will be much opportunity for us to sin, because the sinful nature is still in us
Whether one is a child of God or a child of the Devil is manifested by what he practices, righteousness or sin
Both are their outward behavior, not their outward living, thus not manifesting what they are in their inward life and nature
If we would abide in the Triune God, we need to abide in Him according to the teaching of the divine anointing
Because many Christians do not care for the anointing, they do not remain in the fellowship of the divine life
As we take care of the inner anointing, the moving of the Triune God, we shall live habitually according to this righteous nature
With this message we come to the second portion of this section , a portion on the practice of the divine love
In order to practice the divine love as a virtue of the divine life, we need the divine life and the divine Spirit
In addition to the divine life that has been sown as the divine seed into our being, we also have the divine Spirit within our spirit
The divine life is the source, and the divine Spirit is the One who actually carries out the matter of loving others
In 3:10b John says, 'Everyone who does not practice righteousness is not out of God, and he who does not love his brother'
If someone does not have such a love, this is an evidence that he has neither the divine life nor the divine Spirit
In verse 11 John goes on to say, 'Because this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another'
Although these brothers were of the same parents, one of them became a child of God, and the other was a child of the Devil
The people of the world, like Cain, are the children of the Devil and the components of Satan's cosmic system, the world
If the people of the world, which lies in the evil one, the Devil , hate the believers , it is natural for them to do so
Death is of the Devil, God's enemy Satan, signified by the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which brings death
Death and life are not only of these two sources, Satan and God; they are also two essences, two elements, and two spheres
Not loving the brothers is evidence of not living by the essence and element of the divine life and not remaining in its sphere
After man was created, he was put before two trees: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
The second tree is related to death for in Genesis 2 Adam was told that if he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil he would die
To be regenerated actually means to receive the tree of life, from which mankind was cut off through Adam's fall
When Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, he received death into him and lost the opportunity to receive the tree of life
By repenting and believing, spontaneously we received the divine life into us, and at that very moment we passed out of death into life
If you consider your salvation experience, you will realize that when you were saved and regenerated, you passed out of death into life
You want to be right with your husband or wife, with your parents, with your children, with your relatives, neighbors, and colleagues
As those who have received the divine life with the divine nature a nature that is righteous we have the aspiration to be right in every way
Before they were saved, certain ones may have had the habit of kicking a chair or throwing something when they were angry
When such a person receives the divine life with the divine nature, he does not want to be unrighteous in any matter
Because we have received this life with the divine nature, automatically we aspire to be right with everyone and everything
We Christians, the children of God, have a life that aspires to live rightly with everyone and everything and also aspires to love others
To the divine attributes, hatred is versus love, death versus life, darkness versus light, and lie versus truth
In verse 15 murderer does not denote an actual murderer, but indicates that in spiritual ethics hating equals murdering
When John says that no murderer has eternal life in him, he is not speaking of saved persons but of unsaved ones, like Cain
After reading verse 15, some have questioned whether a believer can murder someone and still have eternal life abiding in him
Some have asked if it is possible for a real believer to murder someone and, if he did, would he still have eternal life abiding in him
It is possible for a child of God to hate someone occasionally, but no regenerated person should do this habitually
We should live this life, abide in this One, and maintain unbroken fellowship with Him according to the inner anointing
In the foregoing message we saw that death is of the Devil, the source of death, and that life is of God, the source of life
Not only are death and life of these two sources, Satan and God; they are also two essences, two elements, and two spheres
Rather, we would say that the drink is composed of three elements and that within these elements are three different essences or substances
The essence of life and the essence of righteousness are of one kind, and the essence of sin and the essence of death are a different kind
Having received the elements of life and righteousness, we are now enjoying and experiencing the essences of these elements
We may use a fountain to illustrate the difference between the source of life the essence of life the element of life and the sphere of life
We have the fountain as the source, the H2O as the essence, the water as the element, and the river as the sphere
Now we are living in the sphere of the divine life, possessing the element of the divine life, and enjoying the essence of the divine life
Although we have had all these aspects in our experience, we have been short of the knowledge to analyze them and the terms to describe them
Truth here denotes the genuineness, the sincerity, of God as a divine virtue becoming a human virtue as an issue of the divine reality
John says that we should not love the brothers merely in word or in tongue, not merely telling the saints that we love them
Of course, this kind of love in truth includes a love that supplies the needy ones with material things or money when necessary
In verse 18 truth denotes the human virtue of sincerity, a virtue that is the issue of the enjoyment of the Triune God as our reality
In verse 19 truth denotes the reality of eternal life, which is something higher, deeper, and richer than our sincerity
Even though we may have a right understanding of eternal life as something organic, our understanding of it may still be rather shallow
When many Christians talk about everlasting life they do not realize that eternal life is the result the issue the fruit of the divine birth
We have seen that in verse 19 truth, or reality, refers to the reality of the divine life which we received in our divine birth
Because we have received the divine life through the divine birth, we have the divine love with which to love the brothers
It will be a confirmation of the fact that we are in the reality of the divine life, which we have received through the divine birth
In verse 19 John says, 'In this we shall know that we are of the truth, and we shall persuade our heart before Him'
A heart disturbed by a conscience with offense frustrates our abiding in the Lord and breaks our fellowship with God
Otherwise, there will be turmoil within, for our heart will protest that we do not love according to the divine love
If we want our heart to be tranquil, we need to live by the divine life in relation to everyone and everything
Nehemiah 8:10 says, 'The joy of the Lord is your strength,' and Proverbs 17:22 says, 'A merry heart doeth good like a medicine'
The phrase 'before Him' points to a crucial matter-that our living as children of God, and also our heart, are before Him
In verse 20 John continues, 'Because if our heart blames us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things'
It is our conscience, which is a part not only of our spirit but also of our heart, that blames us or condemns us
If our conscience condemns us, surely God, who is greater than His representative and knows all things, will condemn us
The consciousness of such condemnation in our conscience alerts us to the danger of breaking our fellowship with God
We know from experience that many times we are arrested and taken to the law court, where we are judged and condemned
We must do something to conciliate the situation, to calm the turmoil in our heart, to cause our conscience to be at peace with God
In order for our heart to be quiet and calm in this way, we need to live, behave, and act in the divine reality
It means that we need to deal with our inward situation so that we may be willing to live by the divine life and in the divine reality
Some may speak about the almighty God who rules the universe, but here John speaks concerning the God who is in our heart
Not only is God infinite, unlimited, and beyond our ability to comprehend; He is also small enough to be in our heart
When God becomes our experience, He is not only the One on the throne who is universally vast, but He is the One in our heart
A brother may argue with God; he may think that it is not right for Him to trouble his conscience regarding a certain matter
We may have thought that we were right and that the other party was wrong, and that for this reason our conscience should not trouble us
We may have questioned why our conscience, the representative of God's government within us, would keep troubling us about that matter
Sometimes we may wonder why God, who has billions of matters to take care of, would be concerned with a small detail in our daily living
In verse 22 the keeping of the commandments is not the keeping of the commandments of the Mosaic law by our own endeavor and strength
All the commandments are summarized in two: one is to believe in the name of God's Son Jesus Christ, and the other is to love one another
Such an abiding and its bases-the divine birth and the divine life as the divine seed-are mysterious yet real in the Spirit
The second part of verse 24 says, 'And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us'
Far in this Epistle the Spirit has not been referred to, though the Spirit is anonymously implied in the anointing in 2:20 and 27
He is given without measure by the Christ who is above all, who inherits all, and who is to be increased universally
Whenever the New Testament mentions the Spirit, it refers to the all-inclusive compound, life-giving, indwelling Spirit
John 4:1-6 is a parenthetical section warning the believers to discern the spirits that they may recognize the false prophets
A number of professors and others in the universities had been influenced by modernistic teachings concerning Christ and the Bible
To love a person is one thing, but to receive one who is a false prophet or an antichrist is an altogether different thing
John realized that it was necessary for him, when speaking about loving the brothers, to say a word regarding false prophets and antichrists
Although we need to love the brothers and even all men, we should never receive a false prophet or an antichrist
In 42 John continues In this you know the Spirit of God every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is out of God
To confess Jesus coming in the flesh is to confess that He was divinely conceived to be born as the Son of God
In Matthew 24:23 and 24 the Lord Jesus says, 'Then if anyone says to you, Behold, here is the Christ, or, Here; do not believe it
For false Christs and false prophets shall arise and shall show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect'
John simply says that the believers heard that antichrist is coming and then goes on to say that many antichrists have come
In 2:22 John again speaks concerning the antichrist: 'Who is the liar if not he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ?
The liar, the false prophet, who denies that Jesus is the Christ, is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son
Docetism was a characteristic feature of the first antichristian errorists whom John had in view here and in 2 John 7
These deceivers are the liars, the false prophets, who deny that Jesus is God incarnate and in this way deny the deity of Christ
The first beast will be the last Caesar of the restored kingdom of the Roman Empire and the second beast the false prophet will work for him
If the 'beast coming up out of the earth' is the Antichrist, he is the same as the 'false prophet' of 16:13; 19:20; 20:10
It is clear, therefore, that Bible teachers have different interpretations in the matter of to whom the title 'antichrist' should be applied
Bible teachers often speak about the antichrist, giving the impression that antichrist is a proper noun referring only to one person
According to John's use of this term in 2:18, 22; 4:3; and 2 John 7, this is a general title, a title referring to a category of persons
The word antichrist is not capitalized in the King James Version, the American Standard Version, or in the New American Standard Version
Eventually, however, the false prophets and the false Christs are all anti-Christ, against Christ, and hence are all antichrists
In 2:22 we can see more clearly what the principle of antichrist is: 'Who is the liar if not he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ?
To deny any aspect of this truth is to deny something of what Christ is and thereby to follow the principle of antichrist
As we have seen, this was the heresy of Cerinthus, who separated the earthly man Jesus from the heavenly Christ
When the two sentences in verse 22 are put together, we can see clearly that to deny Christ is to deny the Father and the Son
Because Cerinthus denied that Jesus is the Christ and thereby denied the Father and the Son, he was an antichrist
Of course, whenever someone denies what Christ is, automatically that person will replace Christ with something else
They claim that Christ was persecuted for His teachings and was put to death because of His teachings and died on the cross as a martyr
Several years ago some opposing ones held a meeting to discuss how to deal with our so-called heretical teaching concerning the Triune God
By this we can see that regarding this matter they care more for tradition than for what the divine revelation actually says
According to the Scriptures, the Son is called the eternal Father, and Christ the Lord is the Spirit who gives life
In his message he strongly emphasized the point that we should not think that the Lord Jesus is separate from the Spirit
In that conversation Brother Nee said to me, 'Witness, we all must know that Christ is the Spirit, and this must be our message'
Concerning certain aspects of Christ's Person, many believers follow tradition and neglect the revelation of the Bible
To deny that Christ is the eternal Father or that He is the life-giving Spirit is to be anti these aspects of His Person
In this sense, to make such a denial is to follow the principle of antichrist, which is to deny something of what Christ is
According to Colossians 1:15, Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, and according to verse 18, He is the Firstborn from among the dead
The title 'Firstborn' is used twice in the same chapter, referring to Christ being the Firstborn in God's creation and also in resurrection
Traditional theology admits that Christ is first in resurrection, but not that Christ is first in God's creation
To say that Christ is not a creature is almost equal to saying that Christ did not come in the flesh, as is condemned in 1 John 4
According to their understanding, to say that Christ is a creature is to take away His deity and His status as the Creator, the almighty God
The heretical view of the Docetists was that Jesus Christ was not a real man, but simply appeared to be a man in the flesh
They deny that Christ is the Spirit, they deny that Christ is the Father, and they deny that Christ is the first among the creatures
If we understand what the principle of antichrist is, we shall realize that certain Bible teachers unconsciously follow this principle
According to the Epistles of 1 and 2 John, anyone who denies any item of Christ's Person is following the principle of antichrist
Our burden in the Lord's recovery is to minister the Triune God as life and everything to us so that we may enjoy all that He is
We have studied church history biographies and the most important writings of the great teachers from the early centuries until the present
We surely know where we are, and we have the assurance regarding the accuracy of whatever the Lord has led us to say in the ministry
Apart from being triune, that is, without being the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, God would not have a way to work Himself into us
God created man in His own image for the purpose of dispensing Himself into man so that man may become His expression
God's purpose in creating man was that man would be His container enjoying Him as life in order to express Him
Many Christians emphasize only that the Son came and neglect the fact that the Son came in the name of the Father and with the Father
In contrast to this natural, human concept, the New Testament reveals that when the Son came, He never left the Father
Of trying to analyze or systematize the Triune God, we should simply accept the facts as revealed in the Bible
These Christians have not been taught according to the Scriptures that when the Son of God came as a man, He came with the Father
Those under the influence of traditional theology may still think that when the Son of God came, He left the Father on the throne
He also told both the Jewish religionists and His disciples that He was not alone, for the Father was always with Him
Some have tried to explain Isaiah 9:6 by saying that the Son is only called the Father but actually is not the Father
The Son came with the Father and in the name of the Father; He also lived in the Father, and the Father lived in Him
The Son came with the Father, and the Spirit comes not only with the Son but as the reality of the Son with the Father
We need to be clear that the Son came with the Father and the Spirit came not only with the Son but as the reality of the Son
The Triune God dwells in us as the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit is the ointment moving within
We do not have merely one third of the Triune God; that is, we do not have the Holy Spirit apart from the Son and the Father
We should not have the concept that one third of the Triune God is in us and that the other two thirds are in the heavens
What we have been speaking in this message is the central view of the entire divine revelation according to the sixty-six books of the Bible
By the time of the Council of Nicea doctrine that seemed to be orthodox concerning the Triune God had been established
In addition, the Nicene Creed does not have a clear statement concerning Christ as the Firstborn of God's creation
Those who follow the creeds and traditional teaching may emphasize only that Jesus Christ is the Son of God incarnate
Because we minister the all-inclusiveness of Christ as revealed in the Bible, some falsely accuse us of teaching pantheism
We may say that we human beings are like transistor radios, and that the receiving apparatus is our human spirit
In our experience today, He is the Spirit as the reality of the Son with the Father to be our life for our enjoyment
Realizing that He is such a wonderful One, we do not care for dead doctrines, vain religion, or meaningless rituals
In verse 3 he says that every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not out of God, for this is the spirit of the antichrist
According to 4:2, the discernment of spirits is based upon whether or not a spirit confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
To confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh is to confess that He was divinely conceived to be born as the Son of God
If Christ had not become a genuine man, He could not have had human blood to shed for the redemption of human beings
The New Testament makes it emphatically clear that Christ's redemption was accomplished in His human body and by the shedding of His blood
According to the revelation of the Trinity in the New Testament, the Son came in the flesh with the Father and in the name of the Father
In verse 4 those who have been overcome are the false prophets , the antichrists , those who taught heresy concerning Christ's Person
Satan usurps fallen mankind as the evil spirit and operates in evil persons, who are the components of his world system
In verse 5 John goes on to say, 'They are out of the world; therefore they speak out of the world, and the world hears them'
In verse 6 John concludes, 'We are out of God: he who knows God hears us; he who is not out of God does not hear us
The apostles, the believers, and the truth which they believe and teach concerning Christ have their source in God; they are out of God
If someone replaces an aspect of Christ with something that is not of Christ, he is also practicing the principle of antichrist
Some teach that the One who dwells in us is only the Spirit, representing the Son and the Father, who are in the heavens
Although all this is correct, there is nothing here concerning the enjoyment and experience of the entire Triune God
What a great difference between this kind of love and the love that is simply a human attempt to imitate the love of God!
All the virtues in our human living should be Christ Himself as the embodiment of the Triune God expressed from within us
Can you see that the teaching to improve our behavior and character leads to a replacement of the living Christ who dwells within us?
We all need to apply this word to ourselves and be on the alert lest in any way we follow the principle of antichrist
In a practical way, we are against the anointing, anti the moving, working, and saturating of the Triune God within us
Whatever our race or culture may be we may replace Christ with our culture or with our way of having our daily life according to our culture
The divine fellowship is a matter of enjoying the Divine Trinity, for the divine life is actually the Triune God Himself
When we speak of the fellowship of the divine life, we actually mean the experience and enjoyment of the Triune God
The anointing is the moving, the working, of the Triune God in us to saturate us with Himself and make Him everything to us
On the other hand, this theology may make the Triune God mostly a doctrine that is not related to our daily Christian life
In 47 John says Beloved let us love one another because love is out of God and everyone who loves has been begotten of God and knows God
Through the divine birth we have received the divine life, which is the eternal life , as the divine seed sown into our being
Love as the nature of God's essence is the source of grace, and light as the nature of God's expression is the source of truth
When the divine love appears to us it becomes grace, and when the divine light shines upon us it becomes truth
The expression 'God is love,' like 'God is light' and 'God is Spirit' , is used in a predicative sense, not in a metaphoric sense
Spirit denotes the nature of God's Person; love, the nature of God's essence; and light, the nature of God's expression
We have seen that when the divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when the divine light shines upon us, it becomes truth
The Gospel of John reveals that the Lord Jesus has brought grace and truth to us so that we may have the divine life
In that God has sent His Son into the world that we might live through Him, the higher and nobler love of God was manifested to us
We have seen that in verse 9 John tells us that God sent His Son into the world that we might live through Him
In the love of God, the Son of God saves us not only from our sins by His blood , but also from our death by His life
In 4:10 John says, 'In this is love, not that we have loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son a propitiation concerning our sins'
If we consider these verses together, we shall see that God's sending His Son a propitiation concerning our sins is not the goal
Rather, this is a procedure for arriving at the goal, and the goal is that we may have life and live through the Son
John 4:12 says, 'No one has ever beheld God; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us'
To love one another is a condition of our abiding in God , and our abiding in God is a condition of His abiding in us
The love of God is perfected and completed in its manifestation when we express it in our living by habitually loving one another with it
The words 'in this' mean in the fact that God has given us of His Spirit we know that we abide in Him and He in us
The abiding Spirit, that is, the indwelling Spirit, is the element and sphere of the mutual abiding, the mutual indwelling, of us and God
To abide in God is to dwell in Him, remaining in our fellowship with Him, that we may experience and enjoy His abiding in us
It is all by the operation of the allinclusive compound Spirit who dwells in our spirit and who is the basic element of the divine anointing
Out of His Spirit' is an expression which implies that the Spirit of God, whom He has given to us, is bountiful and without measure
By such a bountiful immeasurable Spirit we know with full assurance that we are one with God and that we abide in Him and He in us
In 4:14 John continues, 'And we have beheld and testify that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world'
The Father's sending of the Son to be our Savior is an external act, that through our confessing of the Son He may abide in us and we in Him
We may have expected John to say that whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God has the forgiveness of sins, or has eternal life
In this message we shall consider 4:16-5:3, the last message on the virtues of the divine birth to practice the divine love
The fact that according to 4:16 we know and then believe indicates that first we experience and enjoy, and then we believe
If we do not have much experience and enjoyment of God's love, we shall not be able to believe this love very much
To abide in love is to live a life that loves others habitually with the love which is God Himself so that He may be expressed in us
If we love the brothers with God as love, we shall have boldness in the day when Christ judges His believers at His judgment seat
Fear does not refer to the fear of offending God and being judged by Him but to the fear that we have offended God and will be judged by Him
Love' refers to the perfected love mentioned in the preceding verse, the love of God with which we love others
God first loved us in that He has infused us with His love and generated within us the love with which we love Him and love the brothers
We do not hate the brothers but love them habitually, living the divine life in the divine light and the divine love
Whoever believes that the Man Jesus is the Christ, God incarnate, , has been begotten of God and has become a child of God
Such a one loves God the Father who has begotten him and also loves the brother who has been begotten of the same Father
In 5:1 we have an indication that brotherly love is actually a triangular love, that is, a love that involves three parties
In 5:2 John continues, 'In this we know that we love the children of God, whenever we love God and practice His commandments'
Verse 3 is the conclusion of this section For this is the love of God that we keep His commandments and His commandments are not burdensome
The Triune God as revealed in this Epistle is not only life, light, and love; He is also the all-inclusive Spirit
The anointing anoints us with the Father, the Son, the Spirit, incarnation, humanity, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
When we are anointed by the moving of the all-inclusive Spirit within us, we are anointed with all these elements
Whereas many Christians today emphasize objective doctrine, God's economy, His dispensation, emphasizes the anointing
Our teaching concerning the anointing may be different from traditional teaching, but it is definitely scriptural
Even if this teaching is different from the traditional teaching, it is not different from what is revealed in the Bible
Now that we have covered this Epistle from 1:1 to 5:3, we can see that what is revealed in this book is altogether related to the anointing
Through abiding in the divine fellowship according to the divine anointing, we have the practice of the divine righteousness
In order to practice the divine love, we need the divine life as the divine seed, and we also need the divine Spirit
In this message we shall begin to consider the virtues of the divine birth to overcome the world, death, sin, the Devil, and the idols
Our overcoming of these negative things is not by ourselves, by what we are, or by what we can do, but by the eternal life in the Son
Both John's Gospel and Epistle stress the divine birth , through which the divine life is imparted into the believers in Christ
Eventually, the time will come when our body will be transfigured by the power of the divine life into a glorious body
We all need to see that our spirit is mingled with the divine life and is the organ that can overcome the world
Our faith brings us into an organic union, and it is this organic union, not the faith directly, that overcomes the world
In 5:5 John continues, 'And who is he who overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God'?
Our believing that Jesus is the Son of God brings us into an organic union with the Son, who is the embodiment of the Triune God
By these three, God has testified that Jesus is His Son given to us so that in Him we may receive His eternal life by believing in His name
The Spirit, who is the truth, the reality , testifies that Jesus is the Son of God, in whom is the eternal life
Verses 7 and 8 say, 'Because there are three who testify, the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are for the one'
For the one' also means unto the one, that is, unto the one thing, the one point or purpose in their testimony
In verses 7 and 8 we are told clearly that there are three who testify, and that these three are the Spirit, the water, and the blood
Of course, He did not come as the water or as the blood, but eventually, in resurrection, He came as the Spirit
The phrase 'through water and blood' refers to the baptism at the beginning of His ministry and to crucifixion at the end of His ministry
The water of baptism terminates the old creation, and the blood shed on the cross redeems whatever God has chosen of the old creation
Through the water of His baptism, through the blood of His cross, and as the Spirit, Christ has been testified as the Son of God
He who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son'
In 5:11 and 12 John continues, 'And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son
The testimony of God is not only that Jesus is His Son, but also that He gives to us eternal life, which is in His Son
We shall live a life full of righteousness and love, a life that spontaneously overcomes the world, death, sin, the Devil, and idols
In 513 John says I write these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life to you who believe in the name of the Son of God
The written words of the Scriptures are the assurance to the believers who believe in the name of the Son of God that they have eternal life
Our believing to receive eternal life is the fact; the words of the Holy Writings are the assurance concerning this fact
We are assured and have the pledge by them that because we believe in the name of the Son of God we have eternal life
We not only have the fact of eternal life; we also have the pledge, the guarantee, the title deed, to prove that we have eternal life
Verse 14 says, 'And this is the boldness which we have toward Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us'
Without this word, we may think that 5:14-17 is a section separate from the foregoing section and having nothing to do with it
Eternal life not only takes care of our own need; it also takes care of the need of the fellow members around us
As long as there are problems in the church life, this is an indicator that there is death among those in the church
In verse 14 John says, 'This is the boldness which we have toward Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us'
His heart does not blame him, for while he is in the fellowship of the divine life, he has a conscience without offense
It is in this way that we know God's will: by being one with Him, by abiding in Him, and by remaining in the fellowship of the divine life
In 515 John goes on to say And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him
In both cases 'he' refers to the same person, that is, to the one who sees his brother sinning and who asks concerning him
To be one who can give life to others, we must abide in the divine life and walk, live, and have our being in the divine life
The vital point here is that if we would pray for a brother according to what is described in verse 16, we need to be one with the Lord
Undoubtedly, 'life' in verse 16 refers to spiritual life imparted into the one asked for through the prayer of the asker
Some say that it refers to the sin of the antichrists in denying that Jesus is the Christ , a sin which keeps them in death forever
In the fellowship of the divine life there is the governmental dealing of God according to the spiritual condition of each of His children
The situation is like that of Ananias and his wife Sapphira, who were dealt with by physical death because of their lying to the Holy Spirit
Rather, it is a dispensational dealing according to the divine government, which is related to our fellowship with God and with one another
Whether a sin is unto death or not depends on God's judgment according to each one's position and condition in the house of God
These verses indicate that if we see a brother sinning a sin not unto death, we should ask concerning that one and give life to him
If we do not know whether or not this sin is unto death, how shall we be able to make request concerning the situation?
In the fellowship of the divine life there is the governmental dealing of God according to the spiritual condition of each of His children
Whether a sin is unto death or not depends on God's judgment according to each one's position and condition in the house of God
Although we may be clear concerning this matter in principle how are we to discern whether or not a particular brother has sinned unto death
We should not think that a particular sin is serious and is unto death and that another sin is not serious and is not unto death
Moses was provoked, and as a result he did something that was not according to God's will: he struck the rock a second time
The case of Moses illustrates the fact that in ourselves we are not qualified or able to discern what kind of sin is unto death
What is described in 5:14-17 concerning the life-giving petition can be experienced only by those who are deep in the Lord
If we are deeply one with Him, we shall know His will, and we shall also know the situation of the one who is sinning
Because this one is our brother, someone very close to us in the Lord, we shall know his real situation before the Lord
The words 'his brother' point to a brother who is close to him, someone who is so close to him that he is a part of him
If we have entered into the Lord to such a degree spontaneously we shall know the Lords will concerning a brother close to us who has sinned
In these verses we see the need to live in the divine life to such an extent that we are absolutely one with the Lord
In chapter three John says that he who practices sin is of the Devil , and that everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin
Sin not only interrupts our fellowship and causes our conscience to have no peace; sin may even cause physical death
According to the human concept, it may seem insignificant to come to the Lord's table without discerning the Lord's body
It is extremely serious to come to the Lord's table with a divisive spirit and thereby fail to discern the body
If someone does not want to go along with the church, it is better for that one not to be involved with the church
Sin causes our fellowship to be broken, it causes us to have no peace in our conscience, and it may even cause the loss of physical life
Now we need to be careful about everything related to our daily living: eating, drinking, contacting people, spending money
In 5:14-17 there is the indication not only that we have eternal life and enjoy it, but also that we can minister this life to others
You should not try to know whether or not someone will be healed or whether or not a particular sin is unto death
From 5:14-17 we need to see that we have eternal life and that we may experience and enjoy this life and then minister it to others
Concerning these matters, we should not have mere knowledge; we need to touch the depth of the reality of these things in this Epistle
We have a thought that has not previously been introduced-the thought that regenerated persons can keep themselves from sinning
Some teachers say that 'he' in 5:18 refers to Christ, who was begotten of God and keeps the regenerated one, based upon John 17:15
A regenerated believer , keeps himself from living in sin, and the evil one does not touch him, especially his regenerated spirit
As we have indicated, some translators say that 'he' in 5:18 refers to the Lord Jesus and should be rendered 'He'
We are told that everyone who has been begotten of God does not sin, and then that he who is begotten of God keeps himself
In 5:18 'he' refers to a regenerated person, a person who has been begotten of God and who thereby keeps himself from sinning
The Greek word poneros means pernicious, harmfully evil, affecting and influencing others to be evil and vicious
The thought here is not that the evil one is not able to touch us; the thought is that the evil one does not touch us
John is saying that as long as we abide in our regenerated spirit, this spirit will keep us from sinning, and the evil one does not touch us
He knows that if he tries to touch us when we are abiding in our regenerated spirit, he will be wasting his time
The thought here is not that the evil one cannot touch us, but that he does not touch us when we are in spirit
When we stay in our regenerated spirit, Satan knows that there is no way for him to touch us, and he will not try to touch us
If we consider the entire Epistle we shall realize that the apostle John is trying to impress us with the fact that we have been born of God
As long as we stay in our regenerated spirit, we are in a refuge, a place of protection and safeguard, and the evil one does not touch us
Since we have been begotten of God, we are out of Him, out from Him, possessing His life and partaking of His nature
Whereas we are out of God, belong to God, and are one with God, the world lies in the evil one and belongs to the Devil
In 5:20 John says that the Son of God has given us an understanding so that we may know Him who is true, or know the true One
The Lord Jesus, the Son of God, has come and has given us an understanding that we might know the genuine and real God
Now we have an enlightened mind and a quickened spirit with the Spirit of reality, who reveals spiritual reality to us
Just as a child can know his father because he has the father's life, so we can know God because we have God's life
The Son of God has given us an understanding so that we may know-that is, experience, enjoy, and possess-this divine reality
Not only do we know the true One, and not only do we experience, enjoy, and possess Him as the reality, but we are in this reality
There is a question whether the phrase 'in His Son Jesus Christ' is in apposition to 'in Him who is true,' or is an adverbial phrase
If 'in His Son Jesus Christ' is an adverb, then this phrase indicates that we are in the true One by being in His Son Jesus Christ
If the latter phrase is in apposition to the former, the meaning is that to be in the true One is equal to being in His Son Jesus Christ
If 'in His Son Jesus Christ' is a modifier, the meaning is that we are in the true One by being in His Son Jesus Christ
If we consider this matter carefully, we shall see that in both ways of understanding these phrases, the meaning is actually the same
When we are in the true One and His Son Jesus Christ, the true One is called the true God, and His Son Jesus Christ is called eternal life
Because we are in Them, God and Jesus Christ are no longer objective to us, and in our experience They are no longer two
We know that we are in the true God and in eternal life because we are in the true One and in His Son Jesus Christ
Verse 20 indicates strongly that we are now experiencing the true God, and we are experiencing Him by being in Him
Due to our experience of God and Christ by being in God and in Christ, we can say that this is the true God and eternal life
In doctrine, there may be a distinction between God, Christ, and eternal life, but in our experience they are one
If we do not live in the true God and eternal life, then we shall have a substitute for the true God, and this substitute will be an idol
By these we have been born of God to be His children, possessing His divine life and partaking of His divine nature
To abide in the divine fellowship of the divine life, that is, to abide in the Lord , is to enjoy all His divine riches
The second is the world, which is composed of the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of this life
The last is idols, which are the heretical substitutes for the genuine God and the vain replacements of the real God
John speaks of heresy in verse 7: 'Because many deceivers went out into the world, who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh
Certain heretics denied that Jesus is the Christ , and others denied the Son, not confessing that Jesus is the Son of God
As in verse 9, the 'teaching' here is the teaching concerning the deity of Christ, especially regarding His incarnation by divine conception
In this Epistle John warns us not to receive anyone who denies the truth concerning Christ's deity and incarnation
The most preferable is that it refers to a Christian sister of some prominence in the church, as 'co-chosen' in 1 Peter 5:13 does
According to some accounts, she lived near Ephesus, and her sister lived in Ephesus, where the church was under John's care
In such truth, the apostle John, who lived in the divine reality of the Trinity, loved the one to whom he wrote
Simply speaking, the first usage of truth in verse 1 denotes sincerity, and John is speaking of loving in sincerity
The human virtue in which the apostle John loved the one who received this Epistle was the issue of the divine reality that he enjoyed
When we enjoy God as our reality, His divine virtue becomes our human virtue, and this human virtue is sincerity, faithfulness
When we love others with the love that issues from our enjoyment of God as love, our love will be in sincerity
As we consider what John means in verse 1 by loving in truth, we are reminded that it is not a superficial matter to know the Bible
Truth denotes the divine reality of the gospel, especially concerning the Person of Christ as revealed in John's Gospel and first Epistle
The second warns the faithful believers against receiving those who do not abide in this truth-in the teaching concerning Christ
Because of such an inoculating truth, he and all those who had known this truth loved those who were faithful to this truth
In verse 1 he tells us that he and all those who have known the truth love in truth the one to whom this Epistle was written
In verse 3 John says Grace mercy peace shall be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father in truth and love
As in 1 John 1:7, where John speaks of walking in the light, the word 'walk' means to live, behave, and have our being
In some instances this phrase is used in the absolute sense , but here in verses 5 and 6, as elsewhere , it is used in the relative sense
The commandment referred to in verses 5 and 6 is the commandment given by the Son that we should love one another
The Father commands us to walk in the truth to honor the Son, and the Son commands us to love one another to express Him
Verse 7 says, 'Because many deceivers went out into the world, who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh
To confess Jesus coming in the flesh is to confess that, as the Son of God, He was divinely conceived to be born in the flesh
In verse 7 John says that those who do not confess Jesus coming in the flesh are not only deceivers but also antichrists
In verse 8 John goes on to say Look to yourselves that you do not lose the things which we wrought but that you may receive a full reward
The apostle warns the believers to watch for themselves lest they be influenced by the heresies and lose the things of the truth
If we stay in the truth, we shall receive a full reward, a reward that is actually the enjoyment of the Father and the Son
The Cerinthian Gnostics, who boasted of their supposedly advanced thinking concerning the teaching of Christ, had such a practice
It is through the process of incarnation that God has been dispensed to us in the Son with the Father for our enjoyment and reality
We are thus redeemed and regenerated to be one with God organically so that we may partake of and enjoy Him in salvation and in life
Today's modernists, like the ancient Gnostics, do not have the Father and the Son, for they do not abide in the teaching of Christ
Some of the young people may have an opportunity to present to their parents this reality, which is a wonderful treasure
We shall not have any contact with him or share in his heresy, heresy that is blasphemous to God and contagious like leprosy
John says clearly that we should not receive an antichrist, a false prophet, into our house, and we should not even say to him, 'Rejoice'!
Of telling false prophets to rejoice, we should tell them to weep because they do not have the enjoyment of the Triune God
Even though the second Epistle of John is an Epistle about loving one another, here John prohibits us from sharing, participating, in heresy
We see this humanness in verse 12, where John expresses his hope for fellowship that He describes as mouth to mouth
If you review the messages given in the Life-study of 1 John, you will see that in those messages the divine reality is ministered to you
Because of the influence of traditional teaching, certain ones are not open to hear about the enjoyment of the Triune God
Some recite the Apostles' Creed in their services every week, yet they are not saved and do not have any experience of the Triune God
We thank the Lord for opening to us the Epistle of 1 John, a book that contains course after course for our spiritual nourishment
When John says that he loves in truth, he is saying that he loves in a sincerity that is the issue of the divine reality
After speaking concerning truth in verses 1 through 3, John goes on to tell us in verses 4 through 6 that we need to walk in truth and love
The soul is the mediating organ between the body and the spirit, possessing self-consciousness, that man may have his personality
When our soul is occupied and directed by the Spirit of God through our spirit to direct and use our body for God's purposes, it prospers
Christ the Son is the very God and also a real man, who has accomplished redemption and is now the Life-giver, the life-imparting Spirit
The truth concerning the Person of Christ should not only be our belief but should also be our living a living that testifies to our belief
In 2 John there is a negative attitude toward heresy and in 3 John, a positive attitude toward the work for the truth
Whether our attitude should be negative or positive depends on whether the particular situation is for the divine reality or against it
Using a phrase from John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, we may say that, as a whole, today's religion is a 'vanity fair'
We, however, need to be careful not to merely talk about truth, reality, without having the genuine experience of the divine reality
The Father in the Son became a man, who died on the cross to accomplish redemption and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit
They may believe many fundamental doctrines, but all these doctrines are merely objective and are used to form a religion
In God's redemption and salvation as typified by the history of Israel, we see the eating of the Passover lamb with the unleavened bread
Although certain Christians realize that manna is a type of Christ, they do not realize that the Lord Jesus is edible
In chapter six of the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus reveals that He is the bread of life and that we need to eat Him
The Lord Jesus established the table by taking bread, blessing it, passing it on to the disciples, and telling them to eat it
If we have only terms, then we are still in the realm of doctrine, although it may be doctrine of a higher standard and more complete truth
In order to experience and enjoy the Triune God in a practical way, we need to see that He is the Spirit dwelling in our regenerated spirit
Because those brothers were not acquainted with Gaius, the one who received this Epistle, they were strangers to him
In verse 8 John concludes, 'We therefore ought to support such, that we may become fellow workers in the truth'
If we support the traveling workers, we participate in the work and thereby become fellow workers in the truth
In the foregoing message we pointed out that the subject of this Epistle is encouragement to fellow workers in the truth
Verses 1 through 4 are the introduction and speak of loving in truth , prospering in all things and in health , and walking in truth
In 3 John 9-12 John gives two examples: the negative example of Diotrephes and the positive example of Demetrius
In verse 9 John says, 'I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us'
In 2 John 9 the Cerinthian Gnostics took the lead to advance in doctrine beyond the teaching concerning Christ
In 3 John 9 is one who was under the influence of Gnostic heretical doctrine, loving to be the first in the church
The problem of Gnostic doctrine was one of intellectual arrogance; the problem of loving to be first was one of self-exaltation in action
Today's modernists can be compared to the Cerinthians in their desire to have a higher, more advanced, philosophy
The desire to be above others and the desire to be first are both instances of pride and arrogance, and both were issues of heresy
Even the teaching of the Bible is utilized by the enemy to keep believers away from the proper enjoyment of the Triune God
The word poneros denotes something pernicious, harmfully evil, that affects and influences others to be evil and vicious
As we have pointed out, our enjoyment of God is our seeing of Him, and our experience of God is our knowing of Him
Demetrius, who may have been one of the traveling brothers working for the Lord , may have been also the bearer of this Epistle to Gaius
John's word indicates that Demetrius must have been a brother working among the churches, and thus was well known
In order to see that this underlying thought is in fact found in John's Epistles, let us review a number of points
The incarnation was not an act merely of the Son, not an act that had nothing to do with the Father or the Spirit
The truth in these Epistles implies divinity, humanity, incarnation, crucifixion, redemption, and resurrection
Anything that replaces this divine reality, is a substitute for it, is an idol, and we should garrison ourselves against it
James was one of the apostles and one of the elders in Jerusalem , reputed with Peter and John to be a pillar of the church
According to verse 1, this book is addressed to 'those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ'
The fact that mercy is mentioned instead of grace in this greeting may be due to the church's degradation and apostasy
The faith denotes the contents of the New Testament as our faith , in which we believe for our common salvation
Some Bible teachers speak of the dispensation of promise, the dispensation of law, and the dispensation of grace
In order to understand the truth in the New Testament, we need to see that God first gave a promise to Abraham
Because of the ignorance and unbelief of God's chosen people, it was necessary for God to give the law to the children of Israel
The law was given in the Old Testament, but what God gives in the New Testament is the faith that includes all the items of God's new will
That is not the correct understanding of what Jude means by contending for the faith once for all delivered to the saints
We thank the Lord that in this country today many fundamental Bible teachers are also fighting against heretical, modernistic teachings
The words 'this judgment' refer to the judgment of the creeping in unnoticed of the apostates, the judgment unfolded in the following verses
Jude speaks of ungodly men, who pervert the grace of God into licentiousness and deny our Master and Lord, Jesus Christ
The 'gloom' is the gloomy pits of Tartarus , and the judgment of the great day will probably be the final judgment of the great white throne
The phrase 'in like manner' means in the manner of committing fornication with strange flesh, as the fallen angels did
In verse 7 'other flesh' denotes flesh that is strange or different, and 'these' refers to the fornicating angels in the preceding verse
We need to learn from the books of Jude and 2 Peter to fear God and to be very careful concerning the Lord's Person and His redemptive work
Now in verses 8 through 19 he points out the evils of the apostates and their punishment under the Lord's judgment
Verse 8 says, 'Yet in like manner these dreamers also defile the flesh and despise lordship and revile dignities'
The apostates defile the flesh, despise lordship, and revile dignities because they do not care for God's government
They despise lordship; that is, they despise the lordship of Christ, which is the center of the divine government, dominion, and authority
Probably, in view of this, the Devil attempted to do something to his body, and the archangel argued with him concerning this
Jude points out that Michael did not bring a reviling judgment against the Devil, but said, 'The Lord rebuke you'
They do not exercise the deeper and higher knowledge of man with reason, including the consciousness of man's conscience
What they practice is the shallow and base instinctive understanding, like that of animals without human reason
Because they have gone in the way of Cain and poured themselves out in the error of Balaam for reward and perished in the rebellion of Korah
Those who follow the way of Cain are according to the flesh and envy God's true people because of their faithful testimony to God
We have pointed out that Cain rejected redemption by blood as required by God, and he was also envious of his brother, Abel
Balaam knew that what he taught was against God's truth and against His people, and he knowingly taught it for gain
He said that he could not teach this truth, because if he did so, his organization would lose financial support
If we dare not teach and preach the truth because we fear loss or because we desire financial gain, we are practicing the error of Balaam
The rebellion of Korah was a rebellion against God's deputy authority in His government and His word spoken by His deputy
The Greek word spiloi for 'spots' in 2 Peter 2:13 is very close to spilades; hence, some translations render this spots
The pleasure-seeking heretics pretend to be shepherds, but at the love feasts they only fed themselves, having no concern for others
They have died twice, not only outwardly in appearance as most trees do in autumn, but also inwardly in nature
Shepherds, clouds, trees, and stars are positive figures in biblical metaphor, but hidden reefs, waves, and the sea are negative
In verse 14 Jude continues And Enoch the seventh from Adam prophesied also of these saying Behold the Lord came with myriads of His saints
The Lord's coming will be to carry out God's governmental judgment, and by this judgment all the ungodly ones will be dealt with
They go on according to their own lusts, their mouths speak great swelling things, and they admire persons for the sake of advantage
It is in each man bound to the spirit mans higher part and to the body mans lower part drawn upwards by the one downwards by the other
They do not contact God by their spirit in communion with the Spirit of God; neither do they live and walk in their spirit
In verses 20 and 21 he charges the believers to build themselves up in the holy faith and to live in the Triune God
In verse 20 Jude says, 'But you, beloved, building up yourselves in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit'
The faith here is objective faith and refers to the precious things of the New Testament in which we believe for our salvation in Christ
On the foundation of this holy faith and in the sphere of it, through praying in the Holy Spirit, we build up ourselves
The truth of the faith in our apprehension and the Holy Spirit through our prayer are necessary for our building up
As we build ourselves up in our most holy faith, we build ourselves up in a faith that is not only objective but especially subjective
As long as we have this faith we have the processed God redemption regeneration the divine life and all things related to life and godliness
The answer is that this faith is both the materials with which we build and also the base or foundation on which we build
If we do not have faith, we do not have the materials, and we do not have the base, the foundation, on which to build
As believers, we build ourselves up with the content of our most holy faith, and we build ourselves up on this faith as a foundation
The Chinese version of the Bible translates the Greek word for faith in verse 20 with a word that means 'the true word'
When we hear the words concerning this reality, the Holy Spirit works within us in a way that corresponds to these words
To build ourselves up in the faith does not mean to build ourselves up with theological doctrines or biblical knowledge
Jude is speaking to the believers corporately when he charges them to build up themselves in their most holy faith
If we would build up ourselves in the faith, we must do it in a corporate way; that is, we must do it in the Body, in the church life
According to verse 20, if we would build up ourselves in our most holy faith, we need to pray in the Holy Spirit
In verse 21 Jude says, 'Keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life'
We should keep ourselves in the love of God by building up ourselves in the holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit
The way to keep ourselves in the love of God is by building ourselves up in our most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit
If we do not build up ourselves in the faith and if we do not pray in the Holy Spirit, it will be easy for us to depart from the love of God
Jude does not speak of the love of God in an objective way he speaks of the love of God in a subjective way in the way of enjoying this love
We need to pray in the Holy Spirit, keep ourselves in the love of God, and await the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ
We live in the Triune God by praying in the Holy Spirit, keeping ourselves in the love of God, and awaiting the mercy of the Lord Jesus
While we are praying in the Spirit and keeping ourselves in the love of God, we should await further mercy from the Lord
If we pray in the Spirit, keep ourselves in the Father's love, and wait for the Son's mercy, the eternal life in us will grow in measure
unto eternal life' means not only unto the enjoyment of eternal life, but also unto the growth, the increase of the measure, of eternal life
In verses 22 and 23 Jude goes on to point out that as we live in the Triune God we need to care for others with mercy and fear
If you are not careful, instead of helping that one, you may become contaminated and eventually join him in that very practice
At the same time we need a holy fear and a holy hatred, a holy fear of being contaminated by sinful things and a holy hatred of these things
Verse 24 says, 'But to Him who is able to guard you from stumbling, and to set you before His glory without blemish in exultation'
Glory here is the glory of the great God and our Savior, Christ Jesus, which will be manifested at His appearing and in which He will come
The preposition 'in' here means in the element of, and 'exultation' signifies the exuberance of triumphant joy
Glory is the expression in splendor; majesty, the greatness in honor; might, the strength in power; and authority, the power in ruling
To the only God and our Savior be expression in splendor, greatness in honor, strength in power, and power in ruling
It is very surprising even astounding that an uneducated fisherman from Galilee such as Peter could write the two Epistles of 1 and 2 Peter
In his writings Peter embraces all the matters of God's eternal economy, the same matters that Paul covers in his Epistles
He had been trained in the Scriptures of the Old Testament, and he also had been educated in Greek and Roman culture
Not only does Peter use deep and profound expressions, but in his Epistles he also covers a number of significant details
We have the foreknowledge of God the Father, the sanctification of the Spirit, and the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ
In his Epistles Paul has much to say concerning our spirit, but he does not use the expression 'the hidden man of the heart'
In 1 Peter 414 he says If you are reproached in the name of Christ you are blessed because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you
According to chapter one of 2 Peter, the divine provision gives us not only the divine life but also the divine light
At the end of his second Epistle Peter says, 'But grow in grace and the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ'
We pointed out in the Life-study of 2 Peter that this inheritance is actually the Triune God processed to be our portion
Eternal life is the Triune God, and 'unto eternal life' indicates the full enjoyment of what the Triune God is
These things should bring you back to the basic structure of these Epistles-the Triune God as our full enjoyment
In 1 Peter we see that the Spirit applies God's decision to us, the Son redeems us, and the Father regenerates us
In 1 Peter 2:1 Peter speaks of 'putting away all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings'
After we have been regenerated and have tasted that the Lord is good, we shall certainly want to put away these five negative things
Simultaneously, we shall have a love for the Word of God and an appetite to take in the Word as our nourishment
Peter speaks of this in 2:2: 'As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow unto salvation'
These believers often spoke about God's foreknowledge and selection and about Christ as the precious stone rejected by man but chosen by God
They also warned us concerning God's judgment beginning from His own household, and they taught concerning the mighty hand of God
God's goal is to have His building as His expression, and He is reaching this goal through our growth in the divine life
In verse 3 Peter also tells us that the Father has regenerated us unto a living hope through Christ's resurrection
In verse 2 Peter says that the Spirit sanctifies us, applying to us what the Father decided concerning us in eternity past
We have been regenerated by the Father with an incorruptible seed, a seed that is the living and abiding word of God
The basic structure of the Christian life revealed in 1 Peter 1 is something far different from our natural concept
Once such a person repents and begins to care for God, he will immediately have the desire to do good in order to glorify God
The reason we fail to put into practice what we have heard is related to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Whenever we come back to the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit, we are immediately feeding on the tree of life
God clearly told Adam not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for the result of eating that tree is death
In the Bible we have the second source and the second line: the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the line of death
Apparently these words indicate that we do not yet have eternal life, that eternal life is something that we shall have in the future
Since we already have eternal life, what does it mean to say that we are awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life?
God has given us eternal life with the intention that we would enjoy this life and that it would increase within us forever
Many Christians are not even able to understand Jude's elementary word concerning the experience of the Triune God
In order not to be distracted by the many precious matters in 1 and 2 Peter, we need clear answers to these questions
In this book the first half of the first chapter and the last verse of the last chapter are crucial in relation to life
In verse 2 we see the foreknowledge of God the Father, the sanctification of the Spirit, and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ
The full salvation of God is composed of three elements: the Father's regeneration, the Son's redemption, and the Spirit's application
Having been regenerated, we are now newborn babes longing for the guileless milk of the word so that by it we may grow unto salvation
By feeding on the guileless milk of the word and by growing unto salvation, we shall be transformed into precious stones
We are being built up together in a corporate way to afford God a dwelling place and to tell forth God's virtue, that is, to express Him
We shall not be in danger of being distracted from this focus as we pay attention to the other matters in this book
We have become God's children through regeneration, and now we need to feed on His word in order to grow unto full salvation
We shall be transformed in order to be built together to provide God a dwelling place and to be His expression
In the books of 1 and 2 Peter and Jude there are many matters, but not all of these matters are part of the basic structure
Just as the meeting hall in Anaheim has a basic structure, so there is a basic structure to the Epistles of 1 and 2 Peter and Jude
My concern is that the saints may be distracted from this basic structure by the various matters covered in these books
