   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RULE OF PEACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For the peace of Christ to arbitrate in our hearts, it must rule in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It must be enthroned as the ruler and decider.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I believe you all have experienced that Someone has been enthroned in you to rule you and make the final decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us take as an example a brother who is offended by one of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In my early ministry, I would have encouraged the offended brother to love the elder and not to be offended by him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, from experience I learned that the more I did this, the more the offended one accused me of taking sides with the elder.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually I learned that the best thing is simply to pray that the Lord will have mercy on the brother who has been offended.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In His mercy, the Lord will come to him and cause him to set his mind on the things above so that once again he can experience the divine transmission which gives rise to the arbitrating peace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then, ruled by the peace of Christ, the brother will admit that even though the elder might have been wrong, he himself was wrong to a greater degree.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Immediately he will confess to the Lord, receive grace, and have love for that elder.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through the arbitration of the peace of Christ, our problems are solved, and the friction between the saints disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then the church life is preserved, and the new man is maintained in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church life as the life of the new man is preserved not by mere teachings, but by setting our mind on the things above and allowing the heavenly transmission to impart the divine element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we shall have the renewing of the new man and experience the peace of Christ ruling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The peace of Christ is actually Christ Himself in a particular aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the arbitrating of the peace of Christ is Christ working within us to exercise His rule over us, to speak the last word, and to make the final decision.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the case of the brother offended by the elder, Christ s word is to love that elder, to seek him out for fellowship, and to enjoy the Lord with him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is Christ enthroned as peace ruling, deciding, and uttering the last word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to have a proper Christian walk and preserve the church life, we need the arbitrating peace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Otherwise, there will be no way for friction to be dissolved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only the heavenly Christ, the One who is interceding, ministering, and administrating, can solve our problems and resolve the friction.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a brother and his wife set their mind on Christ in the heavens, they will experience the divine transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then the peace of Christ will arbitrate in them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In meeting after meeting and in message after message, we desire to minister Christ to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the saints see the revelation of Christ and experience the arbitrating peace of Christ, the church life will be preserved in freshness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the peace of Christ is enthroned in our hearts to be the unique umpire within us, we shall have peace with God vertically and with the saints horizontally.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We praise the Lord that we are enjoying peace, and in this peace the church life as the new man is preserved!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As the peace of Christ presides in our hearts, the renewing of the new man takes place continually.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we stay under the ruling of the enthroned peace of Christ, we shall not offend others or damage them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, by the Lord s grace and with His peace, we shall minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The oneness in a local church and among the churches is not maintained by human endeavoring.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is maintained only by the arbitrating peace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The management and maintenance of the Lord s recovery are not our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the churches and the recovery as a whole are under the arbitrating peace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In us Christ is the supplying grace and the arbitrating peace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to allow the arbitrating peace of Christ to be enthroned in us first.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not ask the Lord to exercise His sovereign rule over your wife or husband.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, pray, Lord, be enthroned in me and exercise Your rule over me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If instead of praying for yourself to be ruled by the Lord, you ask Him to rule others, the Lord may say, Let Me first set up My throne in you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let Me rule you, subdue you, and make the final decisions for you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we allow the enthroned peace of Christ to arbitrate in our hearts, our married life, family life, and church life will all be preserved in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May we be encouraged to set our mind on the things above so that the heavenly transmission may bring the divine substance into our being for the renewing of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then Christ in the particular aspect of peace will arbitrate in our hearts, and the Lord will have a way to build up the new man and prepare the bride for His coming.</S>
