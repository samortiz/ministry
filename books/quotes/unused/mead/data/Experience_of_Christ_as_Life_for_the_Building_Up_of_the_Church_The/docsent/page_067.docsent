   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We cannot find one instance of the word church in 2 Corinthians in the sense of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are altogether eight verses with the word churches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Have you ever noticed them?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I venture to say that many have not.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They have noticed the church, but not the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They have begun, but they have not advanced.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second Corinthians is not the beginning; it is the advance in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not think that I am boasting or being critical.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is a fact that many Christians know the church but not the churches because they have not improved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is abundantly clear in the Word that the churches are a step beyond the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With the church we are in doctrine, in theory, but with the churches we come into the practice and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many speak about the church as the Body of Christ, about the Body life and the Body ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some speak of the New Testament church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But where is the reality of the local church life?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some even speak despitefully of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If they are right, we had better remove 2 Corinthians from the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This book is full of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every truth in the Bible develops progressively, and the truth of the church is no exception.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church was first mentioned by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 16 v. 18 . That was the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But immediately after chapter sixteen, the Lord touched the local aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In chapter sixteen there is the church, while in chapter eighteen there is the church in a locality, the church to which you can go.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you have some problem, you must "tell it to the church" v. 17 . Then in the book of Acts, we see the growing up of this seed into all the local churches the church at Jerusalem 8:1 , the church at Antioch 13:1 , etc. Following this, in the Epistles there is the definition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Finally, in 2 Corinthians and in Revelation, the local churches are strongly emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The local churches are the harvest of the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With the teaching regarding this matter in the Bible, there is no ambiguity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is exceedingly clear.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By constant repetition and emphasis the Lord has driven this matter home.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The final confirmation is in Revelation 1:11: "What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are seven cities with seven churches not seven churches in one city, but seven churches in seven cities.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There should be one church in one city, and one city for one church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nothing could be clearer.</S>
