   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If we do not know how to pray-read, we will pray in the following way: first, we will rise early in the morning, feeling that we must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then we will try to pray like this: "Lord, I thank You that You are so good...that You have given me peace...that You have protected me from all kinds of danger..."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then we suddenly remember that we are about to travel somewhere: "Oh, I am about to travel...Lord, grant me journeying mercies...the safety...from a car accident..."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After further hesitation, we continue, "I have a friend in Vietnam...Lord, remember him...remember James in Vietnam...also Tom in West Germany...Lord, Tom is there...he needs Your protection..."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must answer honestly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What does this kind of prayer do for us?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the way most Christians pray.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But do they receive any nourishment?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do they gain something which causes them to be full of joy within and rejoicing without?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The right way is this: first, come to the Bible to pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no need to close your eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Keep your eyes on the Word as you pray.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In all sixty-six books of the Bible we cannot find one verse which says that we should pray with our eyes closed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But there is a verse which says that Jesus looked up to the heavens, saying, "Father..."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 17:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was looking at heaven while He was praying!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We would not argue in a doctrinal way, but we must realize that there is no need for us to close our eyes to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Simply look at the printed page which says, "In the beginning..."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then with your eyes upon the Word and praying from deep within say, "O Lord, In the beginning!'</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lord, I praise Thee in the beginning was the Word.'</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although I do not know what the Word is, the Word was there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I praise Thee, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the beginning!'</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the beginning!'</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>O Lord, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.'"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Simply try to pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps you will turn to another verse.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"There is now then no condemnation."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"O Lord, There is now no condemnation' O Lord, Now no condemnation.'</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now.'</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>O Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now.'</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now no condemnation.'</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No condemnation,'" etc.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While we are pray-reading there is no need for us to compose any sentences or create a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Just pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Pray the words of the Bible exactly as they read.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, you will see that the whole Bible is a prayer book!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Not only is the "Lord's Prayer" a prayer, but the whole Bible is a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Open to any page, any line, any word of the Bible, and start to pray with that portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you will continue to pray-read in this way in the presence of the Lord for thirty minutes, you will see what kind of enlightenment, watering, nourishment, refreshing, strengthening, and satisfaction you will obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From these thirty minutes, you will have a spiritual breakfast which will last the entire day!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although you may not understand a certain passage, you still are nourished, because there is really something of God in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Word of God is His very breath.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Second Timothy 3:16 in the Greek is, "All Scripture is God-breathed."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not try only to learn the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must realize that this is a book of life, not a book of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This book is the divine embodiment of the living Spirit, and He is life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The right way is not just to study or learn, but to contact the Word by exercising our spirit to pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thousands have proven that this is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This way of coming to the Bible has revolutionized their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you would try it for five mornings, you also will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Your whole concept about the Bible will be radically altered.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It may not work so well at first, but with practice, you will touch the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What the church needs today is not more knowledge and teachings, but nourishment, and the way the Lord nourishes His Body is by His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord is eagerly waiting for a way to nourish us and become our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Pray-reading gives Him that way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By this kind of prayer all the riches of Christ will be brought into us and even wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>No teaching, doctrine, or knowledge can work Christ into us to such an extent; it is only by this way of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, we all must learn to pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Eventually, we will be brought out of ourselves, saturated with Christ, and permeated with the Spirit.</S>
