<h2 class="head1">LEARNING OBEDIENCE IN EVERYTHING</h2><p>God must secure a group of people who are absolutely submissive to civil authorities. According to Romans 13:1-7, they should render tax to whom tax is due, custom to whom custom is due, fear to whom fear is due, and honor to whom honor is due. In the family there should also be order and authority. One should be a submissive wife, obedient child, or obedient servant. We should maintain our standing and submit to authority in every circumstance. This kind of behavior and attitude constitutes the best testimony. Nothing can be more beautiful in the world than seeing submission in every circumstance. Those who practice this are expressing God's glory and God's authority. We are not submitting to a person when we submit to authority. We are submitting to God. In order to take care of the sense of the spirit within us, we submit to deputy authority. Those who know authority will submit to authority wherever they find it. A brother who listens to only one man is not useful because he is submitting only to man; he has not seen God's authority. Once a man touches God's authority, he can submit to any authority.</p><p>We should submit to authority wherever we are. There is one brother in Foochow who only obeys a certain person. Another brother will not take any word from Brother Chen or Brother Zheng. In Shanghai there is a sister who only responds to the words of Sister Wang and Sister Lee. They are only obeying men; they are not submitting to authority. Submission to authority has nothing to do with persons. We have to touch authority in the kitchen. We have to touch authority in our office. Whenever we find responsible brothers in the church, we find authority. We find the system of authority everywhere. If a man thinks that he needs to only submit to one person, he has not seen authority. Submission is not directed toward one or two persons; it is directed toward all authorities. We must have a feeling for authority. This is not a matter of being polite and careful. We have to have a spirit of submission, a feeling for submission. A person who has touched God's authority once will know it as soon as he touches it. The sisters who are in charge of the kitchen have their authority. If we step into the kitchen we have to obey them. This does not mean that we have to be polite to them and take care to not offend them like those in the world. What we need is a sense of authority. Such a sense comes spontaneously. It is like the feeling an arm has when it is twisted; the feeling of pain is there spontaneously. Those who know divine authority will identify it as soon as they touch it. If a brother says that everyone's word is wrong and that only Brother Witness's or Sister Wang's words are right, he is an outsider as far as spiritual matters are concerned.</p><p>God is looking for a group of people on earth who will not offend or rebel against authority. If a man truly knows authority, his submission will be spontaneous. This is not a matter of politeness. A Christian does not need politeness; he needs a sense of submission. If such a sense is present in the church, the coordination between the brothers and sisters will be spontaneous. Without this the church will be in confusion. We may say that we are submitting to eight or ten persons, but the result of this submission will still be confusion. We need to submit to all authorities. In the church the absence of obedience brings in confusion. Confusion is equally brought in by an obedience to only one or a few persons. The whole issue rests on whether or not we have touched authority. What is God upholding on earth today? He is upholding authority. If a man destroys God's authority, any work, consecration, service, or zeal will be a form of rebellion. It will be nothing but an offense to His authority. Unless we can sense the evil of rebellion and insubordination, we are useless in the work of God. God upholds His authority. If we destroy this authority, we will have no way to go on.</p><p>This matter needs to be fundamentally resolved before the Lord. Unless we settle this, we may not get into trouble when we are on the mountain, but we will certainly get into trouble when we leave. If a man errs in this matter, he may not get into trouble in one place, but he will get into trouble in another place. It is not enough for the brothers from Chefoo to obey Brother Witness alone; they have to find authority wherever they go and submit to it. In order to be obedient wherever we are, we have to see that God alone is the authority and that all authorities are from God. Authority is a mysterious thing. No one knows what authority really is. It is hard to describe authority. This is something as mysterious as God. But once a man touches it, he feels that he has touched God because God is Spirit in Himself, but God is authority in His manifestation. We are speaking about touching authority; we are not arguing about who should obey whom. Those who argue about such things are in depravity. May the Lord have mercy on them. A worker must ask if he is submitting to God's authority. One does not become a worker by being eloquent, persuasive, or capable. Some sisters find it hard to submit to brothers. Some wives find it hard to submit to their husbands. Some children find it hard to submit to their parents. Some servants find it hard to submit to their masters. It is hard for them because they have only touched men. Saul had to be enlightened by the light and fall by the wayside before he could exclaim, "What shall I do, Lord?" (Acts 22:10). Once a man sees authority, all critical thoughts against police, government, husbands, parents, and brothers and sisters will go away. Once a man touches authority, all of his problems are solved. A servant of the Lord must touch authority and submit to authority. If he does not settle the issue of authority, he will have no way to go on.</p>
