   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE KINGDOM REWARD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After we have experienced life and grow in life, resulting in the issues of fruit-bearing, building up of the Body of Christ, and reigning in life, we have made ourselves ready for the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In His timing, He will then come back to begin the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All those that have fully matured in life and served Him faithfully in building and reigning will receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All those who are not matured and are unfaithful in serving the Lord will be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reward is glorious and the punishment is grievous.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The reward is the early enjoyment of the New Jerusalem.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The punishment includes not having all the above items, not being known by the Lord Matt 25:12 , being cast into the outer darkness with weeping and gnashing of teeth Matt 25:30 , and his work being consumed, suffering loss, though being saved yet as through fire 1 Cor 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The reward was originally the common portion of all the believers; however, due to the degradation of Christians, the millennial kingdom became a reward to those who are faithful to God's eternal purpose and have overcome all degradation to be full-grown in life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, as young Christians, we must aspire to receive the kingdom reward by being normal Christians, experiencing life every day to grow in life until we reach maturity, bearing fruits of virtue, bearing fruits of people, building up the Body of Christ, and reigning in life for God.</S>
