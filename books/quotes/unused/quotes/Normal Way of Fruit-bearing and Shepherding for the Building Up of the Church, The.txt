The main question that night was from one of the young people, who had heard that we had many trainings in Taiwan
Their feeling was that to serve the Lord is a matter of life, and as long as they had the growth in life, they did not need training
Still, we cannot say that as long as we have the human life, we can grow in this life to be able to speak English
Only the human life can do this, but this does not mean that as long as we have the human life we can all pilot an airplane
By that time he had seen some who made a vow to the Lord to love Him as single ones but eventually fell into fornication
Paul had taught and trained Timothy, and now he charged him to train others with what he had been trained by Paul
According to our study of Paul's writings and according to our experience in the past years, there is the need for training
Every week there was one meeting for training, and many persons remained there all week to wait for that one training meeting
The first period of training in 1948 was about six months long, and the second period in 1949 was also six months
Each week we would meet on Tuesday through Friday in the mornings and evenings, and in the afternoons we would have practice
Finally, in the fall of 1969, there was a migration from Yorba Linda to Seattle and from three small cities in Texas to Houston
Although in the six years from 1964 to 1970 we had not had a formal training, a proper leadership had been produced among us
After remaining in the new localities for a year, many of the saints could not go on, but they dared not go back
Even in Anaheim alone there are enough saints to become two churches, but we do not have the proper leadership to carry this out
The first point for our training is to realize that in the church service we do not do anything in the way of organization
Even the arranging of chairs and the cleaning of restrooms are not for themselves; they are for ministering life
In ushering, clerical work, and any aspect of the church service, we must do everything to minister life to others
Not doing things well can be a frustration, but this does not mean that merely doing a good job is to have the proper service
In worldly religious organizations it is sufficient to do the jobs well, but in the church the main thing we need is the ministry of life
Even if we cannot do things very well, but by His mercy we minister life to others, the service is still successful
John 5:16a says, 'If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask and he will give life to him'
We all need to be trained and to practice to take care of the weaker ones who are short of life and sick spiritually
Many saints who have a heart for the Lord have been placed into these groups under the care of the responsible ones
In doing other things we should not be individualistic, but in this kind of prayer it is better to do it individually
Without any ambition but even at the sacrifice of our whole life, whatever burden we pick up will be the Lord's will
We do not care whether others grow in life, and we feel that it is sufficient for us to care for our own spiritual welfare
Some older teenage sisters should say, 'All the young girls between ten and fifteen years old in the church life are my food
Many young ones like to talk about marriage, and many older ones like to ask concerning each others' children, grandchildren, and in-laws
In the previous chapter we stressed the need to go to the Lord, deal with Him, and receive light from Him to be exposed
Similarly, many who are sloppy in other things are not sloppy on their job because their desire not to lose their job controls them
If a good housekeeper cleans her furniture thoroughly, her eyes will be exercised to see dust that others cannot see
On the other hand, if we never clean our furniture in a thorough way, we will lose the ability to see the dust
Following this, we can confess a second matter and ask for forgiveness and cleansing of that filthiness with the Lord's precious blood
If we obey a small light, that light will bring in further light, and if we obey the further light, it will bring in even greater light
After we clean the first spot, we will see a second spot, and after we clean the second spot, right away we will see a third one
We thought it was clean the first time, but when we come back to it, we will see that the first cleansing was not thorough
As we pointed out in the previous chapter, the church service is not mainly for doing things but for taking care of persons
Verse 11 says Just as you know how we were to each one of you as a father to his own children exhorting you and consoling you and testifying
If we do not have an interest in people, we are finished with the church service; we are not qualified to serve
The heart of a mother is altogether for the care of her children, and the heart of a father is for their upbringing
The disposition of our new birth is one that sacrifices our self, our soul, and even our lives for the care of others
In the latter part of the nineteenth and the first part of the twentieth centuries a number of missions sent missionaries into the field
Most of the missions tested their new applicants, but not in the way of testing only their knowledge of the Bible
At this point, the young applicant was a little offended, but since he still desired to get into this mission, he exercised his patience
Missions such as these were the Lord's work at that time to send His gospel to the uttermost parts of the earth
It is difficult to imagine what manner of patience, endurance, and attitude they expressed to those unbelieving heathen
The Boxer Movement of 1900 intended to kill the Westerners in China and all the Chinese Christians who followed the 'Western religion'
The leaders of the villages gave the order that whoever saw a foreigner approaching should sound a gong for warning
People would mostly use mules to do the grinding, but if mules were not available, they would have to use manpower
Those who were saved through this kind of endurance were never able to forget it, and they took the same way to preach to others
Recently, we changed from preaching the gospel in the meeting every week so that the saints could do the preaching in their homes
If we had a burden, a care, and an interest for people, we could have brought in a hundred people in the last few months
When the missionaries came to my province, the clans in each village would not allow anyone to rent a house to the 'foreign devils'
One family of missionaries who lived in an underpass observed a peddler of soy bean cakes who passed by early each morning
In principle, the situation in the United States, the most modern nation on the earth, is the same today as it was in old China
The United States was built up not by its presidents but by the people, those who built up their own families in the proper way
A strong church can be living even without formal meetings, but it seems that now we have meetings without being living
Many dear ones who have been in the church life for a certain time are disappointed regarding their usefulness
Let us forget about the eldership and pick up a genuine heart to love the sinners and a genuine burden to take care of the younger ones
After the Lord was resurrected, He came back to Peter and said, 'Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?
In Song of Songs the Lord's seeker asked Him, 'Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock?
While we are seeking after the Lord, He will still remind us to follow the church and take care of the 'young goats'
What we need to do is pick up the burden to care for the younger ones, to feed the lambs in the Lord's recovery
We must care for the young ones, and if there are no young ones, we can still fellowship with the other saints for mutual care
The Lord will ask us to show Him the credits in our account, but when we show Him something, He may say, 'No, this is a debit
They will do many things as long as the elders do not touch them, but as soon as the elders touch them, they will stop
Even bank robbers claim that because the government is not fair, it is right to balance the wealth in society by robbery
Brother Nee once told us that if we do not keep the proper spiritual principles, our prayers will not be answered
In order to have such a word, we need the tongue of the instructed, the tongue of the one dealt with by the Lord
If we have been dealt with by the Lord, we will have a tongue that can offer a word to rescue others and sustain the weary ones
If we do not listen to the Lord in His dealings with us, it will be difficult for us to speak a timely word to sustain the weary ones
In order to minister life to others, we must pick up a burden to care for unbelievers, young believers, new believers, and weaker believers
No mother would be burdened to care for her children simply because they are attractive or so that when she is old they can take care of her
The proper way is to receive a burden for someone from the Lord in prayer and then to go to contact him, regardless of the outcome for us
After receiving a burden for some persons in a specific way, it is not effective to immediately begin to pray with them
The fourth matter we have seen is that in order to minister life to others, we need to be dealt with thoroughly by the Lord
The reason we do not care for anyone is that we are too 'raw'; we have not been dealt with adequately by the Lord
To come together to have a friendly talk without the ministry of life is not fellowship; it is merely something social
In our service groups if we care only for business affairs without much imparting of life, that is not the genuine church service
Everything in the church must be in the nature of life, with the content of life, and in the imparting of life
The 'currency' in the church 'exchange' is not dollars but the divine life; the divine life is our only kind of 'merchandise'
Our work, speaking, fellowship, service, ministry, message, Bible study, and prayer must be in the flow and imparting of life
Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit'
The more we have, the more the Lord will add to us, but the more we do not have, the more the Lord will take from us
Five plus five, two plus two, and one plus one are all the same to the Lord, and He will praise each one equally
If we water others, we ourselves will be watered, and if we desire to grow in life, we need to help others to grow
Satan may use even a wife to tell her husband that he is useless, and he may use the husband to say the same thing to the wife
The Lord even put Abraham into a situation in which he was forced to pray for the household of Abimelech so that they could have children
Spend refers to the spending of Paul's possessions, and be utterly spent is the spending of what he was, referring to his being
If we have a spirit to spend whatever we have and to be spent, to sacrifice whatever we are, we will have a great increase each year
As we pointed out in the previous chapter, the Boxers in China had a slogan: 'Kill all the Westerners and their followers, except Mr
Some in the church life are too strong in their disposition to be touchable in this way; it seems that no one can cause them to be shaped
Because his disposition was fully dealt with by the Lord, it was soft, bendable, flexible, and applicable to any situation
We need to be soft, flexible, and applicable, good for any situation we are placed in, able to fit into every bend and corner
It is as if they would not even pour water on a house fire before they carefully checked what kind of water they should use
They bear fruit quickly, but then because they offend the fruit with their quickness, eventually they have no remaining fruit
Character is different from disposition; it is thirty percent disposition by birth and seventy percent habit by our living
When there is the need to be strong, we must be strong, and when there is the need to be soft, we must be soft
A good elder can speak a strong word of adjustment to a brother and then speak with him in a very pleasant way
The only way to be able to adjust a brother and then be pleasant with him is by having our disposition dealt with
Nee once told us that by the time someone is fifty years old it is difficult for his disposition and natural life to be touched by the Lord
Many in today's Christianity teach that the reason we do not bear fruit is that we are short of power from on high
They say we should pray and fast for a certain number of days until the power comes as the baptism in the Holy Spirit
For the branches of the vine tree to bear remaining fruit is not a matter of this kind of revival; it is a matter of growth
When branches receive a sufficient supply of life-juice, they bear fruit as the overflow of the inner life supply
If we do not bear fruit, it is because we do not have the overflow of life; we are short and undersupplied by the inner life
Brother Nee once told us that if every one-talented person in the church would use his talent, we will have a true remaining revival
What the Lord needs is not the kind of revival that comes and goes but the exercise of our talent with the growth in life
Since everything in this Epistle is a matter of life, the gifts mentioned in chapter 12 are gifts of life, not the miraculous gifts
From birth, children have the ability to eat, but even that ability in their physical life requires some training
We are not superstitious to believe that as long as we have the divine life we can do everything and know everything already
According to John, the Gospel of life, preaching the gospel is a matter not of mere speaking or teaching but of bearing fruit
In John 15 the Lord used the illustration of the vine tree to show that we, the branches of the vine, must bear fruit
The more we bear fruit, the more we need the life supply and the more the life supply will come into us to meet all our needs
In order to have the rich flow of life, we need to open our being, let the life flow out of us, and bear fruit
Many people speak of the normal Christian life, but to be normal is not only to be freed from sin according to the experience of Romans 6
If many people are brought to the Lord by miraculous prayer and preaching, we may proclaim that this is marvelous
We may be in the church, go along with the church, and have no problem with the church, but if we do not bear fruit, we are also wrong
In some churches, however, there is a prevailing gospel preaching, but there is still a shortage of caring for the little ones
The reasons that we do not bear fruit are that we are too sloppy and slothful and that we do not like to be dealt with
Paul spent whatever material possessions he had, and he was spent in whatever he was in his spirit, soul, and body
If the Lord has mercy on us that we pick up the burden to bear fruit, we will immediately see that we must pay a price
If we are willing to pay the price, one of our relatives may be saved, and one of our schoolmates may be brought into the church life
Even if our spouse or children cannot force us to be broken, fruit-bearing will force us to be broken, if we mean business with the Lord
In order to preach the gospel in a living, prevailing way, we must be lowly, right, willing, zealous, and flexible toward people
If people are not ready to speak concerning the gospel at a certain time we must be willing to spend ourselves to come again at another time
We may prefer to choose our own time, and if we cannot choose the time, we may forget about speaking to someone
We may have many relatives, but we may have brought none of them to the Lord simply because we excuse ourselves too much
To bring forth a child requires nine months of suffering, but to raise a child takes at least twenty years of suffering
If we would all bring one person to the church life each year and care for one younger one, the church life will be wonderful
The church life and fruit-bearing affords us many lessons, but caring for young ones gives us even more lessons
Our enjoyment of the riches of Christ's life and our lessons in the spiritual life and church life depend mostly upon our fruit-bearing
We must go to the Lord to confess our fruitlessness to Him and stay in His presence and radiance for some time
If we go to the Lord and remain with Him, the living Spirit will burden us to pray for certain ones among all those whom we know
They will all know the kind of life we live and the kind of persons we are, and they will be impressed, influenced, and convinced by us
If a Christian means business with the Lord, it will be easy for him to bring one person to the Lord and into the church life
Throughout the past centuries, many matters concerning the Christian life and church life were lost in the degradation of the church
The important matter is not how long it takes us to bear one fruit; what is important is that we do bear fruit
As we said in the previous chapter, the three tests of whether we are right are the church life, fruit-bearing, and caring for younger ones
At first we may not have much light, but if we obey the light we receive and deal with what the light condemns, we will receive more light
We are not speaking of a mere work of gospel preaching; we are speaking of fruit-bearing as the issue of a proper Christian life
If the sisters, for example, mean business with the Lord when they go to Him in this way, He may touch them concerning their shopping
Some wives already have dozens of pairs of shoes and several sets of silverware, but they still like to buy more
If the sisters mean business with the Lord to bear fruit, the Lord may say, 'Go home and get rid of all but five pairs of shoes'
Some sisters also love their hair, and in these modern times, even the young men love their long hair and beards
That will not work, and even if it did work, we would bring forth fruit only according to what we are in ourselves
What we need in the Lord's recovery is for many dear saints who love the Lord and mean business with Him to constantly be one with Him
If we go along with the Lord's exposing and enlightening, and we have a thorough dealing with Him, we will be fruitful
Something within condemned me, saying, 'It is not because you were too busy; it is because you did not have the desire'
We first need a thorough dealing with the Lord, and then we need to become available, flexible, and fully dealt with in our disposition
Later he recommended Jesus by saying, 'I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him
Jesus is the Lamb to take away the sin of the world, and He is the One with the dove to baptize people so that they may receive God as life
The first was Andrew, and the second should be John, the writer of this Gospel, although he was humble and did not mention himself by name
After this, the Lord Jesus went on a little farther, and He met Philip, who was of the same city as Andrew and Peter
In actuality, this is inaccurate, since Jesus was born not of Joseph but of Mary, and not in Nazareth but in Bethlehem
Many of us think that if we pray and have a proper daily living, those whom we bring to the Lord will be caught right away
If we read the New Testament carefully, we will see that the Lord Jesus went a second time purposely to catch the disciples
Rather, they all went back to Galilee to work at their jobs-Peter and Andrew to fishing and John to mending nets with his brother James
Some never preach the gospel, and some preach in a foolish way, dreaming that something miraculous will happen
If we have certain problems in our human living, it is better to go to a seventy-year-old man, not a seven-year-old boy
From the time of his earlier ministry to his later ministry, Paul's realization changed concerning certain things
In chapter 7 Paul expressed the wish that all men would be like he was and not marry, since marriage can be a distraction
To those who wish to love the Lord and work for Him, wives are often a bothering, and husbands are not sympathetic
In 1 Timothy, one of his later books, he instructed Timothy to encourage widows under the age of sixty to be married
Pentecostals speak about preaching the gospel in a Pentecostal way, and fundamentalists speak about it in the way of revival
Although the Lord Jesus performed many miracles, He did not commit Himself to those who were interested only in miracles
The Lord is willing to spend time even late at night to speak to only one person, not about miracles and revival but about life
Because this word concerning her husband touched her conscience she told the Lord a lie by speaking a partial truth I do not have a husband
Although she was a simple person, she was clever and turned the problem about husbands to the subject of worshipping God
She said, 'Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship'
Jesus said to her, 'Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father
She also performed no miracle and had no eloquence but was simply a living testimony, testifying to the people
The Lord set up an example in John 3 by speaking at night to one man and in chapter 4 by caring for one immoral woman
These two chapters of John do not speak about praying but many today tell us that we must first pray and fast for a revival to suddenly come
It is true that Acts mentions the prayer of the church, but as we have pointed out, Acts is a book of beginnings, not of completion
A final word means more than a beginning word, and in the Bible the final word is not in the first books but in the last books, such as John
We must all be impressed by the Lord as the example of the proper preaching of the gospel and not of performing miracles
He who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto eternal life, in order that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together
, the Assyrians captured Samaria and brought people from Babylon and other heathen countries to the cities of Samaria
History shows that the Samaritans had the Pentateuch and worshipped God according to that part of the Old Testament
The Lord's word concerning worshipping God the Father in spirit and in truthfulness is difficult for many to understand
The Lord Jesus told the woman Woman believe Me an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father
The Lord seemed to be saying, 'The true worship of God is not in a place but in your spirit and not with offerings but in truthfulness
The Lord Jesus sovereignly and wisely used the illustration of a harvest to portray the proper preaching of the gospel
A harvest comes about through tilling the ground, sowing, watering, and caring for the crop for a certain amount of time
We should awake from this kind of dream, realize what the proper gospel life is, and live it out in the church
Paul told Timothy, 'Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season; convict, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and teaching'
Many Christians have prayed in a superstitious way, expecting a great revival to come, but the result has been poor
Even in our own locality, if we all bear one fruit in a year, our numbers will double until the whole city will be evangelized
If we have the proper living, day by day and one by one people will be brought to the Lord and into the church life
John 4 speaks concerning reaping the harvest, John 15 concerning bearing fruit, and John 21 concerning feeding the lambs
These are all related to a daily living in the way of life, not a mere work, activity, or movement in a miraculous, religious way
By living this way and being such persons, we will constantly enjoy the Lord's presence, supply, and all the riches of the life of Christ
People speak of the Lord's Day morning meeting as a 'service,' and in the evening they also have an 'evening service'
Verse 5 says, 'You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood'
The other, used in 1 Peter 2:5 and 9, refers not to the priestly service but to the group of priests, the priestly body
The spiritual house in verse 5 is the priesthood, the priestly body, and this priesthood is the spiritual house
The true service which we render to the Lord is an offering by a built-up body of priests, and this built-up body is the spiritual house
The service of arranging chairs is a chair-arranging priesthood, and the cleaning service group is a cleaning priesthood
We must not be common in our thinking attitude speaking expression in the way we dress and in every matter and every aspect of our living
Many dear saints love the Lord and know the church, but the way they behave, speak, and do things is too low, not like kings
If a beggar ascends to a king's throne, his kingship will be beggarly, but if a king sweeps the street, his street sweeping will be kingly
The new ones should be able to see something high and kingly even in the lowly affairs such as chair arranging and cleaning the hall
If the President of the United States comes to arrange the chairs, the chair arranging would be a great matter
Among the many teachings, messages, and sermons in Christianity, almost none of them ever speaks of God's building
In John 1, John the Baptist recommended Christ as the Lamb to take away sin and as the One with the dove to bring God as life
When he awoke Jacob poured oil upon the stone on which he had slept and he called the name of that place Bethel which means the house of God
We must be holy and royal in order to tell out the virtues of the One who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light
The enemy uses these things to undermine the building, and when this happens, he is able to prevail against us
To be a holy and royal priest is to be fully separated from the world, and to be built up together is to be fully out of our self
The self must go, including our disposition, our likes and dislikes, our way of thinking, and our way of doing things
Some who are in the service groups may subconsciously hold a criticizing concept, saying, 'The church is good, but
Even if next time the chairs are arranged in a circle, we may say that the circle is too small or that the seats are too far apart
If anyone worships idols, we should cleanse ourselves of him, and if a brother is in immorality, we must ask him to repent
If the leading brothers in the service ask us to arrange the chairs in a peculiar way, we should not speak a dissenting word
Even if arranging the chairs in that way seems foolish, to go along with the brothers is much better than to be dissenting
The driver will insist that he is in control, and the passenger will tell him to humble himself and listen to others
As long as they are not in idolatry, immorality, division, or blasphemy to the Lord Jesus, we should go along with them in every aspect
We must all be built up as a spiritual house, which is the holy and royal priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices
As long as we are one, we are right, but if we are not one, regardless of how right we feel that we are, we are wrong
He acted as one who did not know anything, asking, 'What are these words which you are exchanging with one another while you are walking'?
If the first brother is not already a sloppy person, then sleeping longer for the sake of the other brother will not make him sloppy
If someone feels that it is better to serve in a different area than where he is first assigned, it is better to let him make the change
If we insist that the brother remain where he was assigned in order to learn a lesson, it may be we who need to learn a lesson
If the 'steering wheel' is under our hand, others should listen to us, but if it is in someone else's hand, we should not try to drive
In this case, even if our proposal is better than his, it is better not to say anything in order to keep the standard of oneness
If we never do what someone proposes, he may not learn the lessons, and we ourselves may not learn anything either
Because most Christians do not realize the need for building, Christianity today is mainly a group of organizations
The true nature of the building of God is indicated by Ephesians 416 which says All the Body being joined together and being knit together
Before each individual, separate, and particular item is built into the house, it is easy to identify because it has its own peculiarity
We can easily hire laborers to pile up materials in a quick way, but we cannot produce a proper building very quickly
If we desire to build up a movement, we can do it quickly, but this will simply be a repetition of the failures of Christianity
In addition, every building is something vertical, not only horizontal, and the most useful buildings are the tallest ones
For a man to stand vertically indicates that he is strong, but when he is tired, he sits down, and when he is worn out, he lies down
We may say that a body stands on its feet, but if we would cut off its head, the feet would no longer function
In God's creation there was a good order, but by the fall that order was destroyed and humanity became 'flat,' without the proper headship
Once a member loses its position, it is out from under the headship, it is out of function, and it is out of the proper building up
It is the problems related to the headship that keep the churches in the Lord's recovery from advancing very quickly
If the Lord opens our eyes to see what the proper building is, we will see how short we are of the building up
On the other hand, Christianity has influenced us in a negative way, and it is very difficult today to lose this influence
As long as we do not have the building, it makes no difference to him how many meetings we have or how large a crowd we draw
Those outside the churches do not realize what we are doing here, and they speak all manner of things about us
In 1956, when a servant of the Lord visited us in Taiwan, he recommended to us the political way to touch people
Some think that because they are too young and are not pastors, elders, or experienced Christians, they cannot shepherd others
We should realize that it is a great lack and a shame not to bear fruit each year and have someone under our care
His way is to depend not on spiritual giants but on every member, on those who have a daily gospel life with shepherding
The Lord has raised up His recovery in many cities, but we are still short of a daily gospel living and of shepherding
We simply want to go to the meeting on the Lord's Day and enjoy ourselves for an hour by listening to the good singing and speaking
As human beings, we must believe in the Lord Jesus, and as believers, we have no choice but to take the way of the proper church life
Brother Nee taught us to say, 'I don't know' because, strictly speaking, we do not know much, and what we do know, we do not know thoroughly
Those who went out to the churches without practicing Brother Nee's principle eventually created many problems
We need to be honest with the ones who are under our care, but we must still be restricted by the Lord not to make their decisions
People may ask us about many matters, but we must learn to exercise our spirit to discern the purpose of the questions
People often like to gain knowledge, asking about the elders, the brothers and sisters, and many other matters
If we do not visit people in a clean way, but rather take germs to them, they may be incited to open up in a wrong way
We should not try to wrongly impress people that we have the way to do things, that we are smart, or that we know everything
To this end, we should bring with us a spirit and atmosphere of prayer to help others to come into a prayer life
If we ourselves are not persons with a prayer life, we will not be able to build up others as this kind of person
If we have gospel preaching without shepherding to take care of the new ones, many of the newly saved ones will fall away
In one sense, we are the parents nourishing our children, but in another sense, we are all brothers and sisters
We have seen that some of the ones who are under our care do not open to us, regardless of how much time we spend with them
No doubt, Paul testified many things to the saints, but a great part of his testimony must have been his own experiences
We should not go out to contact people with the concept that we can do many things or that we know many things
Rather, when we care for young ones, new ones, and weak ones, we need to know where they are in their experience
If someone is clear concerning his salvation, we should go on from the assurance of salvation to another experience
We must pray for him contact him have fellowship with him and do something to help him to fully pass through the experience of consecration
We may give him our own testimony and tell him how so many saints in the past consecrated themselves to the Lord
Spiritual Torrent is somewhat difficult to understand, but today it is very easy to read The Experience of Life
Doing this will help us to know if we are in 'high school,' 'college,' or 'graduate school' in our spiritual experience
If we do not know where we are or where those whom we contact are, our fellowship with them will be very general
Not only the service groups but also every local church with an adequate eldership must help the saints to go on in this way
Rather, we must know how to help the saints at every level, just as in America today we have all the different levels of education
We will realize whether or not we can afford them what they need, and we will go on to experience something further
Not all the new ones are able to enjoy whatever the church is enjoying at the present time, although they can enjoy it to some extent
In a general way we should keep all the saints in the present flow of the church but in particular we should know what someones real need is
Otherwise, we are only carrying out a religious work to bring people to the meetings and the service without much of Christ
God's economy is altogether for the church, but in his subtlety Satan has been and still is deceiving the saints concerning the church
Today the subtle enemy is doing his best to allow Christians to use Brother Nee's books on life while hiding what he said about the church
We should not be too proud and think that only we can build up others nor should we be too humble and think that only others can build us up
On the other hand, if not one new believer is added to the church in six months, the whole church life will decline
Even after a long time, someone under the care of the sisters may receive only a general help but nothing in a particular way
A few years ago the one being cared for may not have had certain particular experiences, but today she may still not have had them
Many times we have charged the saints not to come together to gossip but to speak concerning spiritual things or pray
If we do not know how to shepherd people in the experiences of life, we will not have much to speak of when we come together
At first we can say, 'Let us pray-read something,' but after doing this a few times, it will not be very prevailing
Because the church meetings are too general, it is difficult to carry out a particular training in the meetings
No shepherding can be prevailing if we do not have a love for people, an interest in them, a burden for them, and adequate prayer
Sometimes the elders cannot do the job adequately; therefore, we must all take up some part of the work of shepherding
