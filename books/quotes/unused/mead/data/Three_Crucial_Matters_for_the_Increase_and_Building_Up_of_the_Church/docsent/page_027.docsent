   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING THE BURDEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PREACH THE GOSPEL BY DOOR-KNOCKING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND HAVING HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FOR NOURISHING THE NEW ONES</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These results show that it is possible to preach the gospel by door-knocking and to nourish the new ones in home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, we must present these ways to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have two to three hundred full-time trainees who are from more than twenty different countries.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The rest of the trainees are from the churches in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the trainees complete the training, some of them will probably return to their original localities.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the new ones need to be transferred gradually to the care of the local brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The local brothers and sisters must be willing to receive this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, everything that the trainees are doing must be transferred to the local brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some of the elders are worried because they have not seen the newly baptized believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, I am concerned that when we give them the new ones, they will say that there are too many new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, according to our present situation, the elders must rise up and lead the saints to take the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The only way to do this is by door-knocking and having home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is our church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the past our church life was centered on the meeting hall, and it was very convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, every administrative district in the city of Taipei has a meeting hall, and each hall has elders, who handle the church affairs, and co-workers, who give messages to release the word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is a meeting in each hall every Lord s Day morning, and there are brothers who bear the responsibility to minister the word in these meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The saints only need to enjoy the meetings and say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word preached among us is higher than what is preached in Christian denominations, and everyone likes to listen to the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, this old way of meeting is according to our natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, a saint who works five or six days a week hopes that on Lord s Day morning he can relax in the meeting by listening to a good message and then fellowship with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, our former way of meeting matched his need, enabling him to relax.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, twenty years of experience has shown that this kind of living has no impact in the gospel; it is unable to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even though we may baptize many people, few remain.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have experienced the suffering of failing in the gospel and being unable to keep people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, we are the only ones who remain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore we must put aside the old way and take the new way with all our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even though there are many saints who still prefer the big meetings, simply enjoying a meeting is not enough to gain people or to keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The new way, however, does not merely bring people in; it also causes people to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>New ones are brought in through door-knocking, and they are kept through the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This way has been proven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How many of the six thousand new believers we can keep depends on what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do a good job, we will be able to keep at least ninety percent of the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are our treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether the new ones remain depends on how we serve and nourish them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the new ones are properly nourished, they will grow and be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The life expectancy of human beings has increased because of good food and a hygienic environment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nearly seventy years ago, many babies died within the first few days of their birth, and the people who lived to be sixty years old needed others to help them walk.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, many who are presently seventy years old live alone and cook their own meals, because they are physically strong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we take care of nutrition and hygiene, germs will not be able to grow, and we will live long and be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The new ones will remain if they are properly nourished and are healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE CHURCH LIFE IN THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the saints, especially the elderly brothers and sisters, love the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should never think that we have nothing because we do not practice the old way, do not focus on the meeting hall, and do not stress material offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not think that the church has nothing or that the church does not need anything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Door-knocking and home meetings are our church life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are our meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Previously our meetings were in the meeting halls; now they are in people s homes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Previously we preached the gospel in the halls; now we knock on people s doors and lead them to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The people whom we baptize are our children.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must begin immediately to meet with them in their homes to nourish them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is our church life, and this is our meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After we meet with them for a period of time, we will eventually break bread, have prayer meetings, and have meetings to read the Bible and study the truth with them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is our church life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, all the activities of the church life are now in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the past everyone in northern China liked to hire Cantonese nurses as servants, because the Cantonese nurses could do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We all need to be Cantonese nurses, those who are able to serve as elders, responsible brothers, and full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In other words, we must be able to shepherd people, minister the word, baptize people, and teach Life Lessons and Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must be able to do all these things without relying on others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the past when we met in the meeting hall, we asked who was giving the message that day.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If a competent brother was speaking, we were happy, and we thanked the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If a brother whom we did not think was competent was speaking, we were disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We no longer need to ask who will be giving the message, because we will be the ones speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Regardless of whether you are a brother or a sister, as long as you are in a home meeting, you will speak.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The brothers and the sisters should function.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must all serve as Cantonese nurses; everyone must function and be able to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is our training.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Everything with human beings depends on habits.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As soon as something becomes our habit, we feel that it is good, but when we are not accustomed to doing something, we feel uncomfortable with it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have the habit of meeting in the old way; hence, we feel that it is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The administration of the church is orderly; some saints arrange chairs, some dust, some sweep, others minister the word, and still others preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everyone is comfortable doing things according to their habit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the same way, over the past few months the saints in the training have become accustomed to the new church life of door-knocking, baptizing people, and nourishing people in home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They feel that this kind of life is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They have developed the habit of door-knocking and leading people to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we ask them to stop door-knocking or baptizing people, they will feel a lack.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Moreover, the trainees love the people who are saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They love to visit the new ones and have home meetings with them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The trainees rejoice when the new ones throw away their idols or when their relatives no longer oppose them.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is the sweetness of caring for the children we beget.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Before we beget children, we do not know that we love children, but after giving birth to a child, as we look at him and feed him, we feel that he is very lovely, and we love him more.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>All mothers are like this; even the ugliest child is beautiful in the eyes of his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>For this reason, it offends a mother to say that her child is ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Every mother loves her children.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The feelings we have for the new ones should not come from natural affection.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We spontaneously develop a feeling toward the new ones, but this should not be natural.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is proper to have feelings, but it is not proper to have natural affection.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Proper feelings can be compared to frankincense in the meal offering Lev 2:1 , which is acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>However, natural affection is like honey added to the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The honey ferments and brings in uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>An elder who went door-knocking and went to some home meetings testified that he does not want to go back to the old way of being an elder, because he is tired and bored of being an elder for ten years in the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Now his church life is full of flavor.</S>
