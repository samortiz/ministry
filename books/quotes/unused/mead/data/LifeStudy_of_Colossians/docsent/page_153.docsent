   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST REPLACED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY OUR NATURAL CHARACTERISTICS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In our daily living Christ is often replaced by our natural characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose a certain brother is quick, and another is slow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The quick brother automatically lives according to his natural quickness, and the slow one, according to his natural slowness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The quick one will often make mistakes, but the slow one will often cause delays.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In one case Christ is replaced by quickness; in the other, He is replaced by slowness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether you prefer the quick one or the slow one, it is a fact that Christ is replaced by both our natural quickness and our natural slowness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Recently in a meeting a brother stood up to declare that he intended to drop his culture.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Later I pointed out that the attempt to drop our culture will only produce another type of culture a culture-dropping culture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no need for us to drop our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What we need to see is that culture is a replacement for Christ and that we should live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more we live Christ, the more our culture will be replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Formerly our culture was a replacement for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But now as we live Christ, Christ replaces our culture with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There can be no doubt that Christ is fully revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But who among the Lord s people truly lives Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to ask ourselves how much we live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes the saints talk about the best way to have the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, our concern should not be with the way of meeting; it should be with the living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do we care to live Christ in a genuine way, or do we just want to have a certain kind of meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The meetings of the church should not be a performance, but should be an exhibition of our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We thank the Lord for all He has shown us concerning the revelation of Christ in Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now we must go on to experience Christ and to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What we need is not more doctrine, but more experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Again and again, we need to be encouraged to live Christ day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Wherever we are, at home, at school, or at work, we need to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul could say, To me to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How many of us can give such a testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we are tested by the Lord concerning this, we need to humble ourselves and confess that we do not live very much by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How we need to receive grace to live Christ day by day!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we live Him consistently and adequately, all the replacements for Christ will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we have light concerning how Christ is replaced in our daily living, we shall confess to the Lord that instead of living Him we live so many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may say to Him, Lord, I confess that I have not lived very much by You.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I live a clean life, even a pure life, but I do not live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although I have been careful not to sin and not to be wrong with others, I have not lived You.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Years ago, I spent much time to confess my failures and wrongdoings; however, at that time I did not confess my lack in living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But recently most of my confession has concerned one thing my shortage in living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all need to make such a confession to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>TWO UNIQUE COMMANDMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the New Testament there is a unique commandment to unbelievers: Repent and believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who perish will perish because they do not believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just as there is a unique commandment for unbelievers, so there is a unique commandment for believers: To live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you are not a believer, you need to repent and believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if you are a believer in Christ, you now need to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Unbelievers do many different things in place of believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Likewise, believers may do many things instead of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The unique sin of unbelievers is their unbelief, their not believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But the unique sin of believers is their failure to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to confess this sin and condemn it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may be humble, honest, sincere, faithful, diligent, and, in many respects, very scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, if we do not live Christ, we are still under God s condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God does not want honest, sincere people He wants us to be Christ-people, those who live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A genuine Christian should be a Christ-man, not merely a virtuous man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is crucial for us to see that in our living there should be no replacements for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In particular, we see from Colossians that Christ should not be replaced by any kind of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all have a strong culture, both the culture we have inherited and the culture we have made and imposed on ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To live by this culture is to live by something other than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we live by our culture, we may not do anything sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the contrary, our living may be very good, but it is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must condemn the practice of living by such things as humility, love, and diligence instead of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God s desire is that we live Christ.</S>
