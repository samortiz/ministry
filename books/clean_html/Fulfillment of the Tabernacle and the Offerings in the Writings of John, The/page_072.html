<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 6:1-21, 26-69</h1><h2 class=head1>THE BREAD OF LIFE</h2><p>In this message we shall continue to consider the signs in John 6. In the foregoing message we pointed out that chapter six of the Gospel of John gives many details concerning the Lord Jesus as the bread of life. We have seen five characteristics of the Lord as the bread of life. He is the heavenly bread (vv. 41, 50, 51, 58), the bread of God (v. 33), the bread of life (vv. 35, 48), the living bread (v. 51), and the true bread (v. 32). As the bread of life, Christ is the bread with eternal life, with zoe. As the true bread, the real bread, He is the reality of the food we eat daily. We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that we need Christ as the true bread of life sent by God to bring us eternal life. Therefore, through the Word we need to feed on Christ as the living bread.<p>In chapter six of the Gospel of John there are six sections related to Christ as the bread of life (6:32-71). In the first of these sections (vv. 32-51 a), we see that Christ, the bread of life, was incarnated. In verse 33 Christ refers to Himself as the bread of God, who came down out of heaven and gives life to the world. Although Christ is the very God, He became flesh in order to be the bread of life for us to eat.<p>In the second section we see that Christ was slain (vv. 51b-55). He was crucified. John 6:51b says, “And the bread which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.” This refers to Christ’s crucifixion. The Lord gave His body, that is, His flesh, to die for us so that we may have life.<p>The third section concerning Christ as the bread of life points to His resurrection (vv. 56-59). In verse 56 the Lord says, “He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him.” This indicates that the Lord had to be resurrected so that He may abide in us as our life and life supply.<p>In the fourth section (vv. 60-62) we have a word concerning the ascension of Christ. In verse 62 the Lord asked, “What then if you should see the Son of Man ascending where He was before?” In verse 56 the Lord’s resurrection is implied. Here in this verse, His ascension, which follows His resurrection, is clearly mentioned. Ascension is the proof of the completion of Christ’s redemptive work (Heb. 1:3). In His ascension the Christ who came down out of heaven will go back to heaven.<p>In verses 63 through 65, the fifth section, we see that Christ became the life-giving Spirit. At the beginning of verse 63 the Lord says, “It is the Spirit who gives life.” At this point, the Spirit who gives life is brought in. After resurrection and through resurrection, the Lord Jesus, who had become flesh (1:14), became the Spirit who gives life, as is clearly mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:45b. As the lifegiving Spirit, He can be life and the life supply to us. When we receive Him as the crucified and resurrected Savior, the Spirit who gives life comes into us to impart eternal life to us. We receive the Lord Jesus, but we get the Spirit who gives life.<p>In the last section we see that Christ as the bread of life is embodied in the word of life (vv. 66-71). Because He is embodied in the word of life, Simon Peter declared, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life” (v. 68).
