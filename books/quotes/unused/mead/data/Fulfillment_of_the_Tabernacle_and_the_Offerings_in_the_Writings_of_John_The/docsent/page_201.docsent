   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God's Desire to Make His Chosen People His Reproduction</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As a whole, John's Gospel reveals that the Triune God desires to work Himself into His chosen people to make them His reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This reproduction is illustrated by a grain of wheat that falls into the ground, dies, and grows in order to be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The many grains brought forth by the one grain are the multiplication of that grain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A father is one who multiplies himself through the begetting of children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A man's children are his multiplication and reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the same principle, as children of God, we are God's reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Concerning this, 1:12 and 13 say, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name; who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to these verses, whoever receives the one who came as God incarnate and tabernacled among us will be given the authority to become a child of God, His reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a result of the coming of the Lord Jesus, millions of children of God have been produced.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have seen that the Gospel of John does not emphasize the redemption of the Lord Jesus, but instead emphasizes the multiplication brought forth by the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to 12:24, the Lord brought forth this reproduction by falling into the ground as a grain of wheat to die.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus died on the cross to bring forth the multiplication, the reproduction, of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the synoptic Gospels Christ died for redemption, but according to the emphasis in John's Gospel, He died for the purpose of multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Divine Glorification</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have seen that after the resurrection of Lazarus, the crowd welcomed the Lord Jesus and wanted to exalt Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the Lord did not come for human exaltation; He came instead for divine glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This glorification required Him to pass through the process of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The five and a half chapters from the middle of chapter twelve to the end of chapter seventeen are all on one subject the glorification of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is the Lord's glorification?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His glorification is His multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From 12:23 to the end of chapter seventeen we see that Jesus, the Nazarene, had to pass through death so that He might be multiplied in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This multiplication is His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose a certain brother has twelve sons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These sons would be the brother's multiplication and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we saw this brother surrounded by all his sons, we would realize that with him there is multiplication, and that this multiplication is his glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The matter of multiplication as glorification revealed in chapters twelve through seventeen has been neglected by Christians throughout the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nevertheless, these chapters definitely speak of the Lord's glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the people wanted to exalt Him, the Lord said, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified" 12:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order for the Son of Man to be glorified, it was necessary for Him to die and be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 12:28, the Lord Jesus went on to pray, "Father, glorify Your name."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For the Father to glorify His name is for Him to glorify Himself, for the Father's name denotes His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then in 12:32 the Lord went on to say, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For the Lord to be "lifted up" means that He was put on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When He was lifted up, He drew all men to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All those who have been drawn to Him are His multiplication.</S>
