<p>Every Lord&rsquo;s Day I go to a different hall to observe the teaching of <em>Truth Lessons.</em> I feel that all the brothers are making progress everywhere. However, it seems that we are still not thoroughly clear about how to teach the main points of the lessons, and we do not know the secret of teaching. In the past I implored that we not expound but only teach the lessons. Now I am still holding on to this principle. The reason is that the content of <em>Truth Lessons</em> is already a complete message which includes everything that should be included. It does not require us to expound any further. As long as we are able to point out and impress people with the main points, this is the best way to teach <em>Truth Lessons.</em></p>
<h2 class="head2">Exercising the Spirit</h2>
<p>The first and foremost requirement in teaching <em>Truth Lessons</em> is the exercise of the spirit. We need to exercise our spirit in every word that we speak. The minute we open our mouth, if we exercise our spirit, we will spontaneously stir up others&rsquo; spirit. On the contrary, if we speak in a low tone without any vigor, people will be killed by our speaking. For example, in a classroom full of naughty students, if the teacher speaks without any vigor, the students will be even naughtier and will not listen to the teacher. Even though we are not teachers, we still need the same kind of attitude and manner. Once we stand on the podium, we should not speak casually or in our regular tone. Rather, we need to speak in a dignified way. Once we open our mouth, our spirit should be released. We must learn this. If we do this, our teaching of <em>Truth Lessons</em> will be entirely different. Once we open our mouth, our spirit will come out, and what we are going to say will also be spirit. The attendants will also exercise their spirit when they speak and read the messages. Hence, the exercise of the spirit is the first item that we must work on.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Applying Some Techniques</h2>
<p>I said earlier that according to my observation and experience, the best way to read <em>Truth Lessons</em> is that everyone reads instead of a few reading or only the teacher reading. But all should not read together; rather, they should read a sentence each, one after another. Consider a basketball game. It is not one person who holds the ball all the time or five persons simultaneously playing the ball; they pass the ball to one another and take turns playing it. Based on what I saw, almost all the churches commit the mistake of not reading in the right way. I hope that we will receive this fellowship.</p>
<p>The advantage of teaching in this way is that in reading the lesson, everyone will spontaneously exercise to speak and we will not be the only one speaking. Everyone will read consecutively, like five players passing a basketball from one to the other. This is to be flexible. The most important thing in our home meetings and small group meetings is for everyone to speak, as if they are passing a basketball. The best opportunity to train the saints to speak is when we teach them <em>Truth Lessons.</em> We need to explain to them or even give them a demonstration of how to read the lesson.</p>
<p>Second, in reading the lesson, we need to teach them how to pay attention to the main points. When we come to an important point, we can ask someone to read it again, or even three or four times. If the one who reads is experienced, he may be able to stress the point a little. In this way, not only will he gain the benefit, but everyone will be benefited. The newly saved ones and gospel friends in particular will be very impressed. The teacher and the student can profit from each other. The teacher speaks; the students speak; everyone speaks. Spontaneously, we will all grow. This is not easy, but it is not too difficult. I hope we can all practice this. Do not practice this in a rigid or monotonous way; instead, do it in a living way.</p>
<p>Third, after each section has been read, the teacher should highlight the subject and the main point. This will give the saints a deeper impression and enable them to learn the truth and receive the supply.</p>
<p>If the teachers can speak with an exercised spirit, lead the saints to practice repeated reading, emphasized reading, reading that brings out the main points, and give a conclusion after each section, the saints will be able to taste the sweetness and riches of the messages. After each lesson, the saints will not only receive the knowledge of the truth but also the life supply released from the main points that were highlighted. This is a very profitable practice.</p>
<p>There are also a few points to which we should pay attention. When we ask questions and highlight the main points, we should not pay too much attention to trivial things, such as history, geography, or the names of persons; rather, we should pay attention to the types, prophecies, and fulfillments. Once I heard a teacher ask questions, not related to the prophecies of Christ but to the names and numbers of prophets. Some people may ask, &ldquo;Since we do not need to pay attention to all these things, why did you include them in the lessons?&rdquo; I have already pointed out that for a chicken to grow properly, it needs to have bones, feathers, and skin. But when this chicken is presented for man&rsquo;s enjoyment, the more meat there is, the better. When we compiled <em>Truth Lessons,</em> we included some of the &ldquo;bones,&rdquo; &ldquo;feathers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;skin,&rdquo; but this does not mean that we want them to be taught.</p>
<p>I have read the Bible for sixty years. From the very beginning, I started to memorize the names of persons and places, but until today I am not able to remember all of them. If the trainees were to tell me that they have memorized only the names of the twelve minor prophets, I would not be happy. However, if they have not memorized all the points concerning Christ&rsquo;s prophecies, I would say that they should be dismissed and should leave the training. I am afraid, however, that many of them have memorized the names of persons but not the prophecies of Christ. This indicates that our teaching of <em>Truth Lessons</em> has reversed the order of importance&mdash;we are presenting only a pile of bones for people to gnaw on, but we cannot present the meat for people to eat. This is a big failure.</p>
<p>Last Lord&rsquo;s Day I joined a corporate Lord&rsquo;s table meeting in a certain hall. The saints were tested on the main points of the lessons and accordingly given rewards. I agreed with their practice. They did not test on trivial matters but on the outlines&mdash;in Adam, we see God&rsquo;s redemption; in Abel, we see God&rsquo;s way of redemption; in Enosh, we see man&rsquo;s need for God and man&rsquo;s calling upon Him to enjoy God&rsquo;s riches; in Enoch, we see one who was redeemed and who walked with God on the pathway of redemption. We do not need to ask questions such as how long Enoch lived or how long he walked with God. The trivial matters are not important. The most important thing is the spiritual significance.</p>
<p>All of the co-workers and elders should be teachers of <em>Truth Lessons,</em> and especially the younger ones should bear this burden. The older ones are already sixty or seventy years of age; the younger ones should pick up this burden. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery our teaching of the truth should not be the same as the way people teach theology. For example, they teach the historical event of Abraham&rsquo;s being born in Ur of the Chaldees. Instead, we should teach the spiritual matters and things, such as the spiritual significance of Ur of the Chaldees being a land of idol worship. We must remember this kind of spiritual significance. The failure of theological teaching is that even though people have received theological education, their comprehension of the spiritual matters is still incomplete. What they learned are things such as history, geography, archaeology, and culture. What we teach must be matters of spiritual significance.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 1: The Vision and Definite Steps for the Practice of the New Way &nbsp; pg 67</div><br></body></html>
