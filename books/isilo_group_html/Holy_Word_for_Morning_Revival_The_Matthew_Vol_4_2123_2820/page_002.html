And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?</p><p class="bold">26 &nbsp;But if we say, From men, we fear the crowd, for all hold John as a prophet.</p> <p class="bold">27 &nbsp;And they answered Jesus and said, We do <sup>1</sup>not know. He too said to them, <sup>2</sup>Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</p> <p>28 &nbsp;But what do you think? A man had two children. And he came to his first son and said, Child, go today and work in the vineyard.</p> <p>29 &nbsp;And he answered and said, I do not want to; yet later he regretted and went.</p> <p>30 &nbsp;And he came to the other and said likewise. And he answered and said, I will, sir; yet he did not go.</p> <p>31 &nbsp;Which of the two did the will of the father? They said, The <sup>1</sup>first. Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the harlots are going into the kingdom of God before you.</p><p>32 &nbsp;For John came to you in the way of <sup>1</sup>righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him. And you, when you saw it, did not later regret it to believe him.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>27<sup>1</sup> This was a lie.</p><p>27<sup>2</sup> This indicated that the Lord knew that the Jewish leaders would not tell Him what they knew; hence, neither would He tell them what they asked. They lied to the Lord in saying, &#8220;We do not know.&#8221; But the Lord spoke the truth wisely to them, exposing their lie and avoiding their question.</p><p>31<sup>1</sup> In Luke 15:1-2, 11-32, the Lord likened the leaders of Judaism to the firstborn son, and the tax collectors and sinners to the second son; but here the Lord likened them in the opposite order. This indicates that the Jews were the firstborn of God (Exo. 4:22) and had the birthright. However, because of their unbelief the birthright was shifted to the church, which has become God&#8217;s firstborn (Heb. 12:23).</p><p>32<sup>1</sup> The Gospel of Matthew, as the book on the kingdom, stresses the matter of righteousness, for the kingdom life is one of strict righteousness, which we must seek (5:20, 6; 6:33). John the Baptist came in the way of such righteousness, and the Lord Jesus was willing to be baptized by John to fulfill such righteousness (3:15).</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The events in chapter twenty-one took place during the last week of the Lord&#8217;s life on earth (John 12:1). In this period of time He willingly presented Himself to the children of Israel for a thorough examination....According to Exodus 12, the passover lamb had to be examined four full days. In the Jewish calendar, four days could also be considered six days, for part of a day was counted as one day....During the last week of His life, Christ was examined for six days. Then He was crucified on the day of the Passover. This indicates that He was the real Passover Lamb; the lamb in Exodus 12 was a type.</p><p>First the Lord was examined by the chief priests and the elders....The chief priests represented the religious power, and the elders represented the civilian power. These two powers came together to test Christ. [They] asked the Lord where He had received His authority and who had given it to Him. The Lord Jesus did not answer them directly, but with another question....In this way, the Lord Jesus passed the first test, and no defect was found in Him.
