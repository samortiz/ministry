In our fellowship we want to focus our attention on the lampstands in Exodus 25, Zechariah 4, and Revelation 1
Are the altar and the laver in the outer court, typifying the redeeming blood and the washing, cleansing Spirit
The third pair of items in the tabernacle is the incense altar in the Holy Place and the ark in the Holy of Holies
We take grace at the throne of grace, and the throne of grace is the propitiation-cover where God speaks to us and meets with us
The altar, the showbread table, the incense altar, and the ark all have definite measurements, but the lampstand is without measurement
The laver is also without measurement, but is not as peculiar as the lampstand in that we can define its shape
There are no words, however, such as rectangular, square, triangular, or round to describe the shape of the lampstand
On one occasion, some of the brothers confronted certain ones who opposed us because we stood for the truth that Christ is the Spirit
The angel answered This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying Not by might nor by power but by my Spirit saith the Lord of hosts
The lampstand in Exodus, the lampstand in Zechariah, and the lampstands in Revelation are three stages of the truth concerning the lampstand
When people say, 'Let's go to church,' they are referring to a physical building of bricks, stones, wood, and steel
My impression of the church as a youngster growing up in China was that it was a western bungalow with a high tower and a bell
To say that a physical building is the church is absolutely and thoroughly off from the divine revelation of the church
When John Wesley preached outdoors in England in the eighteenth century he was opposed by the socalled Anglican Church the Church of England
After the Brethren, some saints were raised up by the Lord who saw something concerning Christ as our inner life
Based upon this, some began to see that the church is the continuation of Christ, the enlargement of Christ, and the spreading of Christ
For centuries, however, no one has seen, not even the deeper saints, that the church is the reproduction of Christ
The seven lampstands are exactly the same as the unique lampstand in nature, essence, shape, and in every respect
To say that the church is the Body, and the continuation, the enlargement, and the spreading of Christ is not enough
Christ was the unique lampstand, and all the churches are the lampstands in the same nature, essence, model, shape, and function
The ultimate definition of the church is that the church is the reproduction of Christ and the reprint of the Holy Spirit
When we say that we are the church, we have to realize that the church is the reproduction of Christ and the reprint of the Spirit
We have to admit that when we are outside of the Spirit, we are merely the fallen race and the descendants of Adam
If we are not in the Spirit, we are through with the church because the church is the reproduction of Christ and the reprint of the Spirit
The lampstands are for God's building in three stages: for the tabernacle, or temple ; for the recovered temple ; and for the church
If there had been no lampstand in the tabernacle, the priest would have been in the dark and would have lost his direction
The showbread table is for nourishing, the incense altar is for acceptance, but only the lampstand is for moving
These dispensations are the dispensations of innocence, conscience, human government, promise, law, grace, and the kingdom
These seven eyes are of Christ as the Lamb for redemption of Christ as the stone for Gods building and of Jehovah for the visitation of man
As seven is the number for completion in God's operation, so the seven Spirits must be for God's move on the earth
In substance and existence, God's Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God's operation, God's Spirit is sevenfold
We have seen that there are three categories of the lampstand in Exodus, Zechariah, and Revelation, respectively
God's move was with Christ; then this very Christ became the life-giving Spirit for God's move, for God's building
We need some further fellowship to help us realize that the church in the New Testament is absolutely a matter in the Spirit
The Trinity of God is not a matter for doctrinal study but is altogether for God to dispense Himself into humanity
After He accomplished redemption on the cross, He became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection to impart Himself into us as life
God is Spirit; second, the last person of the Trinity is the Spirit; and third, the Redeemer became the life-giving Spirit
Our God today is totally and all-inclusively the Spirit, and He has prepared everything to baptize His chosen people into Himself
We were baptized into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the Body approximately nineteen and a half centuries ago
He actually came to the United States two hundred years before when his great-grandparents immigrated from Scotland
If he had not been brought to the United States two hundred years before, he could not have been born in the United States in 1941
Hebrews tells us that Levi paid tithes to Melchisedec because he was in the loins of his father, Abraham, when Melchisedec met Abraham
We were all put into the church at the same time, but you may not have been enjoying the church as long as another brother
Regeneration, sanctification, transformation, life, power, and every positive spiritual blessing are for the Body
If we have not seen the significance of God's economy, we will not be able to get into the real significance of the whole Bible
When the Lord opens our eyes to see God's economy, the economy of God immediately becomes a key for us to open the entire Bible
In the past we knew something concerning the lampstand in the tabernacle, but by the Lord's mercy, He has shown us something further
Zechariah 4, on the other hand, shows us that the lampstand signifies the life-giving Spirit as the reality of Christ
Both this Christ, who is the embodiment of God, and this Spirit, who is the reality of Christ, signify the lampstand
Eventually and ultimately in the Bible, the churches are brought forth into existence, or produced, and every church is a lampstand
At the time we were reborn, God came into us, and we now have God in Christ within us as our life and as our nature
Anything that is not born of the divine life with the divine nature is foreign to the Body of Christ and the Body of Christ will not take it
The altar, the showbread table, the incense altar, and the ark were all made of acacia wood overlaid with brass or gold
If you have really seen this vision, you will not exercise your mind to argue with the brothers in your locality
If this vision is shining so brightly within us, the Lord will have a way to speak to us in our daily life to terminate our natural man
Although you were put into the church nineteen and a half centuries ago, actually today you may not be in the church
The church has nothing to do with the materials of wood, hay, and stubble produced by us in the natural man and the flesh
If we are in the church and still behave, act, and move by our natural being, by our natural life, this is an insult to the church life
The lampstand for the recovered temple emphasizes the Spirit as the seven Spirits of Jehovah for God's building
The lampstand in Exodus, which typifies Christ, had seven lamps, and these seven lamps are the seven eyes of God, Jehovah
We have seen that the seven lamps, which are the seven eyes of Christ as the Lamb and as the stone, are also the seven eyes of Jehovah
The seven lamps are the seven eyes, and the seven eyes are the seven Spirits of the Lamb, of the stone, and of the Lord Jehovah
There are six items related to the lampstand: the seven lamps, the seven eyes, the seven Spirits, the Lord Jehovah, the stone, and the Lamb
He is watching over us from every side-not only from the right, left, front, back, top, and bottom, but also from within
What we are fellowshipping here is not something doctrinal, but is according to our experiences of Christ in the church
When we receive the Lord's transfusion, many times we have to confess our failures, sins, and weaknesses to the Lord
When we are brought into the practical building, we will see that He is Jehovah, the Lord, and everything to us
The church in Anaheim, the church in Frankfurt, the church in New York, and the church in Taipei would all be the same
The seven lampstands in Revelation 1 represent seven cities: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea
The church in Pergamos was unique with the teaching of Balaam , and the church in Thyatira was unique with Jezebel
We have to make a thorough confession to the Lord to apply His redemption, and then we will be brought into the actual building
