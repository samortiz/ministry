Verse 1 says, &ldquo;Now all the tax collectors and sinners were drawing near to Him to hear Him.&rdquo; The gentlemen and righteous men were not joined to Him, but the tax collectors and sinners were. Therefore, the Pharisees murmured and complained again. Then the Lord spoke three parables. The first is concerning a shepherd seeking the one, unique, lost sheep. Of one hundred, this one was a lost one, so the shepherd came purposely for him. Why did the Lord go to a house full of sinners and tax collectors? It was because among them there was one lost sheep of His, whom He had come to seek. The second parable is concerning a woman who lit a lamp and swept the house to seek her lost coin. The third parable is about the prodigal son. The shepherd is the Son, the woman is the Spirit, and in the parable of the prodigal son there is the Father. As the prodigal son was returning, he was preparing and considering what to speak to his father. He prepared himself to say, &ldquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants&rdquo; (vv. 18-19). While he was walking and thinking like this, the father saw him. Verse 20 says, &ldquo;But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him affectionately.&rdquo; That the father saw the son a long way off was not an accident. From the time the son left home, the father must have gone out to look and wait for his coming back every day. We do not know how many days he watched and waited. When the father saw him, he ran to him. This is the Father&rsquo;s heart. The father interrupted the son while he was speaking his prepared word. The son wanted to speak the word he had prepared, but the father told his servants to bring the robe, the ring, and the sandals and to prepare the fattened calf. A teacher among the Brethren told me that in the whole Bible we can see God run only one time, in Luke 15, where the father sees the returning prodigal son. He ran; he could not wait. This is the Father&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>To speak truthfully, we have lost this spirit among the co-workers, elders, and vital groups. We do not have such a loving spirit that loves the world, the worst people. We classify people, choosing who are the good ones. Throughout my years I have seen many good ones. Eventually, very few of the good ones remain in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Rather, so many bad ones remain. In the beginning I also was one who classified them as bad, but today many bad ones are still here. If it were according to our concept, where would God&rsquo;s choosing be? Our choosing depends upon God, who chose His people before the foundation of the world. The Bible says that God hated Esau and loved Jacob. If we were there, none of us would have selected Jacob. This man was too bad. We would have selected Esau, the gentleman. From his mother&rsquo;s womb, Jacob was fighting, and when he was born, he grabbed his brother&rsquo;s heel. Eventually, he did everything that caused Esau to want to kill him. His mother Rebecca knew this, so she sent him away to his uncle&rsquo;s house, but when he went there, he did the same thing; he cheated his uncle by getting four wives from him. This is to live like a gangster. None of us would have chosen Jacob. It is not up to our choosing, our selection. It is based upon God&rsquo;s eternal selection.</p><p>Do not classify people. Who can tell what they will be? When I was playing mah-jongg at the age of eighteen or nineteen, who would have thought that this mah-jongg player would sit in America many years later to talk to people about the Lord? Who brought me here? It was Christ as the heavenly ladder. He brought me up to God in the heavens, and He brought me down to the earth with Himself. The heavenly ladder has many steps, and God brought me up not in one year but over many years. When I arrived at the top, I met God, and He equipped me and sent me back down. I came down, first to Taiwan, then to the South Asian islands, and then to this country. Now I am here. The pastor in my hometown did not say of me, &ldquo;I know this man. He is a gambler, a mah-jongg player. I do not like him, and I do not want to have such a member in my church.&rdquo; Rather, he visited me, and one day very mysteriously the seeking Spirit was seeking in me, like the woman in Luke 15.</p><p>Why would I spend so much time on this subject? I want to shepherd and disciple you from the Bible so you can see this matter and have a change. I am discipling you to change your concept. The God-man concept is that Christ came to save sinners, especially the top sinners. He saves the &ldquo;gangsters,&rdquo; even the leader of the &ldquo;gangsters,&rdquo; Saul of Tarsus. Paul said, &ldquo;Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:15). Paul could say this because he was the top sinner opposing Christ. He rebelled against Christ, but while he was rebelling, Christ knocked him down, called him, and saved him. Jesus Himself said, &ldquo;Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill....I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners&rdquo; (Matt. 9:12-13). That is why He was there among the sinners and tax collectors, eating and feasting with them, reclining at the table and enjoying with them.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>A Word of Love to the Co-Workers, Elders, Lovers, and Seekers of the Lord &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
