   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE PRACTICE OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH 2 CONCERNING OFFICES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the organization of the church there is a distinction between office and gift.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>An office is a matter of authority, whereas a gift is a matter of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has determined that in the organization of the church there is authority as well as spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The problems that the church has encountered throughout the centuries have been due to a lack of either spirituality or authority; that is, there have been problems in regard to either the gifts or the offices.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our intention in our current study is not to search for regulations in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, we want to see God s purpose in regard to the organization of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, we want to find out why God desires that there be organization in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we touch the deeper meanings of this matter, we will see that it is ultimately related to authority and spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the organization of the church is according to God s desire, authority will be established and spirituality will be manifested in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, the church will have both authority and spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Apostles Not Being Appointed by Man</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Authority does not come from man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Offices, therefore, do not depend on human hands.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the church the first office is that of apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Apostles are not appointed by man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The authority, office, and position of apostles do not come from man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although human hands may be involved in the appointment of elders and deacons, absolutely no human hand is involved in the appointment of apostles because apostles are universal, whereas elders and deacons are local.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The offices of the apostles, elders, and deacons show that in the church there is authority and order.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this regard, not every office is on the same level.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, in regard to any office, we need to pay attention to one matter the source of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Outwardly, apostles appoint elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The authority of the elders is given to them by the apostles, although, strictly speaking, the apostles only confirm the authority of the elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, in a proper church life no one becomes an elder of his own accord; rather, elders are designated and appointed by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only when an apostle designates certain ones to be elders do they have the position and authority of elders in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nevertheless, the source of the elders authority is Christ, the Head of the church, because it is He, not man, who has appointed the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not despise the matter of appointment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although Paul was spiritual, he still made many arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the organization of the church there are two kinds of appointments: appointments made by the Head directly and appointments carried out through human hands.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since no human hand or human confirmation is involved in the appointment of apostles, there is a possibility for some people to make a false claim of apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, in the church there is the need to try the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Revelation the Lord commended the church in Ephesus, saying, You have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The elders and deacons are appointed by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the elders and deacons were directly appointed by the Head, there would be many false elders and deacons, and authority within the church would be greatly confused.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To avoid such confusion, God appoints apostles, and apostles appoint elders.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God does not want His authority to be in a state of confusion in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God also does not want the church itself to be in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Being Sent by God</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God Himself appoints apostles and sends them out Rom 1:1; 1 Cor 12:28; 1 Tim 2:7; 2 Tim 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since there is no outward appointment or assignment by man, people may doubt a person s apostleship 1 Cor 9:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, no one should doubt the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When an apostle appoints certain ones to be elders, everyone is able to see it, and thus there should be no doubt about it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In contrast, people may question one s apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Moreover, due to the absence of human participation in the appointment of apostles, there may be false apostles 2 Cor 11:13; Rev 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, no one can be a false elder or a false deacon, because elders and deacons are appointed by apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such an appointment cannot be falsified.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Who are the apostles?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is an important question.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For the past two thousand years, no one has dared to say who is an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No one dares to say that he himself is an apostle; neither is anyone willing to say that others are apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Christianity some people even hold an erroneous concept that there were only twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Gospels there were twelve apostles, in Acts there were twelve apostles, and in the coming New Jerusalem there will also be twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because of this, some think that there are no apostles in addition to the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They do not believe that there is a thirteenth apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, according to the Bible their reasoning is not sound.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Acts 14:14 Paul and Barnabas are spoken of as the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, in the Scriptures there is at least a thirteenth apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is strong proof that the term apostle is not limited only to the twelve but that there are many more.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The twelve apostles spoken of in the Gospels and Acts have a special place.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Their names will be on the foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Nevertheless, we must see that they are not the only apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some in Christianity say that there are no more apostles because the so-called apostolic age is over.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to the principle of the Bible, we are still in the apostolic age.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There have been numerous apostles throughout the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What kind of person can be an apostle?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To be an apostle involves the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Authority is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we speak concerning the organization of the church, we touch the matter of office and thus the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is marvelous that God never allows another to be the source of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He does not allow man to touch authority or let it be initiated by man s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hence, no one can appoint another person to be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The authority to appoint an apostle has always been in the hands of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Since men do not appoint apostles, the office of an apostle may be questioned.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In contrast, since apostles appoint elders and deacons, the offices of elders or deacons need not be held in question.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God has given the apostles authority to appoint elders; hence, when there is an accusation against an elder, it may be presented to the apostles 1 Tim 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The apostles do have authority in regard to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some have said that there are no more apostles and that the apostolic age is over; however, if this were the case, there would be a great problem.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If there were no apostles in the church, there would be no authority and order, and everything would be dependent on gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If the church had only gifts and there were no offices, the church would undoubtedly become flat and no longer be three-dimensional.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Who are apostles?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Who has received authority directly from the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is a solemn matter.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Although the Roman Catholic Church is three-dimensional in its hierarchy, its way is erroneous.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It claims that the pope is Christ s representative, a successor of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>All the cardinals are subject to the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In turn, they have authority to rule over the bishops.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Although the Roman Catholic Church is altogether three-dimensional, it is the pope who is the ultimate source of authority in the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What an erroneous hierarchy!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the Bible no apostle is under another apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>As an apostle, Timothy was led by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>However, Paul was not above Timothy nor did he rule over Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In the Bible the apostleship is not three-dimensional.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It does not say that God placed one apostle above another apostle; neither does it say that one apostle was under another apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>All apostles are subject to Christ the Head, and only the Head is above the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Hence, apostleship is not three-dimensional.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Otherwise, there would be a chief apostle, such as the pope in the Roman Catholic Church, and all authority would be vested in him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Peter was not under Paul, nor was Paul under Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If Peter were above Paul, there would have been a great problem; that is, the churches of the Jews would have had authority over the churches of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If Paul were above Peter, the churches of the Gentiles would have had authority over the churches of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>However, this was not the actual situation.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Peter was under the Head, and Paul also was under the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The authority over the churches of the Jews was Christ, and also the authority over the churches of the Gentiles was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Although the Bible contains the term super-apostles , it is not used in a positive sense.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Paul said, I count myself to be inferior to the super-apostles in nothing 2 Cor 11:5 , and he also said, I am the least of the apostles 1 Cor 15:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The basic thought is that God never considered the apostleship to be three-dimensional; that is, there were never different levels, from lower to higher, among the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The result of having such levels would be a top apostle, who is under Christ the Head but over the other apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This is the arrangement in the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Is the church flat or three-dimensional?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The church is three-dimensional because the authority of the Head is within it.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This does not mean that one church is above a second and under a third.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The church is not a religious organization.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Each local church is directly under the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>One local church cannot control another local church.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Every local church is directly under the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is similar to an apostle being directly under the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If a person is sent by the Lord to do the Lord s work, he should be neither proud nor humble.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If a person is an apostle, he will sense the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The Lord s presence is an apostle s authority.</S>
