   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND MAN-MADE WORKS TALKS 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Date:Morning, January 10, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Prayer: May the Lord deliver us from quick minds and curious thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We admit that it is very difficult for the Lord's word to come into our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>May the Lord cause the words that we hear to lead us to the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>MAN-MADE WORKS BEING</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>COUNTERFEITS AND BEING ARTIFICIAL</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Christianity, preachers always try to impress others with the importance and goodness of a truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the end, they would point out how one can obtain such truth, what one should do first, and what he should do next.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The listeners may be impressed and may try to practice accordingly when they go home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in the end, they always find out that the teachings do not work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Bible, the apostles did not do this kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Spiritual things do not come through our strivings, strugglings, or resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are a direct result of God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Saul on the way to Damascus did not hear any special message, but he saw the revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In preaching the Lord's word, we have to look to the work of the Holy Spirit, and our being has to go out with the release of the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the way to put the word into others' being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some preaching gives others the revelation, whereas other preaching only presents the methods in a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the latter case, the listeners may be touched, but when they try to practice the methods, their endeavors are but man-made works.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man-made works are counterfeit works.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Japanese occupied China, there was the so-called puppet government.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The puppet government is a counterfeit government.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many so-called spiritual virtues are actually like artificial flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are like the fruit on the Christmas trees, which do not grow out of the trees, but are put there by hand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Artificial goodness is man-made goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This kind of goodness is a result of the work of the preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A man can have any kind of outward performance; he can act like a seminary student, walking slowly with the Bible in his hands and with his eyes fixed to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But this kind of acting accomplishes nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He can come to the meeting with bowed head and silent prayers, and he can nod his head continually while listening to the message.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He can pray silently after the message to show that he is touched by the words.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But after the meeting, on his way home his eyes will catch some attractive things, and his true self will be exposed again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No wonder there are so many hypocrites today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CONFUCIUS' TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>AND GOD'S TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is good that the evangelists are helping people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many of the truths passed on to such ones after their salvation are counterfeit teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What many so-called great pastors and evangelists are preaching is but Confucian teachings, or godly teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man likes to hear these godly teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But ninety-nine percent of these teachings are on counterfeit goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Exhortations to be godly and to be just are things that a person uses to teach others; they are not things that a person lives out in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to forget about all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the one hand, we should not be lawless.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the other hand, we should not bind ourselves; everything should be done in a spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We would rather not do something than to do it in pretension.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To do something in pretension damages a person more than not doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If someone is somewhat loose, we should not feel sad.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If someone is somewhat meek, we should not feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Humanly speaking, to be meek is surely better than to be rough.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But before God, there is not much difference between meekness and roughness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Spiritual matters are not accomplished through outward strivings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul received the light on the way to Damascus, not through his own pursuits or strivings, but through God's taking hold of him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You may say that if this is the case, we might as well give up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But while you may give up, God will not give up; He will take hold of you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The thing I fear the most is for a person to live by himself merely according to ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This kind of conduct is the work of producing artificial flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Of course, we have to admit that, humanly speaking, Confucius' teachings are good.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Chinese say that humility brings profit whereas arrogance brings loss.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For thousands of years, we have upheld the Confucian teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Humanly speaking, they are good teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But the New Testament is not on human ethics, but on divine ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The New Testament says that we have to hate our parents, brothers and sisters, and children.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is not teaching us to be humanistic, but to live God and to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The teachings in Christianity tell people what to do, and the teachings in other religions also tell people what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But none of these teachings are of any value.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>GOLD, SILVER, AND PRECIOUS STONES</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>VERSUS WOOD, GRASS, AND STUBBLE</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>First Corinthians 3 says that with some people, their works will be burned up by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It does not mean that they have sinned or have lost their temper, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It means that the nature of their works will be tested, and their works will be found not to be built on the foundation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All works that originate from the self are wood, grass, and stubble; and everything that comes from God is gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Gold is versus wood.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Gold signifies God's nature, whereas wood signifies the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Silver signifies redemption, whereas grass signifies the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Stubble is earthly, and it is versus the precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The precious stones speak not only of God's image, but of the heavenly glory as well.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What God wants to gain in us today is gold, silver, and precious stones, and not wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
