   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW-MAN-CREATING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:15 and 16 we see that Christ is also the new-man-creating Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For centuries, Christians have spoken about Christ s death on the cross without seeing the consummate point that He died for the creation of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He abolished in His flesh the ordinances in order to create in Himself one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The cross is not only for salvation, release, and victory; it is also for the creation of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The creation of the new man required that all ordinances be abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Praise the Lord that He is the new-man-creating Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By abolishing the ordinances on the cross, He has created the Jews and the Gentiles into one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE ALL-THINGS-HEADING-UP CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1:20-23 we see that Christ is also the all-things-heading-up Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has seated Him at His right hand in the heavenlies and has subjected all things under His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, Christ has been made Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The headship over all things has been given to Christ as a gift from God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE GIFT-MAKING AND GIFT-GIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapter four reveals that Christ is the gift-making and gift-giving Christ 4:7-8, 11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because Christ is the Head over all things to the church, He is able to make gifts and to present them to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ephesians 1:22 says that Christ is the Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The little word to is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It implies transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whatever Christ, the Head, attained and obtained is transmitted to the church, His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this transmission the church shares with Christ in all His attainments.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because all that Christ is and has is transmitted to the church, He is able to constitute us as gifts to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have pointed out that it is through His descending and ascending that Christ constitutes us into gifts to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By His traveling, by His descending and ascending within us, we are made useful gifts to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the church life first began in Los Angeles, we all had the sense that we were weak and useless.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We wondered how we could possibly take care of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, by Christ s descending and ascending, many have been constituted into useful gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The leadership needed for the spread of the church life is produced in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As brothers experience the descending and ascending Christ, they become proper leaders to take care of the churches that are raised up by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This leadership is not produced by man s education or training; it is constituted by the descending and ascending Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to praise the Lord for His traveling, for the marvelous two-way traffic between heaven and earth and between earth and heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is through such traffic that the gift-making and gift-giving Christ produces gifts for His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE HOME-MAKING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Finally, as 3:17 reveals, Christ is the home-making Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is no longer homeless, for He is making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more Christ settles down in our hearts, the more He can boast to Satan that He has a home in His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May we all be impressed with these five aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the church-loving Christ, the new-man-creating Christ, the all-things-heading-up-Christ, the gift-making and gift-giving Christ, and the home-making Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What a Christ we have!</S>
