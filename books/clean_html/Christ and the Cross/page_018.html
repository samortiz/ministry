<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN HEAVEN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 4&mdash;5</h1>
<p>In the previous chapters we saw the past and the present in relation to Christ. In the past Christ was God&rsquo;s plan, the goal of God&rsquo;s plan, and the center of God&rsquo;s creation and redemption. In the present Christ is the life of the believers and the content and reality of the church on the earth. However, Christ is not only in the present; He is also in the future. He is not only on the earth; He is also in the heavens. With respect to time, Christ is the center of the past, the present, and the future. With respect to space, He is on the earth and in the heavens, and He is the reality of everything on the earth and in the heavens. Hence, if we want our revelation and vision concerning Christ to be complete, we must see Christ in the heavens and Christ in the future.</p>
<p>Chapters 1 through 3 of Revelation concern Christ in the church, and chapters 4 and 5 reveal Christ in heaven. Some Bible readers think that chapters 4 and 5 refer to the future. However, if we read these two chapters carefully, we will see that they do not concern things in the future but things that took place in heaven after Christ ascended. If these two chapters were not in the Bible, we would not know the scene in heaven at Christ&rsquo;s ascension. Through these two chapters the scene in heaven at Christ&rsquo;s ascension is revealed and presented to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;WHO IS WORTHY TO OPEN THE SCROLL?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>If we carefully examine chapters 4 and 5 concerning the revelation of Christ in heaven, we will see a special scene. A throne is set in heaven, and God, who rules the universe, is sitting on the throne (4:2). Around Him are twenty-four elders and four living creatures (vv. 4, 6). The four living creatures have no rest day and night, for they continually say, &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy, Lord God the Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming&rdquo; (v. 8). When the four living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits upon the throne, the twenty-four elders fall before Him who sits upon the throne and worship and praise Him, saying, &ldquo;You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, for You have created all things, and because of Your will they were, and were created&rdquo; (vv. 9-11).</p>
<p>In chapter 5 there is a scroll that is sealed with seven seals in the hand of the One who sits upon the throne (v. 1). In verse 2 a strong angel proclaims with a loud voice, &ldquo;Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?&rdquo; This scroll concerns the mystery of the universe. Who is worthy to open the mystery of the universe? The meaning of the universe, why it exists, where it is going, how it will evolve, and how it will end are a mystery, and this mystery is held in the hand of the Ruler of the universe, who is sitting on the universal throne. Who is worthy to open the mystery in the universe? This question was proclaimed in heaven, but no one in the whole universe could answer, because no one in heaven, on the earth, or under the earth was able to open the scroll (v. 3). When John saw this scene, he wept much (v. 4). It would have been truly lamentable if no one was found worthy to open the scroll and the mystery of the universe!</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONLY CHRIST BEING WORTHY</h2>
<p>In verse 5 one of the elders said to John, &ldquo;Do not weep,&rdquo; because &ldquo;the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David&rdquo; was worthy to open the scroll. On the one hand, Christ is the Lion of the tribe of Judah. This indicates that He is a descendant, the seed, of Judah. On the other hand, He is the Root of David. This indicates that He is the source of David. He is a man because He is a descendant of Judah, but He is also God because He is the Root of David. He is both God and man. Furthermore, He won the victory by overcoming sin, the world, and Satan on the cross. He resurrected from the dead, overcoming death and Hades, and He ascended to the throne of God by overcoming the power of darkness in the air. The Lion of the tribe of Judah overcame everything that opposes God, everything that is out of Satan, and even Satan himself. Therefore, He is worthy and qualified to open the mystery of the universe. He is the center of the universe and the key to the universe. He created the universe, and He redeemed the universe. He solved all God&rsquo;s problems in the universe, and He accomplished God&rsquo;s plan for the universe. He opened the mystery of the universe, and He solved the problem of the universe. Without Him the universe would be a lamentable tragedy, but with Him the universe is like a wonderful, joyful song.</p>
