   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How did God strengthen him?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2 Corinthians 4 Paul mentioned the problem of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He said, "Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What attracts our attention the most is that even though verses 10 and 11 are seemingly repetitive, they actually are not.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 10 speaks of the life of Jesus being manifested in our body; whereas verse 11 speaks of the life of Jesus being manifested in our mortal flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many people can express the life of Jesus in their body but do not take a step further to do so in their mortal flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The distinction between these two is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When they are sick, many believers show real obedience and endure much without murmuring or anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They sense the presence of the Lord and manifest His virtues in their countenance, voice, and action.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By the Holy Spirit they indeed manifest the life of Jesus in their body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, they do not know that the Lord Jesus can heal their sickness, nor have they heard that His life is also for their humble body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They never apply their faith to appropriate the Lord's healing of their body in the way that they did for the Lord's cleansing and enlivening of their dead spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result, they do not manifest the life of Jesus in their "mortal flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By the grace of the Lord they endure pain but do not receive healing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They have the experience of verse 10 but not of verse 11.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this verse we see how God heals us and strengthens us by the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When our mortal body is strengthened, the nature of this body is not changed to be immortal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The nature of the body stays the same; it is the life which supplies strength to the body that is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the past we depended on our natural life as the source of our strength, but now we depend on the life of Christ for our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can be strengthened to work because we have the resurrection life of Christ for our body's sustenance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The apostle did not mean that having once lived by the Lord, he would never be weak again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever the power of Christ did not rest upon him, he would be as weak as before.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may lose the manifestation of the life of the Lord Jesus in our body by way of carelessness, independence, or sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes there may be no shortcomings in ourselves, but simply because we boldly attack the power of darkness, we face its assault on our body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At other times we may suffer constantly for the sake of the Body of Christ because of our deep experience with it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, a man usually does not experience these last two unless he is very spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One thing is certain: although we may be weak, God's will is that we would never be handicapped, fail in His work, or cause Him to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The apostle Paul was often weak, but God's work was never weakened because of it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We recognize God's infinite authority, but we must not excuse ourselves of our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here we see that "the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh," is based upon "always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In other words, we must deny our own life completely before the life of Jesus will be manifested in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this we see the relationship between a spiritual, selfless living and a healthy body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's life is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He manifests His life in our body for the sake of accomplishing His own work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He does not have the intention of giving us His life and strength so that we may work and live for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He does not give His life to our body so that we may waste His strength; nor does He supply strength for the accomplishment of our purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we do not completely live for Him, He has no desire to give us this life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here we see the reason that many seek healing and strength but never get them: they think that health and strength are something for them to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They seek God's life for their body in order that they may be more comfortable, happy, free, and less bound when taking any action.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That is why they still remain in weakness and inability.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God will never give us His life for our private use in order that we may live by our self-life and cause His purpose to continually suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is now waiting for His children to come to their end before He will give them what they are seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is meant by "the putting to death of Jesus"?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is the life of the Lord Jesus which continually delivers the self unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord's whole life was one of self-denial.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Until death He never did anything by Himself; rather, He carried out God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The apostle tells us that he allowed the death of Jesus to work in his body so that the life of the Lord Jesus could also be manifest in his mortal flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Can we receive such a teaching?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God is now waiting for those who are willing to accept the death of the Lord Jesus so that He may live in their body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Who is willing to obey God's will completely?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Who will not initiate anything by himself?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Who is willing to continually assault the power of darkness for God's sake?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Who refuses to use his body for accomplishing anything for himself?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This kind of person deserves to have the life of the Lord Jesus manifested in his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we pay attention to the aspect of death, God will take care of the aspect of life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we consecrate our weakness to Him, He gives His strength to us.</S>
