   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RICHES OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The riches of a wealthy man are in his abundance of money, and the riches of a wealthy farmer are in his abundance of land.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What are the riches of God?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In what can God s riches be seen?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can find a few items in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are the riches of God s grace Eph 1:7 , the riches of God s glory v. 18; 3:16; Rom 9:23 , and the riches of God s kindness, forbearance, and long-suffering 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the revelation in the entire Bible, the riches of God are seen in life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Among the many items of God s creation life is the richest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mankind began with one person, Adam, who propagated and multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now mankind covers the entire earth because the human life is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The life of our God is even richer than the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s riches are also seen in the manifestation of His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man possesses love, honesty, endurance, purity, and forbearance as human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man was made in the image of God and according to God s likeness Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that God has forbearance, and therefore, He created forbearance in man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God also has long-suffering, and therefore, He created long-suffering in man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All of God s attributes are the source of our human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man s greatest characteristic is not in having an intelligent mind, in developing huge potentials, or in achieving a great career; the greatest characteristic of man is that his virtues can express God s attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, human virtues are the greatest characteristic of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Philippians 4:8 says, What things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, what things are well spoken of,...take account of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These things are the human virtues that are derived from God and are made according to God s likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The source of every human virtue is God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is rich in love, rich in mercy, rich in forbearance, and rich in many other attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During the past two thousand years of human history, ancient philosophers acknowledge that there is a sovereign One in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, Confucius said, He who offends Heaven has none to whom he can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Confucius referred to this sovereign One as Heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is similar to the prodigal son likening God to heaven when he spoke to his father in Luke 15:21, saying, I have sinned against heaven and before you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before the Lord Jesus incarnation, before He dwelt among men, mankind always wondered about God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They wondered whether God is forbearing or generous, narrow or broadminded, strict or loving.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, it was not until the Lord Jesus was incarnated, that is, when God was expressed through Jesus Christ, that human beings could see God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The record in the four Gospels of the Lord Jesus life on earth shows that the virtues of the Lord Jesus were the expression of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus was meek, caring, compassionate, forbearing, and upright.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His love was the love of God, His mercy was the mercy of God, and His compassion was the compassion of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The life of Jesus on earth was the practical expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Men saw the expressed God in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before Jesus came, people did not know God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They wondered whether God was lovely or detestable, generous or narrow, loving or strict.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, in Jesus, God was openly manifested before men.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, 1 Timothy 3:16 says, Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Jesus came, God was expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everything about the Lord Jesus, what He did, His speaking, attitude, conduct, behavior, and the way He treated others, fully expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God s attributes and virtues are His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is so rich that His riches overflow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When God s riches overflow, they become His fullness, and this fullness is the expression of God.</S>
