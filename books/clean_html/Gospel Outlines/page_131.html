<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The futility of depending upon works
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The human disposition is corrupted. Although man would do good, his goodness has a limit. Sometimes he might be able to do a little bit of good, but even that he can never do perfectly.</li>
	<li>Human works are imperfect and defiled. In fact, man has no power to do good. Even in honoring our parents, our motive within is impure.</li>
	<li>Therefore, no man is justified in the presence of God by his own works.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The trustworthiness of Christ&rsquo;s forgiveness
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The death of Christ resolves the problem of man&rsquo;s sins.</li>
	<li>The resurrection of Christ enables man to obtain the position and life of justification.</li>
	<li>Christ, by His death, has paid the ransom for man&rsquo;s sins, therefore He is able to forgive sins. Because of Christ&rsquo;s position and life in resurrection, He is able to justify man. Therefore, the Scripture says, &ldquo;that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins: and by Him everyone that believeth is justified from all things.&rdquo;</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to obtain Christ&rsquo;s forgiveness and justification
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that you are sinful, and that you have no strength to do good.</li>
	<li>Confess that Christ has died and resurrected for you.</li>
	<li>Receive Christ as your Savior.</li>
	</ol></li>
