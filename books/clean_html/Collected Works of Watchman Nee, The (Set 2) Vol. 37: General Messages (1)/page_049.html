<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE DIVIDING OF THE SOUL<br />FROM THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 4:12-13</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>The dividing of the soul from the spirit is a very important thing. It has to do with the growth of the Christian life. If a Christian cannot tell the difference between the soul and the spirit, how can he seek after that which is spiritual? He will often take soulish things for spiritual things, always live a life in the soul, and not seek after that which is spiritual. God's Word mentions many times what the soul is like and what the spirit is like. The Bible mentions some people who grieve in the soul and some people who grieve in the spirit. It mentions some people who rejoice in the soul and some people who rejoice in the spirit. Some draw the conclusion from these verses that the spirit must be the same as the soul because they have similar functions. However, this is like saying that you are me since you can eat and I can eat. Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit." Since the soul and the spirit can be divided from each other, it is clear that the spirit is the spirit and the soul is the soul.</p><p>Genesis 2 shows us that when God created man, He breathed the breath of life into his nostrils. When this breath of life came in contact with the human body, the soul was produced. Verse 7 speaks of man becoming a living soul. This means that the outstanding feature of man is his soul. The breath of life is the spirit of man; it came from God. The spirit has a God-consciousness; it responds to God's voice and is able to fellowship with God. But after Adam fell, his spirit became dead towards God. Thereafter, Adam's spirit (as well as his descendants' spirit) was dominated by the soul. In the end, the spirit and the soul were mixed together. At the time man is saved, his spirit becomes alive to God once more. Yet because of the long period of mixture with the soul, the spirit now needs God's word in order to be divided from the soul.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Although the spirit and the soul are similar in function, they belong to two different realms. They have two different sources. You may be happy today, but your happiness may be from the soul or from the spirit. In both cases it is happiness, but there is a distinction between the places from which the happiness comes. You may be sad today, but your sadness may be from the soul or from the spirit. In both cases it is sadness, but there is a distinction between the places from which the sadness comes. God is concerned about the source from which a thing comes. For example, Abraham was about to beget a son. At that time he was very old, and there did not seem to be much hope. He waited for a long time without seeing God's promise being fulfilled. Then his wife came up with a plan; she suggested that Abraham marry Hagar. Eventually Ishmael was produced. Fourteen years later God gave him Isaac through his wife Sarah. If we only read Genesis 15&mdash;17 and 21, we will not know what Isaac and Ishmael represent. In Galatians 4, we find out what Isaac and Ishmael represent. Paul said that one was born according to promise, while the other was born according to flesh. Do we see the distinction here? Man thinks that as long as one has a son, everything is all right. But God asks where the son comes from. We think that as long as we have a son, be it an Isaac or an Ishmael, we will be satisfied. But God's Word says that Ishmael represents the flesh, while Isaac represents the spirit. Ishmael represents what man acquires through his own wisdom and strength, while Isaac represents what man receives from God and what is of God.</p><p>Then what does it mean to be soulish? Being soulish is doing things by the self. What does it mean to be spiritual? Being spiritual is doing things by God. These are two entirely different things. A person can do things without waiting on God and without trusting in Him. This is soulish and fleshly. He can also speak and move only when God tells him to speak and move, looking to God, waiting on Him, and trusting in Him. This is what it means to be spiritual. We have to ask whether everything we do is done in the Holy Spirit. This is a crucial question. We often do the right things, yet something within us still condemns them. We condemn them not because they are bad but because they do not originate from God and are not the result of the operation of the Holy Spirit.</p>
