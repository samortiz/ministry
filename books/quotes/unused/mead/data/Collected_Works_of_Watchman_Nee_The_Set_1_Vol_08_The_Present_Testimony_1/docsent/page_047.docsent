   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LETTER ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR By Ruth Lee Issue No. 16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brothers and sisters in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The messages in this issue closely follow the previous issue No. 15 . May the Lord bless all of us so that we would truly gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to believe that the overcoming life is not a theory; on the contrary, it is something that every Christian can attain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many brothers and sisters are aware of the fact that our brother Watchman Nee has been weak and ill for the past two to three years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although he is resting, he has not dropped his work completely.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we feel that he should have full rest, and we have advised him not to do anything for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Present Testimony this year will continue, and we will not disappoint the readers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But, perhaps, Notes on Scriptural Messages will be changed to one issue per month for the next three to four months.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Brother Nee becomes well, it will resume on a bimonthly basis.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some brothers and sisters have written personal letters to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Please excuse him for not being able to answer you personally.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although printing costs have increased twenty percent since July, we thank the Lord for His grace that the zealous supply of brothers and sisters everywhere has covered all the shortages.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Concerning the gospel tracts, many have inquired about the printing costs.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will repeat what we announced in Issue No. 14 of this magazine: the gospel tracts are not for sale, but are given away at no charge in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our purpose, however, is to help those who do not have the ability and yet are burdened to do this work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who are able can help with the printing and mailing costs according to their ability.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We would like to supply those who do not have through the many who have.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not wish to see those who do not have stop their work because of their lack of means.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the same time, we do not wish to see others become negligent in contributing their part in helping this work just because we are giving these tracts away at no charge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The musical score for the Little Flock Hymnal, provisional edition, has been drafted, but we have not yet printed it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to wait until the other hymns are ready before we can categorize them according to subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this reason, we still cannot publish it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We thank the brothers and sisters who are concerned for this matter!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Peace be to you in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>September 1930</S>
