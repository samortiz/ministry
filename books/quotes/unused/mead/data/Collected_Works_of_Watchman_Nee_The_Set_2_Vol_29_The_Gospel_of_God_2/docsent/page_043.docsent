   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE AGE OF THE NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider Revelation 21.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 1 through 7 say, "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death will be no more, nor will there be sorrow or crying or pain anymore; for the former things have passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And He who sits on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And He said, Write, for these words are faithful and true.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And He said to me, They have come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he will be a son to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The description of the kingdom in Revelation 19 and 20 is entirely different from the description of the new heaven and new earth in chapter twenty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When describing the kingdom, the Bible speaks about what man has done.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when it describes the new heaven and new earth, there is no more mention of what man has done.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From chapter twenty-one on, the Bible simply speaks of what God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God said that He has made all things new.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God said that the first heaven and the first earth have passed away and that the sea is no more.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All these are done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The tabernacle of God will be with men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He shall tabernacle with men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are His people; God Himself will dwell with us and will be our God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He will wipe away all our tears, so that we will have no more death, sorrow, crying, or pain, for all the former things will have passed away, and all things will have been made new.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God said all these words are faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said that He is the Alpha and the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man has no place here at all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These verses go on and on, telling us what God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is no condition or demand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you wish to know how to obtain such a wonderful new heaven and new earth, just listen to His word: "And He said to me, They have come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End" v. 6a . In other words, everything is done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely" v. 6b . After all these things have been said, everything is summed up in one sentence: "I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely." As long as there is the thirst, as long as there is the need, God will give from the spring of the water of life freely.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Grace is to give from the spring of the water of life freely.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The new heaven and the new earth is of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. The new heaven and the new earth are absolutely from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The next verse says, "He who overcomes will inherit these things."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Who are these overcomers to whom John refers?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The overcomers here are different from the overcomers in the epistles to the seven churches at the beginning of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here, by the use of the term overcomers, a distinction is being made between the worldly people and the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The distinction here is not between one kind of Christian and another kind of Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The overcoming in the first three chapters of Revelation is the overcoming by some Christians among other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the overcoming in chapter twenty-one is the overcoming by the Christians among the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How can we drink of the water of life?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who believe can drink.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to drink of the water of life freely, we have to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is faith that enables us to overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Compared to the worldly people, every Christian is an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But compared to other Christians, many Christians are failing ones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Compared to those in the world, we are all overcomers because we have a faith before God that the worldly people do not have.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those who overcome and those who drink of the water of life will inherit these things, and God will be God to them, and they will be sons to God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Chapter twenty-two also mentions the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verses 1 through 5 say, "And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>And there will no longer be a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>And the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His slaves will serve Him; and they will see His face, and His name will be on their forehead.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>And night will be no more; and they have no need of the light of a lamp and of the light of the sun, for the Lord God will shine upon them; and they will reign forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The main thing in the New Jerusalem is the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This river proceeds from the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because it is the river of life, there is the tree of life, with the fruit of life growing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Revelation 22, after everything has been said, one thing is prominent, the river of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This river of the water of life flows throughout the city.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How can we enjoy the river of the water of life?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At the end of Revelation, after the kingdom is over and after the church is over, verse 17 says, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>And let him who hears say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>And let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In other words, everyone is welcomed into the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the new heaven and new earth there is a throne, and beneath the throne there is a river.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The river comes forth from God and has the throne as its source.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The throne is the center of the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Furthermore, the word Lamb is never mentioned related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But in the new heaven and new earth, the Lamb is indeed mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The throne is of God and of the Lamb 22:1 ; the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of the city 21:22 ; and the Lamb is the lamp of the city 21:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That the Lamb is mentioned related to the new heaven and new earth indicates that this will be an age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we come to the end of Revelation, the church, the kingdom, and the tribulation are no longer mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Instead, we find only that all who are thirsty can come and take of the water of life freely.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This means that you are invited to the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Everything is free.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>And that it is free means that it is of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Therefore, the new heaven and new earth are entirely different from the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The new heaven and new earth are freely given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>According to the teaching of Revelation, we can say that in the new heaven and new earth God deals with man in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the kingdom, however, He deals with the Christians in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Therefore, we have to admit that it is in the kingdom that God chastises us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In the new heaven and new earth everything is received freely.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In this we see the relationship between today and the future.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we love the world today, walk by the flesh, and live a loose life, in the age to come we will be chastised by God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But if we love the Lord today and forsake everything for the Lord's sake, we will receive God's grace and His reward.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is the biblical teaching concerning these three ages.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I am not responsible for what I am speaking here.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I am only speaking God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>God's Word says that in the coming age there will be these things.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>God Himself is responsible for all of His own words.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I only know that the Son of God has said these words.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It is true that a man can enjoy eternal life today.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But the kingdom is the time when God will deal with His children.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If you live a loose life today, you will be disciplined in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Hence, we have eternal security, but we also have temporary danger.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We have the security of the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But we also have the peril of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In the kingdom we may suffer severe punishment and chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Whereas salvation is settled by the work of the Lord Jesus, reward is judged by one's work.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Salvation comes by the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Reward comes by our own work.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We are rewarded because we obey the will of God and walk not according to our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>May we treasure the grace that we have received, and may we receive the warning from God and pursue after the reward of the kingdom.</S>
