   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO THE GENUINE SERVICE Date:Evening, February 25, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading:Eph 4:11-12, 16 MAINTAINING A FRESH CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Watchman Nee:These are sobering days.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some of you have handed yourselves over to the Lord and are willing to rise up to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You might have struggled a little at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During your struggle you might have experienced pain and sadness, but once you offered yourself, you were filled with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I can sense your feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many people have filled out a consecration slip and indicated a willingness to offer all, including future, career, time, and body to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But today I want to ask a question: Is your feeling different today from when you handed yourself over to the Lord ten or twenty days ago?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It seems as if your feeling tonight is not as strong as it was a few days ago.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever we slip back in our consecration, we slip back in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every day we have to ask ourselves, "Am I still fresh?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Am I still shining inwardly?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Christian life is like polishing shoes; they must be polished again and again to maintain a shine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we feel that we are no longer shining inwardly, we have to ask the Lord if something is wrong with us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to find out why we have lost the heavenly taste.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must learn to maintain a fresh consecration all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Old Testament, the fire in the outer court was lighted only once.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After that it needed wood and sacrifice daily to keep the fire burning day and night Lev 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fire could only be lighted once.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One does not wait until the fire goes out to light it again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fire on the altar is an unceasing fire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to keep it burning, there must be sacrifices every day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the New Testament we offer ourselves as a living sacrifice Rom 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to keep the fire burning, we need to offer ourselves up continually as a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A living sacrifice means that we offer ourselves to God as a sacrifice while we are living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If there is sin, reservation, or staleness in us, or if we forego our consecration, the divine fire on the altar will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not do anything that hurts ourselves, if we will not inflict pain on our feelings, love, will, ambition, human aspirations, desires, and hopes, we have stopped offering ourselves as a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we have never hurt ourselves once, we can claim that we are filled with joy, but this joy will be unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once we offer up everything as an offering, we have sacrificed ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We will suffer loss, pain, and wounds, but God will gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, if you feel that your joy in the last few days has waned, you can try giving away some of your cherished items again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you give them away with one hand, you may be filled with pain and hurt, but you will receive joy with the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It seems as if you are acting against yourself, but this is the only way to ensure that your joy remains.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please forgive me for saying this: The joy in some people's face changes all the time, but when others make a decision, they never change back.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If our consecration does not change, our joy will not change.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those whose joy has changed have changed their consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we want to maintain and even deepen our joy, we need a constant consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A Christian's face is a window.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From this window we see his consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is one thing to fill out a consecration slip.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is another thing to draw a sword to kill.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We admit that we are too slow in reviewing and processing your consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The brothers and sisters who are responsible for this work are not experienced enough.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But what we have offered to the Lord belongs to Him forever.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot regret and try to take it back.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must never eat what we have vomited.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Otherwise, we will lose the blessing of the Lord which we are entitled to receive from Him.</S>
