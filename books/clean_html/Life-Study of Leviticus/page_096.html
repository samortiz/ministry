<h2 class=head1>X. THE SONS OF ISRAEL NOT EATING ANY FAT OF AN OX, A SHEEP, OR A GOAT</h2><p>“You shall not eat any fat of an ox, a sheep, or a goat” (Lev. 7:23). This signifies that in their daily living the sons of Israel should consider God’s food, as indicated by the fat of the ox, sheep, and goat, which fat signifies the tender, fine, and excellent part of the person of Christ.<p>This matter is crucial. As priests, in our eating we need to be concerned about God’s food and should not eat the fat, which is God’s portion. When we are practicing our priestly service, we are serving God, and we should consider not our own things but God’s things. The fat, the top portion of the offerings, must not be eaten by the priests but must be offered to God for His satisfaction.<h2 class=head1>XI. THE FAT OF CATTLE WHICH DIED OF THEMSELVES OR WERE TORN BY BEASTS NOT EATEN BY THE SONS OF ISRAEL BUT PUT TO OTHER USES</h2><p>“The fat of that which dies of itself and the fat of that which is torn by beasts may be put to any other use, but you shall certainly not eat it” (v. 24). This signifies that the dirtiness of death spoils the significance of God’s enjoyment of Christ. God hates death and does not want to look upon anything related to it.<h2 class=head1>XII. WHOEVER EATS THE FAT OF AN OFFERING BY FIRE OFFERED TO JEHOVAH BEING CUT OFF FROM HIS PEOPLE</h2><p>“Whoever eats the fat of a beast from which an offering by fire is offered to Jehovah, the person who eats shall be cut off from his people” (v. 25). This signifies that we who enjoy Christ as our offering to God should keep the excellent part of the person of Christ for God that we might not be put aside from the fellowship of the enjoyment of Christ. This fellowship of the enjoyment of Christ refers to the Lord’s table. At the Lord’s table, we have the fellowship of the enjoyment of Christ.<h2 class=head1>XIII. THE BLOOD, WHETHER OF BIRD OR OF BEAST, NOT EATEN BY THE SONS OF ISRAEL</h2><p>“Moreover, wherever you dwell you shall not eat any blood, whether of bird or of beast” (v. 26). This signifies that only the blood of Jesus should be taken by us for our redemption (John 6:53-56; Heb. 9:12).<h2 class=head1>XIV. ANY PERSON WHO EATS ANY BLOOD BEING CUT OFF FROM HIS PEOPLE</h2><p>“Any person who eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people” (v. 27). This signifies that anyone who regards the blood of Christ as a common thing shall be put aside from the fellowship of the enjoyment of Christ. We must regard the blood of Christ as special, particular, and precious. If we eat other blood, we make the blood of Christ common. This is sin.<h2 class=head1>XV. THE OFFERER OF THE PEACE OFFERING BRINGING PARTS OF HIS OFFERING FOR THE OFFERINGS OF JEHOVAH BY FIRE, THE FAT BURNED TO GOD BY FIRE ON THE ALTAR WITH THE BREAST AS A WAVE OFFERING BEFORE JEHOVAH FOR AARON AND HIS SONS</h2><p>“He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to Jehovah shall bring his offering to Jehovah from the sacrifice of his peace offerings: his own hands shall bring the offerings of Jehovah by fire; he shall bring the fat with the breast, that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before Jehovah. And the priest shall offer up the fat in smoke on the altar; but the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons” (vv. 29-31). This signifies that we who take Christ as our peace offering should offer the excellent part of Christ (the fat) to God for His satisfaction, with the loving part of Christ (the breast) in resurrection for the serving ones’ enjoyment.<p>The wave offering refers to Christ in His resurrection. The top part of the peace offering is for God; it is burned by fire and goes to God. The loving part, the breast, is allotted to us, the serving ones, for our enjoyment.
