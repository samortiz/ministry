<h2 class="head1">A TALK TO THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN BUSINESS<br />AND WHO HAVE HANDED THEMSELVES OVER</h2><h2 class="head2">Not Being Unequally Yoked<br />with the Unbelievers</h2><p>Tonight we have something to say to the brothers who are engaged in business and who have handed themselves over. We have gathered together you brothers who have handed yourselves over in order to have some fellowship with you. Before you handed yourselves over, there may have been some people whom you had business dealings with. Presently, you may also have some unbelieving business partners. At a certain time, these relationships will have to be terminated, because your goal and their goals are not the same. Sooner or later there will be conflicts of interests. We hope that you will do your best to separate yourselves from them within a short time.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning to Coordinate One with Another</h2><p>The second thing is that you have to learn to coordinate with one another. The money you earn is for God, and the money I earn is also for God. We have to learn to be delivered from our individual circles. What I have personally is not a concern of my own, but a concern of the Body. These concerns should be considered within the coordination. Formerly, your goal was for yourselves. Now your goal is changed, and this puts all of us together in the same place.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING FROM THE FAILURE OF THE PAST</h2><p>Witness Lee: Concerning going into business, we had some experiences in the past. First, in the beginning everyone shared everything in common. After a while, each one began to have some possessions and works of his own, and some degradation set in with respect to money. Still later, the brothers and sisters began to form partnerships in investments and business enterprises, and the situation became even worse. According to my knowledge, not once did we see a good result when brothers went into business together. Cases of arbitration and settlement were especially frequent among the brothers. This is why I advised everyone not to go into business ventures together. Instead, it is better that they should engage in business alone.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM RICHES</h2><p>Despite what I said, we frequently saw that some have capital but are unable to operate a business, whereas others can operate a business but do not have the capital. In some cases a person has both but does not have the strength to do anything. In the past we did not have enough light. As a result, when the brothers came together, it was difficult for them to be without opinion. Once opinion came in, the testimony was lost, and what was done was not done to the glory of God. We could not handle the matter properly because we were not delivered from riches yet. Because of this, there was no coordination among us, and we became poor. As far as the work is concerned, we are the poorest among all Christian groups. Today I sent out fifteen to sixteen hundred letters to the brothers and sisters to fellowship with them about the purchase of the meeting hall. I was not happy in my heart about this matter. Our present meeting hall is already packed to the brim. Our present meeting hall will not meet even a fraction of the present need. All the while, however, we are telling the saints to bring others to our gospel meetings. Where are they going to sit if they all come?</p><p>Today we are poor. But what is the reason that we are so poor? The reason is that money has been kept back in our own hands. We have become so fallen that all our hands have become empty again. The work has no money, and you have no money. The reason for our poverty is that we have not been delivered from riches yet. When the money goes into your pocket, your heart falls in love with money. The minute we start arguing, all blessings are gone. You said that you have handed yourselves over, and you have listed all your possessions. But when I read the lists over and over again, I find nothing that can be taken up by us.</p><p>The amount of spiritual need should be matched by the amount of material supply. It is still right for us to go into business. But in order to do that, we must first hand over our individualism. Perhaps some brothers disagree with going into business together. But how much can one person's capital do? The move of the gospel must catch up with the need of the age. In order to catch up with the age, there is the need for coordination. In the world men conduct business by taking an airplane and by doing it on a large scale. But we have not given our time to anything. When we preach the gospel, we do not have any advertisements, and we do not do anything in the newspaper. The reason for this is that we do not have the money. If the brothers who are in business realize the great need in the gospel, they should rise up to do something in an aggressive way. All that the brothers need to do is to keep enough for their own use; the rest should be offered up to the work. If we do not offer up ourselves in this way, there is not much hope that we can go on.</p>
