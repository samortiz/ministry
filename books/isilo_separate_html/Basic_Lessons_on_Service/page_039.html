From Our Side Based upon<br>the Trespass Offering and the Sin Offering</H2><P>From our side the peace offering is based upon the trespass offering (Lev. 5) and the sin offering (Lev. 4). The peace offering is the center of the basic offerings. From God's side, you have the burnt offering and the meal offering for the satisfaction both to God and to man. The experience of the peace offering is based mainly upon the burnt offering and the meal offering. Then from our side, the peace offering is based upon the trespass offering and the sin offering. On our side, there is the need of the trespass offering and the sin offering to take care of our trespasses and our sin. Then we can have peace with God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Required Peace Offering</H2><P>The required peace offering was either an ox from the herd (Lev. 3:1), a sheep from the flock (v. 6), a lamb (v. 7, KJV), or a goat (v. 12). Here we have to tell the saints that Christ in Himself is the same, but Christ in our experience becomes different. Some experience Him in a rich way as a great ox; some experience Him as a sheep; some experience Him in a little way as a little lamb; and some even experience Him in a lesser way as a goat. The differences in the peace offering are not in Christ Himself but in our experience of Him. We offer Christ according to the measure and depth of our experience of Christ.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> </body></html>
