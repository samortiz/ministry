   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MEETING Scripture Reading: Heb 10:25; Matt 18:20; Acts 2:42; 1 Cor 14:23, 26 I. CORPORATE GRACE BEING FOUND IN THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's Word says, "Not abandoning our own assembling together" Heb 10:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why should we not abandon the assembling together?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because God dispenses His grace to us through the assembling together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's grace to man can be divided into two categories --personal and corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God gives us not only personal grace but also corporate grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This corporate grace can be found only in the assembling together or the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have already spoken of the subject of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One can learn to pray by himself at home; there is no doubt that God listens to such prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God listens to individual prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, there is another kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order for this other kind of prayer to be answered, it must be prayed in the meetings, in the principle of two or three asking together in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a person tries to do this alone, he will not get any answer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many great matters must be prayed over in the meetings before God will answer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They must be brought to the prayer meeting before we see them come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's corporate grace comes to man only through the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may think that it is sufficient for a man to pray alone and that he can seek God's mercy by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the experience of many people tells us that individual prayers alone will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It seems that unless two or three people pray, or all the brothers and sisters come together to pray, God will not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we have two kinds of answers to prayers: One is answer to individual prayers, and the other is answer to assembly prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do not meet with others, some prayers will not be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have also spoken of reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, God will give us individual grace when we read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, some portions of the Word cannot be opened up by one person alone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God gives light when we meet, when we assemble ourselves together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In such a meeting, some brothers may be led to open up a particular portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There may not be any speaking concerning that particular portion of the Word, yet the fact that everyone is assembled together gives God the opportunity to shed His light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many brothers and sisters can testify that they understand more of God's Word in the meeting than when they study it individually.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many times in the meeting, God opens up one portion of the Word through another portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As one person speaks on one passage, light shines on another passage.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way more light is unveiled, and we receive grace in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do not meet with others, the most we can have is individual grace; we will miss a great part of the corporate grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God will only give us corporate grace in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not meet with others, we will not receive this grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why the Bible charges us not to abandon our assembling together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE CHURCH AND THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One outstanding characteristic of the church is that it meets.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A Christian can never substitute meetings with "self-taught" pursuits.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has a category of grace reserved for the meetings only.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do not meet with others, that portion of corporate grace will not be available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Old Testament God commanded the Israelites to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In many places in the Bible they are called the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That they were called a congregation meant they had to meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we come to the New Testament, the revelation is even clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have the clear commandment not to abandon "our own assembling together."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God is not that interested in individuals being "self-taught."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must assemble ourselves together before we can receive His corporate grace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No forsaker of meetings will keep His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a foolish thing to abandon assembling together.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A man must meet; he must come together with other children of God before he can receive the corporate grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible gives explicit commandments as well as clear examples of people meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the Lord was on the earth, He often met with His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He met with them on the mountain Matt 5:1 , in the wilderness Mark 6:32-34 , at home 2:1-2 , and at the seaside 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the last evening before His crucifixion, He borrowed a large upper room and met with the disciples 14:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After His resurrection, He appeared in the midst of their gathering John 20:19, 26; Acts 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before the day of Pentecost, the disciples gathered together in one accord to pray v. 14 . When the day of Pentecost came, they were also gathered together 2:1 . After that they continued steadfastly in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Shortly thereafter, they were persecuted and went back to their own places.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Yet they still met together 4:23-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After Peter was released, he went to the house where the disciples were gathered together 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>First Corinthians 14 tells us clearly that the whole church gathered together v. 23 . It was the whole church that gathered together.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No one who is part of the church can be exempt from meeting together with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What is the meaning of the word church?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The word church is ekklesia in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Ek means "to come out," while klesia means "to congregate or to gather."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus, ekklesia means the gathering of those who have been called out.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God is not only after some called out ones; He wants the called out ones to gather together.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If all the called out ones are separated from one another, we will not have the church; the church will not be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After we have believed in the Lord there is a basic need we must take care of, that is, to come together with other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should never have the strange thought that we can be "self-taught" Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must eliminate such a thought from our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Christianity does not have "self-taught" Christians; it only has the gathering of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do not think that we can be Christians who just shut ourselves up to pray and to read the Bible alone at home.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christianity is not built on just individuals but also on the assembling together.</S>
