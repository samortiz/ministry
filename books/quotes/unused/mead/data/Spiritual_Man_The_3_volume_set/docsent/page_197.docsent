   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many times the burden in the spirit is for us to pray Col 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Actually, we cannot pray more than our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To continue to pray without a burden is surely ineffective, and it comes from the self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The burden of prayer that comes from the spirit can only be relieved through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Actually, all burdens are this way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If God burdens our spirit with a certain burden, we can only relieve the burden in our spirit by fulfilling what God wants us to do, either through prayer or through proclaiming His message.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only when we have a burden in our spirit to pray can we pray in the Holy Spirit, and only then can we pray with groanings which cannot be uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When there is a burden in our spirit to pray, nothing can alleviate this burden and nothing can release us except prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the things we pray for are accomplished, the burden is immediately lifted from us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many times believers have accumulated too many burdens of prayer in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When they begin to pray, it seems to be a very painful task.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the more the believers pray, the more their spirit will say amen.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must try our best to thoroughly pray out what is burdening us in our spirit, until the burden is fully removed from us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more we express our life in our prayers as well as everything we have, the more comfortable we will become.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But there is a temptation in this kind of prayer to stop praying before the burden is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Most believers think that as soon as they are somewhat relieved in their spirit, their prayers are answered.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually this is the time when proper spiritual work begins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we turn away to do other things at this juncture, the spiritual work will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Believers must not be misled to think that all spiritual works are happy and joyful; nor should they think that once there is some kind of burden, they have lost their spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is very unfortunate that believers do not realize that the burden in the spirit is the source of real spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only those who suffer in this way for God and men truly do not live for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the other ones who seek for joy in their feelings and who are afraid of taking up any burden for the church are living for themselves and are soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, when God gives us a burden, we should not think that we have fallen or that we have committed some errors.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Satan loves to see us think this way, for this kind of thinking spares him from our attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not misunderstand ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we listen to Satan and think that there is something wrong with us, we will come under his accusations even more and suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Genuine spiritual work is an assault on Satan and a travail in birth for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is indeed no joy to this!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This requires one to die to the self in the deepest way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason, no soulish believer can truly participate in spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Having a happy feeling all day long is not a proof of a believer's spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The right kind of believers advance with God without caring for their own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times when believers are burdened in their spirit to fight with the enemy, they prefer to be alone and cut off all fellowship with the world, so that they can concentrate in their warfare with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the end of this warfare, it is difficult to find any trace of a smile on their face.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, all spiritual believers should welcome the burdens from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Believers must know the laws of the spirit and the way to cooperate with God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Otherwise, they will neglect such burdens and consequently suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Soon they even lose their burdens and do not participate in the most glorious co-labor with God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, every time there is a burden in the spirit, they should immediately find out what the burden is in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If it is a call to fight, they should fight.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If it is a call to preach the gospel, they should preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If it is a call to prayer, they should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They should seek to work together with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They should move the old burdens out of the way, so that the new burdens can come.</S>
