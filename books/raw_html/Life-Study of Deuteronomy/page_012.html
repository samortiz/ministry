<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. ULTIMATELY THIS BOOK SHOWS US THAT<br>THE LOVE OF GOD CONSUMMATELY WORKS<br>FOR HIS PEOPLE THAT THEY MAY ENJOY<br>HIS FULL BLESSING ACCORDING TO<br>HIS WILL AND FOREKNOWLEDGE</H2><P>Ultimately this book shows us that the love of God consummately works for His people that they may enjoy His full blessing according to His will and foreknowledge. In spite of our failure in loving God and fearing Him and in spite of our unfaithfulness, God will be successful. No matter what the situation of His people may be, God will be faithful to the end, and eventually He will accomplish His intention that we enjoy His full blessing.</P><P>In Deuteronomy Moses is strong in rebuking the people. However, at the end of this book, we have the song of Moses and his full blessing to every tribe. Eventually, God's chosen and redeemed people entered into the holy land, possessed it, lived in it, and enjoyed it. That was God's success, and the boast and glory belong to no one other than Him.</P><P>What is revealed in Deuteronomy is what is revealed in the Bible as a whole. The entire Bible shows us that God is loving, righteous, and faithful. The Bible also exposes how unfaithful we are; it shows us how defeated we have been in the past and how much failure we will have in the future. But in spite of all this unfaithfulness, defeat, and failure, God will still enable His chosen people to enter into the rich Christ to possess Him, enjoy Him, experience Him, and even to live Him.</P>
