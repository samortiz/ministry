<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Planting, Watering, Growing,<br>Transforming, and Building</H2><P>In 1 Corinthians 3 we have seen the planting, watering, growing, transforming, and building (vv. 6-14). We are God's farm and God's building, and we are growing in life on God's farm to be produced as precious material for God's building.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Temple of God</H2><P>In chapter three Paul also speaks of the temple of God (vv. 16-17). The temple here is collective and corporate, not individual. We are many, but the temple is one. We can be made one by being fed, watered, built up, and transformed. By growing and being transformed we become the gold, silver, and precious stones, and we are built up together to be the temple of God. We are the temple of God, and the Holy Spirit dwells in us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>All Things Being for the Church</H2><P>At the end of chapter three, Paul said, "All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all are yours, but you are Christ's, and Christ is God's" (vv. 21-23). We need to realize that all things are for us, so all things are for the temple, the church. All things, including the heavens and the earth with all the plants, animals, and human beings, are for the church. Even Satan and the demons are for the church. Surely we hate Satan and the demons, but in His sovereignty God uses even them for the building up of the church.</P><P>Things present, things to come, life, and even death are for the church. All things are for the church. This is the fundamental point of God's purpose. God created the heavens, the earth, the angels, and all human beings for the church. God even allowed one of the angels to become His adversary, Satan, for the church. God also allowed many of the angels to rebel for the church. Everything is for the church.</P><P>The Corinthian believers foolishly said that they were of Paul and of Apollos, but Paul said that both he and Apollos were theirs. The church is not for Paul; Paul is for the church. Everything and everyone is for the church. All things are yours, and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's. This means that all things are for the church, the church is for Christ, and Christ is for God. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ (Col. 2:9), Christ is in the church, and the church is the center of the whole universe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Begetting Father</H2><P>Now let us consider chapter four of 1 Corinthians. In verse 15 Paul said, "For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel." The Corinthians were not Paul's students; they were his children. He was their begetting father.</P>
