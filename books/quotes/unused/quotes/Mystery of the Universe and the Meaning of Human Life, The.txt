Romans 1:19 and 20 say, 'Because that which is known of God is manifest within them, for God manifested it to them
It is unavoidable that throughout the centuries, scholars have been speculating in their study of heaven, earth, and man
The first sentence in the first book of the Bible says, 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth'
The advance of modern day science has only proved again and again that the revelation of the Bible is totally accurate
After billions of years, the order of the universe is still maintained, and the solar system still revolves in perfect order
We who live on this earth can still enjoy the distinct difference between spring and summer and the definite timing of day and night
Just as the great things in the universe operate according to their laws, so the smaller things have their principles
We all know that there is a law, a principle, to everything, and behind all things there must be One who establishes the laws and principles
We can have a glimpse of all that God is, all that God has, God's power, and God's divine characteristics through all things in the universe
Genesis 1, which is a record of God's creation of the universe, shows us how God created all things out of nothing and how He created man
Zechariah 12:1 says, 'Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him'
Since we were created according to Gods image even though we became fallen and corrupted to this day we still have these four elements in us
All this tells us that when man was created, he was created according to God's image of love, light, holiness, and righteousness
The gloves have been created for the hands; therefore, there must be the hands inside the gloves for the reality to be there
Today man feels empty, insecure, wavering, and restless and has no calming and stabilizing power within, simply because he lacks God within
Even though a radio may have all the outward parts, if there is no receiver, or if the receiver is out of order, this radio cannot function
Regardless of how hard you try to tune to the right frequency, you will not be able to receive the radio waves in the air
Our heart is like a radio, and our spirit is that receiver; if we turn our spirit to focus on God, we can touch Him
In your mind perhaps you have never thought about the existence of God, and you have never seen God with your eyes
Besides these provisions that are necessary for man's physical existence, something that is more precious within man is the human spirit
The gospel we preach today is not merely to tell people that they are sinful and must therefore believe in Jesus to avoid perdition
Not only so, but man is truly a wonderful living creature with thoughts and wisdom, being able to produce a spacecraft to land on the moon
All those who study science, physics, and medicine ultimately say that there must be a Sovereign One in the universe
From this we can see that the human heart desperately desires to find the true God who created the universe and all things in it
Many friends who have not yet believed in the Lord wonder why Christians seem to have something extra, something as a 'motor' in them
Some Christians previously spoke little, yet after they believed in Jesus, they try their best to preach Jesus to others
Now that they have gained Jesus as their Savior and therefore have a stabilizing power, how can they refrain from preaching to others?
When we are preaching the gospel, we ask that You remember our country, the head of our country, and all the government officials
We ask You further to grant Your visitation to all the people of this country so that they can hear the gospel
There are a few verses here that can be considered as the sweetest and richest in life in the whole of the Scripture
If we do not open our heart to let this God come in, as far as we ourselves are concerned, we are only an empty shell, an empty vessel
The spirit of man lost its function due to man's fall, so God came to be a man and died for us on the cross as our Savior
When He resurrected from the dead, He became the ever-living Spirit, not only forgiving our sins but also entering into us to be our life
The Lord who created the universe, the God of all, is actually willing to enter into us, who were created yet fallen people, to be our life
When we are endeavoring for our career, living a very busy life, we may not feel as much the pain of having no hope
After His death and resurrection, He returned to be among the disciples, breathed into them, and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
After saying that He is the bread of life and the water of life, one day He again spoke a very mysterious word
We have a physical life in the flesh and a soulish life as well, but we do not have the eternal, divine life of God
If we live by our created life in the flesh, we will not be satisfied, and our human life will be without a goal and without hope
Throughout human history, there has never been any leader or founder of a religion that has resurrected from the dead
The believers of the Lord Jesus all testified that before they met the Lord, their human living had been mostly empty and miserable
The next day when he went to work, his colleagues were greatly surprised when they saw that he did not smoke as he usually did
A few years later even the colleagues who lived in his neighborhood all believed in Jesus, household by household
One time after preaching the gospel, a judge came and said to me, 'I want to receive the Savior whom you preached
The next morning when he was on his way to the court, he suddenly felt that the heavens and the earth had changed their color
Not long afterward he quit his job as a judge and became a preacher to share with others the life that he had obtained
Not only so he said in Philippians 120b and 21a As always even now Christ will be magnified in my body whether through life or through death
To the sour tree, the sweet tree is its life, so it is no longer the sour tree that lives, but it is the sweet tree that lives in it
We beseech the brothers and sisters to receive a burden from the Lord to take care of these new ones and to pray much for this matter
The Bible does not merely teach us to know God and to worship God, nor does it teach us merely how to live and walk in an excelling way
Of these, the mystery of Christ and the mystery of the church are great and deep, and all these mysteries are unfathomable
He is the Upholder of the universe; as such, He upholds and bears all things so that the whole universe can operate orderly
He required people not only to be clean and pure in their outward behavior but also to be pure in their inward motive
These words which otherwise might sound proud and haughty contain a great deal of wisdom and cannot be spoken by ordinary people
Today, among the five great religions in the world, not one of them has been preached as widely as Christianity
Along with the spreading of the gospel, wars were to become rampant, and nation was to rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom
Geologists all acknowledge that there have never been so many earthquakes in these two thousand years as there have been in the recent days
We have to realize that even though the Bible teaches us how to conduct ourselves as human beings, this is not the center of the Bible
Only through His becoming flesh, going to the cross to die, and becoming the life-giving Spirit can He enter into man to dispense life
Love is God's essence , light is God's expression , holiness is God's nature , and righteousness is God's procedure
Before we believed in the Lord Jesus, sometimes we had a feeling of doing good, and sometimes we also had a feeling of sinfulness
God is righteousness, so we are proper and righteous in all the ways that we conduct ourselves and in our contact with people
The fact that we can live out such conditions proves that we are submitting ourselves to the Christ who lives within us
We hope that the saints can practice this word and spend more time to pray before the Lord to contact the Lord Himself
The Lord is already in us, so the more we pray, the more we allow Him to increase in us, have more ground in us, and spread more in us
Now Christ is lived out of us so that we may live a God-like living, that is, a living of love, light, holiness, and righteousness
The Christian life is a life that allows Christ to live out through us to express God's love, light, holiness, and righteousness
Philippians, a book concerning the experience of Christ, was written by the apostle Paul, who was full of the experience of Christ
In Philippians 4 Paul referred to six virtues being true being dignified being righteous being pure being lovely and being well spoken of
To be true is to be without falsehood, without lying, and without vanity, to be real and truthful in everything
These six items are divided into three groups: truthfulness and dignity, rightness and purity, and loveliness and being well spoken of
The Greek word for virtue spoken of by Paul in 4:8 denotes any virtue expressed through the development of the inner life
Such virtues are not produced by outward efforts; rather, they are manifested through the development of the inner life
If we look at the context of this book, these virtues are produced as the expression of letting Christ live in us
The Bible reveals that God Himself is the One who is true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of
For this reason, Confucian scholars spent a great deal of time to study whether the human nature is good or evil
After we sin lie or do something filthy on the one hand we feel regretful and sorrowful but on the other hand we want to improve ourselves
The intrinsic nature of this life fully corresponds to the image of God-love, light, holiness, and righteousness
Man has an inner desire to do good, but when he is actually going to do good, it is an entirely different story
We have the shell of love, light, holiness, and righteousness, but not the intrinsic substance of love, light, holiness, and righteousness
When we receive the Lord Jesus as life He as the embodiment of love light holiness and righteousness enters into us to be our life elements
We all have the experience that before we were saved, even though we wanted to listen to our parents and honor them, we could not do so
Now whenever we call on the Lord Jesus, He enters into us so that we can spontaneously honor our parents and obey them
Since he was small in stature and could not see Jesus in the crowd, he climbed up in a sycamore tree in order to see Him
Apparently, the Lord Jesus was standing outside of Zaccheus, but in reality He could be the dynamic salvation to him
The life of a Christian is not a life of correcting the outward conduct but a life of allowing Christ to enter in to be the motivating power
Today, because people do not have a full understanding of God's salvation, in their lives they are like cars without gas and electricity
They depend either on others to pull them from ahead or on their relatives and friends to push them from behind
Previously, they always liked to 'put up their fists,' but now there is Someone in them-the Lord Jesus-who draws their fists back
Do not ever think that Christians are those who belong to a charitable organization with the purpose of doing good deeds
The first lines of the chorus of Hymns, 538 read, 'It is God's intent and pleasure / That His Christ be wrought in me'
The Lord Jesus is our Savior, who saves us not only from perdition but also from our temper, anger, lies, and jealousy
Through us He is expressed as our virtues as truthfulness dignity righteousness purity loveliness and the quality of being well spoken of
Consequently, the intrinsic nature of the living we manifest before man is virtue, yet for others it becomes something worthy of praise
The gospel which we announce is 'Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,' as declared in 1 Corinthians 15:3
His death was a death with accomplishments, and His resurrection was a resurrection with even greater accomplishments
The chorus of Hymns 227 says Thine the cup of suffring Mine the cup of blessing For Thy love in Thy redemption Praise we ever sing!
Through the death of the Lord Jesus our sins were dealt with, and through His resurrection we have received His life
In the same manner, in our experience we may not speak anything sinful, yet we often commit sins in our thoughts
After we have sinned as promised in 1 John 1 as long as we confess to God He forgives us and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from every sin
After three days He was resurrected and transfigured into the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, to enter into us as life
When they go shopping after they have believed in Jesus the moment they pick up a dress within them Jesus may say Put it down and go home
If they would not obey and put it down thinking that they may be missing an opportunity unless they buy it the Lord will say Do not reason!
Because He is holy, when we do something that is incompatible with His nature, He troubles us within and makes us restless
Sometimes when we grumble to our mother, the Lord Jesus bothers us within, so we have no other way but to obey
After we have believed in the Lord Jesus, when we exercise our spirit by calling on His name, our spirit within is enlivened
The resurrected Jesus as the life-giving Spirit not only regenerated us, but also lives in us and makes us His home
After we are saved because He is living in us we have Him as our Lord and we are blessed because we are under His preserving and cherishing
In particular, we should be grateful for the various conveniences provided by the government which facilitate the gospel
In 1984 we compiled official statistics, which included more than six hundred churches from the six major continents over the whole earth
More than four hundred churches are in the Far East and Australia, and more than four hundred churches are in the Western Hemisphere
Currently, the country with the greatest number of churches is the United States, with a total of more than one hundred
It is because the population here is concentrated and because we have had forty years of history here since we first arrived in 1949
Of course, many brothers and sisters have come from overseas to join the training and to coordinate with the move of the Body
The Lord has already added to us many newly saved brothers and sisters, and we also have had meetings with the new ones in their homes
Since many new believers have just entered into the church life we would like to clarify where we stand among the many sects of Christianity
Generally, people are familiar with the term chiao-hui , but our usage of chao-hui in place of chiao-hui does have a basis
In the New Testament times this is the word the Lord Jesus used when He mentioned the church in speaking to the disciples
From 1860 to 1870, after some brothers in the United States were raised up, they studied the English word church
After 1915, a charismatic movement began in the United States which established a group, the Assemblies of God
From now on we will use chao-hui instead of chiao-hui in all of our publications in order to convey the proper meaning
Only the church of the Lord is a called-out congregation, so it only makes sense that it should be called chao-hui
In 1949 the brothers felt that a portion of the saints should leave mainland China and go overseas for the spread of the Lord's work
Since we worship God according to the Bible, we cannot accept the traditional denominations nor participate in the traditional divisions
In the United States there is the one moon in all the countries in Asia there is the one moon and in Europe there is still just the one moon
If you must give it a name, calling it 'the moon in the United States,' or 'the moon in Taiwan,' it is all right
If they are in Taipei, they are the members of the church in Taipei; if they go to Los Angeles, they are in the church in Los Angeles
In a typical Christian organization, we can see a group of people who are the preachers, pastors, teachers, and choir directors
If after two years, after they have been equipped in this way, they go out to get a job or do some business, this will be very good
Some may feel that they can go half-time and some one-quarter time, while some may feel that they can set apart their nights and holidays
Of course, the new believers may not know very much, so some who have been saved for a longer time need to have a home meeting with them
We do not have preachers, we do not have pastors, and we do not have gospel giants preaching the gospel while others listen
In our church life, however, there are only the brothers and sisters, only the members of the Body of Christ, each carrying out his function
The clergy system is related to religious hierarchy, so in order to abolish the clergy system, religious hierarchy must be torn down
Under the 'red-robed bishops' are the other bishops, and under these bishops are still various ranks, all the way down to the monks and nuns
After years of study and seeking before the Lord, in 1985 we felt that we should thoroughly correct our situation
Christians gather together and hire an eloquent person to speak to the congregation; this is the traditional way of meeting
As for gospel preaching, it is also a matter of finding a large place of gathering and inviting people to come to listen to the gospel
It has been more than one hundred fifty years since then, but today their number is only somewhere between ten and twenty thousand
By simply looking at the number nine million you may feel it is big, but if you look carefully, the base number was fifty to sixty million
At this time, after more than two years of research, not only have we changed the way, but we also have put it into practice
We reject denominational divisions, we abolish the clergy system, and we completely tear down religious hierarchy
In preaching the gospel, the first thing we speak about is the mystery of human life and the meaning of human life
Some of the Lord Jesus' words spoken in the Gospel of Matthew, for example, are not simple, but Christianity applies them in a simple way
In addition, Matthew 5, 6, and 7 speak of the decree of the kingdom's constitution, which is also extremely profound, crucial, and practical
For many years the precious truth among us has not been able to be spread because our practice is contrary to the principle in the Bible
Not long ago in the United States the business of 'food delivery' began, which specializes in delivering food to people's homes
Today our preaching of the gospel and the truth is not inviting people to our 'restaurant' but delivering food to their homes
Not only do we need to know people's situation, but more importantly we need to preach to them the pure, high, and complete gospel
In this way the Lord will be able to gain a proper church prepared as His bride so that He can come back to marry us
While we do have the elders' administration of the church among us, in this administration there is no rule or control
We can say that the first instance of knocking on doors and paying a visit occurred in Genesis 3 when God came to 'knock on Adam's door'
Perhaps some would argue with us saying that back then in the garden of Eden houses were not yet invented so there were no doors to knock on
Abraham went forward immediately to greet them and received them eagerly, fetching water for them to wash their feet
Again and again the Spirit of Jehovah came to man, to the leaders among the children of Israel, and to all the prophets
On the earth He preached the gospel from place to place for three years, but not once did He send out invitations for people to come
In His divinity and Godhead He was omnipresent, yet after He became flesh He was very much restricted by space
The Lord was born in the world to bring peace to men on the earth; He also sent out the disciples that they would go with His peace
Today we need to cause this peace to reach those whom God has chosen, not by inviting them to come, but by being sent to go to them
Although we have come out of Christianity, we are still under the influence of the poison and the atmosphere of Christianity
The context of these verses tells us very clearly that all authority has been given to Him in heaven and on earth, so we should go
When we go we should be full of faith declaring to Satan I come with the resurrected Christ full of His authority in heaven and on earth
Many who go out to visit people and preach the gospel testify that the ones they visited were all very submissive
Sometimes even we were astonished, unable to believe that they were as submissive as lambs, doing whatever we asked them to do
In the past when we read John 15, we greatly emphasized that if we abide in the Lord, the Lord will abide in us
Establishing a home meeting in their home is to establish a shelter to cover this home, and by this the fruit remains naturally
Today medicine is quite advanced in the United States, so much so that even a premature infant born at five or six months is able to survive
That was certainly impossible before, but now in the United States there are, in fact, such cases of successful survival
Our mistake in the past was to let go of people as soon as they were baptized, like a mother who neglects her child after he is born
In our past church life, we neglected the meetings in the homes of the saints and relied mostly on the meetings in the meeting hall
Verse 46 speaks of being in homes, or 'from house to house,' which, if house is to be used as the unit, can also be 'according to house'
Chapter five verse 42 says, 'From house to house, they did not cease teaching and announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ'
They taught the truth, preached the gospel, fellowshipped with one another, broke bread, and prayed in the homes
Beginning from now, our church life should be absolutely according to the pattern in the Bible, following the footsteps of the early saints
After we baptize people, we should immediately establish a home meeting in their homes in order to teach them, lead them, and help them
In other words, they should learn to know the truth, preach the gospel, have mutual fellowship, and pray and break bread in the homes
Finally, we need to see that the more we practice this, the more we love the Lord, and the more we love the Lord, the more we pursue Him
In that day we can declare to Satan, to the angels, and to mankind, 'The church is the pillar and base of the truth on the earth'
Among the more than seven thousand new believers gained, we have established over two thousand new home meetings
Sometimes a person has been a God-chosen son of peace, but when we went to knock on his door on a certain day, he was not in the right mood
He may have just fought with his wife and still had a stomach full of anger, so he could not hear our speaking to him about Jesus
These are the principles the brothers and sisters have learned from going out in the training to knock on doors
It is best to use the booklet, 'The Mystery of Human Life,' in which are four keys that are more than adequate to meet various needs
When going out to visit people, the new trainees should not speak at first but should simply learn in a good way
He had been in the church life for many years, so naturally he was full of knowledge and felt that he had many things to say
Seeing that the young people knew only to read a section from 'The Mystery of Human Life' tempted him very much
One time this elderly brother went out with the door-knocking brothers and sisters, and they entered into a couple's home
A young sister spoke to the husband, and just when she felt that she had spoken enough and he was ready to be baptized, the wife came out
With the addition of the seven thousand brought in through the trainees' door-knocking, the total comes to almost fifty thousand
The total number of regular meeting-goers adds up to about ten thousand people, of which at least four thousand are in the church in Taipei
With these ten thousand as the base number, if one out of twenty is a full-timer, there should be five hundred full-timers
In order to carry this out, we need five hundred full-timers plus two thousand five hundred who will go out door-knocking weekly
If some disagree we need to believe that the Lord we serve has a way and since He has begun a good work He will complete this work Himself
Never say lightly that anyone can go door-knocking; going door-knocking and gaining people to be baptized is not as simple as it seems
Anyone can push down the keys and make a banging sound, but no one can play a melody without adequate training
Today whether you are an elder or a co-worker, whether you are young or old, you need to be trained in a good way
Success can only come out of being trained in the training and continuing steadfastly in the principle of the new way
Concerning the new way, we have a saying with two simple phrases: 'The new way produces the new man; the new man walks the new way'
In the past two thousand years there were some who practiced this way, but regretfully no one took this way as the unique way
Whether going out door-knocking or going to people's homes to lead the meetings, we need to learn this truth in a thorough way
Every newly baptized brother or sister, after attending such meetings for six months, can also become one who teaches others
We must raise up the ones who have been baptized, edified in the truth, and have grown in life to be the church
When we meet, He is with us, and He operates in the meeting in various ways, giving grace to every brother and sister
Currently the church in Taipei has over ten thousand names on the list, but there are only four thousand regular meeting-goers
One full-timer should be produced out of every twenty people, and the other nineteen should endeavor to support this one
Six consecutive days of door-knocking per week would guarantee one person being gained and baptized every week
Four thousand people meet in the church in Taipei, so there can be one thousand part-time serving ones going door-knocking every week
To be sure, door-knocking in this way every week for two hours, at least one person will be saved every two months, or every eight weeks
From now on, the elders will not sit in the offices in the meeting halls, but they will go door-knocking every day
According to what the Bible says, elders should not be 'as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock'
If we continue in this way, Taipei will have gained two million seven hundred thousand through door-knocking by 1990
According to various observations and general experiences, we do have the full assurance that we can gospelize the whole of Taiwan
Sometimes the same words are not as easily received when they are spoken by a Chinese person as when they are spoken by a foreigner
More than sixty years ago we came out of the denominations in China, and over thirty years ago we started the Lord's work in Taiwan
They are all well-known persons in Christianity, but the work of these well-known persons has 'killed' every one of their church members
When we talk or move, even the little finger and the ear function, because when we talk, we do it as living persons with lively gestures
The functions of the fellow believers in Christianity have been nullified by the preachers and replaced with the clergy
The more the responsible brothers speak, the less the saints need to function and the more they lose their function
As for the ones listening to messages, the more they listen, the more they are drugged and lose their function
When the Lord comes again, not only will we go forth to see His face, but we also will hand over our account to Him
Apparently the slave did not do anything wrong yet he did not use the possessions the master gave him to do business or accumulate interest
How can we listen to messages under the same roof for thirty years and still remain exactly the same as we were thirty years ago?
The first year yielded a thirtyfold increase, and after the fourth or the fifth year we had a hundredfold increase
In the early days of the church, the church life was in the homes , such as the church in the home of Aquila and Priscilla
The New Testament mentions at least three or four homes in which there was a church , but it does not speak of a church in a large gathering
During His three and a half years of work, He always went to visit people, yet not once did He invite people to come and listen to messages
The statistics of Christianity in the twenty-two years from 1964 to 1986 further confirmed my feeling: the way of Christianity does not work
Next, He sent forth the twelve disciples two by two and charged them, saying, 'I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves'
When we go, however, we need only be concerned with going house by house, because there will be the sons of peace
After we knock on the door and go in, we should give people only a taste and not linger for more than twenty minutes
In Acts 1 He said, 'You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth'
We need to knock on every door in the whole world, seeking out the sons of peace one by one from among the wolves
To wait for a week to baptize someone after he believes in the Lord and after he has a baptism interview, is too formal
Baptism is the first step of mans salvation that he needs to take after he believes because he who believes and is baptized shall be saved
After we baptize people, if we do not look after them and feed them, it is the same as begetting children but not caring for them
In practicing the new way, the Lord has shown us that right after baptizing people we should invite them to establish a home meeting
To establish a home meeting is to establish a protection, not only to protect the new ones, but also to protect ourselves
We all love whom we beget, and we are willing to go and see them repeatedly; the more we see them, the more we want to see them
After knocking on doors, we bring people to believe and be baptized, and then we establish meetings in the homes of all the new ones
After we have baptized a person in this way, this person becomes a child begotten by us, so we must go and visit him
It is not easy when we first go out door-knocking, but one day, when a person is baptized, this new one will stir us up
In this way all the saints are put into action, each fulfilling his duty, and the clergy system naturally ceases to exist
In order for there to be fellowship among the saints, we can have a gathering of the entire assembly every two months
From now on there will not be only the speaking of the elders and co-workers in the churches, which annuls the functions of the saints
If these two homes are close to each other, after two or three weeks they can have a joint meeting so that they can get to know one another
In the past our meetings were full of old stories, and after meeting for a few decades we still talked about the same old things
