   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT CHRIST AS OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every religion makes some contribution to the well-being of society.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every one of them has a point in common: giving man something or bringing man towards some goal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although the methods they employ may be different and what they offer may vary, all of them have something to offer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Believing in Christ naturally involves receiving something from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we want to see what Christ offers to man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THAT MAN MAY RECEIVE REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What we are about to see are not the contributions made by Christianity to nations, governments, the world, and society at large.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We want to study a more basic, crucial, and practical matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What Christ gives to man is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we believe into Him we receive regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to admit that regeneration is a big subject in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can only take a general glance at its meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you read through the Bible carefully, you will discover that it emphasizes life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In numerous passages it alludes to life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On this earth there are many kinds of life with many different expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every life has its own unique expression.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You can identify a life by its distinctive expression.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE EXPRESSIONS OF DIFFERENT LIVES</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Take for example a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You know that it has life because it is living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You can also identify the distinctive expression of this bird.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is this expression?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even a child knows that a bird can fly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The flying of a bird is the distinctive expression of its life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is such a uniqueness with the bird's life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When this unique trait is manifested, it expresses itself in flying.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Again look at a fish.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only does the fish have life, but it expresses the characteristics of its life by swimming in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we compare the fish with the bird, we can see that though both have life, the expressions of their individual lives are different.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A bird can only fly; it cannot swim.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A fish, on the other hand, can only do the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is impossible for a bird to swim, even if you try your best to teach it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the same manner, there is no way that you can teach a fish to fly in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Different lives have different expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The characteristics each displays allow us to identify them as different lives.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since the mode of living is determined by the life it possesses, the question of life has nothing to do with learning and imitation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the lives are different, there is no way to change one into another by a learning process.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The only possibility is to have a change of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the life is changed, the expression of it will also change.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the life remains the same, it is impossible to alter the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A CHANGE OF BEHAVIOR FOLLOWS A CHANGE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose that a person is very interested in the research of small animals.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He wants very much to see a bird swim.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To him nothing would be more thrilling than to be able to train a little bird to swim.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>So he starts teaching a little bird to dive under water, breathe in the water, flap its wings, and exercise its claws in the proper manner.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do you think that he will succeed?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suppose he continues his experiment by changing the diet of the bird or by altering its posture in sleep, etc., in order to adapt it to a life in water.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Will he succeed?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His doctrines may work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the life of the bird is different.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This life can fly comfortably in the air, but it cannot be made to swim in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The kind of life determines the kind of expression.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You cannot change it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you try to change the expression without changing the life, you will totally fail.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Based on the principle of this law, we have a most vital and basic doctrine in our faith regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>REGENERATION IS AN EXCHANGE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every expression of our living as a human being is based upon the kind of life we possess.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A corrupted living is caused by a corrupted life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To change the mode of living, we have to first change the life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If the life is changed, the expression of it will also change.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There will be no problem with the latter when the former is taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Otherwise, any endeavor will be as futile as training a bird to swim or coaching a fish to fly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Regeneration is an exchange of life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What Christ offers us is not merely a change of behavior but regeneration based upon a change of life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>One thing we unanimously admit: the human life we possess is corrupt and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the one hand, we blame the wickedness in the world and the demoralizing circumstances around us, but on the other hand, we have to admit that we are basically evil and filthy within ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We realize that everywhere in the world there is a base scramble for power and position, but we also realize that we are fully filled with jealousy and pride.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We admit that the heart of man is stubborn and rash.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is not a gentle or loving man.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are not only sinful, but exceedingly wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We know that sin is abhorrent, giving no peace to our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We also wish or try to deal with sin and rid ourselves of it.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The basic phenomenon of our life is a total involvement with sin.</S>
