   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FROM APPRECIATION TO ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the seeking one became a lily, she began to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At first, she appreciated the Lord as a bundle of myrrh and as a cluster of henna flowers, but at that time she had not yet begun to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The enjoyment began after she was transformed into a lily.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After becoming a lily, she started to enjoy the Lord's fruit, which was sweet to her taste.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then, she not only appreciated the Lord, but also enjoyed the Lord by eating of His fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After this, she was brought into the banqueting house, the house of wine, to have a further enjoyment of eating and drinking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before that time, she only had a kind of appreciation of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The riches of the Lord had not yet been deposited into her.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But when she started to enjoy the Lord, she began to take something of the Lord into her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By eating and drinking of the Lord, some of the elements of the Lord were wrought into her.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, by eating, drinking, and enjoying the Lord, the third step of transformation was wrought into the seeking one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>She became a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A dove in the Bible signifies the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a dove, she lived as the Spirit, behaved as the Spirit, and had the appearance of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a dove, she became the expression of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was not only by appreciating the Lord, but by taking the Lord Himself into her in a way of enjoyment that some of the Lord's very element entered into her and caused her to be transformed substantially.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She was no longer a company of horses or a lily, but a dove, the expression of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>PARTICIPATING IN THE LORD'S DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All of her transformation was due to her appreciation and enjoyment of the Lord through the experiences of the Lord's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many figures, such as the myrrh, the clefts of the rock, and the secret of the steep places are pictures of the Lord's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While she was appreciating and enjoying the Lord, she experienced the Lord's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot partake of the Lord Himself without participating in His death and resurrection, because these are elements of His very being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we enjoy Him, surely we will participate in His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more we partake of the Lord, the more we take His death into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more we enjoy Him, the more we take in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord today is just like an all-inclusive dose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In such a dose are all the ingredients and elements that are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are the killing elements, and there are the nourishing elements.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord's death is the killing element, and His resurrection is the nourishing element.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we enjoy the Lord, we enjoy all the ingredients of such an all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more we take the Lord in, the more the killing elements get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the same time, we also obtain the nourishing elements of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the Lord's element gets into us, He kills all the negative items and nourishes us with all of the positive elements.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This results in transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The horse's eyes were changed into doves' eyes, and even the company of horses was changed into a lily.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then, the lily was transformed into a dove, and she stayed in the cleft of the rock and in the secret of the steep places.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She stayed in the Lord's death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
