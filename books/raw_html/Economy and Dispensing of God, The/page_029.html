<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Drinking of Christ as the Living Water</H2><P>Third, we need to drink of Christ as the living water (John 4:10, 14). This water is the water of the eternal life, which is the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God. Our Christ today is the water. We need to drink of Him. The way to drink of Him is to pray, to call on Him, and to talk to Him. This kind of praying is also a breathing and inhaling of Christ into us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Eating Christ as the Living Bread</H2><P>Fourth, we need to eat Christ as the living bread. This bread is the bread of the eternal life embodied in His words, which are Spirit and life (John 6:27, 51, 57-58, 63). Eventually, God, Christ, the Spirit, life, and the word are all one thing. God is Spirit (John 4:24), and the Spirit is Christ (2 Cor. 3:17). This Spirit, as Christ, is life (Rom. 8:2; Col. 3:4) and is embodied in the words of the Bible. Thus, when we come to the Bible, we must realize that we are coming to the living God, the living Christ, the living Spirit, and His life.</P><P>We need to eat Christ daily at the appointed times. We should especially eat Him early in the morning as our daily manna (Exo. 16:13b-15, 21). We should also eat Christ with the drinking of Him; that is, we should receive His word by prayer (Eph. 6:17-18a), by pray-reading His Word. This is the way to receive His gracious dispensing. In this way all the rich elements of the Divine Trinity will be dispensed into our being. This will enable us to grow in life, to live Christ, to preach the gospel, and to do the divine work for the Lord. We do not do these things by ourselves, but by the One who lives in us and who is now dispensing His riches into us all the time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Flowing Christ in All the Aspects<br>of His Riches as Rivers of Living Water<br>from within Our Every Inward Part</H2><P>If we cooperate with the Lord by abiding in Him, by allowing His words to abide in us, and by eating Him as the living bread, drinking Him as the living water, and breathing Him as the heavenly air, Christ will flow from within our every inward part in all the aspects of His riches as rivers of living water (John 7:38-39). He will have a way to dispense Himself in our spirit, and from our spirit into all the parts of our being. Then we will be supplied and will be able to grow in life, live Christ, preach the gospel with authority, and do the divine work. This is the revelation of the Gospel of John concerning the dispensing of the processed Triune God within us as our bountiful supply, beginning with incarnation and ending with fruit-bearing and lamb-feeding.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in San Jose, California, on August 28, 1990)</P>
