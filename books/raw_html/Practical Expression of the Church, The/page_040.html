<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>PRACTICAL LESSONS FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture reading: 1 Timothy 3:15</h1><h2 class=head1>WHAT TO DO WITH DENOMINATIONS</h2><p>In the last chapter we have seen something regarding the attitude we must have toward the saints who are still in the denominations. On one hand, we must be so general and so open to all saints regardless of their background. But on the other hand, if they are still in the denominations, it is rather difficult for us to identify ourselves with them. However, the responsibility is not ours, but theirs. As long as we return to the proper ground of unity, we are absolved from all responsibility of division. For this reason we can do nothing to help them. All we can do is to return to the proper ground. Positionally speaking, this is the right place for us to be identified with all the children of God. But actually speaking, it is impossible because so many of them are still in the divisions.<p>Now we must see what we should do with the denominations. Some brothers who have seen that the denominations are wrong still insist that we must stay there. They say that if we do not remain in the denominations, we will be charged with causing division. They also say that we must stay to help others, for if we leave, they say, there will be no way to help them. At least some who have seen that the denominations are wrong speak in this way. I know some dear saints who are like this.<p>Well, are the denominations right or wrong? If they are wrong, should we stay in them? Should we remain in something wrong? If you cannot leave because others will say that you cause division, I am afraid you are the biggest politician on earth! You are not faithful to what you see. You know the denominations are wrong, yet you still remain because you are afraid of what others will say. This is not honest or faithful.<p>You may say that we must be careful not to cause divisions. But to leave Babylon and return to Jerusalem is not causing a division. To abandon what is wrong and come back to what is right is not causing a division. We all must have a pure conscience. Regardless of how much you say you are careful, I say that you are political. In your heart you condemn the denominations, yet you still remain there. I do not believe that Christians should hold this kind of attitude. And if you stay, what kind of work will you do? Will you stay in a denomination and do a work which is absolutely against that denomination? We should not be this kind of person.<p>The Presbyterians, for example, exert much energy to build up their Presbyterian denomination. If you agree with them, you should stay. But if you do not agree with them, you should plainly tell them that you cannot stay. We must be honest. We should not pretend that we are one with a certain denomination, yet day by day undermine it. This is not right and this is not honest. Eventually, all such people will be expelled by the denominations. Suppose you are a pastor of a denomination. Would you allow a member of your denomination to remain and yet undermine your work? You would have to dismiss him.<p>Everything must be after its kind according to Genesis 1. If we are for the denominations, we must remain with the denominations. But if we are not for them, we must be faithful and honest to tell them so.<p>In 1927, I was elected a member of the executive committee of the denomination I was in. But I told them frankly that I could not accept the position and that I was going to leave them. That was the end of my denominational life. I still believe that this way is right. We are the children of light, and we must be honest to ourselves and to others.<p>We must abandon the idea of remaining in the denominations to help others. If we stay, we are not honest. Suppose you are a missionary, and the mission sends you out as a missionary to work for that mission. You must be honest to them. If you work honestly and faithfully for the mission, you are right. You should not go to the field, yet work in another way. This is not honest. You may say that you are doing something for Christ, but I do not believe the Lord needs such underhanded servants.<p>We must be after our kind. If we are denominational, we must be one hundred percent denominational. If the denominations are wrong, we must leave them at any cost. We have to be what we are. We should not pretend to be something. That is being political. Let us be so simple, so faithful and so honest to God, to others and to ourselves. We must let people know what we are and where we stand. We should not pretend to be anything. If we prefer the denominational way, then we must stand for it. The Lord never respects pretension. We must be what we are.<p>Of course, if we are so frank, we may offend some people. But eventually, if we do not declare what we are, we will offend them more. From the beginning we must let others know what we are and where we stand. I say this because it is so easy to consider it better to remain in the denominations. I frankly tell you that this does not work.<p>There are some who say this is right. They agree that they should not stay in the denominations to undermine their work. But they say that we must stay to pray for them and improve them. This is a good intention, but I have never seen anyone who has succeeded in so doing. If you do not believe my word, you may go and waste your time. Try a few years and see whether you can improve them. I am sure that you cannot. We must not involve ourselves in so many things; it is just a waste of time.
