<h2 class="head1">IV. JOSHUA&rsquo;S CHARGE TO THE PEOPLE<br />
ACCORDING TO JEHOVAH&rsquo;S INSTRUCTION<br />
AND THE PEOPLE&rsquo;S ACTION<br />
ACCORDING TO JEHOVAH&rsquo;S CHARGE</h2>
<p>Next, this chapter shows us Joshua&rsquo;s charge to the people according to Jehovah&rsquo;s instruction and the people&rsquo;s action according to Jehovah&rsquo;s charge (vv. 6-17a, 18-21, 24).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In Circling the City</h2>
<p>In circling the city, the armed men passed on before the ark of Jehovah. The seven priests passed on before Jehovah and blew the trumpets, and the ark of Jehovah went after them. The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard went after the ark, the trumpets continually blowing (vv. 6-9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The People Not Shouting<br />
until the Day Joshua Told Them to Shout</h2>
<p>Joshua commanded the people not to shout, nor to let their voice be heard, nor to let a word go forth from their mouth until the day he would say to them, &ldquo;Shout!&rdquo; Then they would shout (v. 10). There was a time to be silent, and there was a time to shout. Here, to be silent means to be one with the Lord to carry out the matter in the Lord&rsquo;s way without the expression of any thought, opinion, or feeling.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Ark of Jehovah Circling the City<br />
Once a Day for Six Days<br />
and Seven Times on the Seventh Day</h2>
<p>The ark of Jehovah circled the city, going around it one time, and did the same on the second day, circling the city one time. This they did for six days. Then on the seventh day they circled the city in the same manner seven times (vv. 11-15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The People Shouting with a Great Shout,<br />
and the Wall Falling Down Flat</h2>
<p>The seventh time they circled the city on the seventh day, the priests blew the trumpets, and Joshua said to the people, &ldquo;Shout!&rdquo; The people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat. Then the people went up into the city, each straight ahead, and they captured the city, utterly destroyed it with the edge of the sword, and burned it with fire (vv. 16, 20-21, 24a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Victory over Jericho Being Won<br />
by Israel&rsquo;s Blowing of the Trumpets and Shouting</h2>
<p>The victory over Jericho in Israel&rsquo;s first battle after crossing the Jordan was won not by Israel&rsquo;s fighting but by their blowing of the trumpets and shouting, by their testifying and proclaiming of God with His ark, through their faith in God&rsquo;s word of instruction (vv. 2-5). These were the vital factors that enabled them to win the victory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Not Taking Anything from the Destruction<br />
but Saving All the Silver, the Gold,<br />
and the Vessels of Bronze and Iron</h2>
<p>They did not take anything from the destruction but saved all the silver, the gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, sanctified them to Jehovah, and put them into the treasury of the house of Jehovah (vv. 18-19, 24b).</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE SALVATION<br />
RENDERED TO RAHAB AND HER HOUSEHOLD</h2>
<p>This chapter speaks not only of the destruction of Jericho but also of the salvation rendered to Rahab and her household (vv. 17b, 22-23, 25). This was done in order to keep the promise that had been made to her (v. 22). Joshua preserved Rahab and her father&rsquo;s house and all that she had, and she remained within Israel (v. 25).</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE OATH MADE BY THE PEOPLE<br />
FOR THE CURSING OF JERICHO</h2>
<p>Finally, this chapter tells us of the oath made by the people for the cursing of Jericho. &ldquo;At that time Joshua charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah who raises up and builds this city Jericho! At the cost of his firstborn son shall he lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest son shall he set up its gates&rdquo; (v. 26). This word was fulfilled with Hiel in 1 Kings 16:34.</p>
