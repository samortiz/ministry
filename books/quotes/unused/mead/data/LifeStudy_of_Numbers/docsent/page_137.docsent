   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX FIGHTING 5 Scripture Reading: Num 25:1-18; 31:2; Rev 2:14b</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will consider Israel's fall into fornication and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, I would first like to review the crucial matters, the intrinsic elements, in chapters twenty through twenty-four of Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In typology, these five chapters present us a picture of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chapter twenty shows us Christ as the smitten rock who, in resurrection, is flowing out living water to meet our need v. 8 . Christ has been smitten, crucified, and there is no need for Him to be smitten again.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now He is in resurrection flowing with living water to quench people's thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The crucified and resurrected Christ is here to meet us in our need.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As long as we have Him, God has no problem with us and we have no problem with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In chapter twenty-one we have further aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, as the bronze serpent, Christ is our replacement vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He became the same as we in nature with the exception that in Him there was no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 , but He did not have the sinful nature, just as the bronze serpent had the form of a serpent without having the poisonous nature of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because Christ came in the likeness of the flesh of sin, He could be our replacement, bearing God's judgment and accomplishing redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As our replacement, Christ has solved not only the outward problem of sins but also the inward problem of our sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Having solved these problems through His crucifixion, in resurrection this One has become a fountain, a well Num 21:17 , springing up with living water, which is the consummated Spirit of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In our experience we need to dig this well v. 18 . If we dig the well, we will become nobles and leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, as Numbers 33 indicates, Christ is our destination, our land of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, Christ is our replacement, our well, and our land of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we enjoy Him as our land of rest, we do not have any lack or shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Numbers 23 and 24 we have four parables spoken by Balaam, a Gentile prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These parables reveal much concerning the church, with the fourth parable revealing something concerning Christ.</S>
