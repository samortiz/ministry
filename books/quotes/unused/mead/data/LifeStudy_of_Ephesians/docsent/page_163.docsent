   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOURISHED BY TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 29 there are two important words: nourish and cherish.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To nourish is to feed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the past many of us attended so-called Christian services or read the Bible without receiving any nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if we take Christ as our person, we shall experience Him nourishing us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We shall continually have the sense of His inward nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be nourished by Christ is to be supplied with His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I believe that we all have experienced the nourishment that comes from taking Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nourishment brings about transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all become what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that if we eat Christ, we shall eventually be constituted with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We shall be transformed by the element of Christ that has been dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we take Christ as our person, the more He nourishes us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through Christ s nourishment we are transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that we become a new person with a new element and substance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hallelujah, Christ nourishes us with Himself, with the riches of all He is!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What we need today is not doctrine or religion, but the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>OUR BURDEN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In these messages our burden is not to pass on more teachings to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our burden is to minister the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today the need of the Lord s people is to take Christ as their person for nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because we are conscious of this need, we are not interested in mere objective teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our desire is to help others come in touch with the living Christ, to open to Him, and to take Him as their life and person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I hope that many will say, Lord, I have been a Christian for years, but I have not taken You as my person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Lord, by Your mercy, I want to begin now to take You as my person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If your husband or wife troubles you and you are tempted to exchange words, that is the time to take Christ as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead of arguing with others or defending ourselves, we should allow Christ to make His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>WRECKED BY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many of us can testify that we have been wrecked by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the one hand, Christ rescues us; but on the other hand, He wrecks us and makes us useless for anything other than Himself and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more we take Christ as our person, the more He wrecks us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, this ministry is a wrecking ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through it, thousands have been wrecked for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now nothing other than the living Christ and the proper church life can satisfy us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>WARMED AND SOFTENED</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Along with the nourishing we have the cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be cherished is to be softened by being warmed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we are hard and cold, we need Christ to cherish us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need Him to warm our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After some experiences of His warming, we are softened.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many can testify that through their contact with the church in the Lord s recovery, they have been warmed and softened.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before coming into the church life, they were somewhat cold and hard.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But Christ, the nourishing and cherishing One, has made them warm and soft.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many of us can give testimony of what it is to be cherished by Christ in such a tender, intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Just as a mother cherishes a child by holding the child to her breast, so the Lord cherishes us by holding us close to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although I am an elderly person, I still need Christ s cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes I tell Him, Lord, You know how small I am.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He replies, Yes, I know.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why I am here not only to sanctify, cleanse, and nourish you, but also to cherish you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How tender, sweet, and warm the Lord Jesus is!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By resting on Him, we who once were hard and cold become soft and warm.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such a change takes place through the Lord s care for us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Inwardly the Lord warms us and softens us as we enjoy His tenderness, sweetness, and lovingness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Praise Him, He is the cherishing One!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May we all take Christ as our person and experience more of His sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this way we enjoy Him and experience Him in a living way.</S>
