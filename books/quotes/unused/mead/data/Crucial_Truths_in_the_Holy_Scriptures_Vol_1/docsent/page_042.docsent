   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are at least three results to being reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, we can boast in God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Originally, God was man s joy, but once we developed a problem with God and lost God, we were godless and without any peace and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Consequently, we sought after recreation, entertainment, and even sin to find enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now that we are reconciled to God, we have obtained God and possess God, who is our joy and boast.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We feel sweet whenever we think of Him; we feel happy whenever He is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Formerly, we took pleasure in drinking, smoking, gambling, movies, or dances, but now that we have been reconciled to God, we boast and joy in God and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We love to pray and draw near to God; whenever God is mentioned, our hearts beat with longing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Love God ; The love of Christ constrains us...that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised Rom 8:28; 2 Cor 5:14-15; see also 1 John 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second result of being reconciled to God is love for God.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We boast in God as our enjoyment, and we express our love toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once we consider how God loved us, how He came and reconciled us to Himself, how He sent the Lord Jesus to accomplish all that was necessary for this reconciliation, how the Lord Jesus died, bled, and was resurrected for us, our heart of love is stirred toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We desire to show Him our love by laying down everything to please Him and to live for Him all our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Serve...God 1 Thes 1:9-10 .</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who are reconciled to God love Him, and those who are reconciled long to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Loving God is a demonstration of our heart toward God, and serving God is our practical action before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The very love through which God reconciled us to Himself constrains us in our heart to serve Him until the Lord returns.</S>
