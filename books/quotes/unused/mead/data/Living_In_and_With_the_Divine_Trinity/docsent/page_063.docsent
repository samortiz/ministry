   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Gaining Christ and Being Found in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Philippians 2 God's operating is for us to work out our own salvation without murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For this we need to take Christ as our model, our pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter three we see that we need to be those gaining Christ and being found in Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The real gain is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Anything other than Christ is a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Philippians 3:7-8 Paul said, "But what things were gains to me, these I have counted loss on account of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them refuse that I may gain Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To gain Christ may be compared to gaining the victory in a war.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To gain the victory in a war, everything has to be sacrificed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the United States declared war in World War II, the entire country with all its citizens sacrificed everything to gain the victory in the war.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without that kind of sacrifice, the United States could not have helped to win World War II.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today we also need to sacrifice everything to gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to tell Satan that we are going to fight to win the victory to gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We also need to be found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everyone should be able to see that we are persons in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, he was absolutely in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When people found him, saw him, he was a person in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in Philippians 3 Paul declared that he only wanted to be found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was only for Christ, and he wanted to be found by everyone in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was a man in Christ 2 Cor 12:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By Knowing Christ as Our All</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>and by Knowing the Power of His Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>to Be Conformed to His Death</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We gain Christ and are found in Christ by knowing Christ as our all and by knowing the power of His resurrection to be conformed to His death Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul indicated in Philippians 3 that he was a person pursuing Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>12, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Greek word for "pursue" is the same word for persecute.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul did two kinds of persecuting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first kind of persecuting was a negative kind of persecuting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul persecuted Christ in this way when he was Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But after he was saved, he began to persecute Christ in a positive sense.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To persecute Christ in a positive way is to press toward Christ, to follow after Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul realized that in order to pursue Christ, to persecute Christ, he needed the power of Christ's resurrection, a power that can overcome death, subdue death, defeat death, and bring us out of death's usurpation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul aspired to know Christ and the power of His resurrection so that he could be conformed to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A.B. Simpson said, "'Tis not hard to die with Christ, when His risen life we know" Hymns, #481 . When we have resurrection as our enjoyment, this enjoyment enables us to be conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ's death is a model, a mold, and we are like pieces of dough that are put into this mold so that we can be conformed to the image of this mold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The mold that we are being conformed to is the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Each one of us has a certain amount of problems and sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may have sufferings related to our health, our finances, or our children.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Who has no suffering?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No one is in a situation in which everything is complete, perfect, satisfactory, fine, and in the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Who has a perfect, complete, satisfactory, and heavenly marriage?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is not such a marriage on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even marriage can be a real suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No one can escape suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These sufferings should be a mold.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After we have been saved, God's sovereignty puts us into this mold.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the mold of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need the power of resurrection to be conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to be in the image of Christ and also in the image of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For this we need the power of His resurrection, not our natural power.</S>
