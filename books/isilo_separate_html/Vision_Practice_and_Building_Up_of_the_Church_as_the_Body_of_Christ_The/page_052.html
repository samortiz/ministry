<h1 class="title">HAVING ONE MIND, ONE OPINION, <br />
AND ONE SPEAKING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:10; Phil. 1:27; 2:1-2; 4:2; 1 Tim. 1:3-7</h1>
<p>First Corinthians 1:10 says, &ldquo;Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.&rdquo; First we have the same mind, then we have the same opinion, and eventually we speak the same thing.</p>
<p>Philippians 1:27 says, &ldquo;Only, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I may hear of the things concerning you, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together along with the faith of the gospel.&rdquo; This verse proves that the spirit is different from the soul. As the leading part of the soul, the mind represents the soul. To have one soul is to be of the same mind. We may be in one spirit, but to be of the same soul is a further matter.</p>
<p>Verses 1 and 2 of chapter 2 say, &ldquo;If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tenderheartedness and compassions, make my joy full, that you think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s thought was that if the Philippians desired to give him any encouragement and consolation, if they had any fellowship with him, and if they had a heart of tenderheartedness and compassions toward him, they should fulfill his joy by being like-minded. If those brothers and sisters had not been like-minded, Paul could not have been happy, and he would have had no encouragement and consolation.</p>
<p>In verse 2 Paul also speaks of having the same love. We may love others, but our love may be different for different persons. In this verse Paul once again mentions the soul, saying that the Philippians should be joined in soul. Then in 4:2 he says, &ldquo;I exhort Euodias, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF THE APOSTLES&rsquo; TEACHING BEING THE ECONOMY OF GOD FOR HIS BUILDING</h2>
<p>First Timothy 1:3-4 says, &ldquo;Even as I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies, which produce questionings rather than God&rsquo;s economy, which is in faith.&rdquo; The root of the word <em>economy</em> in Greek is <em>house.</em> God&rsquo;s economy is the building economics of God, the building arrangement, or stewardship, of God. It is God&rsquo;s stewardship for the purpose of building. The different teachings Paul speaks of minister questions rather than the building economics of God, which is in faith.</p>
<p>Verses 5 through 7 continue, &ldquo;But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith; from which things some, having misaimed, have turned aside to vain talking, desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither the things that they say, nor concerning what they confidently affirm.&rdquo; To be a teacher of the Old Testament law is in contrast to being &ldquo;a good minister of Christ Jesus&rdquo; as mentioned in 4:6, one who is nourished, not merely taught, with the words of the faith and the good teaching. The teachers of the law teach people the law, but the ministers of Christ minister Christ to people. According to the above verses, in the first century, even in the days of the apostles, some Christians were teaching things that seemed very scriptural but were different from the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>The law and the genealogies of the Old Testament are both scriptural, but these teachings are different from that of the apostle Paul. The central thought of the teaching of the apostle Paul can be seen in his fourteen Epistles from Romans through Hebrews. The subject of all these Epistles, written by the same apostle, is simply the building economics of God with Christ as life as the center and content and with the church as the vessel, the building, the house, to contain and express this very Christ. This is the central thought of all the teaching of the apostle. However, in his time there were other teachers, teaching things that seemed to be scriptural but were very different from his teaching. Because the apostle encountered this problem, he asked Timothy to stay at Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently. Due to these different teachings, some misaimed and turned aside from Christ, the church, and the Body life to the so-called scriptural teachings of the law and the genealogies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEMS WITH<br />
THE ONENESS OF THE BELIEVERS<br />
BEING RELATED TO THE MIND, THE OPINION,<br />
AND DIFFERENT SPEAKING</h2>
<p>In this message I would like to emphasize three points: one mind, one opinion, and one speaking. The mind is the source, and from the mind we have a certain opinion. Then we speak whatever we have in our mind as an opinion. We should once again remember that man is a tripartite being, as illustrated by three concentric circles. We all have been regenerated in the spirit, represented by the innermost circle. Because of this, Christians have little problem being one in the spirit. We are all of the same spirit. Our problem, however, is with our mind and our speaking.</p>
<p>Christians use the two eyes of their body to read the Bible, and they exercise their mind to understand it. However, not many exercise their spirit when they read the Bible. We have the same problem concerning the oneness. Christians mainly use their mind to have too many opinions, and then they use their body to speak too much. Whenever our mind is not under the control of the spirit, we use our mouth too loosely. The problem among the Lord&rsquo;s children is not in their spirit. In our spirit we all have the oneness of the Spirit. The problem is with our mind and with our speaking.</p>
<p>Our speaking always causes the problems. First Corinthians 1:10 says, &ldquo;That you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.&rdquo; Both in 1 Corinthians and in Philippians the apostle Paul deals with the divisive factors of the mind, the opinion, and speaking. If we all learn the lesson to bring our mind under the control of the spirit, we will see a difference. Much of our speaking will be swallowed up.</p>
<p>I have a very heavy burden in my spirit concerning these things. The more a businessman carries out his line of work, the more he considers it and learns from experience. In the same principle, we have been in the Lord&rsquo;s work for more than thirty years, always considering our situation and studying the Word of God, history, and biographies. We have studied the Bible and history, compared them to our present situation, and examined the situation according to our experience. Because of this, we have a certain amount of learning and realization. The more we have learned, the more we are very concerned for the Lord&rsquo;s children. The practical building up of the church depends upon our oneness. If we have divisions rather than oneness, there can be no building. Instead, we will have only a tearing down.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> </body></html>
