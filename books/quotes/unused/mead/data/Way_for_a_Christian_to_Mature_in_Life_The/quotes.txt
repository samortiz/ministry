[1]  The Way for a Christian to Mature in Life CONTENTS
[2]  The Holy City, New Jerusalem the Final Destination of the Believers
[3]  The Saved Ones Receiving the Promise of God in Full in the New Jerusalem
[4]  It contains fourteen messages that show us that the way for a Christian to mature in life is by allowing God to build Himself into him, by paying the price before God, by being watchful and ready, by turning to the spirit, and by giving the ground to the Lord.
[5]  There are records in both the Old Testament and the New Testament that show us where a believer s spirit and soul go after he dies.
[6]  In Luke 23 the repentant robber who was being crucified said to the Lord Jesus, Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.
[7]  This word clearly shows us that on the same day that the Lord Jesus died, the robber went with Him to Paradise.
[8]  In verses 1 through 4 Paul says, To boast is necessary, though indeed not expedient; yet I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
[9]  I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know; God knows such a one was caught away to the third heaven.
[10]  Philippians 2 says that the Lord was exalted to the heavens that in the name of Jesus every knee would bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord vv.
[11]  At the end of Acts 7 Stephen was martyred, and while he was being stoned, he said, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit! v. 59 . Some use this to say that Stephen s spirit went to a heavenly mansion.
[12]  They think that since the Lord is in heaven, when He received Stephen s spirit He must have received it into heaven.
[13]  In the Scofield Reference Bible there is a footnote for Luke 16:23 regarding Hades.
[14]  This footnote says that before the Lord Jesus ascended, Hades had two parts.
[15]  It speaks of many who believed in and hoped to obtain God s promise.
[16]  God s plan has not been fulfilled yet, His preparation has not been completed yet, the time has not yet come, the required number of saints has not yet been reached, and God s work in the saints has not yet been fully accomplished.
[17]  In Matthew 27, when the Lord Jesus resurrected, there were some Old Testament saints who came out of the tombs, entered into the earthly city of Jerusalem, and appeared to many people vv.
[18]  The thought in the Bible is that God has definitely ordained that those who have been saved would enter into the living room, but they must first be properly clothed and complete.
[19]  Do you think that God would let such a naked spirit and soul, bearing a big mark of death, go to the heavens where His dwelling place is to be with Him?
[20]  At the same time, we still may not be conformed to Christ s image, we may not be mature in life, and we may not be faithful to God and may still have a big problem in serving Him.
[21]  FOR THREE PERIODS OF TIME Scripture Readings: Gen 2:8, 9b-12; Rev 21:1a, 2-3, 10-11, 18-19a, 21; 22:1-2
[22]  In the last message we saw that the spirits and souls of dead believers did not ascend to heaven even after the Lord Jesus resurrected and ascended to heaven.
[23]  Revelation 6:9 clearly says that at the time of the opening of the fifth seal, which occurs very close to the second coming of the Lord, the souls of the martyrs will still be underneath the altar, that is, in the Paradise of Hades.
[24]  Genesis 2:7 records that in the beginning God formed man with the dust of the ground, 1 Corinthians 15:47 tells us that Adam is earthy, and 2 Corinthians 4:7 says that we were created to be earthen vessels.
[25]  In 1 Peter 2, Peter says that every saved one is a living stone before the Lord and is being built together with the Lord Jesus to be a spiritual house for God s dwelling v. 5 . In Ephesians 2 Paul also says that the saved ones are being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone; in whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord vv.
[26]  If a man dies before he is completely transformed into precious stone, his spirit and soul will go to Hades.
[27]  The spirits and souls of those who have not been saved go into the fire in Hades, while the spirits and souls of those who have been saved go to the Paradise in Hades and rest there, waiting for God.
[28]  Starting in the garden of Eden, the God of creation began to work in us to make us pure gold and precious stones.
[29]  At that time we will not only be in the New Jerusalem, but we will also be able to say that we are the New Jerusalem.
[30]  God wants man to be transformed, to grow in life unto maturity, to let Christ be formed in him, and to be conformed into the Lord s image.
[31]  OF THE UNION OF GOD, HEAVEN, AND MAN THE NEW JERUSALEM BEING THE HOLY CITY,
[32]  Then verse 3 continues, saying that God will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.
[33]  The disciples were troubled upon hearing this, but the Lord comforted them by saying, Do not let your heart be troubled; believe into God, believe also into Me v. 1 . The Greek phrase translated believe into God, believealso into Me also has the meaning believe into the inside of God, believe into the inside of Me.
[34]  The work of God throughout the generations is to gain something that is very mystical.
[35]  We do not need to wait until the time of the new heaven and new earth to be God s habitation, because we are God s habitation today.
[36]  Ephesians 1 tells us that we are in Christ v. 12 . Then chapter two tells us that we are in the heavenlies v. 6 . We not only have God and Christ in us, but we also have heaven in us.
[37]  I hope that we can see from our experience and the light in the Bible that the work of God s salvation is not only to work God into us but also to work heaven into us.
[38]  We who are saved are not only a mingling of man with God but also a mingling of man and God with heaven.
[39]  I believe we all have to say that when we are loving the Lord and contacting the Lord, heaven is truly within us, and inwardly we have the taste of heaven and the feeling of heaven.
[40]  Some people say that the Lord is building the church, not the New Jerusalem.
[41]  If they were two habitations, then today in the age of grace God would build us into the church, His habitation, and then in the future God would abandon us and build the New Jerusalem, a larger habitation.
[42]  Do not think that even if we do not grow today or as men of clay we are not transformed and remain what we are, then one day we will simply enter into the New Jerusalem.
[43]  CHAPTER FIVE THE WAY GOD BUILDS HIMSELF INTO MAN
[44]  Ephesians 4:12-13 says, For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[45]  The more we allow Him to work Himself into us, the more we will have the element of God and the element of heaven.
[46]  God s building work in us is our growth in the Lord s life and is also our getting ready before the Lord.
[47]  THE WAY GOD BUILDS HIMSELF INTO MAN BEING FIRSTLY THE BREAKING OF THE SELF
[48]  From the time that God begins His building work in us onward, the Spirit of God continuously moves us and motivates us within, and the life of God continuously operates and works within us.
[49]  If the self is not broken, it is impossible for God to build Himself into us.
[50]  How much God can build Himself into us depends on how much we allow God to break us.
[51]  However, sometimes when the Spirit moves and pierces the heart of a brother, he is unwilling to comply.
[52]  One day, if God has mercy on him and is gracious to him, God will stretch out His hand and raise up an environment to smite him.
[53]  This smiting is God s dealing in order to deal with his insight and views, which are devoid of God.
[54]  At this moment, this brother, having been inwardly pierced by God, may awaken and realize that in the matter of his children s marriages he did not give any ground to God or let God in and that he acted altogether according to his own insights, views, preferences, and opinions.
[55]  If we pay the price and let God have the ground and the freedom in us in every single matter, then we will be filled with God and possessed by God.
[56]  We not only must accept the word in John that we will have eternal life if we believe in the Lord, but we must also accept the Lord s command in Matthew 24 to watch and be ready.
[57]  By now we all realize that it is not sufficient to merely be a Christian.
[58]  We must also be watchful, ready, and mature in life in order to go before the Lord.
[59]  First, at the beginning of Matthew 25 the Lord said, At that time the kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom v. 1 . This shows us that the status and position of those who belong to the Lord is that of a virgin.
[60]  I hope that the Holy Spirit would speak to us and reveal to us that a Christian s status and position is that of a virgin, his condition is to take his lamp to shine, his way is to go out of the world, and the purpose of his life is to wait for the Lord s coming.
[61]  In Revelation 3:15 and 18 the Lord said to the church in Laodicea, I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot....I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire that you may be rich, and white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested, and eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see.
[62]  In the Bible the number twelve indicates eternal perfection, whereas the number ten indicates human perfection.
[63]  The Spirit of God has entered into us, God Himself has entered into us, and His life has entered into us.
[64]  When we are saved and receive the Lord as our Savior, we are regenerated, and the Spirit begins to live inside of us.
[65]  At the beginning of our salvation we have the regenerating Spirit and God s life and nature in us, but we do not have the infilling of the Spirit in us.
[66]  We have oil in our lamps, but we do not have oil prepared in our vessels.
[67]  We are saved and Christ is now living in us.
[68]  I am afraid that we have not enjoyed Christ that much, because what is in us is not Christ but many other things that in comparison are like refuse.
[69]  The oil in the lamp refers to the Spirit that we receive in regeneration, whereas the oil in the vessel refers to the infilling of the Spirit that we receive by pursuing after we have been saved.
[70]  Why does God want us to pursue the infilling of the Spirit after regenerating us, saving us, and giving us the Spirit?
[71]  We may make light of this or may overlook this matter before the Lord, but the Lord wants us to realize that our situation before Him today and our future destiny all depend on our attitude in this matter.
[72]  The fact that we are human beings is not something decided by us.
[73]  As men we are told by God through the gospel that we must repent and believe in the Lord Jesus or else we will perish.
[74]  It means that all the things that are necessary in life do not have any ground in us.
[75]  We have already seen that the way for us as Christians to mature is to let the Lord fill us in our being, that is, to let the Spirit of the Lord have the full ground in us.
[76]  When the Spirit of God with His life entered into our deadened spirit, our spirit was made alive and became bright.
[77]  The Spirit of God with God s life shines out from our spirit, shining forth to every part of our soul.
[78]  This Holy Spirit is the realization of God and has the life of God.
[79]  Paul s spirit could shine because he had the Spirit of God, the anointing oil of God.
[80]  The Spirit of God dwells in us, and we have been regenerated and saved and have the Spirit of God as light in our spirit, yet our outer man, including our thoughts, insights, loves, decisions and determinations, remains absolutely intact.
[81]  THE WAY FOR A CHRISTIAN TO MATURE IN LIFE ACCEPTING THE BREAKING AND
[82]  The way for a Christian to become mature is to accept the breaking from God.
[83]  Often God works in us and speaks to us through the speaking of the Spirit, the speaking of the brothers, the speaking in the Bible, and the prophecies and testimonies of the saints in order to shine upon us.
[84]  However, if we do not care about His speaking, do not listen to Him, and do not even respond to Him, then, because He loves us, He will cut an opening or make a hole in us.
[85]  In this way, the light of God and the life of God will shine forth from our incomplete and broken being.
[86]  If we struggle with God day by day, unwilling to lose, to drop, all that is in our soul, and to pay the price, then God has no way but to work from the outside and to deal with us through our circumstances.
[87]  Even though we have the Spirit of God in us, who is glory, this glory has not been manifested because it is only in our spirit and has not yet been manifested in our soul, our outer man.
[88]  At every time and in all matters, whenever we struggle with the Lord in our thoughts, preferences, and decisions, we have to be subdued, admit defeat, and lay ourselves down in order to let the Lord win and to let the Spirit spread out.
[89]  Just as the Lord is God mingled with humanity and humanity brought into God, we also have God being mingled with us and are being mingled into God.
[90]  Inwardly and outwardly, the condition of our entire being will match and be in harmony with the Lord s. At that time, we will be able to meet and dwell with the Lord in glory.
[91]  As long as we confess in our heart that we are sinners and open ourselves to receive Him as our Savior, the Spirit of God will enter into our spirit without any cost to us.
[92]  Today the problem is not with the Spirit s infilling but that many things apart from the Lord are occupying us.
[93]  From morning to evening, our emotion desires many things that, though they may not be evil, filthy, or sinful, are not the Lord Himself.
[94]  Ever since He saved us, the Lord has been continuously working to move us, demand of us, encourage us, and even wait for us to empty out the things that are occupying our emotion so that He can have the ground.
[95]  Sometimes we bargain with the Lord until He gives in. Even when we agree to the Lord s requests, eventually we still break our promises.
[96]  THE WAY FOR A CHRISTIAN TO MATURE IN LIFE Turning Our Heart to the Lord
[97]  In 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul says, But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
[98]  This verse indicates that when our heart turns to the Lord, the veil will be taken away, and we will behold the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face.
[99]  For example, suppose a sister is moved by the Spirit of the Lord and responds to His love, saying, Lord, although I love to dress up and live to adorn myself, I love You even more.
[100]  She will then realize in her mind that such beautification is not after the Lord s desire, does not glorify the Lord, and is not pleasing to the Lord.
[101]  If in every matter in our daily living our heart would be open and turned to the Lord, allowing Him to pass through and allowing the Spirit to enter into every part of our soul, then our mind, emotion, and will would be filled with the Spirit.
[102]  When the Lord through His Spirit works His glory, which is Himself as the Spirit, into us and saturates us from our spirit into the three parts of our soul, then we are becoming mature in life from glory to glory.
[103]  Some may think that if a person who is outwardly bad gets saved by God s Spirit and life, he should endeavor to have good behavior and conduct.
[104]  God does not save us in this way He does not correct our shortcomings from the outside.
[105]  God saves us by causing His Spirit and life to expand and spread out from our spirit, our inner being, so that we are completely changed.
[106]  After a person who has a bad nature receives God s Spirit and life, God desires that His Spirit and life would spread out from within this person until he is completely swallowed up and transformed.
[107]  Man s way is to outwardly improve and correct himself; God s way is to swallow us up and transform us from within.
[108]  A saved person may have a fiery disposition and a bad temper, but on the day that he got saved, the Spirit of the Lord and the life of the Lord entered into his spirit.
[109]  Of course, when we pray, we are in spirit, we have fellowship with the Lord, we feel the presence of the Lord, and we can touch the Lord.
[110]  Thus, when people touch us, they may not sense that we are sinful or that we are doing something wrong, but they also may not sense that we have God or the taste of the Lord.
[111]  If a Christian has the proper growth in life, when you touch his thoughts, you will sense the taste of the Lord in it; when you touch his likes or even his dislikes, you will sense the taste of the Lord; and if you watch the way he decides and chooses, you will also sense the taste of the Lord.
[112]  One day the Lord s Spirit and life will permeate our whole being completely, causing our whole being to be filled with the Lord and to have the taste of the Lord in full.
[113]  Here we would like to elaborate on a particular matter our heart.
[114]  Whether God s Spirit and life within us can spread to our mind, emotion, and will depends upon whether our heart allows God to pass through it.
[115]  But when our heart is turned away from the Lord, then we are turned away from the Lord, and spontaneously, there is no communication with the Lord.
[116]  We have to learn to turn within to our spirit to fellowship with the Lord so that we can be mingled with the Spirit.
[117]  His will follows him to love the Lord his decisions are according to the Lord s decisions, and his opinions are according to the Lord s opinions so his will also has freedom.
[118]  When we got saved, God regenerated us, and the Spirit of the Lord entered into our spirit.
[119]  If someone were to ask us whether or not we are saved, surely we would say that we are.
[120]  If someone were also to ask us whether or not the Lord is within us, we certainly would say that He is.
[121]  The reason is that our heart is often closed toward the Lord, and the Lord is detained in our spirit to the extent that He cannot come out.
[122]  Thus, the Lord is not able to move within us even a little bit, and He does not have any chance to come out of us.
[123]  In order for us to grow in life, our heart must be open to the Lord, and our mind, emotion, and will must be opened to the Lord.
[124]  What is the sense of the Spirit in us?
[125]  Whenever our heart opens to the Lord, this Spirit spreads out from within us into our mind, emotion, and will.
[126]  Whenever our heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
[127]  Then we with unveiled face are able to meet the Lord face to face and behold His glory.
[128]  The Lord is the Spirit, the Spirit is freedom, and freedom is glory, which is God expressed.
[129]  Second Corinthians 3:17-18 mentions five important matters the Lord, the Spirit, freedom, glory, and image.
[130]  After the Lord resurrected and ascended, He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .
[131]  The Lord Jesus incarnation was His becoming flesh; His death and resurrection were His becoming the Spirit.
[132]  Even before the Lord s death and resurrection, John 4:24 tells us that God is Spirit and that if man wants to worship Him, he must worship Him neither in Jerusalem nor Samaria but in his spirit.
[133]  We need to see that the freedom of a Christian, the glory of a Christian, and the image expressed by a Christian, are all the Holy Spirit Himself.
[134]  To repeat, the Lord Himself is the Spirit, and when this Spirit lives out of us, the Lord s image is expressed from us.
[135]  Therefore, to be transformed into the Lord s image means that in every matter in our daily living, whether big or small, we deny ourselves and walk according to the Spirit.
[136]  In all of our family life, church life, and contact and interaction with others, we must deny and reject our self and live in the Spirit.
[137]  Whenever we live by our self, the flesh is expressed, and whenever we live according to the Holy Spirit, the Lord is expressed.
[138]  If we do not regard our own views or the views of others and only pay attention to the feeling of the Spirit within us, then we will be those who live according to the Spirit.
[139]  The more we have the Lord s image, the more we will become mature, and the more we become mature, the more we will have the Spirit in our soul.
[140]  When we become mature, not only will we have the Holy Spirit in our spirit, but even our person, our soul, will be full of the Holy Spirit.
[141]  We will be fully transformed into the Lord s image, we will be mature in life, and we will be ready to be raptured to meet the Lord.
[142]  TO MATURE IN LIFE EXPERIENCING THE WORK OF GOLD, SILVER, AND PRECIOUS STONES
[143]  According to this verse we are being transformed into the same image as the Lord by the Lord Spirit.
[144]  These three Persons the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are actually one God, the Triune God.
[145]  The Triune God s purpose is to work Himself into us and also to work Himself out from within us.
[146]  This is to say, once a person is saved, he experiences the first step of God s work the element of the Triune God is worked into him and he receives the golden element of God.
[147]  Is a person mature if he has both the golden nature of God and the silver element of Christ?
[148]  A saint who has the golden element of God and the silver redemptive work of Christ does not necessarily resemble the Lord, having the Lord s flavor or the Lord s image.
[149]  Together with the pressing work of the outward environment, the work of the Holy Spirit will work the Lord s image as a precious stone into us.
[150]  Because we are rebellious and resistant, the Holy Spirit also uses the outward environment in coordination with His work within us to burn us, press us, and constitute us to the extent that our mind, emotion, and will all have the shining image of God and become like precious stones, that is, resemble the Lord.
[151]  If we dislike someone, the Holy Spirit will give us a sense within and cause us to feel that it is not right for us to dislike this person and that our dislike does not come from the Lord.
[152]  Now we will have the Lord s image, and everything that comes from our mind, emotion, and will shall be like precious stones being glorious and bearing the Lord s presence.
