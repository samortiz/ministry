Supplying Christ</H2><P>Some brothers and sisters give you the impression that they are very good. They have life and are living. They are brought into the coordination; their functions are realized, and their gifts are manifested. But they have not passed the hurdle of experiencing Christ as life and as their inward fullness. The elders must spend time again to fellowship, pray, and talk with them. They must study the Bible with them and trust that the Holy Spirit will open their understanding to see that the gifts are just the glass containers and that only Christ is the content. Now the question is: every time the gift is exercised, what is in the container? You have to show them that the content of the gift must be Christ. Perhaps there is the need for another consecration here. The last consecration was for something else. This time they have to consecrate their gift. They have to say to the Lord, "Lord, I know that I have all these, but I am still empty inside. I do not have the fullness of Christ. Lord, I am consecrating myself to You again." You have to help them to go over the hurdle and to know the meaning of Christ as life, so that they can enjoy the riches of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Helping to Fellowship</H2><P>By that time, the elders have to help such brothers learn to fellowship with the Lord. This is what we have said many times&#151;to eat, drink, and enjoy God, to touch Christ every day, to have fellowship with Him, to absorb Christ, and to enjoy Him.</P><P>Up to this point, a certain number of brothers and sisters will be brought to a point where their functions will be manifested and their gifts will be realized. Furthermore, they will be able to minister their portion of Christ. They will be able to live in the fellowship and to eat, drink, and enjoy the Lord. How glorious is such a work in the church!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Perfecting in the Truth</H2><P>Although these brothers and sisters are useful by this time, you will find out that they are not entirely clear in the understanding of the truth. You still have to perfect them in many ways concerning the truth. I can never forget the help I received from one brother ahead of me. Shortly after I had come in contact with him, within less than half a year, he sent me a Bible from far away. This was the New Translation by J.N. Darby. This version gave me a lot of help. I have to admit that before this time I did not know that there was such a version in the universe. Later I left my job and served the Lord full-time. In 1933 I went to Shanghai. I can never forget that one day this brother came with two sets of books. When he saw me, he said, "Brother, all these are yours." After he said this, he went downstairs. When I looked at the two sets, I found that one was a book on the New Testament by Dean Alford. This was the authoritative word study of the New Testament. The other book was the Synopsis of the Books of the Bible by J.N. Darby. At that time, I felt that these two sets were too precious. I can tell you that for over three days I did not eat well, not because I was too sorrowful, but because I was too happy. Every word written in these two sets was like gold to me. They rendered me immeasurable help during those years. I am very clear concerning the perfection that brother rendered me.</P><P>I can still remember that one time I went to the living room of that brother. He came down from upstairs. The minute he sat down he asked me, "Brother, what is patience?" I was trembling all over at that time. I could not answer him at all. He was rocking in his chair and asking, "What is patience?" I said, "Isn't patience to bear with others when they mistreat you?" He said, "No. Patience is just Christ." After he said this, he stood up and said, "Let's go." He took me to the car and drove me home. When I arrived home, I was enlightened within. What is patience? Patience is just Christ! I do not know how much help this word has rendered me.</P><P>Two days later, I was again in his home. He asked, "What are you reading in the Scriptures these days?" I replied, "The book of Acts." He then asked, "What else are you reading?" I said that the book of Colossians seemed very interesting too. He said, "Oh, these two books are the most difficult ones to match together! But actually, only these two books match one another. Acts reveals to us how Christ is the Head, and Colossians shows what kind of Head He is." I wanted to hear more, but he would not say any more. I can tell the brothers and sisters that when I went home to read these two books again, I got the light, and I saw that indeed, only Colossians can match the book of Acts. Acts portrays to us a resurrected and ascended Head, whereas Colossians shows us how rich the Head is and how He is everything. I must say that I had received this brother's perfecting. His influence was very great, and the results were also very great.</P><P>Oh, brothers, the administration of the church is not a simple matter. The matter of coordination alone includes so many things. Today we can only stop here.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_102.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_104.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Elders' Management of the Church &nbsp; pg 103</div><br></body></html>
