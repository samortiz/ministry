   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FIFTY-FOUR CHRIST HIS PERSON 34</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall cover further aspects of what Christ is in His person to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>29.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Feast</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Colossians 2:16 and 17 say, "Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the aforementioned items of the ceremonial law are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, which are the things to come.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The body, like a man's physical body, is the substance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The rituals in the law are a shadow of the real things in the gospel, like the shadow of man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is the reality of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the good things in the gospel belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For us as believers, Christ is the feast, the new moon, and the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul's word in Colossians 2:16 and 17 indicates that to the believers Christ is the real feast.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word "feast" in verse 16 refers to the annual Jewish festivals, signifying joy, enjoyment, and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Three times a year God's chosen people came together for the annual feasts, which were times of enjoyment, of rejoicing together before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although the feasts were enjoyable, they were simply shadows of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the real joy, enjoyment, and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>30.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The New Moon</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Colossians 2:16 and 17 also indicate that Christ is the new moon.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The new moon signifies a new beginning with light in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Just as the new moon marked a new beginning in Old Testament times, so Christ affords us a new beginning with light in darkness today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before we came to the Lord, we, like all unbelievers, were in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we have Christ as the new moon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>31.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sabbath</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Colossians 2:16 and 17 we see that Christ is the Sabbath, which signifies completion and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without completion, we cannot rest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rest always comes from completion and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we have finished a certain matter and are satisfied with it, we are then able to be at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After God completed His work of creation on the sixth day, He enjoyed rest on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, we also can enjoy rest only when our work has been completed and we are satisfied with it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the Sabbath signifies Christ as the believers' completion and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to Colossians 2:16 and 17, Christ is the reality of the various aspects of the ceremonial law, which are shadows of spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The festivals, the new moons, and the Sabbaths were all shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The body, the solid substance, of these shadows is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a Christ is now for our enjoyment and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>32.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Armor</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ephesians 6:11 opens with the words, "Put on the whole armor of God."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To fight the spiritual warfare, we need Christ as the armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The whole armor of God is for the entire Body, not for any individual member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church is a corporate warrior, and the believers together make up this unique warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only the corporate warrior, not an individual believer, can wear the armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is contrary to the concept held by many Christians that an individual believer is able to wear the entire armor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The armor in Ephesians 6 is not for the believers as individuals; it is for the church corporately as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This chapter reveals not the believers fighting as individuals, but the believers fighting as a corporate entity for God's interests on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, we must fight the spiritual warfare in the Body, not individually.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to Ephesians 6, Christ is the armor that we put on for our protection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to fight in the spiritual warfare, we must put on Christ as the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Ephesians 6:14-17 there are six aspects of Christ as armor: the girdle of truth, or reality; the breastplate of righteousness; the firm foundation of the gospel of peace the shoes ; the shield of faith; the helmet of salvation; and the sword of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Of these six aspects of Christ as our armor, only the sword is for offensive warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the other items are for defense.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to put on Christ as the whole armor of God so that we "may be able to stand against the stratagems of the Devil."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These stratagems are the Devil's evil plans.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Not only does the Devil have an evil will, but he also has subtle stratagems to work out his will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we would stand against these stratagems, we need to put on Christ as our armor.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us now consider briefly the six aspects of Christ as armor to the believers.</S>
