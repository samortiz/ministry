   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This Samaritan came purposely to this half-dead man.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When he saw the man, he was moved with compassion, and he saved him with two things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One was wine, and the other was oil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He poured out the oil and the wine, put them on the wounds, and bound up the wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to see that this is after Golgotha and after Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not at Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If it were at Bethlehem, it would have been the wine on the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But since Jerusalem and since the house of Cornelius, it is the oil on the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Wine represents the work of Golgotha.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Oil represents the work on the day of resurrection and the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Wine is symbolized by the cup at the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you become sick, what the elders bring to your house is the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is represented there is what is spoken of here.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, wine is the work of redemption, and oil is the work of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Wine symbolizes the blood of the Lord in redeeming us, and oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit applying the work of the Lord to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If it were only the oil poured without the wine, there would be no foundation for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If there were no oil, salvation would not have any effect.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without the cross, it would have been unrighteous for God to forgive our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It would mean that He was dealing with our sins in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It would mean that He was glossing over our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But without the oil, though God may have accomplished redemption in His Son and may have solved the problem of our sins, that work could not be applied to us; we would still be wounded.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here we see that there is oil, and there is wine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, the oil is mentioned first.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is the Holy Spirit who has applied the work of the Lord upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the procedure of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the oil that is mingled into the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Holy Spirit does nothing other than convey the Lord's work to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many of our sisters are nurses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We also have two brothers here who are doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you know that the function of the wine is altogether negative?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is used as a disinfectant.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that the redemption of the Lord is to deal with past filth and past sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The oil is there to help the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here, on the one hand, there is the removal of what was in the first Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the other hand, there is the new life from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only by this can the dying man be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I will speak more concerning this matter if I have an opportunity later.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After the good Samaritan bound up the wounds of the man beaten by the robbers, what happened next?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He placed him on his own beast.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The beast denotes traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>With a beast, you can travel without exerting much effort.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When there is a beast, I do not have to travel by my own effort; the beast will carry me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Where did the beast go?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It went to the inn.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This inn is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When this man is brought to God, God cares for him.</S>
