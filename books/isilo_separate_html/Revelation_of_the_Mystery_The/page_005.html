Ephesians chapter three reveals that even the dimensions of the universe-the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth-are Christ (v. 18). No one can tell how wide the universe is. The breadth of the universe is immeasurable and boundless. The length and height of the universe are also boundless. Today, due to scientific advancements, man is able to go to the moon. According to the human perception, the distance from the earth to the moon is quite far. However, from the perspective of the whole universe, that distance is quite insignificant. The breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe are immeasurable, and all of these dimensions are Christ. Christ is the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe. Ephesians chapter three says that when Christ makes His home in our entire being, we will know what are the breadth, length, height, and depth. Do not think that our mentality can ever thoroughly apprehend Christ. In his old age Paul wrote in Philippians 3 that he wanted to &#8220;know&#8221; Christ (v. 10a). Paul knew Christ much more than we do, yet at that time he still wanted to know more of Christ. Our Lord is all, and He is unlimited.<h2 class=head1>THE SON BEING THE FATHER, AND THE SON ALSO BEING THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Because of man&#8217;s limited mentality, there have been many debates and different interpretations concerning the person of Christ. In the last twenty years, in speaking concerning the experience of life, I often have spoken of the Lord Jesus being the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and I have met opposition because of what I have said. Someone once attacked me, saying, &#8220;How can you say that the Lord Jesus is the Son and also the Father? How can you say that He is the Son and also the Spirit?&#8221; When I met this opposer ten years ago, I asked him, &#8220;If the Father is not the Son, and if the Son is not the Spirit, how can you say that God is triune? Do you have one God or three Gods?&#8221; To my surprise he answered, &#8220;I have three Gods.&#8221; Immediately I warned him, saying, &#8220;You must by no means teach this kind of doctrine. To say that there are three Gods is heresy.&#8221; This incident shows us that if a person has not seen that Christ is all, he will oppose this concept and say that Christ is only the Son and not the Father or the Spirit. If this were the case, then Christ would not be all. Today, however, we see that in this universe there is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and that the Lord Jesus is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Isa. 9:6; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). In this universe there is both God and man. The Lord Jesus is both God and man. In this universe there is the Creator and there are the creatures. Our Lord Jesus is not only the Creator but also a creature (Col. 1:15-16).<p>Concerning this matter, another one also opposed me, saying, &#8220;To say that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation is to make Christ a creature, and this is heresy! Christ is the Creator but not a creature!&#8221; I refuted his argument by showing him that Christ became a man with bones, flesh, and blood, so He was surely a man. Was man created or not? Yes, man was created. Christ is God the Creator, yet He became a man, a created one. If you do not confess that the Lord is a creature, this means that you do not confess that He is a man. If you confess that the Lord Jesus is a man, then since man is a creature, you must confess that He is both a creature and the Creator. He is both man and God. Our Christ is all.<p>When you breathe, you should say, &#8220;O Lord, You are my real air.&#8221; When you go down some stairs, you should say, &#8220;O Lord, You are my stairs.&#8221; When you see a door, you should say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus, You are my door.&#8221; When you see a window, you should say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus, You are my window for fresh air.&#8221; The Scriptures clearly say that the Lord Jesus is all. Not only is He all, but He is also &#8220;Lord of all&#8221; (Acts 10:36b). All comprises all persons, matters, and things. He is the Lord of all persons, matters, and things.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST FILLING ALL</h2><p>Furthermore, Ephesians 1:22b-23 says that the church is &#8220;the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&#8221; What does this mean? We must realize that the fullness here is not Christ but the church. We must not apply the fullness here to Christ but to the church. The fullness is the church. Today in Taiwan there is so much rich produce-different kinds of grains, fruits, and vegetables, plus chickens, ducks, and other kinds of meat. These are the riches, not the fullness, of Taiwan. When we take in all these riches as our nourishment, eventually all of us will look healthy and strong. Then we may say that we are the fullness of Taiwan. Similarly, Christ is rich. When we enjoy and assimilate His riches so that they become us, we become the fullness of Christ. We are not the riches of Christ but the fullness of Christ. The riches of Christ are all that Christ is, and when all these riches become us, we become His fullness.<p>Let us come back to the matter of Christ being all. Do you see that Christ is all? Is Christ the reality of the heavens? Yes! Is Christ the reality of the earth? Yes! The emergence of the dry land from the death waters on the third day in Genesis 1 is a type of Christ who resurrected from the dead. Christ is typified not only by the light and the expanse but also by the land, which was raised out of the death waters on the third day. In the same chapter you see that the plants, animals, and mankind all came out of the earth. This signifies that life comes out of the resurrected Christ. Furthermore, the land of Canaan promised by God to His chosen people is a type of the Lord Jesus. The land of Canaan is surrounded by water-the Mediterranean Sea, the Dead Sea, and the Jordan River. This land, which is two to three thousand feet above sea level, is a type of Christ as the resurrected, transcendent One and as the source of life. Hence, we may say that Christ is the real land.<p>If people had such an enlarged view of Christ as all, then they would not argue, saying that Christ is the Son but not the Father. They would not say that Christ is the Creator but not a creature. The Bible says that Christ is the Lamb and the Lion. Is a lion the Creator or a creature? It is true that the Bible says that Christ is the Creator, in whom all things were created (Col. 1:16). However, Christ also became a created one. He became the Lamb, the Lion, and a vine. Are these items created things or the Creator? If we had a complete view and saw that Christ is all, then we would not argue. Hallelujah! Christ is indeed all!<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
