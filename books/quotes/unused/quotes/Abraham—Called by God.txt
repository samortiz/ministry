The messages in this volume are devoted primarily to the experience of Abraham the one called by God to become the father of the called race
The first section covers God's creation, the second covers the serpent's corruption of mankind, and the third covers Jehovah's calling
According to the revelation of the Bible, Elohim, the Hebrew word for God in 1:1, is a title that mainly relates to God's creation
Since the name Jesus includes Jehovah, we may say that Jesus is the New Testament Jehovah and that Jehovah was the Old Testament Jesus
Because of the fall, our relationship with God the Father is sweeter and more meaningful than it would have been without the fall
The thirty-nine and a half chapters that compose the third section of Genesis are a brief of the entire New Testament
As we have pointed out on other occasions, the New Testament begins with the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom
When Jehovah came in to call Abraham in Genesis 12, He gave him a promise, and that promise was the preaching of the gospel
In God's preaching of His gospel to Abraham, He promised the called ones that He would give Himself to them as a blessing
When God revealed Himself to Moses, He said, 'I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'
The New Testament is simply an autobiography of the Triune God-of the Father in Abraham, the Son in Isaac, and the Spirit in Jacob
When God called Abraham, in a sense He called a corporate man, but, in another sense, He called a single person
Although all of the descendants of Adam were created in Adam, we cannot say that all the descendants of Abraham were called in Abraham
Although it appears so outwardly actually this is not the case for Romans 978 says that not all the seed of Abraham are the children of God
Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, as long as we have had a new beginning by faith in Christ, we are Abraham's seed
At the time of His calling of Abraham, God began to have a new beginning, and now we all have entered into this new beginning through faith
When we say that God's calling is a new beginning, we must understand that this new beginning is a transfer of race
Although we were born in a particular race at the time of our calling we were transferred into another race the new race of the called ones
Although you can boldly declare that you have undergone the transfer of race, can you say that you have experienced the transfer of life?
Due to the fall of man, all of God's original creation became old and is no longer able to fulfill God's purpose
The transfer of life in God's calling is from the fallen life of the old creation to this stronger and better life of the new creation
He had the new beginning, the transfer of race, and the transfer of life, which was a great problem to both him and God
God rejected Eliezer saying to Abraham This shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir
The wife was the one who made the proposal and eventually she was the one who was troubled by the result of her proposal
Your name shall be changed from Abram, which means an exalted father, to Abraham, which means the father of a great multitude
After the death of the strength of his fleshFBefore Isaac was born, Abraham and Sarah were completely deadened
What he had-Eliezer-and what he intended to keep-Ishmael-were all rejected, and his natural ability was terminated
When 'the time of life' came, Isaac was born of these two dead ones, as if it was by the power of resurrection
Probably, some of us still cling to Eliezer, some want to hold on to Ishmael, and some have been fully disappointed
Laban thought that Jacob was helping him with his flocks, but while Jacob was helping Laban, he made a flock for himself
Although it took God a long time to accomplish this, at a certain time He told Jacob that his name was being changed from Jacob to Israel
With the believers, the transfer of life is accomplished by the experience of circumcision, by the putting off of the flesh
All that God promised to Abraham will be the blessings of the New Testament gospel in which we all shall participate through faith in Christ
Although Genesis is a long book, it has only three sections: God's creation , the serpent's corruption , and Jehovah's calling
Although you have been called out of the old race, the nature and life of the old race still remain in you, and you still live by that life
His lameness was a sign that he had been touched by God that his natural strength had been dealt with and that he had become a prince of God
If you say that you have been called, then you must come out of Chaldea, Babel, the old race, and your natural life
Although at times the process of this transfer is not pleasant, after a while you can see in the saints the real transfer of life
Man had forsaken God, had exalted himself, had denied God's right and authority, and had turned from God to serve idols
Although God's calling is carried out in time, something prior to that-God's selection-took place in eternity past
One day, in time, while Abraham was worshipping other gods, having no forethought that he was to be called by God, God visited him
If we study the Bible carefully, we shall see that, in Ur of the Chaldees, God did not appear to Abraham's father but to Abraham
Abraham however did not accept that calling immediately and God sovereignly caused his father Terah to bring the family from Ur to Haran
In the second calling at Haran, God called Abraham out of his country, his kindred, and also out of his father's house
At the time of God's second calling, however, He told him not only to leave his country and kindred but also his father's house
As you read the book of Genesis, you will notice that the records of Adam, Abel, Enoch, and Noah are quite distinct one from another
The significance of this overlapping is that, according to the experience of life, these three persons are one man, a corporate man
The God who came to call this corporate person and who dealt with this corporate man was the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
When God spoke to Moses out of the burning bush He said I am the God of thy father the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob
A son is one who comes out of the father, who inherits all that the father is and has, and who accomplishes all that the father desires
He was out of the father, he inherited everything of the father, and he worked to accomplish his father's purpose
The Lord Jesus as the Son of God came out of the Father inherited all that the Father is and has and accomplished all the Fathers will
The Triune God considered them as members of a corporate man for His dealings and for Him to be their God in this way
The last thirty-nine and a half chapters of Genesis are a biography of a corporate person composed of three plus one
Abraham had a good beginning with being called, but there is no record of his being chosen or of his reaching an ultimate and matured end
Do you believe that, according to the record of Genesis, Abraham attained to the highest and consummate maturity of life?
Although Abraham was high in the life of faith, we do not see in him the maturity of life that we see in Jacob
By this we can see that, according to experience, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not individuals but three members of the whole Body
Isaac needed the beginning of both Abraham's and Jacob's experiences and the end of Jacob's experience for his completion
Although there are so many good ones, such as Abel, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham, in the book of Genesis, no one is as mature as Jacob
If we add together the experiences of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, we have a clear portrait of the complete experience of the called one
While Jacob was a prince of God, Joseph was the one who reigned over the world, reigning over all the earth for Jacob
We need You to regenerate us, to discipline us, to transform us, and to make us grow that we might mature in life
Our Triune God, how we bow to You, worship You, praise You, and thank You for all that You have done to us and in us'!
According to our traditional background, everyone ranks Abraham at the top, thinking that he exceeds everybody else
How wonderful it is to realize the Son's redeeming, saving, bringing us into the inheritance, and accomplishing of God's eternal purpose
How excellent it is to experience the Spirit's regenerating, disciplining, transforming, and causing us to grow and mature
In the last message we saw that the Triune God dealt with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as one complete corporate man
Abraham's dwelling place was not only in a place full of demons but also in a place that was enclosed by two great rivers
It was very difficult for him or any other person to leave such a place, for the demons held him and the great rivers enclosed him
Many of the students are little demons selling drugs and trying to hold you back, saying, 'How can you be different from us?
Behind Sarah there might have been many demons, and these demons would not agree with Abraham's getting out of Chaldea
It was neither an angel nor a dignified person who appeared to Abraham but the God of glory Himself who appeared to him
Although we might forget the day or even the year when we were saved, we can never forget the time that, deep within, we saw Jesus
Many of us can testify that at the time we were saved, deep within us we had the consciousness that Jesus was speaking to us
With others, the Lord Jesus has spoken in a different way, saying, 'Look at how sinful you are, at how bad and poor you are'!
Many of us have heard words such as these, not out of the mouth of a preacher but out of the mouth of the living Jesus
Do you recall the kind of speaking you heard from the living Jesus when He appeared to you at the time you were called and saved?
The non-Christians, including the professing Christians, have not had this kind of experience and they consider it as superstition
He might even say I dont believe in Jesus anymore but deep within the Lord says How can you say that you dont believe in Me anymore
A genuine Christian has, at least once, heard the speaking of Jesus by the living Spirit directly in the depths of his being
God told Abraham to get out of his country, from his kindred, and from his father's house, unto a land that He would show him
Since the Spirit is God Himself, this means that God promised that He would give Himself to Abraham as the blessing
In His promise, God made another turn from Abraham back to all the families of the Adamic race through Christ, the seed of Abraham
God turned from Adam to Abraham and, eventually, He turned from Abraham through Christ back to the created race
Since the United States is helping the nation of Israel today, surely the United States is under God's blessing
In the gospel, after we repent for the kingdom, we need to believe that we may have eternal life, which is in the Spirit
The blessing promised to Abraham, which, according to Galatians 3:14, is the promise of the Spirit, is the very blessing of the gospel
A nation is a matter of dominion to represent God, and blessing is a matter of image in the Spirit to express God
Some may ask why 1:26, 28 mention expressing God with His image first and representing Him with His dominion second
In God's original purpose, it was image and dominion, but, due to the fall, in the gospel the order is reversed
The appearance of the wall and of the entire city of New Jerusalem will be the same as God's appearance-jasper
After we were saved, most of us met some mistaken preachers who told us many wrong things that distracted us from God's purpose
Praise the Lord that in God's recovery He has recovered us to His original purpose and He has brought us back to the beginning
Although it is easy to talk about river crossing, it is not easy to have the real river crossing according to the experience of Abraham
We may do this with respect to the calling of Abraham, for his calling is mentioned in both Genesis 12 and Acts 7
By these two verses we see that God appeared to Abraham in two different places: at Ur of Chaldea and at Haran
When God called Abraham the second time, He not only mentioned Abraham's kindred in a general way but his father's house in a particular way
Perhaps some of you reading this message still hold on to the concept that Acts 7 is a quotation of Genesis 12
The call in Acts 7 occurred before Abraham was brought to Haran, and the call in Genesis 12 happened after he had lived there for a time
Although you might have received the calling from God, you allow your relatives to be the mud through which you drag your feet
While Saul of Tarsus was on the way to Damascus to persecute the Christians there, a light from heaven shone upon him
You saw that your place, your environment and surroundings, was not the right place for you to stay any longer
He might have told his father Terah and his relatives how God had appeared to him and had told him to get out of his country and his kindred
In 11:28 we are told that 'Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees'
Abraham's delay in answering God's calling caused two deaths, the death of his brother at Ur and the death of his father at Haran
Your dear relatives, whom you love so much and whom you would take with you in answering God's calling, are always veils to you
When we come to Genesis 13, we shall see that Lot caused a great deal of trouble to Abraham and that eventually he had to leave Abraham
To be saved means to be called out of your background, to be called out of your present surroundings, environment, and situation
To be saved is not merely a matter of having your sins forgiven, of being rescued from hell, and of being qualified to go to heaven
Pilgrim's Progress, a very famous book written by John Bunyan, stresses the one point that salvation is a journey
Before Genesis 15, however, we have at least three chapters telling us that this justified one was on a journey
On the road to Damascus, the Lord appeared to him, shined upon him, and called him, and Saul's Chaldea became 'Ur,' the place of light
The Lord called Saul out of that religion in order that he might enter into Christ, God's new covenant economy, the church, and the kingdom
God is going to leave heaven and dwell in the New Jerusalem, which is the consummation of the church, for eternity
In His calling, God told him definitely what he had to leave, but God did not tell him clearly where he had to go
According to Acts 7:4, it was not Abraham who entered into the good land but God who removed him into the land
Although Hebrews 11:8 says that Abraham went out by faith, Acts 7:4 says that God removed him from Haran into Canaan
After crossing the river, he sojourned through the land, traveling southward until he reached a place called Shechem
After that time you wandered, journeyed, and traveled from place to place without having another appearing of God
Many of us can testify that after we were saved we traveled through Christianity without having God's reappearing
It was not until we came to today's Shechem with the oak of Moreh, that is, the church life, that the inner appearing rose up once again
Many of us can testify that after we came to the church we had the feeling that God had appeared to us again telling us This is the place
At Shechem, Abraham did not build anything to make himself a name; he built an altar for calling on the name of the Lord
We all can testify that we never called on the name of the Lord as much as we have since coming into the church life
We, the believers, are the true descendants of Abraham, and he is the true father of everyone who has been called by God
As we read all of the chapters in Genesis about Abraham, we must read them in the way of realizing that his story is our story
In principle, the seed is on a small scale, the growth is on a greater scale, and the harvest is on the greatest scale
The Christian workers and the leading brothers must have the faith never to be disappointed with the brothers and sisters
His living was an anti-testimony to the way of the humankind, to the way that had been fully developed at Babel
Although God's first appearing is initiated by Him and does not depend upon us, the subsequent appearings depend upon our condition
If Abraham had not arrived at Moreh, he would not have had God's reappearing, the reappearing that strengthened him to go on with God
Why do you go there on Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, twice on Sunday, and even sometimes on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday?
Although we did not realize what it meant at the time, we promised the Lord that everything we had was for Him
We all can testify how sweet is the sensation and how intimate is the fellowship whenever we tell the Lord that everything is for Him
It is not teaching that causes people to consecrate themselves to the Lord; it is the Lord's appearing that motivates them to do this
Between the house of God and the heap of ruins we build an altar that we might fellowship with God, worship Him, and serve Him
We all need to build at least three altars: the first at Moreh, the second between Bethel and Ai, and the third at Mamre in Hebron
We need to build an altar at Mamre in Hebron so that we may worship God, serve Him, and have constant fellowship with Him
With Abraham, the primary matter was to consecrate everything to God, to worship and serve God, and to have fellowship with God
That was the place where God's house was and where he began his testimony in expressing God by fellowshipping with Him
His altar was the beginning of his testimony for God to the world, whereas his tent was the completion of his testimony to the world for God
His tent was a miniature of the tabernacle built by his descendants in the wilderness, which was called the 'tabernacle of testimony'
Since his tent was pitched by Bethel, in a sense it may be considered as the house of God for God's testimony on earth
His tent firstly was a testimony for God to the world and then it became the center where he had fellowship with God
When Abraham was feasting with God in his tent, he was the high priest, and the inner part of his tent was the Holy of Holies
We can say to the worldly people, 'You have everything, but there is one thing that you don't have-God's presence
When we have a tent with God's presence, we have the deep sensation within that nothing here on earth is lasting
Hebrews 11:10 says that Abraham 'waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Maker is God'
While Abraham was living in a tent without any foundations, he was looking and waiting for a city with foundations
Abraham's tent was a miniature of the New Jerusalem, which will be the ultimate tabernacle of God in the universe
While he was living there with God, he was waiting for a city, a city that eventually will be the New Jerusalem
Although God had told him that He would give the land to Abraham and his descendants, Abraham did not care for that
We have seen how Abraham was called by God and how, by God's appearing, he was strengthened to answer that call
We have also seen that, by God's appearing, Abraham was brought to the very place where God intended him to be
He was brought to Shechem and then to the place between Bethel and Ai, the place between the house of God and the heap of ruins
That place between the house of God and the heap of ruins was the high point, and Abraham should have remained there
Suddenly, after such a high attainment in his experience of God, Abraham continued his journey, going toward the south
The night before you said, 'Hallelujah, this is the place for me,' and the next morning you began to journey downward to the border of Egypt
One night you were on the high point in Canaan and the next morning you were moving downward to the border of the world
Today you may say, 'Hallelujah, this is the best place for me,' and next weekend you may move downward to the movie theater
Although you may consider yourself a small creature, as far as God is concerned, you are a very important person
As far as God's keeping grace was concerned, Abraham was still on the high point even when he was selling his wife in Egypt
Even if you have fallen, you are still in the keeping grace, and the keeping grace will bring you back to the high point
By this one experience in Egypt Abraham learned that the God who called him also took care of him and that everything was in His hand
Through this experience Abraham was disciplined not only to trust in God but to know that God is real and faithful
As long as you are one of God's called ones, He will take care of you whether or not you believe in Him or trust in Him
When Abraham was planning to sell his wife, God was preparing to bless him, preserve his life, and give him many riches
When Abraham was planning to sell his wife in Egypt, there was no altar, tent, or calling on the name of the Lord
Abraham came back to the beginning, to the place of the altar, and there he recovered his calling on the name of the Lord
If you say this, you may soon find yourself in trouble, for the second trial will come from the blessing of the first trial
Abraham learned the lesson of not striving for himself and of having no choice for himself but of trusting in God's care
Lot made his choice, departed from Abraham, and 'pitched his tent toward Sodom,' not caring about the wickedness of Sodom
In Egypt, God dealt with Pharaoh in the plagues, but He did not appear to Abraham because he was in the wrong position
Now in chapter thirteen Abraham was not only in Gods keeping grace but having come back to the original place was also in the right position
He removed his tent and came to dwell in Hebron where he dwelt for most of the remainder of his time in the fellowship with God
The events in chapter fourteen, however, are not just related to international affairs but are sovereignly related to God's people
In the land of Canaan at that time, there were only two families of the Hebrew race-the family of Abraham and the family of Lot
If you had been there and had separated yourself from him, it would have been equal to separating yourself from God's mark
The first defeat occurred when Lot's herdmen were striving against Abraham's herdmen and Abraham offered Lot the choice of the land
On the contrary, when Abraham gave him his choice, immediately, without much consideration, Lot made his choice and went his way
The four kings had captured Sodom and all of its food supply, but one person who escaped told Abraham that Lot had been captured
Unlike us, Abraham did not count the weak point of his brother and did not take pleasure in Lot's suffering and calamity
The four kings must have had several armies, the number of men in which must have been much greater than the number of Abraham's men
Abraham had been called by God, and he answered that calling by coming forward to the very land that God intended to give him
All he had was a little experience in answering God's calling and coming forward to the place where God intended him to be
As we saw in the last message, a famine arose as a test to Abraham, and he was not able to withstand that test
When the problem arose with Lot, Abraham didn't take his own choice; he knew that his choice was in the hands of God
When Melchisedec appeared, two special titles of God are revealed: the Most High God and the Possessor of heaven and earth
Abraham said, 'I have lifted up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth'
Although his capture was a warning to him not to return to Sodom, he still went back, even after his capture and rescue
How was it possible for one who escaped to have come to Abraham, and how could Abraham have made such a brief and bold decision?
Do you not believe that before Melchisedec came to minister bread and wine, as the priest of God he was interceding for Lot and Abraham?
In answer to his intercession one escaped from Sodom told Abraham the news and Abraham made the bold decision to fight for the rescue of Lot
After we have finished our slaughter of the kings, our Melchisedec will come to us, meet with us, and celebrate our victory
Christ will be made manifest by our slaughter of the kings, and the whole world will be surprised at His coming
To us, the overcomers, Christ's second appearing will not be a surprise, but to the worldly people it will be a great surprise
We may answer, 'His name is Christ, the real Melchisedec, and He comes from the heavens where He has been interceding for centuries'
If we go according to that echoing forgetting our environment enemies and even ourselves we shall gain the victory and slaughter the kings
In our experience of Christ, we shall realize that our God is the Most High God and the Possessor of heaven and earth
Abraham told the king of Sodom that, before he went to war, he lifted up his hand to the Most High God, to the Possessor of heaven and earth
Since Abraham had full confidence in the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth, he had to be victorious
When Melchisedec came to Abraham, he blessed Abraham with the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth
Our victory gains the spoils, and the offering of our spoils to Christ always declares the greatness of Christ
Melchisedec, the priest of the Most High God, was there, granting Abraham the blessing and receiving tithes from him
Even the people who had been captured and brought back by Abraham wondered whose people they would be from then on
Abraham said, 'I have lifted up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth'
Abraham said that his fighters and confederates should have their portion but that he would give his portion to the king of Sodom
Can you believe that one who was so high could have been so low as to plan to sacrifice his wife for his living?
When Abraham was willing to sell his wife, he was in the lowest hell, but when he dealt with the kings, he was in the highest heaven
Abraham's victory and his being higher than the kings were absolutely due to the intercession behind the scene
The first trial that he faced in living by faith was a grievous famine through which he learned to trust God in the matter of eating
In the Bible and in human history, many times God exercised His control over the human race through this matter of eating
These herdsmen were fighting for their bread and butter, striving with one another for the sake of a better living
Abraham was victorious in the second trial, having learned in the first trial that God was sovereign in his daily life
He did not need to take care of his own bread and butter, for he had learned that the One who had called him would take care of this for him
Abraham was not afraid of those four kings but went out boldly and fought against them, slaughtering them and recovering the food supply
All of Abraham's experiences up to the end of chapter fourteen were outward, being concerned with outward blessing, care, and supply
Before hearing this, you might have thought that at the end of chapter fourteen Abraham must have been on the peak of his experience of God
After his slaughter of the kings, a strong enmity had been created between him and the people who belonged to those kings
When we are in faith, we are bold, saying, 'Hallelujah to the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth
He left Haran, where he had been called the second time, taking Lot along with him, and passed through Damascus where he picked up Eliezer
The Lord said to Abraham, 'This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir'
The Lord said to him Look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him So shall thy seed be
Abraham tried to make this an outward matter, for Eliezer was something outside of him, not something out of him
Some may argue with this, saying, 'Don't they have justification by faith, and is this not in chapter fifteen'?
Abraham was not justified by faith in chapter fourteen when he believed that God was the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth
Believing that God will supply our daily needs, our daily food, is good, but it is not the kind of faith that is precious in the eyes of God
Prior to chapter fifteen, Abraham had experienced God as the One who protected him and provided many material things
None of these things, however, had anything to do with the fulfillment of God's purpose but were only related to Abraham's existence
God's purpose is to have a people to express Him with His image, represent Him with His dominion, and take the earth for His kingdom
Everything that had happened to Abraham prior to Genesis 15 had nothing to do with the fulfillment of God's purpose
Many are still hoping that the Lord will give them a better job, a good husband or wife, a good education, or an excellent promotion
While all of these things may enable you to exist, they have nothing to do directly with the fulfillment of God's purpose
Although God had given Abraham a great deal, nothing that he had was useful for the fulfillment of God's purpose
Our education, jobs, and houses are all good for our existence, but none of them are good for the fulfilling of God's purpose
As we have seen, His purpose is to have a people in His image to express Himself and with His dominion to represent Himself
The seed that was needed for the fulfillment of God's purpose had to be what God promised to work out through Abraham
All of these things are just Eliezers, things which are not what the Lord has wrought into us to bring forth Christ, the seed
Perhaps even in the church life you might still be trusting in this Eliezer, meaning that you still trust in your college education
The Lord told Paul that he had to forget all of those things-they were dung, garbage, dog food-and to cast them aside
The Lord seemed to tell Paul, 'The things that you had from your religious background can never bring forth Christ
Many Christians, using the adjective form of the word grace, are fond of saying, 'Oh, how gracious God is to us'
The Hebrew word for gracious in Numbers 6:25 means to bend or to stoop oneself in order to be kind to an inferior person
The Gospel of John does not say that the Word became flesh full of blessing, or that blessing came with Christ
Revelation 22:21 does not say, 'The blessing of the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth, be with you all'
Abraham believed in the Lord according to His word, and the Lord counted his believing to him for righteousness
Although this is the New Testament age many Christians still live in the Old Testament dispensation caring only for blessings not for grace
During Abraham's time, the land was a place in which Abraham could defeat all of his enemies in order that God might have a kingdom on earth
Eventually, in the land, the kingdom of God was established, the temple was built for God's habitation, and the glory of God was manifested
It was one thing for Abraham to exist; it was another thing for him to have the seed and the land for the fulfillment of God's purpose
To them, Christ is not the land for them to live in and to live on; neither is He the land for them to slaughter all their enemies
If we see this, then we know how greatly most Christians have missed the mark in seeking only for God's blessings
We do not need to pay that much attention to our existence or to be so concerned about Gods blessings because our Father knows what we need
Eliezer was what Abraham had and Ishmael was what Abraham could do, and neither of them counted for the fulfillment of God's purpose
Before coming into the church, it was difficult for us to defeat any of our enemies, but after coming into the church, it was so easy
In the last message we saw that whatever Abraham experienced prior to Genesis 15 was a matter of God's blessing for his existence
God's calling of Abraham was not merely that Abraham should exist; it was that God's eternal purpose might be fulfilled through him
Beginning with chapter fifteen, God came in to show Abraham that he needed grace for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose
As we saw in the previous message, two things were needed for Abraham to fulfill God's purpose-the seed and the land
If you read Genesis 15 again, you will see that these two things, the seed and the land, are mentioned repeatedly
In Christ, God establishes His kingdom and builds His habitation, the church, for His expression and representation
At that time Abraham was justified by faith by the faith that believed that God would give him the seed to accomplish Gods eternal purpose
Although he was able to believe in God for the promise concerning the seed, he could not believe in Him for the promise concerning the land
Many Christians seem to be saying, 'It is possible for us to live by Christ, but it is impossible to have the church life'
Years ago, before we came into the church life, we ministered on the matter of living by Christ, but we ourselves were not in the rest
Because Abraham found it difficult to believe in God regarding the promise of the land, God was forced to make a covenant with him
If Abraham had immediately believed in God for the promise of the land, Genesis 15 would have been much shorter than it is now
It was not the time of sunrise but of sunset, and God did not come in a lovely way but as a smoking furnace and a flaming torch
In making His covenant with Abraham, God told him to take a heifer, a she-goat, a ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon
The three cattle, all of which were three years of age, were divided in half, but the two birds were not; they were kept alive
If we see this, then we can immediately understand that the three cattle, which were cut and killed, are types of the crucified Christ
If we read Genesis 15 along with the book of Leviticus, we can see that the female heifer was for a peace offering
Following this there was the need of the burnt offering, the offering which signifies that everything must be for God
After the peace offering, there was the sin offering, and after the sin offering, there was the burnt offering
Regardless of how strong you may be, if you were to be killed, you would be killed in death, not in resurrection
He was killed as a man who walked on this earth, but now He is living as the heavenly One soaring in the heavens
While His humanity was good for Him to be all the sacrifices, His divinity is good for Him to be the living One
In typology, the turtledove signifies a suffering life and the young pigeon signifies a believing life, a life of faith
His living forever is His testimony, for the testimony of Jesus is always related to the matter of being living
Today Satan and his angels are doing their best to rob Christians of the enjoyment of Christ for the church life
As Abraham drove the fowl away, so we must drive Satan and his angels away from what Christ is to us for the church life
At such a time God will always come in as a furnace to refine us, to burn us out, and also as a torch to enlighten us
On the one hand God is burning us and we are suffering; on the other hand He is enlightening us and we are under the light
It was in this kind of a situation that God passed between the pieces of the sacrifices, and that was the enacting of God's covenant
God made a covenant with Abraham in the way of passing through all of the sacrifices as a smoking furnace and a torch of fire
It was in this way that God confirmed His promise to Abraham by making a covenant with him for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose
God's asking Abraham to offer the cattle and birds to Him implied that Abraham had to be one with all of the things that he offered to God
Only by Christ's being crucified as our peace offering, sin offering, and burnt offering and being resurrected to be our life
Abraham's sleep signified that the four hundred years were to the children of Israel a dark night through which they passed
Ishmael's mocking of Isaac was the start of the affliction of Abraham's seed that was to continue for four hundred years
Before the children of Israel were tested in the wilderness for forty years, they had been tested for ten times forty years already
The persecution of the seed began thirty years after Abraham was called in Genesis 12 and continued for four hundred years
While we are enjoying Christ as the seed within and as the land without, a dark night may fall upon us and some trials and testings may come
By suffering the affliction as God prophesied, God's people should be assured that God would fulfill His covenant
In typology, this means that after all of the experiences of affliction, the church life will be expanded and become spacious
It is here in Genesis 15 that we are in the covenant made through Christ that enables us to fulfill God's eternal purpose
Although some Christians criticize the allegorization of the Bible, Paul took the lead to allegorize the Old Testament
If we are going to appreciate the treasures in the book of Genesis, we must realize that Genesis is a book of allegories
If you read the Bible with this heavenly light, you will see that the whole Bible covers this divine intention
Eventually, God had a new start with a new race, the race of the called ones, the first one of which was Abraham
If you read Abrahams biography you will see that again and again God came to him with a promise concerning two thingsthe seed and the land
Abraham was not young when he was first called by God; he was seventy-five years of age when he answered God's calling in a full way
If when God calls you you have nothing, that is very good, for if you have too much, that will frustrate God's calling
When Abraham was called by God, he did not have a child and he lived in a condemned, demonic land, a land out of which God called him
Following that, it might have been that after Abraham fell into Egypt, drifting downstream like a piece of driftwood, he acquired Hagar
In order to strengthen Abraham's faith, God made a covenant with him in a very extraordinary way, using three cattle and two living birds
Don't you believe that God was sovereign in giving us Hagar in Egypt and in the fact that she gave birth to a boy, not to a girl?
God has been sovereign in three respects-in giving us Hagar, in causing her to conceive, and in giving us a boy through her
God told him that a seed would be born not only out of him but also out of his wife, saying that He would give Abraham a son by her
God answered Abraham, saying, 'Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac'
We should not be content with just knowing the stories in Genesis but should press on to understand the meaning of the allegory
In other words, before the law was given, God took a photograph of what would happen with the law four hundred thirty years later
While grace is the proper wife, the mother of the proper heirs , the law is the concubine, the mother of those who are rejected as heirs
God had no intention of bringing in the law and of having man endeavor to keep it for the fulfillment of His purpose
, and the law was given in Exodus 20, four hundred thirty years later, after the exodus out of Egypt about 1491 B
They appreciate the law and try their best to keep it, making themselves Ishmaels, the children of the bondwoman
God does want us to live such a life, but He will work Christ into us to live for us a heavenly life to please Him and glorify Him
When God does not allow us to rely upon Lot then we turn to Eliezer expecting that he will enable us to live a heavenly life for Gods glory
Once we realize that God wants this, then we begin to exercise our own energy, our natural strength, to fulfill God's purpose
Perhaps you say that never again will you lose your temper with your husband or have a negative attitude towards him
The second commandment is that, as a Christian lady and a Christian wife, you need to be nice, sweet, and humble
Your third commandment is never to criticize others, and the fourth is to always love people and never to hate them
Whether we succeed or not in keeping our laws makes no difference in the eyes of God because in His eyes even our successes do not count
Although we may gain an Ishmael who is good in our eyes, we have the deep sensation that we are missing something
Just as the descendants of Ishmael are a problem to Israel today, so the Ishmael that we have produced remains a problem to us
In our ministry we are saying that you have to stop living a Christian life by yourselves and doing a Christian work with worldly means
Do not be bothered at our saying this, for regardless how much we tell people to stop, hardly anyone will stop
If anyone will stop trying to live a Christian life by himself or to work for the Lord by worldly means, blessed is he
When Abraham was eighty-six years of age, he still had too much of his own strength, causing God to wait for another thirteen years
While Abraham was so busy on earth, God might have looked at him and said, 'Poor Abraham, you don't need to be that busy
Our experience today tells us the same thing, for our Ishmael breaks our fellowship with God and keeps us from God's appearing
We see by this that it is not a matter of what we do or of what we are; it is altogether a matter of whether or not we have God's presence
The seed for the fulfillment of God's purpose is nothing less than Christ Himself wrought by God into, through, and out of us
No longer should we consider this story in Genesis merely as a kind of prediction but as an allegory of today's situation
We have a safeguard-to check whether or not we have God's presence in our daily life and in our Christian work
Do you have the assurance, the confidence, that day after day Christ is being wrought into your being to be the inner life by whom you live?
In this message we come to Genesis 17, a record of God's crucial dealing with Abraham in confirming His covenant
After God called Abraham, He gave him the promise and then He confirmed the promise by making a covenant with him
We see three things: Sarah's proposal, Hagar's expediency, and Abraham's exercise of the flesh to produce Ishmael
When Abraham brought forth Ishmael he was eightysix years of age and thirteen years later when he was ninetynine God appeared to him again
After Abraham had answered God's calling and had begun to live a life by faith in God for his existence, he had a failure
Taking Hagar to produce Ishmael was not simply a matter of right or wrong or of committing a sin; it was a matter of life
God's intention with Abraham was that He would work Himself into Abraham so that Abraham might bring forth a child to fulfill God's purpose
His wife Sarah even proposed this thinking that it would help Abraham to produce the seed since Abraham was old and she was out of function
It was as if God had turned His face away from Abraham and had refused to speak to him for that length of time
In the heavenly record those years were lost because Abraham exercised his natural self to do something for the fulfilling of God's purpose
We see that God charged Abraham with two things-that Abraham had to walk before the all-sufficient God and that he had to be perfect
El means the Strong One, the Mighty One, and Shaddai, implying the meaning of breast, udder, means all-sufficient
If we did not have the New Testament we could never understand adequately this title of God but now we can understand this title adequately
Regardless of how perfect we may be in ourselves, we are still short of God and need to be perfected by and with God
Have you ever realized that regardless of how good you are or how perfect you are in human eyes, without God you are short of something?
The losing of our temper should force us to learn one lesson-never to stay away from God but to trust in Him every moment
Regardless of how much we might train our four fingers to do things, they will still be imperfect because they are without the thumb
In order to be the number five, bearing the responsibility to fulfill God's eternal purpose, God must be added to us
As the person is the reality of one's name, so the changing of Abraham's name signifies the changing of his person
The more they seek this kind of spirituality, the more they become barren and individualistic, producing no seed
Even this kind of self has to be terminated so that we may be a multiplied person, not an exalted one, for the fulfilling of God's purpose
And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be'
Sarai's name was changed to Sarah because in a broad way, not in a narrow way, she was to be a mother of many nations
Although you may be a brother or sister, if you do not have God added into you, you are a narrow brother or sister
If you are going to be a broadened person with a broadened view and with a broadened mind, heart, and spirit, you need God to enlarge you
There was no need for God to confirm it again, for He had confirmed it once already, but it had to be confirmed from Abraham's side
While God was faithful to His covenant, Abraham was not because he had used his natural strength to produce Ishmael
In a strict sense, circumcision has nothing to do with the dealing with sin; it is a matter of being crucified and buried with Christ
As long as our natural strength remains, it is difficult for God to come in to be our everything for the fulfillment of His purpose
Suppose I, a saved person who has been justified by God, still live, act, and work by myself, doing everything by myself
The confirmation of the covenant by circumcision concerned the seed and the land for the fulfillment of God's purpose
In order to fulfill God's eternal purpose that man express and represent Him, we need to have Christ as our seed and as our land
In order to have Christ as the seed and the land for the fulfillment of Gods purpose we need to be circumcised and to live a crucified life
When the flesh, the self, and the old man have been terminated, the door is open for God to come in and bring forth Isaac
When we reject and deny our self and live a crucified life, we immediately have a new beginning in resurrection
If we do not live a crucified life, we are cut off from Christ, from the church life, and from the supply of the divine udder
In these verses we see that God promised in a definite way that the seed would be Isaac and that Isaac would be born of Sarah
The promise of the birth of the seed was confirmed definitely at the time when Abraham was as old as dead and Sarah was out of function
The birth of Isaac was not the result of Abraham and Sarah's energy but that it was absolutely the result of God's gracious visitation
Isaac was not produced by any element in Abrahams natural being he was brought forth by Gods allsufficient supply out of the divine udder
God will only honor what is out of Him because only the seed that is produced out of Him by the supply of His grace can fulfill His purpose
Beginning with Genesis 15, God began to train him in the matter of knowing grace for the fulfillment of God's purpose
Throughout all the ages, God's purpose has remained the same: to have Himself expressed and represented by man on earth
If God can gain a people, He will be able to accomplish His purpose, but if He cannot gain a people, He will be defeated
Although God called only one person, Abraham, this person had to become a race so that God could be expressed and represented on earth
It is impossible for an individual to fulfill God's purpose, for what God needs is not just an individual but a people
Abraham did not wait for God to do this, but, as Genesis 16 reveals, he acted on his own to bring forth a seed
Since God's divine title denotes His divine Person, the unveiling of the divine title is actually the revelation of the divine Person
In 1:1 God was unveiled as Elohim, which primarily means the Mighty One, the Strong One, and which is mainly related to God's creation
The divine title in 17:1 denotes that God is the rich source of supply as grace to His people for them to fulfill His purpose
All of the elements and ingredients of the riches of the milk we drink become our constituent, our organic tissue
After that message a very highly educated brother said to me Brother Lee that message was very good but the term eating Jesus is too wild
In John 6:35 and 57 the Lord Jesus said, 'I am the bread of life' and 'He who eats Me shall also live because of Me'
In Revelation 22 we see that in the New Jerusalem there will be a river flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
If we put all of these verses together we can see that our God today is One out of whom something is flowing to quench supply and satisfy us
We all must drink of the rich supply that flows out from our God that we may be able to fulfill the divine purpose
The Bible reveals that God's intention is to get into us and that we must eat and drink of Him, taking something of Himself into our being
What Abraham did for the fulfilling of God's purpose was accomplished by his natural being and natural strength
Since he did something for God by his natural strength, God was displeased and disappeared from him for thirteen years
You must drink of the supply of this udder and not do anything for Me by your natural strength or natural ability
Apart from Me, it is impossible for you to fulfill My purpose because apart from Me you can do nothing for My economy
Not only must God's title be unveiled to us, but our names need to be changed, meaning that we need to be changed
Everyone likes to be exalted; however, God does not want to exalt us but to multiply us, making us a father of a great multitude
While our natural tendency is to be exalted, God wants to change our name from the father of exaltation to the father of multiplication
For the sake of the fulfillment of His purpose, we need to forget our old name and be changed from being exalted to being multiplied
It is not merely for the increase or for the expansion of our work; it is for God to be expressed and represented on the earth
It is not easy for a family to live together with several young people because we all like to have our privacy and stay by ourselves
If the husbands are honest, sometimes even living with their wives is too much for them, and they would prefer to be left alone
If we are going to be hospitable, our name must be changed from the father of exaltation to the father of multiplication
Your particular character has to be changed into a general one so that you can be a mother of nations and take care of many people
When our name is Sarai we say, 'My husband, my home, my day, my children, my position, my function in the meetings, my everything'
Although the sisters may say 'my princess,' God wants them simply to become 'princess' without any 'my,' to be general, not particular
If the brothers still insist on being exalted and if the sisters still prefer to be particular, how could we have the church life?
For the fulfilling of God's purpose, Jacob's name was changed to Israel ; a heel-holder, a supplanter , was changed into a prince of God
If Jacob had remained a supplanter, he could never have been used by God in the fulfillment of the divine purpose
The proper church life is that which carries out God's eternal purpose through being supplied with the riches of God Himself
We must drop ourselves, depreciate our natural strength and ability, and walk before God, drinking of the riches of His udder
If we do this, spontaneously some element of His divine being will be wrought into us to produce the seed for the fulfillment of His purpose
Among and within us God has His dominion, and in this dominion God has a kingdom in which He may build up His habitation
It is Bethel, the gate of heaven, with the heavenly ladder joining earth to heaven and bringing heaven down to earth
We need to forget ourselves, cease from our natural source of supply, walk before God, and drink of His udder all day long
The riches of the unveiled divine Being will be wrought into our human being as the allsufficient grace for us to fulfill the divine purpose
The Apostle Paul labored more abundantly than all the apostles; yet it was not he but the grace of God that was with him
He did not exercise his natural strength to produce Ishmaels but enjoyed the rich supply of the sufficient grace to bring forth many Isaacs
In this message we come to a great and basic truth in the holy Word that is sown as a seed in Genesis 17-circumcision
In order to understand circumcision, we need to see two main points of the divine revelation unfolded in the Bible
The accomplishment of God's purpose does not depend upon what we can do but upon God's working Himself into us
As we have seen, Abraham did not give a clear-cut answer to God's call but dragged his feet through mud and water
It was not easy for Abraham to remain in the place where God wanted him to be and not long afterward he drifted down to Egypt
At the time of Genesis 17, Abraham had been robbed of all the places where he had been and of all the important persons he had acquired
Sisters, it is absolutely right for you to be for the Lord, but it is absolutely wrong that anything of yourselves be for Him
The seed of circumcision was not sown in Genesis 12 or 15 but in Genesis 17, after Abraham had been robbed of so much
God appeared to Abraham again, unveiled Himself as the all-sufficient Mighty One with an udder, and told Abraham to change his name
How can He take possession of the land so that He may have the proper church life for His dwelling place, dominion, satisfaction, and rest?
Our intelligence, wisdom, natural ability, natural strength, and all that we are in our natural being must be taken away by the Lord
God has a purpose and He has the called ones, but there is a frustration to His coming in to bring forth the seed-our flesh
Throughout the years, we have been robbed of so many things, but our flesh, our natural strength, our natural ability may still remain
In the Bible, the flesh includes much more than this, for it also includes our natural strength, ability, power, and talents
Although the book of Genesis contains nearly all the seeds of the biblical truths, it does not contain the seed of the overcoming of sin
Circumcision must be in resurrection, and it will always usher us into resurrection, just as death ushers people into resurrection
Both baptism and circumcision have the same purpose-to terminate our natural being and bring us into resurrection
Romans 2:28-29 says that circumcision is not 'outward in the flesh,' but 'of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter'
Since the priest had sprinkled water on his head and had changed his name to John, he thought that he could do the same to the meat
Baptism must be an inward reality in the spirit, not an outward form of sprinkling a few drops of water on a person's head
The circumcision of Christ, like baptism, means to terminate our old being and to make us a new creation, a new person
God called that appointed time the time of life, saying that according to the time of life He would return and Sarah would have a son
Praise the Lord that we do have Christ and the grace of God worked into us so that we can have the seed and possess the land
Following that, in chapters fifteen through seventeen, the third section, God trained him to know grace for the fulfillment of His purpose
As Abraham learned to know grace for the fulfillment of God's purpose, God changed him in both name and in nature
Abraham had been called had learned to live by faith in God for his existence and had come to know grace for the fulfillment of Gods purpose
At first, Abraham did not realize that one of these men was the Lord, Jehovah, and that the other two were angels
Of these forms of God's appearing-as the God of glory, as the Most High God, as El-Shaddai, and as a mortal man-which do you prefer?
Before the feet of the Lord Jesus were washed with the womans tears in the house of Simon Gods feet were washed in front of Abrahams tent
While Jesus was in the house of Simon having His feet washed and anointed, the priests of Judaism were worshipping God in the temple
Is He only the God of glory, the Most High God, and the El-Shaddai, or One in the form of a mortal man, the same as you are?
He does not come in the form of God but in the form of man, without making any declaration that He is Jehovah God
At this juncture, the Lord clearly unveiled to Abraham that He was Jehovah God by saying, 'Is anything too marvelous for the Lord '?
Although we may be unprepared to worship God, we may see someone approaching and ask him to stay with us for a while
Are you experiencing God as the God of glory, as the Most High God, as the El-Shaddai, or as the One in the form of a mortal man?
How sweet it is when God comes to us not with His divine glory or in His high position but in the form of a mortal man!
In his circumcised state, God came to visit him, and as a circumcised person Abraham had an intimate communion with the visiting God
Religion always charges people to go to God, but Genesis 18 reveals that God came to visit His circumcised one
When Abraham was sitting in the tent door to cool himself in the heat of the day, God appeared to him with the two angels
Because in both Genesis 18 and Matthew 13 three measures of fine flour signify the resurrected Christ in His humanity
The cakes, the calf, and the butter and milk all signify the riches of the all-inclusive Christ for the satisfaction of both God and man
Although the Bible does not say that Abraham presented this meal to God as an offering, in actuality he did so
In other words, we offer Christ to God as three measures of fine flour, as a tender and good calf, and as butter and milk
While we were enjoying intimate fellowship with God, we not only received Christ from God but also offered Christ to God as God's food
We all need to be in such an intimate fellowship with God that we not only enjoy Christ but also offer Christ to God for His enjoyment
The highest fellowship is not when we enjoy Christ so much before God but when God enjoys Him in us more than we do
The highest and richest meeting in the church is the meeting in which we offer Christ to God for His satisfaction
Today God is not only accomplishing His plan to fulfill His purpose, but as the Lord over all men He is also judging sin
The principle is the same in every aspect of our lives: in our married life, home life, personal life, Christian life, and church life
He intends to produce Christ and to destroy the 'Sodom' in our home life, work life, and even in our Christian and church life
Whenever we become nothing, that is a good time, a divinely appointed time, for us to participate in more life
A wonderful and marvelous doing of the LordFIn verse 14 the Lord said, 'Is anything too marvelous for the Lord'?
We can do what other people cannot do and we can be what others cannot be because Christ is marvelous and wonderful in our experience of Him
Abraham walking with God to bring Him on the wayFThe second revelation that Abraham received concerned the destruction of Sodom
After enjoying such intimate fellowship with Abraham, God and the two angels were satisfied, strengthened, and refreshed
Verse 16 says that then 'the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way'
Verse 22 says, 'And the men turned their faces from thence and went towards Sodom: but Abraham remained still standing before the Lord'
Although Abraham did not expect such a visitation, God appeared to him in the form of a mortal man, conversing with him as with a friend
God had found a man to whom He could commit what was on His heart, a man to respond to His heart's intention and echo His heart's desire
In this message we come to another seed of the divine revelation sown in the book of Genesis-the seed of intercession
Although we may suppose that Melchisedec was interceding behind the scene for Abraham, there is no record of this
The first clear mention of intercession in the Bible is in Genesis 18, where we see that Abraham was the first intercessor
In Genesis 18 we not only have a story of intercession but a clear revelation of the basic principles of intercession
Abraham did not wake up one morning concerned for Lot and then kneel down to pray to the One on the throne in heaven regarding him
While Abraham was sitting at his tent door to cool himself in the heat of the day, God came to him in the form of a mortal man
He surely did not come for a meal; neither did He come to confirm His promise regarding Sarah's giving birth to a son
God knew that there was no one on earth who was as concerned for Lot and who was so much with God as Abraham was
Rather, He came down to visit Abraham in the form of a mortal man so that Abraham might easily talk with Him and intercede for Lot
In Genesis 18 Abraham did not pray to God or call on the name of God; he talked to God as with an intimate friend
If he says, 'I would like to stay with you for a while longer,' then you will know that you can open yourself to him
Although God spoke to Abraham during the preparation and eating of the meal, He did not disclose the purpose for which He came
As Abraham lingered in God's presence, even after the two angels had left for Sodom, remaining standing before Him , God opened up to him
We must come all the way from Ur of Chaldea through many places to the tent door at the oaks of Mamre in Hebron
Even after he had slaughtered Chedorlaomer and the other kings, Abraham was not ready to converse with God in an intimate way
In chapters fifteen and sixteen we see that although Abraham was a man who sought God and loved Him, he was still so much in his flesh
In chapter seventeen he was circumcised and terminated, his name was changed from Abram to Abraham, and he became another person
When Abraham was in this condition, he was prepared and qualified to receive a revelation from God's heart concerning His desire
Although millions of people belong to the name of God, very few have been prepared, disciplined, trained, circumcised, and terminated
Suppose God would come to you in this way today and you would serve Him a meal and talk with Him, speaking with Him face to face
Abraham seemed to be saying Lord dont You know that in Sodom the wicked city which You are about to destroy there is a righteous person
None of the outsiders knew what they were talking about, but they understood each other because they were intimate friends
Since all proper intercession is according to the revelation which is out of God's heart, it must also be according to God's heart
Abraham did not intercede according to the outward word of God but according to the inward intention of God's heart
We have seen that Abraham did not abruptly say good-bye to the Lord but walked with Him for a certain distance
Have you ever experienced this kind of intercession, talking with God in a challenging way, saying, 'Lord, is this Your way of doing things?
In verses 27 through 32 we see that Abraham continued to talk to God about the number of righteous people it would take to spare the city
When Abraham proposed that thirty be the number, the Lord said that He would spare Sodom if thirty were found there
When God told Abraham that He would not destroy the city for the sake of ten righteous persons , Abraham was disappointed
According to Abraham's figuration, there must have been at least ten people in Lot's family, if all his sons-in-law were included
Proper intercession is neither according to God's love nor according to His grace, but according to His righteousness
We must challenge God according to His righteousness because His righteousness binds Him more than His love and His grace do
Every good intercessor knows that the way to bind God effectively is to challenge Him according to His righteousness
We may say to God Lord dont You know that You have promised us definitely in the New Testament to finish the good work that You have begun
From now on, many of us will exercise our spirit to intercede for the church by challenging God according to His heart's desire
We know that His heart's desire is to save His people out of the wicked city, to rescue today's Lot from the condition of condemnation
In this message we must consider this record in detail, taking it as a warning for ourselves and for our children and relatives
In verse 8 Peter referred to him as a 'righteous man' whose 'righteous soul' was vexed with the unlawful deeds of the people in Sodom
His grandfather brought him from Ur of Chaldea to Haran, stopping halfway because the grandfather would not go on
God did not appear to Lot or reveal Himself to Lot, because Lot was passive, not actively seeking God, and was living in a wicked city
God does not respect persons, but He does respect behavior, respecting whether or not we are active or passive in seeking Him
Those who took no initiative but who were passively brought into the way of the church have gradually fallen away
When Lot was faced with the choice between spiritual influence and material substance, he chose material substance
Abraham did nothing wrong in dealing with Lot, but simply because he dealt with him, Lot would never return to him
In 19:27 and 28, Abraham rose up early in the morning and looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah because he was so concerned for Lot
In spite of the fact that Lot knew Sodom was wicked in the eyes of God, he eventually entered into that evil place and lived there
Ur of Chaldea was a place of idols, Egypt was a place of worldly riches and pleasures, and Sodom was a city of sin
Although Lot stayed away from the land of idols and the place of worldly pleasures he drifted like a piece of driftwood into the city of sin
Although Lot was rescued from captivity by the Lord's overcomer, he was not helped to come back to the way of God
Lot went back to live in the wicked city which was condemned by God and which was to be destroyed by the judgment of God
According to ancient custom, whoever sat at the gate of the city was one of the elders, for only they had the privilege of sitting there
While the angels were staying in Lot's house, the Sodomites came to indulge in their sodomitical lust, coming from every corner of the city
If someone having a fresh sense of smell would come into the midst of the garlic eaters, he would immediately notice the scent of garlic
When Lot preached the gospel to them, some would not believe the word from the Lord, thinking that he was joking
If they had not brought the wine with them, how else could they have had it in the cave where they were dwelling?
If they would come in to the church life and remain in its pure atmosphere for a few months, they would never return to the sinful world
That Lot's wife became a pillar of salt meant that she had lost her usefulness in the hand of God and had become a sign of shame
Because some of her children, especially her daughters, were still in Sodom and because her house and her clothing also were there
Lot's life issued in bringing forth Moabites and Ammonites , who were rejected by God even to their tenth generation
Genesis 19 might be the only record in human history regarding a pillar of salt, and we need to consider it very carefully
The Lord was saying, 'If you are on your housetop at the time of My coming, do not come down into your house to take away your stuff
When the angels had brought the four of them outside the city, they said, 'Escape for thy soul; look not behind thee'
The seed of being put to shame was sown in Genesis 19, grows in Luke 17 and 1 John 2, and is reaped in Revelation 16
The basic concept of this message is that a genuine saved person faces the definite possibility of being put to shame
In this message we need to hear a sobering word from the Lord, a word that will sober our mind and quicken our spirit
Concerning the things of God, the best thing for a wife to do is to go along with and walk together with her husband
That Lot's wife became a pillar of salt signifies that she had lost her function and had become a sign of shame
Although the name of Abraham's wife, Sarah, is mentioned many times, there is no mention of the name of Lot's wife
At her looking back to that place, the Lord caused her to become a pillar of salt as a warning example to us all
We must heed the warning that a truly saved person faces the possibility of being put to shame at the Lord's appearing
What a shame for a believer to become a lifeless pillar of salt standing in the open air for nothing but suffering!
In this portion of the word out of the mouth of the Lord, we see that we must follow Him in the way of absoluteness
Many messages have been given and booklets published on John 3:16, but where are the messages and booklets on Luke 14:26-35?
In the kingdom age there will be the earth the land for the fulfillment of Gods purpose and there will also be the lake of fire the dunghill
Although they are believers, yet they live like worldly people, shopping and dressing in the same way as the worldly people do
Since they live and walk the same as the worldlings, there is no difference between them and the worldly people
In Luke 1734 and 35 the Lord said I tell you in that night there will be two on one couch the one will be taken and the other will be left
If you read the context of Luke 17:22-37, you will see that this word is not given to unbelievers but to the Lord's disciples
The 'two' in verses 34 and 35 refer to two of the Lord's disciples, one of whom will be taken and the other of whom will be left
The children of God who do not abide in the Lord as the anointing teaches will be put to shame at the Lord's coming back
We should simply say, 'Amen, Lord, I'm just abiding in You according to Your teaching of the inward anointing'
Notice that, according to the Greek, it does not say, like the King James Version, 'before Him' but 'from Him'
At the Lord's appearing we shall be in His parousia and not be cast out to the third place, the place of shame
Genesis 19:30-38, probably the first recorded case of incest in human history, is part of the section on living in fellowship with God
Abraham had a family for God's purpose, for Abraham alone could do nothing for the fulfillment of God's purpose
As we shall see, at a certain point, Lot's family group lost its function in life because the wife became a pillar of salt
She should have been salty and maintained a good flavor, but due to her worldliness she lost the function in life
Praise the Lord that eventually the far-reaching and unsearchable mercy of God is seen in one of the descendants who came out of this incest
Ruth, a Moabitess, a descendant of Lot through his daughter, became the great grandmother of David and an ancestress of Christ
Abraham's tent was the seed, and the tabernacle erected in the wilderness by the children of Israel was the growth
The children of Israel were the development of the seed of God's people, and now the church today is the continuation of this development
Lot's family was a part of the people of God, but they had left God's witness and testimony, which were Abraham and what he was testifying
God's witness and testimony were at the tent of Abraham by the oaks of Mamre in Hebron, not with Lot in the city of Sodom
God's presence was with Abraham's family because his family was the typical people of God and had the proper standing of God's testimony
All God's people, being His family, should dwell by the oaks of Mamre in Hebron, where God can pay them a friendly and intimate visit
After the angels left for Sodom to rescue Lot and his family, God's presence was with Abraham, His dear friend
Why do you make so much of the difference between Abraham's family and Lot's family when both of them are God's people?
Besides the family which was on the ground where they could have intimate fellowship with God, there was a free group
The source, the root, of the problem of the ancient free group was its departing from God's witness and testimony
As many of us can testify, when we departed from the denominations, we were happy and felt as though we were in the heavens
Although we may not be able to discern the difference between them by our thought, we can discern it by the sense of life deep in our spirit
They firstly left Gods testimony and drifted into a Godcondemned situation and then still having their own choice went to a little place
If you examine today's situation, you will find that the leader of nearly every free group has been drugged and befuddled with some wine
Most of the leaders of the free groups, being drunk with some wine, say, do, and decide things in a befuddled way
They may be very active in the things which they are pursuing, but they are asleep as far as God's testimony is concerned
We have seen that the mother, who, as the wife, should have been the helper in life, became a pillar of salt because of her worldliness
When Lot's family came into the cave, there was no function of life, for there was no function of the proper wife
They have lost the function of the Body of Christ, the proper function of life, and use worldly methods to fill the gap
Although they had neither the proper leadership nor the function of life, they had an evil way of acquiring the seed
Look at today's situation: some groups use rock music, dancing, drama, movies, and games to satisfy their desire of securing the increase
Once people have lost the proper wife with the function in life, they use ugly and worldly means for securing the increase
Lot's daughters had lost their sense of morality, having been drugged with the wicked current of the evil world
The result was that his daughters had no sense of morality and that their humanity was degraded to the lowest level
Some free groups today have also been drugged with the wicked current of the evil world and only care for success, not for the means
For the Lord to say, 'I never knew you' means 'I never approved of you because you are a worker of lawlessness'
In Genesis 16 through 21, there are three kinds of births: the birth of Ishmael, the birth of Moab and Ben-ammi, and the birth of Isaac
Although the Moabites were rejected to the tenth generation, in the case of Ruth we see the far-reaching and unsearchable mercy of God
Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, brought his family from Judah to seek the peace and prosperity of the Moabites
Even a descendant of Moab, a man born through incest, could participate, through redemption, in the incarnation of Christ
After Genesis 18 and 19, in which we see Abraham's high attainment in his experience of God, there is a record of his weakness in Genesis 20
If it were of human manufacture, the writer would not have included this record of Abraham's weakness and shortcomings
While in chapter eighteen he made a glorious intercession, in chapter twenty we find the record of a shameful one
Abraham's journeying toward the south meant that he had left the standing of fellowship at the oaks of Mamre in Hebron
If you go to Las Vegas and meet someone there who asks about what you do at home, you will find it difficult to give him an honest answer
When Abraham left the standing of intimate fellowship with God and journeyed southward, he lost God's presence
In chapter twenty, he should have been a circumcised person, not a natural person, for he had truly been dealt with by God
Many are the blessings that you have received from God, if you do not remain in fellowship with Him, you will be in the flesh
If we consider our past experience, we shall find that at least a few times we have done the same kind of thing
After Abraham had left God's presence and had journeyed toward the south, he repeated an old failure-lying by sacrificing his wife
Although you may not believe that you have a reserve, when you take a vacation from the church life, it will be exposed
In other words, in the presence of God, a man always stands for faith and the wife always stands for God's grace
We do not know how many times we have been in danger of damaging grace and losing the testimony because we have left the proper standing
At a certain juncture, God came in to deal with the circumstances so that the testimony of His grace might be preserved
If this had been clear to Abraham, he would not have lied; he would have believed that God would care for His grace and His testimony
When Abimelech gave Abraham sheep, oxen, servants, and silver, Abraham did not dare to say, 'I don't need your help
God wisely and sovereignly restored Sarah, taking care of His grace and His testimony, and at the same time He disciplined Abraham
Abimelech needed Abraham's intercession because the Lord had closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech
Many times, after we have failed the Lord, we are unable to pray for days, even though no one knows about our failure
When Abraham forgot his need and interceded for Abimelech and his house, not only were their needs met but also his
If you forget your need and pray for the needs of others, God will not only answer your prayer for them but also your prayer for yourself
The Bible does not give us a full record of Abraham's intercession for Abimelech like it does of his intercession for Lot
If you hold on to your feelings, your mouth will be shut, Satan will be victorious over you, and you will be deadened for days
Do not think that if you have attainments as high as those recorded in Genesis 18 and 19, you will have no problems
Although your old self has been dealt with by God, it is still untrustworthy, even if it has been fully circumcised
Along with His answer to your shameful intercession, He will also answer your previously unanswered prayers for your own needs
In the foregoing messages we have covered nearly ten chapters in Genesis regarding Abraham's experience with God
In those chapters we saw that Abraham, God's called one, had come to many stations and had passed through many stages
When, at the time of chapter twenty, the seed still had not come, even such a giant of faith as Abraham could not stand the test
Being the giant of faith, he interceded, not with boldness or the release of the spirit, but in a shameful way
If the first section of Genesis 21 has a spiritual significance, then the second section must also have a spiritual significance
Isaac, whose name means 'laughter' or 'he will laugh' , was born according to God's promise at the appointed time, the time of life
In God's calling us there is a goal, the same goal as there was with His calling Abraham-to bring forth the seed
Although we can produce many things and have done so ever since we were saved, it is very difficult for us to bring forth Christ
According to His timing, He will come in as the strength of grace to bring forth through us what He desires to have
Verse 8 says that 'the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned'
Isaac grew up and was weaned away from his mother's nourishment, meaning that he was no longer a young child but had become a young boy
God even counted Ishmael's persecution of Isaac as the beginning of the four-hundred-year persecution of His people
It was she who proposed to Abraham that he have a son by Hagar and now she tells him to cast Hagar and Ishmael out
In this way, we brothers learn the lesson of hating our natural life and all the good things we can produce out of ourselves
It was only after Abraham had undergone dealing after dealing and failure after failure that Isaac finally came forth
Christ has been born in our Christian life, but we still keep our Ishmael, hesitating to give up our good behavior
Many of us still boast in our natural goodness, saying, 'I am not as proud as some of the brothers and sisters are
When the Christ who has been born in our Christian life has begun to grow up, our natural goodness will mock Him
You may do it apparently, but secretly you still hold on to Hagar and Ishmael, to the law and to your natural attributes and goodness
The brothers and sisters will then begin to rise up and say, 'From now on there will be no more Hagar and Ishmael
When we are in our soul, in our natural being, we are wandering in the wilderness and can easily drift into the world
Leading to the joining to EgyptFIshmael's source of living eventually joined him to Egypt, that is, to the world
We see from all this that there is a well, a source of living, which can make us a wild hunter who kills life and can join us to the world
In 1 Corinthians 12:13, the Apostle Paul says that we have all been made to drink of one Spirit, that is, of one well of water
Are you drinking of the well for Isaac, the well which signifies the divine well, the well of Christ, the well of the Spirit?
In Genesis 20 and 21 we see that Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, did not reject God but accepted Him in his own clever way
Today, while the whole human race is living by a source which is without redemption, we are living by a redeemed source
The living water which we are drinking today is not natural; it has been redeemed at the cost of Christ's complete redemption
A tamarisk a type of willow tree has very fine leaves often grows near water and gives the impression of the flowing of the riches of life
The Lord Jesus said that whoever believes in Him will have rivers of living water flowing out of his innermost being
One is the natural source in the wilderness of our soul, whereas the other is the redeemed source in the garden of our spirit
Today we also need to fight for the divine well that we may have it for both the Christian life and the proper church life
God was not revealed to Abraham but was experienced by him as the ever-living, secret, mysterious One who is the eternal life
In chapter twelve he only called upon the name of Jehovah, not yet experiencing Him as the God who is the mysterious, ever-living One
The One we have within us today is the very El Olam, the hidden, secret, concealed, mysterious, ever-living One
Here the Scripture only tells us of one thing-that Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beer-sheba and called on the name of Jehovah, El Olam
As we have pointed out, Genesis 1 and 2 are not merely a record of God's creation but a record of life, with the tree of life as its center
As the tree of life is the center of the record in chapters one and two, the tamarisk tree is the center of the record here
Our Christian life and the proper church life are both a tamarisk tree, expressing the tree of life by which we live
We also need to go up from Beer-sheba to Jerusalem, not only having the church life at Beer-sheba but also in Jerusalem
Ishmael lived in the wilderness and was joined to Egypt, but Isaac lived in a planted place and was led to Moriah
As a result of this all the children of Israel were brought three times every year to the very mountain in Moriah to which Isaac was brought
Isaac's being brought to Mount Moriah was a seed which was developed in the going up to Mount Zion of all the children of Israel
These two chapters, giving the record of the birth and offering of Isaac, cover a period of at least twenty years
Although some have paid a little attention to the tree of life, they have not paid attention to the tamarisk tree
According to our opinion, the planting of a tamarisk tree may be insignificant, perhaps being only an ancient type of landscaping
If we do not have this tamarisk tree experience, we can only call on the old title of God, Jehovah, not on His newly unveiled title, El Olam
In chapter twentyone Abraham called on a new title of GodEl Olam the mysterious hidden secret yet so real living and everexisting God
The people in ancient times ate vitamins, but they had no scientific knowledge of them nor scientific terms to describe them
After the mention of Abraham's planting a tamarisk tree and calling on the name of the Lord, God came in to test him
Now, after Eliezer, Lot, and Ishmael had all been rejected, Abraham had acquired Isaac, the seed promised by God, and was at peace
Many Christians, including some Christian workers, have never learned the lesson of offering back to God what He has given them
One day, after our having a good enjoyment of the Lord, He will ask us to give back to Him the gift, work, or success He has given us
Genesis 21:34, the last verse of chapter twenty-one, says, 'Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days'
During that time Isaac grew up by the well of Beersheba growing up by a life of planting and calling on the name of the Lord the Eternal God
The one whom Abraham was told to offer up was a grown-up son, one who had lived with him in a life of planting and calling
When God told Abraham to offer Isaac, He told him to go to the land of Moriah and to offer him upon one of the mountains there
The mountain on which Isaac was offered was later called Mount Moriah, eventually becoming Mount Zion, the place where the temple was built
Isaac, who was carrying the wood for the burnt offering, said, 'Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering'?
Although it is a long journey from Beer-sheba to Mount Moriah and it is a journey which causes some suffering, it results in blessing
The more we stay in the church life, the more it will bring us from Beer-sheba to Moriah, from the growing water to the burning fire
Abraham had to pass through the separation of Lot, the rejection of Eliezer, the casting out of Ishmael, and the birth of Isaac
Although God had promised Abraham a seed, He did not give it to him until Abraham had made a thorough clearance of Lot, Eliezer, and Ishmael
As we have seen, Isaac did not grow up in the wilderness but in Beer-sheba, properly growing by the life of calling on the Lord
If you offer it back to God, after it has passed through death, it will be returned to you in resurrection and become a blessing
It all depends on our growing up to be offered to God as a burnt offering and then being raised up from the dead to be a resurrected gift
If you offer your one grain to God and allow Him to put it into death, it will be returned to you in resurrection
We see that Abraham believed in God for two things: for giving life to the dead and for calling things not being as being
The birth of Isaac was related to Gods calling things not being as being and his being returned was related to Gods giving life to the dead
In verse 2 God told Abraham to go into the land of Moriah and offer Isaac on one of the mountains of which He would tell him
On the one hand, in the church life today, as true descendants of Abraham, we are on Mount Zion; on the other hand, we are on our way there
His descendants, the Israelites, were the development of this seed, and we today are the further development of the seed
Verse 4 indicates that Abraham traveled for three days, for we are told that on the third day he saw the appointed place afar off
If you look at a map, you will see that the distance between Beer-sheba and Moriah is approximately fifty-five miles
On the third day Abraham put Isaac on the altar, and then what he offered to God was given back to him in resurrection
Because we are in His provision and have the vision, everything is clear, nothing is opaque, and there is no separation between us and Him
In the church life everything is crystal clear and transparent in God's eyes and in ours, and nothing is opaque
It was this infused faith that brought him to Mount Moriah where he enjoyed God's provision and had a thoroughly transparent vision from God
At that time there was no one on earth nor in the whole universe who was as clear about divine things as Abraham was
We are not going downward to Egypt we are traveling upward to Mount Moriah where we shall enjoy Gods provision and have a transparent vision
On the third day, Abraham put the two servants aside, saying, 'I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you'
It was no longer a story of four people-the father, the son, and the two servants; it was now a story of Abraham and his son Isaac
Before Christ bore the cross and walked to Calvary, Golgotha, Isaac bore the wood for the burnt offering and walked along the same way
We see that Abraham was a type of the Father, and Isaac, with the wood upon him, was a type of the Only Begotten Son of God
As Abraham and Isaac were climbing Mount Moriah, Isaac said, 'Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering'?
Do you not believe that while Jesus was bearing the cross on the way to Calvary He fellowshipped with the Father?
In 22:5 we see that Isaac took his father's will, and in Matthew 26:39 we see that Christ chose the Father's will
He not only followed the father to the foot of the mount; he also obeyed him in taking up the wood and in being bound
Even when the father laid him on the altar, took the knife, and stretched out his hand to slay him, he did not rebel
John 1:14, speaking of the Son of God, says, 'We beheld His glory, glory as of an only begotten from a father'
Praise Him that He was willing to be a little lamb putting His horns among human beings and being caught by us
When in Revelation 5 the Apostle John saw the scroll which no one in heaven or on earth was worthy to open, he wept
Many of us have had the wrong impression in the past saying that receiving a good job or material benefit means that the Lord has blessed us
We have all been told to count our blessings one by one, counting such things as our degree, promotion, wife, house, and children
We, the Christians, are the stars, the heavenly descendants of Abraham; and the genuine Jews, God's earthly people, are the sand, the dust
Although they are an earthly people, they are not the dust under the sea, but the dust, the sand, by the seashore
According to Revelation 208 and 9 at the end of the millennium Gog and Magog will fight against the camp of the saints and the beloved city
The camp of the saints is the camp of all the heavenly stars, and the beloved city, Jerusalem, is the city of the separated sand
Those represented by the Apostles are the heavenly stars, and those represented by the twelve tribes are the sand of the seashore
After seeing this, we need to say, 'Praise the Lord, God's blessing is not a good house, car, degree, promotion, wife, or child
God's blessing of Abraham eventually issues in Christ as the unique seed in whom all the nations of the earth shall be blessed
In the four Gospels we have the individual Christ, but at the end of Revelation we have the corporate Christ including all true believers
May we all expect that the blessing which we shall receive of God will be the multiplication that will issue in Christ, the unique seed
In Genesis 22 Christ is revealed in three ways: as the angel of the Lord , as the ram , and as the seed of Abraham
The angel of the Lord, who was Christ, provided the ram, a type of Christ, which eventually issued in the seed, who is also Christ
Genesis 23 is focused on the matter of a burying place and gives us a detailed account of the purchase of a sepulcher
Although Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac were living at Beer-sheba, she died and was buried in Hebron, the place of fellowship with God
We all must answer that we are living in Beer-sheba, in the church by the well of living water and the tamarisk tree
Before the Lord comes back some of the older ones may leave Beersheba the church life die in Hebron and wait there for the New Jerusalem
According to our natural concept, Abraham, one who was so good with God, should not have suffered all these things
Suddenly, while Abraham was enjoying a happy life with his wife Sarah and his son Isaac, Sarah, the factor of his happiness, was taken away
When Sarah died, the atmosphere, life, and happiness of this family were all taken away, and the family itself was gone
As God's called ones, we Christians should be so weighty that people are surprised and say, 'Why is this young man so weighty?
Genesis does not say a word regarding how Abraham put up his tent, how much he paid for it, or exactly where he erected it
Rather, he had strong faith in the God of resurrection, believing that his dear wife would be in that city and in that better country
Although he might have been somewhat light with his tent, he was not light concerning the burying place of his wife
His intention in purchasing the cave of Machpelah was not only to bury Sarah there, but also to bury himself there
Everyone who was buried in this cave was buried as one of a couple: Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah
Deep within, Abraham was filled with the expectation that one day his wife would be in the city of foundations
Although in ancient times it was not a small thing to take Jacob from Egypt to Canaan to be buried, Jacob's sons did it for him
Whenever anyone saw this, he would immediately have had the sense that it was a place of death, a place of termination
He devoted much attention and spent a large amount of money to purchase the burying place for Sarah, himself, and his descendants
If we have the light from the New Testament, we shall realize that this indicates the expectation of resurrection
Our forefather, Abraham, God's called one, did not care very much for the present, but he did pay attention to the future
In Genesis 2 we see that for the fulfillment of God's purpose we must have the divine life signified by the tree of life
When we were on Genesis 1 and 2, we saw that those chapters are not only a record of God's creation but a record of life
If you read those chapters carefully, you will see that many aspects of God's creation are omitted because they are not related to life
In the same principle only those aspects of Abrahams history which are related to life are recorded in chapters twentyone through twentyfour
The fact that such a long period is covered in just fifty chapters proves that Genesis is not a record of history
We should not understand the Bible according to our common knowledge or tradition, but come back to the pure Word
Whenever we read any portion of the Scriptures, we must forget all we have learned in the past and look to the Lord for something new
For the fulfillment of this purpose, God promised to give Abraham the good land and the seed which would inherit the land
If you consider the Bible as a whole, you will see that Isaac's marriage was altogether for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose
Isaac's marriage was not common nor merely for his human living; it was for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose
When this son was thirty-seven years old, the wife and mother died, and the father buried her in a very meaningful way
The father and the son, both of whom were now unmarried, were left alone, living together in that sad condition for three years
There is no record that God said, 'Abraham, let Me charge you to send someone to your own country to get a wife for Isaac
If we live in oneness with Him, He will not need to tell us what He desires, because we shall already know it by being one with Him
Although Abraham was desperate to take care of his son's marriage, he would not accept a Canaanite as Isaac's wife
If we had been Abraham, we might have taken the easy way and said, 'There are many girls here in the land of Canaan
Abraham did not think this way, but sent his oldest servant far away, back to the country from where he came, to find a wife for Isaac
When we live in oneness with Him, we shall share His concept, and whatever we think and do will be in accordance with His feeling
God will not need to say anything, for we shall sense what He senses, knowing His inner feeling because we live in oneness with Him
Young brothers, if everything you do is in accordance with God's economy, even your marriage will be the carrying out of His economy
If we are such a person, whatever we say will be God's expression, and whatever we do will be for the fulfillment of His purpose
Abraham did not charge his servant to be faithful, honest, or to do a good work; he charged him with and by the Lord
Abraham believed in the sovereign Lord, telling his servant that the Lord would send His angel with him and prosper his way
Rather, he only charged his servant to serve by the Lord, assuring him that God would send His angel before him and prosper his way
After she had done this, the servant was clear that Rebekah was the one and he gave her a ring and two bracelets
It was hard work for a young woman to draw water out of the well and pour it into the trough for ten camels to drink, but she did it
If the young sisters want to be under God's sovereignty, especially with respect to their marriage, they need to be kind and diligent
Although her brother and mother were hesitating, wanting her to stay for at least ten days, she said, 'I will go'
Some spent days, weeks, months, and even years considering whether a particular brother was the one whom God had prepared for them
If they had not been hospitable but rather had rejected Abraham's servant, that wonderful marriage would never have taken place
They accepted the Lord's sovereignty, saying, 'The thing proceedeth from the Lord: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good'
Laban and Bethuel recognized that this was the Lord's doing and that they had no right to say anything about it
Some versions interpret it as meaning that Isaac went to the field to pray, and others say that he went to the field to worship
After the servant had told Isaac all that had happened, Isaac took what his father had done for him and married Rebekah
In the New Testament we cannot find a verse which says that this marriage is a type of Christ marrying the church
The New Testament clearly reveals that Isaac, the son of Abraham, was a type of Christ being Abraham's unique seed
Based upon the fact that Isaac was a type of Christ, we may infer that Isaac's marriage was a type of the marriage of Christ
Because the Bible is a divine book composed with the divine concepts, we can see these concepts in the various biblical records
The subject of the New Testament is the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, working together to obtain the bride for the Son
In the Acts and Epistles we see how the Spirit works according to the Father's plan to obtain the bride for the Son
According to the King James Version, Ephesians 3:11 speaks of 'the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord'
In typology, this indicates that the counterpart of Christ must come from Christ's race, not from the angels nor from any other creatures
As Abraham commissioned his servant to reach the chosen bride , so God the Father commissioned God the Spirit to reach the human race
As that person was preaching the gospel to you, you were attracted by what he said and were willing to receive it
In our mentality, many of us said, 'I don't like this,' but deep within our spirit we said, 'This is very good'
Before we ever heard the preaching of the gospel or came to a gospel meeting, the Holy Spirit was already there waiting
In Genesis 24 we see a servant who was thirsty after his long journey and in John 4 we see a Savior who was thirsty after His tiring journey
When we heard the preaching of the gospel in the past, we did not realize that the Holy Spirit was thirsty for us
As you were listening to the preaching of the gospel, did you not sense that someone was desirous of having you?
On the one hand, you said, 'I don't like this'; on the other hand, something deep within you said, 'You cannot run away'
As Rebekah went to draw water from the well that day, she was completely innocent, having no idea of what was to happen to her
She did not realize that by giving a man a drink of water and by drawing water for his camels she would be caught
After the camels had finished drinking, the servant put a golden ring on Rebekah's nose and two bracelets upon her hands
In these verses, the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit will not speak of Himself, but that He will glorify the Son
Suppose Abraham's servant had said to Laban, 'It is difficult for Abraham to earn a living in Canaan, and his son Isaac is not healthy
Today we realize the riches of Christ, which He has received of the Father, through the gifts that the Spirit has dispensed to us
After the servant, typifying the Spirit, brought Rebekah the riches, she was convinced and was willing to marry Isaac
Although her relatives wanted her to linger, Rebekah, upon hearing the servant's testimony of Isaac, said, 'I will go'
Although it is a long journey, eventually He will bring us through and present us to Christ as His lovely bride
Sometimes he even lies to us through preachers who speak negative things and tell us that we cannot love the Lord Jesus
Often we have unconsciously done what the Holy Spirit expected, satisfying His desire, doing it without knowing what He expected
He appraises her nose, saying, 'Thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus,' and, 'The smell of thy nose like apples'
In Song of Songs 2:3, the seeker says, 'As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons
As the book of Hebrews says, we have tasted of the heavenly gift, the good word of God, and the works of power of the coming age
The two bracelets given to Rebekah were ten shekels in weight and thus could fulfill the requirements of God's commandments
The taste which we have received of the Holy Spirit is only partial, but the divine function which we have received of Him is complete
Rebekah also received articles of silver, articles of gold, and raiment , all of which indicate the riches of Christ
By all these details we can realize that the record in Genesis 24 is altogether divine and implies the divine concept
After receiving and enjoying all these riches, Rebekah followed the servant, traveling through the desert on a camel until she met Isaac
Rebekah traveled through the desert on top of a camel, and we are traveling through the desert on today's modern 'camels'
Forty years after Isaac's birth, Abraham married again , and when he became one hundred forty years of age, he still begat six sons
As we have seen, God's purpose is to work Himself into a corporate person that He might have a corporate expression
After the fourth fall, God came in to call Abraham out of the fallen race and establish him as the father of the called race
God's intention in making Abraham the father of the called race was to work Himself into that race for the fulfillment of His purpose
The record from the last half of chapter eleven through the first part of chapter twenty-five shows how much God worked with this person
When we come to the end of the record of Abraham's life, do we see a person who was matured in life and who expressed God in every way?
Chapter twenty-four is wonderful, but it is not wonderful with respect to Abraham's life but with respect to his activity
Abraham did a wonderful thing in choosing a proper wife for his son; yet, immediately after this, he remarried
One day, he called Isaac and Rebekah to him, laid his hands upon them, blessed them, and then went to be with the Lord'
Abraham's life may be divided into three sections: the section with Ishmael, the section with Isaac, and the section with the six sons
None of the other sons were reckoned as heirs , for they were all sons of the concubine and, like Ishmael, were rejected by God
He was called, had faith, and lived in fellowship with God, but, to use a New Testament term, he did not have sufficient transformation
As water flows through the wood, the element of wood is carried away and the elements of minerals are added in its place
If you read chapters twenty-three through twenty-five again, you will see that Abraham was not a fully transformed person
He was a man who lived in fellowship with God and who acted according to His leading, but he was not transformed in full
Rather, he remarried and exercised the flesh which had been dealt with by God to bring forth six more 'Ishmaels'
His two sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah , which he had obtained for Sarah in chapter twenty-three
According to the implication of the divine record, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not three separate individuals
Their God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, is not three gods but the one Triune God
When Abraham was in Chaldea worshipping idols, that was the time of God's calling, not the time of His selection
In other words, as far as the experience of life is concerned, by himself Abraham cannot stand as a complete person in the eyes of God
If we are not matured in life, although we may be quite active, doing many things, all our labor will be in vain
As the record at the end of Genesis reveals, Jacob, although he could not see well, blessed in a very clear way
Because Jacob was mature, he blessed everyone he met, including Pharaoh, who was an unbeliever, a Gentile king
Jacob could bless his sons in a way that was full of divine revelation because he was fully matured in the divine life
Whatever he spoke was the divine word, and whatever he blessed was a prophecy concerning God's economy with all His children
At the end of Genesis we see a man called Israel, a transformed person who is transparent, clear, and full of life
As we have been robbed with Abraham and have been enjoying with Isaac, one day we all shall be matured with Jacob
When you have matured, you will not complain; you will bless, saying, 'O God, bless all the brothers and all the churches'
The Triune God is working within us as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit to make us the full expression of Himself
He is the Triune God, and we must be a person of three aspects in the spiritual experiences of the divine life
As we read the record of his life in chapters twenty-one through twenty-eight, what do we see of the experience of life?
After Christ came, there is a full and thorough revelation of grace, and in the New Testament the word grace is used again and again
Although the record in Genesis concerning Isaac does not have the term grace, nevertheless such a thing is implied there
Although Isaac's experience is recorded in Genesis, it is difficult to designate the experience he had as the experience of grace
Abraham represents the aspect of being called, of living by faith in God, and of living in fellowship with God
Jacob represents the aspect of being chosen, being dealt with by the Lord, and being transformed into a prince of God
Most of us have heard messages saying that the Christian life should be a suffering life, a life of bearing the cross and groaning in prayer
Eliezer, in whom he trusted, was rejected, and Ishmael, the son he begat by his own endeavor with his concubine, was cast out
Before we can have the experience of Isaac, we need Abraham who represents the first aspect of the experience of life
Abraham's self and natural man were the strongest frustration to God's blessing and forced God to deal with him
Being called by God, living by faith in God, and living in fellowship with God are all for the enjoyment of God
We all have had at least some experience of being called by God, living by faith in God, living in fellowship with God, and suffering loss
Abraham acquired a great deal, having been blessed and having become enlarged, but he gave all that he had to Isaac
As Abraham, we have been called by God, have learned to live by faith in God, and have learned to live in fellowship with God
Because of the lack of revelation, Christians have misunderstood and misinterpreted grace, thinking of it as something outside of them
If we love others in ourselves, God will never recognize that love, because it does not come from His visitation
As we have seen, God's intention is to work Himself into a corporate man that He might have a corporate expression
God's purpose is to work Himself into us to be our life and even to be our living, but our natural self frustrates this
His intention is to deal with our natural being that we may have the full experience of Himself in Christ wrought into us as our enjoyment
God the Spirit is the Spirit of grace and this grace is the grace of life which is the varied grace the all grace and the sufficient grace
It is the Spirit of grace indwelling our spirit to be our enjoyment that we may enjoy God as our life and our everything, even as our living
Whatever we call it, the Spirit of grace or the grace of life, it is something living and divine in our spirit
In the Old Testament, God gave many things to His people as blessings, but all those things were merely outward blessings
Christ came not only to die on the cross for us, but, after His death, to become the life-giving Spirit to enter into our being
To grow in grace is to grow in the enjoyment of all that Christ is to us as our spiritual food and living water
He was not required to do anything that he might inherit the father's riches and he did not do anything for the inheritance
In Christ He has put us into grace that we might become the heirs of grace inheriting all the riches of the divine fullness as our enjoyment
Our Christian life must be like Isaac's, doing nothing by himself, but inheriting and enjoying all that the father has
In this kingdom God can be fully expressed in the seed, into which He will work Himself and which will be transformed into His image
Through our enjoyment of grace the kingdom of God will be realized and God in Christ will be fully expressed for eternity
We thank the Lord that in the Old Testament He has given us a wonderful and clear picture of the experience of life
If we did not have this clear view, we would only consider Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as three separate individuals
The first item in our experience of God is His selection, His choice, which was made before the foundation of the world
In a sense, we are all Abrahams, for we have been called and have learned to live by faith in God and in fellowship with Him
We have not only been called and have learned to live by faith in God and in fellowship with Him, but we are daily enjoying something of God
Praise the Lord that we not only have the aspect of Abraham but also the aspect of Isaac, which is the aspect of grace
From the moment we called on the name of the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Savior, we began to have these two aspects in our experience
When he was old, he still had the taste for 'savoury meat' and asked Esau to go out to the field and prepare him the meat which he loved
When Rebekah heard this, she called Jacob to fetch her two kids of the goats that she might prepare the meat for Isaac
If he had stayed in Lahai-roi, not returning to Beer-sheba or Hebron, he would have missed that meeting with Rebekah
His son Isaac also had trouble when he went to Philistia, for he had contention and enmity with the Philistines
Even when Isaac went downward to Lahai-roi, he still enjoyed a well, the well of the living One who sees us and reveals Himself to us
Lahai-roi was a place where one who had left the standing of grace could still have some enjoyment of God's visitation
In the past we might have questioned whether our standing was right, feeling that we were somewhat removed from the standing of grace
Although the enjoyment is our destiny, we may have it on an improper ground, at Beer-lahai-roi, not at Beer-sheba
In the past, many of us held the religious concept that if we are wrong, God will give us up and we shall not have any more enjoyment
You may have a well for your enjoyment, but you will miss the Lord's appearing and be unable to fulfill God's eternal purpose
If we do, we shall experience the Lord's appearing and have the ground to inherit the promises to fulfill God's eternal purpose
Although we may have wells, even 'a well of living water' , in other places, those wells cannot enable us to fulfill God's eternal purpose
Isaac had been going down, but God used the circumstances to force him to come up from Beer-lahai-roi to Beer-sheba
Some Christian teachers have encouraged the believers to follow the example of Isaac and not to strive with others
According to this teaching, when we dig a well and others take it, we should simply tolerate it and give it to them
If we go to another place and dig another well and others take it over, we should not fight for it but go to still another place
At Beer-sheba, after the Lord's appearing, Isaac built an altar, called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent
Only in the unique place, in Beer-sheba, could he inherit the promise and have a life of testimony for the fulfillment of God's purpose
The enjoyment which we may have everywhere because it is our destiny is not a confirmation or a justification of our standing
In many places we have had the enjoyment, but when we were there, we had the deep sense that we did not have the Lord's appearing
In those places we did not have an altar or a tent, and we did not call upon the Lord's name from deep within our spirit
Did God not say in His promise that Isaac, the only seed of Abraham, would be the one in whom all the nations of the earth would be blessed?
Eventually, Isaac had a son, Jacob, who not only fulfilled Isaac's need but also fulfilled God's eternal purpose
All these eternal things came about through the meeting of Isaac's need, a need which corresponded with God's need
In the enjoyment of God's grace, we must render Him our human coordination that He may fulfill His eternal purpose through us
He will use our circumstances to bring us back to the proper standing that the fulfillment of His purpose might be realized
After receiving the hundredfold harvest, he found the 'well of living water' and came into the 'broad places,' the 'broad ways'
Now we must see that with this grace-enjoying person there were still the natural weakness and the natural life
According to our natural, religious concept, we always think that if we are natural, we cannot have the enjoyment of grace
Probably none of us has ever thought that participating in the grace of God does not depend upon our being spiritual
Isaac also loved Esau partially, loving him because he was a skillful hunter and could obtain the venison which Isaac loved
Jacob learned how to supplant from his supplanting mother, and his supplanting mother was the supplanting completion to his father Isaac
According to our natural concept, a person who has a natural weakness and who lives in the natural life can never enjoy the grace of God
Do not think that if you are spiritual you are privileged to enjoy Gods grace and that if you are not spiritual you cannot enjoy His grace
If we are spiritual, we shall not enjoy grace more, and if we are unspiritual we shall not miss the grace of God
Do you believe that a man who had such an enjoyment of God's grace could still have the natural weakness of lying in a substantial way?
When Isaac plainly told Esau that if he would prepare venison for him he would bless him, he was not conscious of being religious
Before Isaac was exposed in chapter twenty-six, he probably never realized that his natural weakness was the same as Abraham's
You yourself may not know your own natural weakness, but it is clear to everyone else because it has been exposed to them
Peter, John, and Paul all had their weaknesses, but their weak points did not frustrate them from enjoying God's grace
Isaac's intention might have been to go down into Egypt, but God commanded him to dwell in the land of which He would tell him
My burden in this message is to tell you that the enjoyment of God's grace does not depend upon our being religious
Isaac's love for his firstborn son was altogether in the natural life according to his natural taste, as was Jacob's love for Joseph
Esau, a 'skillful hunter' , was a father's boy, and Jacob, a 'quiet man' who dwelt in tents , was a mother's boy
When Isaac felt him, this caused him to say, 'The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau'
In a sense, the mother cheated the father, meaning that the second part of a person cheated the first part of the same person
It is difficult to believe that a person like Isaac could still have such a natural weakness and still live in such a natural life
Both Isaac and Rebekah suffered because they lived in a natural way, for Esau's wives were 'a bitterness of spirit' to them
When Rebekah heard of this, she told Jacob to flee to her brother Laban and to stay with him until Esau's anger had turned away
He blessed blindly, not only physically but also spiritually, because he had been blinded by his natural taste
Whenever you want to exercise faith, you should not look at yourself, at what you are, nor at your environment
He did not consider what he was; he looked away to God and to God's promise, blessing his son by faith and in the spirit
Before he died, he must have charged his sons to bury him in the cave of Machpelah, where Abraham and Sarah were buried
