<p>Each of these groups should focus on gaining knowledge of the truth and growing in life. I hope that the church will have these kinds of meetings twice a week, one on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning and the other during the week. The Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting should focus on life, whereas the meeting during the week should focus on truth.</p>
<p>In regard to life, we should lead the saints to know how God&rsquo;s life, which is in the Son, becomes our life practically when the Holy Spirit indwells us. We need to help the saints to know how the Triune God becomes our life, and we should help them learn to live in the fellowship of this life and according to the sense and light of this life. We must begin with these points in order to lead the saints to grow in life.</p>
<p>In regard to truth, we should lead the saints to know four main items: Christ, redemption, life, and the church. Concerning Christ, we must help the saints to see who Christ is according to the Bible. We can begin with Christ being the eternal God; that is, we should speak on God&rsquo;s divine, eternal nature. But we must go on to speak of His incarnation, human living, death on the cross, resurrection from the dead as the life-giving Spirit, ascension into heaven, descension as the Spirit of reality, and status in eternity future. The saints have only a fragmentary understanding of these matters; they have not received a fundamental and systematic teaching related to them.</p>
<p>Modern education involves a system. Mathematics instructors follow a progressive curriculum that begins in elementary school and finishes in graduate school. When a person receives instruction through such a system, he is able to learn the full content of the mathematical discipline in an orderly way. Without systematic instruction, however, a person can study for twenty years yet learn very little. Our situation speaks of this kind of failure. We have given many messages for twelve years, but many of the saints do not know the truth concerning Christ, because our leading has not been systematic. In order to help the saints to go forward, we must systematically lead the saints, step by step, to know the truth concerning Christ, redemption, life, and the church.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, these four main points are the center of the Bible. The Bible speaks of how Christ came to accomplish redemption so that we can receive God as life and be built up together in life to produce the church. These four points are connected. The Bible is centered on these four points. All the other points are supplementary. If we can provide the saints with a thorough understanding of these four points, it will be easy for them to understand other points.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preparing Practically and Exercising</h2>
<p>We should use the same subjects in both &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; using less material with the newer saints and more material with those at a more advanced level. This can be compared to teaching first graders to add single digits, but teaching second graders to add double digits. Thus, the saints who are more advanced can be given eight or ten verses on the matter of consecration, but newer ones should be given a general sketch of consecration based on only three or four verses. Hence, although the subject can be the same, the instruction, leading, and material should be different.</p>
<p>Presently, we may not be able to do this. However, we should at least have some feeling related to this need. We must lead the saints to exercise so that they can carry out their priestly service before God, learning not only how to pray to God individually but also how to carry out the priestly service corporately with all the saints. Hence, we will begin to change the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting. Before we begin, however, we need to have adequate preparation. This is a huge task, and the elders and responsible ones should join together to do it.</p>
<p>In addition, we should lead the saints to pray, not merely individually but with all the saints as priests ministering and serving together in prayer. In the meetings we can lead the saints to exercise to sing, to burn the incense, and to light the lamps. To sing is to exercise to sing hymns. To burn incense is to exercise to pray. When we come together, we should pray; we should open our mouths and exercise to have strong spirits. To light the lamps is to exercise to receive light from the Lord&rsquo;s Word. For example, we can pray-read 1 Peter 2:5 and the related verses in Zechariah 6. We should abandon the practice of one person giving a message. Instead, we should fellowship with one another and bring out what we have gained from the Lord. Some saints may help and perfect others, while other saints may receive the help and the perfecting. Those who receive the help and the perfecting can then render help to others. In this way, all the saints will serve in the meeting, and the function of the saints will be manifested in the meeting.</p>
<p>This is only a general outline; we still need to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading step by step regarding the details. The purpose of this change is not to establish some new rules but to deliver us from meetings that hinder the leading of the Holy Spirit. We should not be like Christianity, which neglects the remembrance of the Lord and the worship of the Father in the bread-breaking meeting and which relies on an outward Sunday worship service. We must exercise to be in spirit in the bread-breaking meeting in order to have real remembrance of the Lord and genuine worship of God.</p>
<p>I also hope that we can have a mutual fellowship in spirit when we come together for prayer, learning to use our spirit to pray freely before the Lord and to have more blending in spirit through prayer. This will allow the Holy Spirit to lead and operate more freely among us. I hope that we will pray before the Lord concerning this matter. We are doing this so that all the saints may exercise to walk, step by step, according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> </body></html>
