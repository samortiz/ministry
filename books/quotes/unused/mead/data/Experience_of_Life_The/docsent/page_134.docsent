   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN KNOWING THE ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We now come to see the sixteenth experience of life, which is knowing the ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although this lesson is rather profound, yet it is not difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We will speak of this in several main points.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. THE NEED OF KNOWING THE REDEMPTION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to know ascension, we need firstly to know the redemption of Christ, because ascension is included in it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Concerning Christ's redemption, many comprehend only Christ's crucifixion, His dying for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some see something deeper; they realize that Christ's redemption includes also the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if we read the Scriptures again carefully and examine our experiences, we will discover that His redemption includes ascension also.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ's redemption consists of three main parts: death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If any part is missing, the redemption of Christ cannot be regarded as complete.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In these three main parts of Christ's redemption, Christ's death emphasizes deliverance from the negative aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That is, it saves us from sins, the world, the flesh, that which is natural, and all those things which are incompatible with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ's resurrection emphasizes the entrance into the positive aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That is, it brings us into all the riches of the new creation, which God has in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And Christ's ascension is the glorious conclusion of His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ's death and resurrection are not the conclusion of His redemption; His ascension is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot say that Christ rested when He was raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ did not rest in death nor in resurrection; He rested in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Scripture does not say that the Lord sits in resurrection, but that He sits in the heavens Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sitting signifies that the work has already been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the redemptive work of the Lord was not considered accomplished until He ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can say that death and resurrection are only progressive stages of the Lord's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ascension is the final stage of the Lord's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord's death and resurrection are the path which leads to His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus ascension is the conclusion of His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since the Lord's ascension is the conclusion of His death and resurrection, all three steps are closely connected.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord came forth from death and entered into resurrection, He had already reached the heavenly realm.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Immediately following death and resurrection is ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Christianity, there is an inaccurate understanding that Christ ascended forty days after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, in the resurrection morning the Lord ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In that morning, the Lord appeared to Mary Magdalene and said to her, "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And He continued, saying, "I ascend unto my Father" John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the evening of the same day, the Lord again appeared to the disciples and said, "Handle me, and see" Luke 24:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By this time the Lord could let men touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This reveals that before this time He had already ascended to the heavens and offered to God the freshness of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, before His ascension in the sight of His disciples forty days later, He could say, "All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and earth."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This authority was obtained from God when He ascended to the heavens on the resurrection morning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus we see that Christ's death and resurrection are connected with His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Finishing of school cannot be separated from graduation; when one finishes his study, he graduates.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Likewise, when the Lord was risen from the dead, He ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Christ's ascension, He brought all that He had accomplished through His death and resurrection to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He brought the fruit of all His redeeming work into the heavenly realm.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, the Lord today, in the position of His ascension, applies the efficacy of His redemption to man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Certainly, the Lord's forgiveness of our sins is based on His blood shed on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if He had not ascended to the heavens, He would not have been able to apply His death or His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has achieved redemption on the cross, but it is in His ascension that He applies His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the position of ascension, He gives man salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To speak accurately, all the redemptive grace experienced by the church, from forgiveness of sins to experiencing the ascension and obtaining various gifts, is being applied in a practical way by the Lord in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the ascension in Christ's redemption occupies a very important place.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All that Christ has accomplished through His death and resurrection is brought into the ascension for application.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without ascension, nothing in Christ's salvation can be applied to us in a practical way.</S>
