<p>We do not need to wait until the end of Revelation to see the incorporated God. We can see the incorporated God as the Body of Christ in the Epistles. The Body is an incorporated entity. First Corinthians 12:12-13 says, &ldquo;Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ. For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body...and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; Some believers teach only that Christ is the Baptizer (Matt. 3:11), but Galatians 3 reveals that Christ is both the Baptizer and the One into whom we are baptized. &ldquo;As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ...You are all one in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (vv. 27-28). According to the pure Word, our baptism has been accomplished and is completed. We have all been baptized into Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit, and have also been positioned to drink one Spirit. What we need to seek today is not to be baptized but to drink of what we have already received&mdash;the one Spirit.</p>
<p>Drinking of the one Spirit requires us to be properly positioned. To be positioned to drink of the Spirit, we need to remain in the Body of Christ. Our experience confirms this principle. The flow of the Spirit is in the Body. The picture of the New Jerusalem also indicates that we must be properly positioned in order to drink of the Spirit, for the flowing of the river of water of life is located in the city. In eternity whoever is outside of the New Jerusalem will not drink the river of water of life or eat the tree of life. To stay away from the New Jerusalem means to stay away from all that God is. God can be nothing to us if we are outside of the New Jerusalem, but God will be everything to us if we are in the New Jerusalem. The principle is the same in the church life today, where we have a foretaste of the New Jerusalem. In the church life we enjoy the watering, enlightening, refreshing, nourishing, and comforting life supply of the water of life and the tree of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PARTICIPATING IN THE INCORPORATED GOD<br />
IN THE CHURCH LIFE TODAY AND<br />
IN THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>We participate in God not as the &ldquo;bachelor&rdquo; God nor as only the incarnated God, the redeeming God, and the indwelling God but as the incorporated God. Of course, the incorporated God is also the incarnated God, the redeeming God, and the indwelling God, and in Himself He will also always be the unique God with the Godhead. How wonderful it is that in the Body, which we experience in the church life today, we enjoy God in all these stages! We love the church life because here we enjoy the incorporated God, who includes the God of creation, the incarnated God, the redeeming God, and the indwelling God. In the church life, the practical expression of the Body of Christ, we are positioned to enjoy the incorporated God.</p>
<p>On one hand, God will always be omnipresent. On the other hand, the vision presented in Revelation shows that for eternity God will be located in the New Jerusalem. God the Father will be in the New Jerusalem in God the Son, and God the Son will be flowing there as God the Spirit in the river of water of life, carrying Christ as the life supply of the tree of life through all the parts of the city. This picture should become a governing vision to us, the governing principle of our walk today, reminding us that we should not be individual Christians but incorporated believers.</p>
<p>There is no need for us to wait for the New Jerusalem to be completed. Today we have a foretaste in the church life as a miniature of the New Jerusalem. Today in the church life we are incorporated with one another, and together we are incorporated with God.</p>
<p>In the church life we enjoy God as He is revealed in every stage. Our God was and still is the God of creation, the incarnated God, the redeeming God, and the indwelling God. He is ultimately and consummately the incorporated God, and we are in His incorporation, which is the church life today as the foretaste of the New Jerusalem. Here in the incorporated God we enjoy the all-inclusive God in every stage. In the church life we sense the flow of the river of water of life and we experience the foretaste of the New Jerusalem, the ultimate incorporation of God and man.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision and Experience of the Corporate Christ &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
