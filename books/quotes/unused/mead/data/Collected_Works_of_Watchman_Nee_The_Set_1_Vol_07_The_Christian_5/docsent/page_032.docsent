   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO WITNESSES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: Are the two men in Revelation 11 two of the three from among Elijah, Enoch, and Moses?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If so, will they be changed the same way as that which is described in 1 Corinthians 15?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lee, Kiangsu</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Answer: Maybe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is no clear Scripture telling us that Enoch was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Elijah was taken up to heaven with his garment see 2 Kings 2:13 ; it seems that he did not change either.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Lord resurrected, did He not leave the linen in the tomb John 20 ?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the mount of transfiguration, they did not shine as the Lord did.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE BODY OF MOSES</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Question: Will Moses have a body of resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lee, Kiangsu</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Answer: No. He only has a "soulish body." In Luke 16 we see that after the body dies, one still has eyes v. 23 and a tongue v. 24 . These are parts of the "soulish body." The two preachers in Revelation 11 are two of the three.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to my knowledge, when the Lord was on earth, He raised up three persons from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not these three die again later?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps between resurrection and a changed body, there will still be a temporary separation death .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, after 1 Corinthians 15:52, they will surely be in incorruption and immortality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But there are differences as to the other experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although Enoch and Elijah were taken up, they did not reach heaven John 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is possible that their body was not totally a body of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It may be that they only possessed the kind of body like the three who were resurrected by the Lord had.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1 SAMUEL 20:25 AND 34</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Question: Is there a difference in time between 1 Samuel 20:25 and 34?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lee, Kiangsu</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Answer: There is no difference in time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both are in the past tense.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps on the first day Jonathan stood, while on the second day, he sat at the table and hence "arose."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>JUDGES 14:15 AND 17</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Question: How do you reconcile Judges 14:15 with verse 17?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Answer: Judges 14:15 should be "it came to pass on the fourth day."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The internal proof is as follows: verse 14 says, "they could not in three days expound the riddle."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, this must be the fourth day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Otherwise, verse 14 should say, "they could not in six days expound the riddle."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The external proof is that both the Septuagint and the Syriac versions say "the fourth day."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is an error in the manuscript and does not affect the divine inspiration in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE VIRGIN IN ISAIAH 7:14</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Question: Some have said that "the virgin" in Isaiah 7:14 can be translated woman.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Is this true?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Lee, Kiangsu</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Answer: Virgin in Hebrew is ha-almah.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the New Testament, the Greek word is parthenos.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Isaiah was written in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The root of this word came from alam, which means hidden, enclosed in the inner chamber; therefore, it means a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This word is used in the Old Testament seven times Gen 24:43; Exo 2:8; Psa 68:25; Prov 30:19; S.S. 1:3; 6:8; Isa 7:14 . Although there is another word more specific than this one, betulah, that word can mean either a young girl or a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The above is quoted from Wordsworth's Companion Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Hebrew the word ha refers to something unique and is a definite article.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, Isaiah 7:14 clearly says that it is a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although the Jews consider Matthew wrong in translating Isaiah 7:14 to be parthenos, yet the Septuagint was translated by the Jews themselves, and the Greek Old Testament also translated this word as parthenos.</S>
