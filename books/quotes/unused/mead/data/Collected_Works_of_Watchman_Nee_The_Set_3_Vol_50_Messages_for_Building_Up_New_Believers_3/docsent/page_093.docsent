   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Expecting the Seed to Grow as an Herb</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to God's intention, this seed "is smaller than all the seeds" v. 32 . The mustard seed is very small; it is smaller than all the seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When God sowed His word into the world, His intention was for such a mustard seed to remain an herb when it grew up.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's ordained law from the beginning of His creation is for the mustard seed to grow according to its kind into an herb.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everything must grow after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is right for the tiny mustard seed to grow into a mustard herb.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is God's original intention.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God sent His own Son into the world to sow His word into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The result is the church which grows out of this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God expects the church on earth to be full of life, to bring forth fruit, and to be good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It must remain an herb, something temporal, small, unnoticed, and not big enough to shelter others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's intention is to sow, grow, and reap again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is like a wheat crop, which is sown and harvested over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once the seed grows into a herb, it is taken away, and the ground is cleared for the next sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ground must be cleared for others to come in to believe, to be begotten, to grow, and to be reaped.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Others have to believe, grow, and be harvested by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, the church is always continuing on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the other hand, God's intention is to reap men group by group unto Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church can be food to men, and it can feed men, but it must be reaped bundle by bundle, again and again, like crops of herbs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Herbs are not meant for display; they are not supposed to be great.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are meant to be food for man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After man sinned in Genesis, God first gave him herbs for food.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God gave herbs to man for food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The herb is not a flower, which is good for show, and it is not a tree, which is great in size.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As an herb, it should remain weak, powerless, and fragile in the eyes of man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Growing into a Tree</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, the Lord prophesied that something unexpected would happen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Lord planted the mustard seed in the field, it was the smallest of all the seeds, "but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree" v. 32 . The Lord had no intention that the church would become a tree and be rooted deeply in the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now it is no longer growing and being reaped in bundles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead, it has become something lasting and remaining, something tall, big, and wide.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It draws attention, respect, and visibility, and has become a shelter to others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>B. The Beginning of Roman Catholicism</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The God-ordained way for the church is one that is according to the footsteps of Jesus of Nazareth, the One who was hidden, lonely, and humble.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church should follow the footsteps of our Lord who walked on this earth in lowliness and humility.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the beginning of its earthly history, the church was persecuted and suffered much opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But one day it became rooted in the earth and began to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Roman Caesars who ruled over the world, who controlled the destiny of the nations, suddenly became the church's partners and brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christianity became a religion of kings, rulers, and commanders.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The herb became a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It achieved a certain status in the eyes of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It became big.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was the beginning of Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A Unified Church</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church in the New Testament is local in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is scattered in every locality and is not united or organized in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although there were centers for the work, the churches were never united into unified organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But with the passing of the apostles, the churches began gradually to unify themselves on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Churches in big cities organized the churches in the smaller cities around them, and spontaneously the churches in the bigger cities took over the leadership.</S>
