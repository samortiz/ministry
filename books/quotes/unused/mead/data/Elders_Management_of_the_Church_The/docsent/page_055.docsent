   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. WITH DISCERNMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>An elder must also have the power of discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He cannot deal with matters and make judgments and decisions foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has to learn to be an authority with discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We will speak about this point specifically in the next chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here we will just mention this in passing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>IN COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>An elder must also serve as the authority in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever he is isolated, he is no longer the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Concerning the coordination of the elders, we will also have a special section to cover this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The eldership is a corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It can be compared to the government in a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No one there can be isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>ON BEING THE AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>AND ON EXERCISING AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>An elder must be the authority, but he must never exercise authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever you exercise your authority as an elder, you are already disqualified from being an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let me again relate the story of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moses was indeed the authority among God's people, yet he never exercised authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every time that problems, difficulties, or business affairs arose, he had only one place to go, which was to bow before God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No one ever heard him say that he was God's established authority, or that he was going to deal with matters or take care of affairs with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He never said anything like this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But yet all the while, he was being the authority there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was acting as an authority in love, in patience, and with discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His being the authority in this way was his exercising of his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the same way, you and I must learn to be the authority in love, in spirit, in resurrection, in patience, in discernment, and in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the same time, we must not exercise our authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Always bear in mind that we should never exercise our authority as an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Never say, "I am an elder, and I sit in the seat of an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am doing such-and-such a thing in the position of an elder."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May the title of an elder and the position of an elder be reduced to zero among us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Among us we should only have the person, the ministry, the responsibility, and the burden of an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For the elders, to be an authority is to exercise authority.</S>
