The Bible, the greatest book on earth, is the most complete book, revealing many things concerning God, the universe, and man
There is one thing in the Bible called a mystery, which is something that is hidden and difficult to comprehend
Many great teachers have read and thought that they understood the Bible, yet they never saw the mystery in the Bible
Before Paul's writing, much of the Bible already existed, but without Paul's writing, the word of God would not be complete
Many Bible translations, including the King James Version, do not adequately translate to complete the word of God in verse 25
According to the Greek grammar, the word of God at the end of verse 25 is the mystery at the beginning of verse 26
The completion of God's word in Paul's fourteen Epistles reveals the mystery, that which is hidden and beyond understanding
It is not something that we can substantiate by our physical senses or mental comprehension, yet we believe it
For nearly two thousand years countless Christians have read the Bible but have not seen the mystery revealed in Colossians 1:26-27
Like a person's heart, the mystery in the Bible, which is Christ in us, is real and living but difficult to perceive
Romans 8:34 says that Christ is at the right hand of God, but verse 10 of the same chapter says that Christ is in us
Unbelievers cannot understand why we believers love one another even though we are of different ages and nationalities
The mystery in the Bible is Christ in us, the mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church
The One who died on the cross was God, the eternal Word who became a man and as the Lamb of God took away our sin
To enter into His believers as life, He had to go through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit
Christ is both in the heavens and in us, just as electricity is both in a distant power plant and simultaneously in many buildings
Christ is within us as our life, life-supply, power, strength, wisdom, patience, kindness, love, and everything
The dispensing of food implies not only that food enters into a person but also that the food is digested and assimilated by the person
In 2 Corinthians 1314 Paul says The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all
The love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit are not three separate matters but three aspects of one thing
Because Christ embodies the entire Triune God , when Christ is in us, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in us
He may begin to speak something in anger but then suddenly will become silent, go to his bedroom, and begin to pray
As she considers what to buy, a speaking within may tell her not to purchase certain items; it may even prompt her to leave the store
Some become worldly or even fall into sin, but most Christians live uprightly, according to religion, ethics, and morality
A glove may be washed, clean, and beautiful, but it will not fulfill its purpose unless it is filled with a hand
At the end of each day we may repent if we have lost our temper or done something sinful, but we need to repent for not living Christ
When Paul said in Galatians 2:20 that he had been crucified, he meant that his religious, ethical, habitual person had been terminated
Christ should be our life and our living; He should be our kindness, our gentleness, and everything that we express
Through Christ's redemption we can receive God into us, be filled with God, and even be saturated with God in our entire being
In 1 Corinthians 2:11-12 Paul says, 'Who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him?
We cannot know these things by exercising our mind, because the things of man can be known only by man's spirit
Atheists say that there is no God, but when they are alone, something deep within them causes them to wonder, 'What if God does exist'?
Scholars may have strong minds, but they do not know God, the two spirits, or the things of man if they do not use their spirit
The Spirit of God existed already, but the ingredients of Christ's processes and accomplishments had not yet been added
When we drink the Spirit, we receive Christ's divinity, humanity, human living, all-inclusive death, and resurrection power
When we realize that we are doing or speaking something that is not according to the Lord, we should stop and repent
The more we practice walking according to the mingled spirit, the more we will pray, sing, pray-read, and fellowship with the Lord
In the proper church life every meeting is a feast-'dish' after 'dish' of Christ is brought forth and enjoyed by the saints
Genesis 2:9 says, 'Out of the ground Jehovah God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food'
God commanded His people in the Old Testament to keep the feasts by coming together not to labor but to eat and rest
If we eat the Lord only in the meetings and not privately in our daily life as well, there will not be much to eat in the meetings
We can eat privately by praying, reading the Word, pray-reading, calling on the Lord's name, and remaining in His presence
The call is in verse 17, which says, 'Let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely'
If we learn to eat and drink, we will be kept in God's central line, fulfill His purpose, and reach His goal by being filled with Christ
Our heart is not merely something in our environment or even something very close to us but the center and content of our being
Christ making His home in our heart is not an outward or superficial matter but is something deep in our being
People may wonder what the source of strength and power is that enables Christians to endure sufferings or to love when others cannot love
As human beings, we have many defects and imperfections, but Christ, who is also a man, does not have any defects
To experience the riches of Christ means that something of Christ, some element of His riches, has been dispensed into us
Naturally speaking, Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans cannot love one another, just as the Germans, French, and British cannot love one another
Even if we cannot understand one another's language, we love one another because we experience the dispensing of the mystery
Christ is in our spirit but we often miss Him because we remain in other areas of our being where Christ has not yet spread such as our mind
When we are strengthened into the inner man, Christ spreads in us and dispenses more of Himself into our being
When Christ makes His home in our heart, we will overcome all our troubles, enjoy Him, and experience Him in countless ways
The Christian life is a daily life of allowing Christ to make His home in our heart, a life of Christ adding Himself into our daily life
Christ's dimensions are the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe, which are immeasurable and unlimited
When we experience Christ to the extent that we discover His unlimitedness, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God
The church is a group of people who are filled with Christ until they become the fullness of God, God's expression and His flowing out
In the previous chapters we have seen that Christ is the mystery of God and that the church is the mystery of Christ
Our mind cannot grasp how one person could have two lives and two natures, how Christ could be God and man at the same time
The mystery mentioned in Ephesians 3 includes the unsearchable riches of Christ, which are being dispensed into us
In every situation and at every moment, while we are eating, washing, and talking to others, Christ is dispensed into us
The church, which comes out of this dispensing, is not material or physical but altogether spiritual and mysterious
The church comes out of the mystery, the unsearchable riches of Christ, the economy of the mystery, and Christ making His home in our hearts
When the church experiences the immeasurable dimensions of Christ, it becomes the fullness, the expression, of God
The Lord and the Father are also grouped with matters related to the believers to show the Triune God mingled with our being
Chapter 4 goes on to reveal something further-that the Triune God mingles Himself with us to cause us to become the Body
In our thinking, our loving and hating, our likes and dislikes, and all our decisions, we may grow up into Christ
It is difficult for anyone to leave the real church, because we are not stones placed upon one another but living members growing together
All the gifts to the Body-the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers-do one work, that is, to feed the believers
For this reason, we need to call on the name of the Lord, read the Bible, and pray with the words of the Bible
To read the Bible with prayer is to eat, to pray with the words of the Bible is to drink, and to call on the name of the Lord is to breathe
The washing of the blood of Christ deals with our sins , but the washing of the water in the word deals with our spots and wrinkles
Spots are defects that come from wounds or from the natural life we received by birth; wrinkles come from oldness
In Matthew 4:4 the Lord said, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
To read the Bible once a day is good, but it is best to practice to eat the Bible several times a day-morning, noon, afternoon, and evening
If we read the Bible only with our eyes and our mind, we are using only our body and our soul, and we will receive only knowledge
The more that we eat and the better the food is that we eat, the more we will experience this inward, metabolic washing of life
We must eat the word daily by exercising our spirit and pray-reading in order to experience these four crucial matters
Owning a Bible but not reading or praying over it may be compared to buying much food but not cooking or eating it
In the nourishing word there is washing water, which carries away all the negative things from our inner being
If we eat and drink the word by exercising our spirit to pray-read the word, we will receive spiritual nourishment and washing
Ephesians 5:29 says, 'No one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church'
When a nursing mother feeds her child, the child receives the nourishment and at the same time enjoys tender care
When a baby is lying in his mother's bosom, he receives protection, rest, warmth, and comfort; all fear and cares are gone
For a small child, to be in the mother's bosom is the best thing, for there he enjoys nourishing and cherishing
The way to have Christ make His home in our hearts experience the Triune God grow and be renewed and cleansed is to receive the word of God
The last section of Ephesians 6, beginning with verse 10, reveals the last secret for us to have the proper church life
We receive the word, which is the Spirit, not by means of reading or understanding but by means of all prayer and petition
He found that the best means to receive the word of God was not merely by reading and understanding but by praying
The result of our receiving the word of God by prayer is that we are inwardly cleared up and filled with the Lord
Verse 18 concludes, 'Praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints'
We may already pray concerning the saints, but we need to learn how to pray concerning the saints in the proper way
In verse 33 the Lord went on to tell us, 'But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you'
Romans 14:17 says, 'The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
We need to pray not for outward necessities, such as eating and drinking, but for righteousness-a proper daily life for the church life
Lord, cause every saint to realize the mingling of the Triune God with the church, and allow each one to see that the Spirit is in the Body
Lord, help every saint to see that they have an organic union with You and that the Triune God is truly one with the church'
We also need to pray for the apostles that they may have the utterance, the expression, to speak the mystery of the gospel
The church has been on this earth for nearly two thousand years, but the situation among Christians today cannot satisfy God's heart
