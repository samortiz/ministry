        <h2 class="head1">PRAYER FOR INQUIRING</h2>
<p>The above points are concerning prayer to fellowship with God. This is the foundation of prayer. After a good foundation has been laid, we can enter into the second aspect of prayer&mdash;prayer for inquiring. This aspect of prayer includes inquiring concerning the Lord&rsquo;s work and concerning our personal needs. We will speak concerning inquiring for the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Initiated by God</h2>
<p>The foundation of our prayer is to enter into fellowship with God, that is, to enter into God. Then our prayer is initiated by God, not by us. He gives us the burdens to pray. It is not that we ask God to accomplish something; rather, it is God asking us to petition on His behalf concerning the matter. Matthew 6 shows that genuine prayer is to pray on behalf of God. During the first segment of our prayer, we enter into the presence of God and fellowship with Him. At this time God will anoint us with His burden for the work and reveal His intention to us. We can then petition according to God&rsquo;s will and His burden for the work. These matters are not concerning ourselves but concerning God. Therefore, we are praying on behalf of God, not on behalf of ourselves. This aspect of prayer is initiated by God; it is not initiated by us. Genuine prayer is not for ourselves. Genuine prayer is for God and is initiated by God. When the Lord taught the disciples how to pray, He said, &ldquo;You then pray in this way&rdquo; (v. 9). This is the Lord&rsquo;s initiating and proposing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">More Inquiring Than Petitioning</h2>
<p>The second aspect of prayer should have more inquiring than petitioning. For example, while fellowshipping with the Lord, a responsible brother might sense a concern for the young brothers and sisters. He should then inquire of the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, is this burden from You? What do You want me to do? How do I help them? What is Your purpose with the young brothers and sisters?&rdquo; This is to inquire. We should not begin to petition without first fellowshipping with the Lord. To petition at the beginning of our prayer is to let God know what we want without knowing what He wants. Good prayers are inquiring prayers. When we pray by inquiring, we do not make our desire known to God; instead, God&rsquo;s desire is made known to us. When the responsible brother senses God&rsquo;s purpose concerning the young saints, he should inquire further, &ldquo;Lord, do You want me to fellowship with them?&rdquo; This is the anointing within him. It seems as if it is the brother who is inquiring, but it is God who is working in him. While the brother is inquiring, on the one hand, he will sense a heavy burden within, but on the other hand, he will be filled with life, freedom, and peace. He can also inquire whether he should go by himself or with another brother. Good prayers are inquiring prayers because they honor God.</p>
<p>David knew how to pray. He often inquired of Jehovah (1 Sam. 30:8; 2 Sam. 5:19, 23; Psa. 27:4). The best prayer is to inquire of the Lord step by step, according to the sense within. By inquiring in this way, we can easily receive God&rsquo;s leading, and we can work according to the leading. If we are led to visit a brother, he will surely touch God because God will be expressed through us. Then our going to contact the brother will be God&rsquo;s going to contact him. This kind of work does not have human preference, intention, maneuvering, or capability. Rather, it is full of God mingling with man. Furthermore, our words to the brother will be the issue of fellowship. Before we utter anything, we will first inquire of God; hence, every word will come from our spirit. As a result, every word will touch the spirit of the brother and supply him with God. This is the genuine work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Inquiring before Giving a Message</h2>
<p>The same principle applies to giving a message. Before giving a message, a brother should first enter into fellowship with God and inquire of Him, allowing the Spirit to anoint him and operate within him. Then he should inquire of the Lord, according to the inner sense. As he continues to inquire, his burden will become heavier and his sense will be clearer. Finally, he will be able to say, &ldquo;Lord, if this is what You want me to say, accomplish it according to Your will.&rdquo; This is the best prayer for the Lord&rsquo;s work. The more thorough and detailed the inquiring, the better. A good message comes from inquiring of the Lord. The brother can pray concerning what he has prepared to speak. If he lacks the sense of life and peace, he should wait for a fresh anointing. Genuine prayer is to utter God&rsquo;s desire. Nothing can be more practical than this.</p>
<p>Our work and service should be the issue of inquiring prayer. The extent to which we inquire should be the extent of our work. If we do not have peace, we should not work. Since this kind of work is initiated by God, it will issue in life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Thorough</h2>
<p>Our inquiring should be thorough and detailed; that is, all prayers for the work must be thorough. The brothers who give messages should begin with inquiring concerning every point, including the hymns to select, the atmosphere of the meeting, and the audience. It is better to be detailed and thorough when we inquire. If we inquire concerning the hymns, we will have the anointing when we select the hymns. The Spirit will be present in every item of our prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fulfilling the Principles of Prayer</h2>
<p>Often our prayers for the work are not answered, because we do not pray according to the principles of prayer. Our prayers need to be according to the principles of prayer. Suppose we visit a brother; we should not ask the Lord to work on the brother. Such prayer does not correspond to the principles of prayer, because it is not initiated by God. In order to correspond to the principles of prayer, we should first use our spirit to contact God and allow Him to anoint His burden into us and to give us the feeling to visit the brother. Then we can inquire based on this feeling. If we sense life and peace within, we can be assured that the visitation is of God. Afterward, we can inquire concerning every aspect of the visit. This is to pray according to the principles of prayer. Then our words will be according to our fellowship with God, and the visit will be effective.</p>
<p>Every time that we pray, we should first enter into fellowship with God in order to receive His feeling. Then, based on this feeling, we should inquire concerning the work. This is the way to be mingled with God and to work in fellowship with Him. This is how we co-work with God and let God work in us through prayer. As a result, God flows out of us. Hence, the work is carried out in fellowship with God and in the spirit of prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing Time in Prayer for the Work</h2>
<p>The work cannot be quick, because everything that we do requires fellowship in prayer. Therefore, we need to spend time to pray. The effectiveness of our work depends on how much time we spend before God. If we can learn this lesson, the work will be solid. This lesson requires our whole life to learn. We must learn to pray by fellowshipping and inquiring. The more we learn, the more thorough our prayers will be. The saints who pray in this way will be seeds of life and will bear the fruit of life.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
