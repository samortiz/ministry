Ephesians 4:13-14 says, &#8220;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the slight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.&#8221; These verses indicate that the teachings of doctrines are related to little children.<p>First Corinthians 13:8 says, &#8220;Love never falls away. But whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless; or tongues, they will cease; or knowledge, it will be rendered useless.&#8221; Prophecies, tongues, and knowledge are gifts, as mentioned in 12:8-10. In 13:11 Paul says, &#8220;When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child; since I have become a man, I have done away with childish things.&#8221; By the context of these verses we can see that the gifts are also childish things. Christianity today pays full attention to these two categories of things, the teachings and the gifts. The fundamentalists are for the teachings, and the Pentecostals are for the gifts, but they do not see that these two categories of things are related to children.<p>The Ephesians were children in doctrines, and the Corinthians were children in the gifts. Are we still children in doctrines and the gifts? Today&#8217;s Christianity is thickly clouded with teachings and gifts. There is no clear sky there. Many there put their trust either in their gifts or teachings, but we have to see that in the New Testament both teachings and gifts are childish things. This is the clear teaching of the Bible.<h2 class=head1>CARRIED ABOUT BY EVERY WIND OF TEACHING</h2><p>If we still take the way of teaching, we are children, tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching. We may illustrate the winds of teaching by a young brother who has recently been saved and is in the church. Today he appreciates the church very much, but when he visits a certain place, some may come to him to teach him. They may ask, &#8220;What kind of church do you go to?&#8221; If the brother answers, &#8220;It is an eating and drinking church,&#8221; they may say, &#8220;This is nonsense. In John 13 the Lord Jesus tells us that we all have to wash one another&#8217;s feet to show love one to another. Does the church you go to practice foot-washing? The Lord charges us to follow His pattern. Why does the church you go to not practice this? That is wrong. We have a little group here in a home, and every Sunday we have the Lord&#8217;s table. Before taking the table we all wash one another&#8217;s feet.&#8221; The young brother may be convinced by this talk, and he may join this foot-washing group and forget about the church. This is to be carried about by the wind of the teaching of foot-washing. Others may be carried away by some other teaching.<p>If people ask us whether the church practices this kind of foot-washing, we cannot say no because in the local churches we do not make anything legal or formal. We cannot say that we do not have foot-washing. I myself have washed others&#8217; feet in this way, and others have washed my feet. However, this is not the main concern of the church. The main matter is our faith in Christ and the Body of Christ. In these days I look to the Lord that we will spend time to see the unique faith. We have to keep the faith, and we have to be the Body. We should not be carried about by any wind of doctrine.<p>If there is the possibility that we will be carried about by the wind of doctrine, this proves that we are still childish. All little children love toys, but no grandfather or grandmother still likes toys. The younger we are, the more we love toys. As we grow, we drop all the toys. Teachings are good things but childish. Likewise, gifts are good but childish. This is not merely my word. Paul clearly points out that if we are childish, we will be carried away by the teachings, and we will &#8220;play&#8221; with the gifts.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Enjoying the Riches of Christ for the Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 46</div><br></body></html>
