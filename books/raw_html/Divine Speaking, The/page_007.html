<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE SPEAKING<br />
IN THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
BY THE SPIRIT OF FAITH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:3; 2 Cor. 4:7-14; 5:7; 1 Cor. 14:4, 19</h1>
<p>What we are considering here, the divine speaking, is quite crucial to our Christian experience. So many riches in the Bible have all been lost or neglected by Christians throughout the centuries. Even up until 500 years ago, that great item of God&rsquo;s economy, justification by faith, was lost. It was through the Reformers under the leadership of Martin Luther that this item was recovered. The divine speaking also has been, and still is, missed, lost, and neglected by Christians today. This is why there is the need of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>As we have seen in the previous chapter, all Christians have been made the witnesses of Christ. As witnesses we must be persons speaking. We must be speaking for Christ, telling something of Christ to others. A dumb person could never be a witness. We must be speakers, those speaking clearly, adequately, and definitely for the One we witness. I hope that we all would go out to speak. For example, we can speak something to our relatives. We can tell them something concerning Christ&rsquo;s death, something concerning Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, and something concerning the Body of Christ, and the local church. In this matter Christianity has altogether missed the mark. We must come back to the Bible and mine the store of the divine riches. Then we will have so much to speak.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Consummation of the Triune God</h2>
<p>The divine speaking is in the Holy Spirit. To be in the Holy Spirit is not a small thing. Who is the Holy Spirit? Throughout the last twenty centuries there have been many debates concerning the Spirit. Even less than four hundred years ago, Christians still did not understand the Holy Spirit to be a Person. In translating the New Testament, the King James translators did not use the personal pronouns he, him, or his with regard to the Spirit; they still used it, its, and itself. This indicated that they did not consider the Holy Spirit to be a Person. According to this concept, the Father in the Trinity is a Person, and the Son is also a Person, but the Spirit is not. They considered the Spirit just as a means, a channel, or an instrument by which the Father and the Son accomplish something. In the middle part of the last century, the British Brethren, mostly under the teaching of John Nelson Darby, saw that this was wrong. In his New Translation of the New Testament, Darby began to change the pronouns referring to the Spirit to the personal pronouns he, him, or his.</p>
<p>In the first part of this century when the Lord raised us up, we made a very strong decision not to be influenced by anything of the past. We appreciated all the Western missionaries who went to China, and we thanked the Lord for them, because they brought three treasures to us: the name of the Lord Jesus, the gospel, and the Bible. We decided just to take these three things and nothing else. We made a strong decision that we must start to have something purely and absolutely according to the pure word of the Bible. That was the start of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in China.</p>
<p>In this way we began to study the Bible. I myself have been studying this crucial item, the Triune God, for sixty years. This is my major. Of course, it is not only I who like to talk about the Triune God; the Bible speaks much about the Triune God, especially in the New Testament. I discovered by thorough study that nearly every book of the New Testament is constituted with the Divine Trinity. For example, Matthew at its conclusion says, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19). Likewise, 1 Peter says that we were chosen by the Father, sanctified by the Holy Spirit, and sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ (1 Pet. 1:1-2). The conclusion of 2 Corinthians says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all&rdquo; (2 Cor. 13:14). This is the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>After sixty years of study, I came to this conclusion: the Father is the source, the Son is the embodiment of the Triune God, and the Spirit is the realization of the Triune God. Now I would improve this a little more by saying that the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. The Father is the source, the Son is the embodiment, and the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. The entire Triune God, is consummated in the Spirit. Hallelujah! Genesis 1:1 and 2 say, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth...And the Spirit of God brooded over the face of the waters&rdquo; (Heb.). God created, and the Spirit of God brooded to produce for God&rsquo;s creation. But the last chapter of the Bible, as the conclusion of the sixty-six books says, &ldquo;The Spirit and the bride say, Come&rdquo; (Rev. 22:17). This verse says, &ldquo;The Spirit,&rdquo; not God, nor even the Spirit of God, not even the Holy Spirit. This indicates that the Spirit, as the consummation of the processed and dispensed Triune God, is the Husband, and the bride, as the aggregate of the regenerated and transformed tripartite men, is the wife. Who is the Holy Spirit? He is not only the Spirit of God; He is the consummation of the entire Triune God.</p>
<p>I have a strong base to speak in this way. When the Son came, He did not come alone. He came with the Father (John 16:32). When He was living on the earth, His Father was all the time with Him. Even when He was conceived in the womb of the human virgin, God the Father was with Him. He never left the Father. It is impossible to separate Him from the Father. No doubt, the Son and the Father are distinct. Just by the titles we can see that one is the Father and one is the Son. But there is no separation. In John 14:10, He said, &ldquo;Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father Who abides in Me, He does His works.&rdquo; While He was speaking there, He told His disciples that He was at that time in the Father, and the Father was in Him. He was never separated from the Father. When He went to the cross, He died there, and the Father was with Him. He was, and still is, the very embodiment of the Triune God. This is proven in Colossians 2:9: &ldquo;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead [the Triune God] bodily.&rdquo; Then at the end of His earthly ministry, He told His disciples that He would ask the Father to give them another Comforter. John 14 through 16 reveal that this other Comforter is just the realization of Himself (14:17-20; 16:12-14). Therefore, this Comforter is called the Spirit of reality. We may say that the Spirit of reality is the realization of the Son, Christ, as the embodiment of the Triune God.</p>
<p>In John 16:15 He tells us that all that the Father has, has been given over to Him. All that the Son is and has, has been realized in the Spirit. Then the Spirit comes to us to make all this real. Whatever the Father is, is embodied in the Son, and whatever the Son embodies is realized in the Spirit. Who then is the Spirit? He is the realization, the consummation of the entire Triune God. If you receive Him, you receive the Triune God. If you receive Him, you receive Him with the Son and with the Father. If you receive Him, you receive all the Three, the Father, the Son and the Spirit.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we speak in the Holy Spirit we speak in the Triune God. We must realize this and declare it. It would even be good for us to become excited and jump up, declaring, &ldquo;We speak in the Triune God!&rdquo;</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
