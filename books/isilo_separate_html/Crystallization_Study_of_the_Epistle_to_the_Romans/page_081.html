Attributes in Human Virtues in the Living<br />
of the Early Believers in Jerusalem</h2>
<p>Acts 2:47 describes a situation in which the early believers in Jerusalem were contacting God and experiencing God. Everyone was full of God. That was a situation of grace which could be seen by others. That grace was the visitation of God. A group of believers were growing to express God&rsquo;s attributes in their virtues. They were humble, loving, and full of light. All these were human virtues, but these virtues were the expression of God&rsquo;s attributes. That was the issue of their experience of God as grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">6. The Grace Which Was upon the Multitude<br />
of Believers When the Apostles Gave Them<br />
Testimony of the Resurrection of the Lord Jesus</h2>
<p>When the apostles gave the believers testimony concerning the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, great grace was upon them (Acts 4:33). When we are under the proper ministry of the word, grace is also upon us. There is an atmosphere and situation of God&rsquo;s presence with us. The presence of God is the grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">7. The Grace of Which Stephen Was Full,<br />
and the Power of Which He Was Full, When He<br />
Did Great Wonders and Signs among the People</h2>
<p>When Stephen was full of grace and full of power, he did great wonders and signs among the people (Acts 6:8). In Pentecostalism many of the so-called miracles and healings are false. But what Stephen did was the genuine manifestation of grace. That was God&rsquo;s visitation. God was there.</p>
<h2 class="head2">8. The Grace Enjoyed by the Believers<br />
in Antioch, Which Barnabas Saw</h2>
<p>When Barnabas went to Antioch, he saw God&rsquo;s grace which the believers there enjoyed (Acts 11:23). That means that they were all continually enjoying God&rsquo;s visitation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">9. The Grace in Which the New<br />
Believers Were Urged to Continue by<br />
the Apostles Paul and Barnabas</h2>
<p>The apostles Paul and Barnabas urged the new believers to continue in the grace (Acts 13:43). That means to continue in advancing and growing in grace, which is the visitation of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">10. The Grace of Which the Word of God Is,<br />
Ministered to the New Believers<br />
by Paul and Barnabas</h2>
<p>The word of God is called the word of grace. This word of grace was ministered to the new believers by Paul and Barnabas (Acts 14:3). The word of grace is the word of God Himself, the word of God&rsquo;s visitation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">11. The Grace of God to Which Paul<br />
and Barnabas Had Been Commended<br />
for the Work Which They Fulfilled</h2>
<p>When Paul and Barnabas were going out, the saints commended them to the grace of God (Acts 14:26). That means when they went out, they would always be under God&rsquo;s visitation, God&rsquo;s grace. The saints commended them to God&rsquo;s visitation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_080.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_082.html">Next</a> </body></html>
