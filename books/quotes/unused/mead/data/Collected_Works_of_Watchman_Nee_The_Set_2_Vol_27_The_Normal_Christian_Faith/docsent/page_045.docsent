   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN CHRIST AS LIFE IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that by including us in Christ, God accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This identification with Christ is purely the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The present question is: How can Christ be worked into us?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In other words, how can He be related to us personally and subjectively?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Having Christ worked into us and having a vital life relationship between Him and us is the essence of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Gospel of John, Christ repeated over and over again the phrase, "You in Me, and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Being mutually within one another is the reality and essence of union.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only in this union can God accomplish what He has purposed for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE FULLER UNION</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has already included us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we have to see how Christ can be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only when Christ is in us can our union be real and complete, and only then will everything He has be worked into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This relationship with Christ is union in its ultimate and fullest sense.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day I was watching a blacksmith at work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As he threw a big piece of iron into the fire, he kindled the flame and began to hammer on the red hot metal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>An apprentice standing next to him was trying to get some fire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He rolled up a piece of paper, and instead of thrusting it into the fire, he touched the red hot iron with the end of the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In an instant, it caught on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was exceedingly surprised at seeing the fire coming out from the iron.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This piece of iron was now different from all other iron.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You could say that it was iron, yet you could also consider it as a ball of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fire was within the iron and the iron within the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It had the nature of iron and the appearance of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you put a piece of paper on it, the paper burned up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God intends that our union with Christ be as intimate as that of the iron and fire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has forgiven our sins and terminated our old man in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But He did not stop there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He wants us to be completely one with Christ in the way that the iron was one with the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every molecule of iron was mingled with the fire, and every trait of the fire was manifested in the iron.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the degree that God wants to work Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We still have to look at God's side of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For the moment, we will not say what we have to do on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We want to see how God has wrought us and Christ into one piece.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What we saw hitherto was God's work of putting us in Christ and His work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order for Christ to be wrought into us in a union that resembles that between the iron and fire, God had to take one very important step in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This step is what we are about to explain in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE LIMITED JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all know that Jesus of Nazareth is God incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words He is God clothed with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If God had not clothed Himself with flesh, He could never have accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the reason He was incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the minute He put on the flesh, He was limited in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was limited in time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If He remained merely God, He would not be within the bounds of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the minute He put on humanity, He was trapped by these two factors.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He became the same as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How is the flesh bound by time and space?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you are in Tientsin, you cannot be in Peking at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you appear in China, you cannot appear simultaneously in England.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As long as you have a body, you are confined by distance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You can only be in one place at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Human beings are bound by the body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Moreover, you are also limited by time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You cannot exist at two different times simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I can only know you as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I cannot see what you will become tomorrow or next year.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Often I would be talking to someone one minute.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The next instant he was no longer available to me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That person to whom I talked was limited; he could only appear to me at one time but not at another.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the bondage that time puts on our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We can be together, but not forever.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Time puts an ultimate end to all human relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ who clothed Himself with human flesh, was also confined by the two conditions of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All that God could do then was to reckon us as attached to Christ and accomplish redemption this way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There was as yet no way for us to be actually in Him, because we could not get into another body of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In order for us to be in Christ or Christ in us, there was the need for Him to be something other than merely in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He had to come in another form before He could be one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Fire can become one with iron because it is something that has "proceeded forth."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is impossible to blend a piece of wood into iron.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He had to appear in another fashion before He could come into us.</S>
