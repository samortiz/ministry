<P>Prayer: Lord, thank You for putting us in Your recovery to be the slaves of Your children. As co-workers and elders we all are slaves in Your house. Lord, only You are the Lord, the Sovereign Master; we worship You, serve You, preach You, and dispense You to people. For Your sake we are willing to be Your household slaves to serve You and take care of Your children. O Lord, do speak a clear word to us again in these six meetings; speak something which You have not spoken before and which we have not heard before. It seems that we heard many things before but did not take them in. O Lord, we pray that You would give us a glorious beginning; glorify Yourself, glorify the Father, and glorify the Spirit. O Lord, we are Your slaves, and we can only bow down and worship before You, looking to You to grant us a good beginning.</P><P>O Lord, we also cannot forget Your enemy. While You are giving grace to us, he is disturbing us. Lord, we truly hate the evil one; we accuse him before You. We declare before You that You have already destroyed him through Your death in the flesh on the cross. We pray that You would destroy Your enemy, Satan, the evil one, among us in Your recovery. Lord, release Your children, release Your rich grace, and release Yourself that we may receive Your rich and abounding supply. Amen.</P><P>In this conference we want to see how to be a co-worker and an elder and how to fulfill the obligations of the co-workers and elders. The central burden of these messages can be expressed in the following statements:</P><P>(1)The full ministry of Christ is carried out in three stages for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy.<br>(2)In the first stage of incarnation to bring God into man, to express God in humanity, and to accomplish His judicial redemption.<br>(3)In the second stage of inclusion to be begotten as God's firstborn Son, to become the life-giving Spirit, and to regenerate the believers for His Body.<br>(4)In the third stage of intensification to intensify His organic salvation, to produce the overcomers, and to consummate the New Jerusalem.</P><P>This is a special conference originally initiated by the brothers from Taiwan. Since I have not returned to Taiwan for many years, they requested repeatedly that I speak in Chinese in this conference. In the past few years I did not comply since there should be no differences of nationalities in the Lord's recovery. Although we still have the language problem passed on to us from Babel, we keep the Lord's word by not having national differences. In the Lord's Body there is no room for any nation or race, but He is all. In the new man there is only our Lord, who is all the members and in all the members as their content. Since the Lord is in us, we should not have any national differences. Nevertheless, because we are still in our flesh, language remains a big problem. Hence, although we are releasing the messages in Chinese, may there be no differences of nationalities among us.</P>
