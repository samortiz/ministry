   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The New Testament records that one day while the Lord Jesus was on the earth He prayed, "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth " Matt 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Again, through the man Jesus, God had ground on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>So many Christians today desire to go to heaven, but God desires to come down to this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Heaven is so precious to some, but to God this earth is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should sympathize with God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not say, "Let the church life be in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should say that the church must be on this earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hallelujah, God can never be defeated!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the Israelites had been in captivity for seventy years, the struggle was again openly manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God had been patient long enough; so He fought back.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He stirred up His people to return to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The two books of Ezra and Nehemiah record a very interesting phrase "unto Jerusalem" Ezra 1:11; 7:7; 8:31; Neh 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's way of recovery always involves a return to the original, proper ground of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today we cannot say, "There is not any difference; God is omnipresent, God is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If God is in Jerusalem, He must also be in Babylon."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yes, God is everywhere, yet you must leave Babylon and come back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we would realize God's recovery today, we must leave Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Babylon is the very element which damages God's building; we must abandon it and return to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is only one ground for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must return to the old standing of the proper ground, in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The books of Ezra and Nehemiah record the real struggle involved over Israel's return to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For the Israelites to have God's building in Babylon was quite all right all their enemies agreed concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But for them to return to Jerusalem was another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The situation is exactly the same today: the battle between God and His enemy is mainly over the matter of Christians returning to the church ground, the ground of unique unity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must return to "Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In God's way of recovery the most important thing is to recover the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Israelites returned to Jerusalem, one of their first projects was to rebuild the altar upon its original base Ezra 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Israelites could have built another altar in the same shape and style, using the same material, and put it in a place other than its original site in Jerusalem; but that would be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The altar must be on the proper base, the proper ground in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some Israelites might have built a temple in Babylon, using the same pattern, the same size, the same precious materials, and the same color as the temple in Jerusalem; but God would never have recognized that temple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It would be the same in every respect except for one vital factor it would be on a different ground, a different standing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the recovery of the church life the first thing to which we must pay attention is the old ground, the original standing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must not say, "Let us build a temple here in Babylon, in Egypt, or in Syria."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot do that.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must return to Jerusalem, to the old ground, to the original standing of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The book of Nehemiah records how the enemy stirred up an intense struggle to frustrate the Israelites from God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After they began to build, they were openly attacked Neh 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The enemy's only intention was to stop the recovery of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Another tactic of the enemy was to utilize some people to suggest a conference Neh 6:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even so there are some today who say, "Please come; let us sit down together and talk it over."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must see through these subtle wiles of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must tell them as Nehemiah did, "I don't have time for a conference; I am too busy building."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>People may accuse you of never desiring to discuss the matter and have fellowship with others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we want to have positive fellowship; we do not want to waste our time; we do not want to be frustrated from the recovery of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How subtle the enemy is in his attempts to frustrate us from God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Israelites who worked in the building with Nehemiah labored with one hand to build and in the other hand held their weapons for fighting the battle Neh 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This reveals that whenever we labor on God's building we will certainly be involved in battle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These historical books also show us what happens when we neglect the recovery of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord says in Haggai that when we neglect His house to do our own labor and sow our own seed, the result will only be emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may eat continually but we will still be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may drink constantly, yet we will not be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may gain something by our labor, but the Lord will blow it away.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may earn some wages and put them away in a bag as our savings, but the bag will be full of holes Hag 1:2-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we neglect the building of God's temple, we will lose the blessing of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we give our full attention to the recovery of the church life today, being willing to be built up together, we will attain this building.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever we go out to preach the gospel, many will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The blessing of the Lord will be upon whatever we do.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the other hand, if we neglect God's house, the building up of the church, no matter what we do the end results will be very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We may sow the seed, but there will be no lasting fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may gain something, but eventually it will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There will be no satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many of us can verify these things.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord warns us that we must pay attention to His house first.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we would attend to the church life and be built up in our locality, we will see the Lord's abundant blessing upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>About ten years ago the church in Taipei set aside several days specifically for gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The gospel was preached in at least five or six meeting places during the same evening.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After several days of meetings, a person from a Christian organization came to me and inquired, "Brother, would you please tell me the secret!"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When I asked him what he meant, he told how his group had held some gospel meetings several weeks before.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They had put a large advertisement in the newspaper, and they had invited a well-known speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Yet every night their turnout was little more than ten people and never over twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Now this gentleman had visited all the meeting places of the local church for just a few minutes each night.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He was exceedingly surprised to see every place full of people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He knew that there had been no advertisement in the newspapers and that before each meeting not many knew who was to be the speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I could not adequately explain the situation to this brother, and if I could pass on to him the methods, they would not work for his group.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Because this brother had simply neglected the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He trusted in advertising and famous speakers, yet he neglected God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>How much we need God's recovery today!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must be built up together as one church in each city; then we will have God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, we must realize that we will suffer for such a building.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The enemy will attack us over this matter more than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He will do everything he can to damage us, spreading all kinds of rumors and lies, for no other reason than to hinder or stop the recovery of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Yet the Lord is victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Praise Him!</S>
