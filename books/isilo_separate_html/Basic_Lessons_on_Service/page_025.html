We, the Many Sons of God,<br>Following Christ in Praising the Father</H2><P>We, the many sons of God, follow Christ in praising the Father. In Matthew 26:30 it was not only Christ but also His disciples singing a hymn of praise with Him. So He took the lead and the disciples followed Him. Today it should be the same. Christ, the Firstborn, takes the lead, and we, the many sons, follow Him to praise the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Addressing Praise to the Father</H2><P>Our addressing praise to the Father is through the Son and in the Spirit. In our remembrance of the Lord, we address all the praises to the Lord. Then when we turn to worship the Father, we have to address all our praises to Him. Ephesians 2:18 says, "For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father." Through the Son, as the One who died on the cross to abolish all the ordinances and to create the one new man of two peoples (v. 15), and in the Spirit we have access unto the Father.</P><P>Ephesians 1 reveals the Father choosing and predestinating us, the Son redeeming us, and the Spirit sealing us. Then 2:18 says that through the Son and in the Spirit, we approach the Father. In chapter three Paul said that he bowed his knees to the Father that He might strengthen us through His Spirit that Christ might make His home in our hearts (vv. 14-17). In chapter four there are three groups: one Body, one Spirit, and one hope; one Lord, one faith, and one baptism; and one God and Father of all, who is over all, through all, and in us all (vv. 4-6). These portions from Ephesians show us the divine economy of the Divine Trinity.</P><P>In our sharing it is helpful to link Ephesians 2:18 with Luke 15. Luke 15 reveals that the Son came as the Shepherd to seek after the lost sheep (vv. 1-7), that the Spirit as the woman enlightens the house and eventually finds the lost coin (vv. 8-10), and that the Father receives the returned son (vv. 11-32). This shows the divine economy of the Divine Trinity with the redeeming Son, the sanctifying Spirit, and the receiving Father. Through the Son and in the Spirit, we have access unto the Father. The Lord told three parables in Luke 15 to unveil the saving love of the Triune God toward sinners. The lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost son are one lost person in three aspects. Luke 15 shows that we cannot be sought for and found and brought to the Father directly. We can come to the Father only through Christ and in the Spirit.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
