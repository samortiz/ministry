   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Sitting beside Him</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>An unbeliever does not know where to sit when he comes to the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You must let him know where he should sit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the ushers in the hall have made an arrangement already, you must cooperate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you bring one person to the meeting, you must sit beside him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you bring two, sit between them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you bring three or four, sit with one or two on each side of you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not take care of more than four people; you will be busy enough taking care of four.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you bring more, ask other brothers or sisters to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Keep two persons at the most on each side.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The way we sit is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the meeting we have to sit beside the invited ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. Looking Up the Verses and the Hymns</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>and Explaining the Terms</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are many things to do while sitting next to gospel friends.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You have to help them find the verses when the Scripture is quoted in a message.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the speaker mentions a word or term that requires explanation, you have to explain it to your friend softly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have to pick up what the speaker misses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Your voice must not be loud.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Speak softly but clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A brother once preached the gospel to a big audience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He began by saying, You all know the story of the Israelites coming out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Another brother went over to him and said, These people do not know who the Israelites are; nor do they know anything about Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This shows us that it is best for the speaking brother to avoid words that unbelievers do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the same time, the brothers and sisters who are sitting in the audience should help fill up the lack.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If they come across this situation, they should explain to the gospel friends immediately and in a very simple way that the Israelites are Jews, that Egypt is a country, and that the Israelites were slaves in Egypt, but later they came out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Explain these things to your friends in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must also look up the hymns for your friends.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many hymns have chorus lines that need to be repeated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must help your friends repeat these lines.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>C. Paying Attention to Your Friends Response</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>and Praying for Them</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have to be watchful before the Lord concerning your friends response.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you feel that the response of the one sitting beside you is not good during the preaching, you can pray in secret, saying, Lord, soften his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you feel that he is proud, you can pray, Lord, break his pride.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The success of a gospel meeting in the church depends on the condition of all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If all the brothers and sisters attend the gospel meeting and if all participate in the work together, there will be a free way for the gospel to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You must pay attention to the new ones and observe their response to the message.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These are the ones you have brought to the meeting; you know their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Your eyes must be fixed on them, and you must pray for them, saying, Lord, move his heart and make him understand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Lord, touch him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Take away his pride so that he can hear and receive Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes you may feel that the brothers on the podium should say certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You may feel that they should talk about certain subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You can pray, Lord, cause the brother to speak such a word to meet this man s need.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many times the brother on the podium will say the very words that you have prayed for, as if he has heard your petition.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is important for you to take care of the ones beside you by praying for them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>D. Helping Them to Receive the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once you feel that they are touched by the message, you should help them to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You have to usher the word of the Lord into their hearts by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You have to carry God s word to them and capture their heart by praying, Lord, let him hear this word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Lord, let this word hit him hard.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Lord, let this word shine so that he may see.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the speaker starts pulling in the net, that is, sounding the call, we must encourage them to respond, saying, Please do not miss this opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I hope you will receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must give them a push when we see that they are touched but are hesitating.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since Satan is doing his best to hold them back, it is wrong for us to shy away from pushing them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Satan works in men s hearts to hinder them from receiving the Lord, while we are trying to push them to believe from their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the gospel meeting we need to help our friends receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the brother at the podium invites people to receive the Lord, we have to observe our friends reactions closely.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If they are touched at all, we have to do our part by saying, You should believe and receive the Lord now.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you do not receive, you will suffer in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our tone should be serious and sober.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This will have an effect on them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Please remember one principle: In trying to save people, do not analyze whether or not they will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do not analyze whether or not they are predestinated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our hearts and minds should be set on their receiving salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to bring them to the Lord and not let them go until they are saved.</S>
