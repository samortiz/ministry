   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Learning to Know Mercy in Faith</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many of you are passing through trials, and you are testing your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Your way, your living, and your pursuit have become trials to you, and you are being tested in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During such times of trials and testing, we are not fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In our experience we enter into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This darkness is not bad; it is good.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is bad darkness, and there is beneficial darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is similar to death, which can be either bad or beneficial.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The death we have in Adam is bad, but the death we have in Christ is beneficial.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord leads us through trials in which we experience darkness that is beneficial.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we pass through this darkness, we must learn the lesson of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, we must also learn the lesson of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While we are being tested, we must live more and more by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more trials we pass through, the more we live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must also learn the lesson of not looking at ourselves but of boasting in the Lord s selection and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot claim any credit for our standing before the Lord, because it is only by His mercy that we are still here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the Lord s mercy that we have chosen to take this way and to have this living and pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is His mercy that enables us to make the right choice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without His mercy, we would be like so many other people who have made the wrong choice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not that we have foresight and therefore know what to choose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is altogether of the Lord s mercy that we can stand and continue on this way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord leads us through trials so that we will learn lessons and so that we will know that everything is altogether a matter of faith and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the trials we will know that our relationship with the saints also depends on the Lord s mercy, not on our leading or our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I cannot say that you are taking this way because of my leading.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I may be able to lead you for a period of time, but without the Lord s mercy, you will not remain on this way for the rest of your life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether or not you stay on this way will only be the result of receiving mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even continuous contact will not ensure that someone will remain on this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may be able to encourage others to take this way through such contact, but this will not cause them to continue on this way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must realize that the human hand is not able to restore a person who has a problem with this way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the past we have not been able to help those who had problems taking this way, in spite of our attempts to help them understand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All our attempts at restoring people are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is altogether a matter of whether or not a person receives mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must see that this way is entirely of faith and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should never think that this way is merely a matter of leaving the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no position for those who take this way; moreover, those who take this way will be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not only will we be tested, but this way will be tested by us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to test this way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not enough for others to lead us on this way, nor is it enough for others to contact us, because we will still be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I believe that many saints have been tried and that they also have asked whether this way is trustworthy and true and whether the Lord wants them to take this way or do something else.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who are tested must live by faith, and they must receive mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After we are tested, we will be able to declare, I will take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whether or not I have companions to fellowship with, the object of my faith is directly related to me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even if others do not take this way, I will still take it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I will not be influenced by others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only in this way can we pass the test and touch faith in simplicity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only those who know mercy can say that their taking this way is related directly to God and that even if the apostle Paul did not take this way, they would still take it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The saints who know mercy can say, I know whom I have believed 2 Tim 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should never think that because we have heard this word, we must take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only a handful of people are able to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The way of following the Lord is in faith, and it is according to His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After we are tested, we will know when others have begun to take this way, how far they have gone, and whether they have been tried.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We will know whether they are taking this way due to others influence or due to their relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many people have taken this way because they were influenced and helped by others, but in the end they must have a direct relationship with God in order to remain on this way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Otherwise, they will not be able to continue without wavering.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The only way is to learn the lesson of faith and to know mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no other way.</S>
