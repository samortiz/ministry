   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time, the whole house of Israel will look upon Him whom they have pierced, and they will mourn for Him; thus, all Israel will be saved 12:10-14; Rom 11:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Afterwards, He will be the King to reign and rule over the nations; all the people will go up to Jerusalem from year to year to worship Him, and all will be sanctified unto Him 9:10; 14:16-21 .</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When he heard that those who had returned from the captivity were in great affliction and reproach, and that the wall of Jerusalem also was broken down and its gates were burned with fire, he wept, fasting and praying before God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes I not the same King Artaxerxes who stopped the people of Israel from rebuilding the holy temple , Nehemiah was granted permission by the king to return to Jerusalem for the rebuilding of its walls Neh 2:1-6, 17 .</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ezra was a lineal descendant of Aaron the high priest; hence, he was a priest.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because the nobles and the rulers of Israel exacted usury from the people, the people were poverty-stricken and there was a great cry among them.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moreover, although he was the governor, Nehemiah had not eaten the bread of the governor that he might not increase the burden of the people.</S>
