<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE FUNCTION<br>OF THE BOOK OF JOB IN THE SCRIPTURES</H2><P>Although the book of Job contains very little of the divine revelation, this book nevertheless has a particular function in the Scriptures. This function has several aspects.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. To Minister to Its Readers<br>a Picture of Man's Concept concerning<br>God's Dealing with His Holy People</H2><P>First, the book of Job ministers to its readers a picture of man's concept concerning God's dealing with His holy people. Such a picture is clearly presented.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Expose the Deficiency<br>of the Divine Revelation in Job's Age</H2><P>Second, the function of this book is to expose the deficiency of the divine revelation in Job's age, which was quite primitive in knowing God. There was some divine revelation, but it was in a primitive stage.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Serve the Bible Readers<br>with a Negative Background<br>so That They Will Proceed Further<br>in Seeking the Divine and Spiritual Truths</H2><P>Third, in its function in the Scriptures, the book of Job serves the Bible readers with a negative background so that they will proceed further from what they can receive in the book of Job and seek the divine and spiritual truths as the progression of the divine revelation shown in the Psalms. For example, the divine revelation in Psalm 45 concerning Christ as the King is very high.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. To Stir Up the Bible Readers'<br>Hunger and Thirst for Knowing Christ<br>as the Centrality and Universality<br>of God's Eternal Economy</H2><P>The book of Job also functions to stir up the Bible readers' hunger and thirst for knowing Christ as the centrality and universality of God's eternal economy and to urge them to get out of their contentment in their present attainment in knowing God. Our contentment with what we know of God is a hindrance to our progressing in the understanding of the divine revelation.</P>
