   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>But you say, "They won't let me pray in the prayer meeting; how can I always go out against him?"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But you have a world-wide sphere in the prayer life, your spirit can go out in victorious prayer against all the powers of darkness, persistently, steadily for the whole church of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Quiet Talks on Prayer", by S. D. Gordon, gives much light on this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That will keep your spirit going out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The truth is you either must go out against what is outside, or else what is outside will come in, and crush you down.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some of you have no flow now in testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Revival days your spirit was free.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How easy it was then to speak; but, alas! the attacks, the conflict, the opposition, and the difficulties, have come like a great thick wall of clay, and the poor spirit has gone back into prison to be locked up and bound and compressed, so that it cannot move; and you have lost the power to perceive the will of God, and you don't know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us ask God for liberation from all the accumulated weights that crush you down in spirit, so that you may enter into a sphere of mightier work in the unseen realm.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Though you cannot pray in the prayer meetings, God calls you into a spirit union with Himself, that in prayer you may drive these forces of darkness back.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is a mightier work than anything else, and that field is open to any of you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The closing of the prayer meeting door against you can drive you to pray for Wales as you never prayed before.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you understood how to walk in the spirit, if you knew how to detect God's will in the spirit, that is possible for you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Though absent in the body from them, Paul told the Corinthians that he was "present in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Again he said to the believers, "Stand fast in one spirit, striving with one soul for the truth of the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Ye are all made to drink of one Spirit," ye are a "habitation of God through the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Endeavouring to keep the "unity of the spirit" in the bond of peace, "praying in the spirit," "fellowship in the spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is "all in the spirit," and if the church of Jesus Christ was united in the spirit, there is no power of darkness that could stand before her.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She would be fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do you see in the light of this what is the matter with the prayer meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This great thick cloud of the powers of darkness comes down on the prayer meeting, and because you do not know how to fight in spirit through that wall, you are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Satan tells you that God is not listening to you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Oh! if you knew how to penetrate through.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Someone has said, "The Lord Jesus Christ has gone through the plane of the prince of the power of the air, and sat down on God's right hand, praying and keeping the way open for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The only way through is a blood-marked way; He is keeping open the way through the hosts of darkness."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Having boldness to enter by the blood" a blood-marked way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you have once known that life with Christ in God for "ye died and your life is hid with Christ in God" , cease to walk after the natural man, the man of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Learn to live in spirit with Christ on the Throne, and live the will of God as you learn it there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Your spirit must remain there, for that is the ascension place "joined to the Lord, one spirit," and from that place you must understand how to resist everything that comes to you from the powers of darkness, direct, and indirect through men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Be determined that the one thing that you will do is to keep your spirit clear with God, so that you know the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God must work out His own plans in His own way; and your one thing is to know Him, to live and walk in the spirit with Him, to obey His word, to refuse to have clouds that will shadow your spirit-fellowship with God, who is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That is the place of authority, and power over all the power of the enemy.</S>
