<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Law</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Spirit Not Only Belonging to Life<br>but Also Having Its Law</H2><P>Romans 8:2a speaks of "the law of the Spirit of life." This shows that the Spirit not only belongs to life but also has the life law as the law of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Life Being the Content and Issue of the Spirit;<br>Law Being the Function and Action of the Spirit</H2><P>Life is the content and issue of the Spirit, whereas the law of life is the function and action of the Spirit. When the Spirit functions, this function is the law. When the Spirit acts, this action is the law.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. By Contacting Life We Touch the Spirit;<br>by Sensing the Law We Also Sense the Spirit</H2><P>We can realize the Spirit by contacting life and by sensing the law. By this we can see that the phrase the law of the Spirit of life is somewhat complicated. The law, the Spirit, and life are wrapped up together as one unit. Life is the content and issue of the Spirit, and law is the function and action of the Spirit. Thus, when we contact life, we touch the Spirit, and when we sense the law, we sense the Spirit. This is because life and law are both one with the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Peace</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Peace Being Also the Issue of the Spirit</H2><P>Romans 8:6b says that to set the mind on the spirit is life and peace. In addition to life, peace is also the issue of the spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Touching the Spirit, We Do Not Only Touch Life but Also Peace</H2><P>We should not forget that this is a continuation of our fellowship in lesson eleven on the sense of life. We have to point out that the feeling of peace is the inner feeling of ease, comfort, harmony, rest, joy, and liberty. When we touch the spirit, we touch life, and at the same time we also touch peace.</P>
