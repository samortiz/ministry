   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>and Serving the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord wants us to serve Him more than He wants us to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ministering to the house and serving before the Lord's table are different things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Working for the Lord and serving the Lord are different things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Tilling the field and shepherding the flock are different from serving in the presence of the master.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What the sons of Levi did was different from what the sons of Zadok did.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Levites ministered to the house in the outer court; they killed the sacrifices before the people and ministered on their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The sons of Zadok ministered to the Lord's table within the Holy Place and served the Lord by offering the fat and the blood.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many people like to exercise their muscles in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They like to help others move and kill the sacrifices, but they do not like to serve the Lord in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many people like to run around in an outward way; they like to save sinners, edify the believers, and serve the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the Lord wants us to pursue a service to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's work has its interests and attractions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The attractions of the flesh do exist within God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many people love to run around and work because this is what their flesh is inclined to do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Outwardly, they are saving sinners and serving the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, they are serving their own flesh and their own pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One believer who has passed the veil and who is on the other side of the veil prayed after reading Ezekiel 44: "Lord, may I minister unto You, rather than unto the house!"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ministering to the Lord in the Holy Place</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"They shall come near to me to minister unto me" Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>44:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the outer court one comes near to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Holy Place one comes near to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is possible to follow the Lord "at a distance" Matt 26:58 , but it is not possible to minister to the Lord at a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to minister to the Lord, one has to come near to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The prayer that brings one near to the Lord gives him strength.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It also requires that he exercise his strength.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"And they shall stand before me" Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>44:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not only must one come near to the Lord, but he must also stand before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people cannot stand and wait.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To stand is to wait for an order.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All those who cannot stand and wait before the Lord cannot minister to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have two kinds of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One is to receive a command and not obey it; this is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The other is to have no command and yet do something; this is presumption Psa 19:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not a matter of good or bad but of having or not having God's command.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Good things can damage the believers very much; they are a great enemy to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the outer court one takes orders from the offerers of sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Holy Place one takes orders from God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"To offer unto me the fat and the blood" Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>44:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God's righteousness and holiness fill the Holy Place, and His glory fills the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The blood is for God's righteousness and holiness, while the fat is for God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Glory is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Holiness is God's nature, while righteousness is God's procedure, His way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The blood is there for the forgiveness of sins; it satisfies God's righteousness and holiness, and it enables us to come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The fat is to satisfy God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The blood deals with the old creation, while the fat is for the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the Lord poured out His blood, it meant that He poured out all His natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today the Lord has flesh and bones Luke 24:39 but no blood.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He does not have a drop of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Every day we have to learn to deny our natural life before the Lord; this is the aspect of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At the same time, we have to offer up the resurrection life; this is the aspect of the fat Rom 6:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"They shall enter into my sanctuary" Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>44:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be in the sanctuary is to be in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are very afraid of being in the sanctuary because if we remain in the sanctuary it is easy to be misunderstood, slandered, and criticized.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But we should dwell in the house of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are not narrow; our hearts are broad and ambitious.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Paul said in his Epistles that he was determined to be well pleasing to the Lord 2 Cor 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have to pursue ministering to the Lord rather than to the house.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"No wool shall come upon them" Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>44:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>"They shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat" v. 18 . Sweat is a condition of the curse Gen 3:19 . To sweat is to be without the Lord's blessing and to labor by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>One can sweat when he kills the bulls and the goats in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But he cannot sweat when he is ministering to the Lord in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>One can exert spiritual strength before the Lord, but he must not sweat.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Committees, discussions, and propagandas all belong to the realm of sweating.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Spiritual work touches God alone, while fleshly work touches men alone.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The more spiritual a work is, the more inward it is.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But the work of the flesh is all outward.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God did not command all the Levites to minister to Him in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He only ordered the sons of Zadok to minister to Him in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God invites men to minister to Him in His Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He wants men to preserve His Holy Place, shine out from there, and separate the holy things from the common things, and the clean things from the unclean things.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Acts 13:1-3 tells us when "they were ministering to the Lord and fasting," the Holy Spirit sent them out on their missionary work abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Our work abroad should start with our ministering to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Lord is after drafted workers, not volunteer workers.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Hebrews emphasizes two things: our ministering to God within the veil and our suffering the reproach of the Lord without the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Ministering to Him after Working</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In Luke 17:7-10, "plowing" is preaching of the gospel, while "tending sheep" is caring for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>To "serve me" means that one has to minister to the Lord even after he has worked.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>To "eat and drink" is to remember and to enjoy the fruit of our work; we must first allow the Lord to "eat and drink" before we enjoy eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The result of our work should first satisfy the Lord's heart before it satisfies our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>After we have worked, we should not eat, drink, and enjoy; rather, we should say, "We are unprofitable slaves."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>"Gird yourself and serve me" means that after one has worked, he should still be on the alert to minister to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>May we pursue a ministry to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The work in the field is not as good as the ministry in the house, and the field and the sheep are not as good as the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Morning, January 22, 1934</S>
