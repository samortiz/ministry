   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MOST SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the end of chapter seven, a long chapter concerned with married life, Paul says, I think that I also have the Spirit of God v. 40 . In the previous chapter Paul said that he was one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But in 7:40 he says, I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that he may not have been sure.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I did not know how to reconcile these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 7:10 Paul says, I charge, not I but the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 12 he says, I say, not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 25 he goes on to say, I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in verse 40 he says, But she is more blessed if she so remains, according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All these verses indicate the New Testament principle of incarnation the principle of God and man, man and God, becoming one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This differs drastically from the principle of Old Testament prophecy speaking for God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Old Testament the word of Jehovah came to a prophet Jer 1:2; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1:3 , the prophet being simply the mouthpiece of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in the New Testament the Lord becomes one with His apostles, and they become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result, both speak together.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His word becomes their word, and what they utter is His word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, the apostle s charge is the Lord s charge 1 Cor 7:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What he says, though not by the Lord, still becomes a part of the divine revelation in the New Testament v. 12 . He is so one with the Lord that even when he gives his own opinion, not the commandment of the Lord v. 25 , he still thinks that he also has the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He does not claim definitely to have the Spirit of God, but he thinks that he also has the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the highest spirituality, the spirituality based on the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I can remember that one day in 1948 Brother Nee pointed out in fellowship with some of us that 1 Corinthians 7 is the most spiritual chapter in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I wondered how a chapter concerned with married life could be considered the most spiritual chapter in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brother Watchman Nee said that in this chapter we not only have married life, but we also have the matter of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He pointed out that according to 1 Corinthians 7 Paul wrote certain things even though he did not have the commandment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How would you react if someone told you that he did not have any commandment of the Lord, yet he went on to give you instructions regarding a certain thing?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Is it not likely that you would refuse to listen to him?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brother Nee helped us to see that in 1 Corinthians 7 we have a person who did not have the word of the Lord, but spoke his own word, even his own opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually, Paul could say in verse 40 that he thought he also had the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This, Brother Nee said, is the most spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually I became convinced that no spiritual experience is as deep as that revealed in 1 Corinthians 7.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here we have a man who tells us that he does not have the Lord s commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then he proceeds to give his own opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After giving his opinion, he tells us, I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here Paul seems to be saying, I am giving you my word, my opinion, without any commandment from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But I think that I nevertheless have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we had been able to question Paul concerning this, he might have replied, Brother, I am now practicing what I wrote about in 6:17.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is certainly right to say that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now when I say that I think I also have the Spirit of God, I am living the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I live the Lord in this one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even when I give you my opinion, I still have the Spirit of the Lord, although I don t have the boldness to declare with assurance that I have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, those who are childish and shallow may say with assurance that they have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, they don t have that kind of assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But what I am saying is a description of my living of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we see this, we shall realize that chapter seven of 1 Corinthians describes something profound.</S>
