   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was in San-Tai, I met a British missionary in a Friends Church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>She told me that the Friends Church does not emphasize outward formalities but inner light and that baptism and the breaking of bread are unnecessary.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the third day in their fellowship meeting, we studied a few passages concerning fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord was indeed with us, and they were all willing to receive the word quietly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the Lord's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>May all the glory go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Meetings here are as usual.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thank the Lord that He always blesses the work that He has ordered.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because of the lesson we learned last time, we did not move rashly this time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I was concerned about exposing the children to the danger of long-distance travel by bus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The mountain roads are dangerous, and there is always the danger of accidents and robberies.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thank the Lord, He cared for the weak and gave us a full promise: "Your women, children, and all your possessions will come in the way of peace."</S>
