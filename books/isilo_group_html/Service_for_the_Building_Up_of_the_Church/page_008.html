<p>Let us have more specific fellowship concerning how to take care of the believers. First, we must pray for them. If we want to bring them to God, we must first go to God on their behalf. We should mention them by name to God; we should write their names in a booklet and pray for them often. Such prayer is necessary and should be specific. We should no longer have general prayers, saying, &ldquo;Lord, revive Your church. Remember the brothers and sisters. Remember those who are weak, who have stumbled, or who are backsliding.&rdquo; It is not that general prayers are not effective but that the effectiveness of our prayers depends on how specific they are.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew two blind men heard that Jesus was passing by and cried out, saying, &ldquo;Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!&rdquo; (20:30). Jesus stopped, called them, and said, &ldquo;What do you want Me to do for you?&rdquo; (v. 32). They answered, &ldquo;Lord, that our eyes may be opened&rdquo; (v. 33). The Lord was moved with compassion and touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight (v. 34). Hence, instead of general prayers, we need to bring the believers by name to the Lord and bear their specific burdens practically in prayer. If we love the believers, we need specific prayers for them.</p>
<p>After interceding, we need to contact the believers personally. We will know their true situation by contacting them. We will know their occupation, their family, their financial situation, any marital problems, their children&rsquo;s education, and their spiritual condition. We can be clear concerning others only after we have personal contact with them. Such contact will guide our prayers and deepen our burden. Knowing the believers&rsquo; actual situation is the base for intercession.</p>
<p>A brother may consecrate himself to the Lord but not know what he should do next. If we know his situation, we should pray specifically for him, asking the Lord to lead the brother in a definite way. Some may ask what the definite way should be. A consecrated person should know assuredly that he needs to forsake everything and that he has consecrated his strength, time, and energy to the Lord for His use. This is definite. Some believers make decisions concerning their finances immediately after their consecration. They say to the Lord, &ldquo;From now on, I offer everything in my hand for Your use. Not only so, a portion of my income will be separated wholly unto You.&rdquo; This is a definite way. These believers did not say in a general way, &ldquo;I am a consecrated person.&rdquo; Hence, if someone has consecrated himself but has not yet taken specific action, we need to pray for him and shepherd him in this regard.</p>
<p>A brother may have reached the point where he needs to know his flesh or his peculiar temperament. This requires that we pray for him and bring his situation to the Lord. These are examples. We need to contact the believers and also pray for them. The more contact we have, the more we will pray, and this prayer will cause us to have even more contact. Our contact with the believers should be spontaneous, not rigid. We can find opportunities to contact them before or after a meeting. This method is simple yet effective. The churches usually meet four times per week. If we can contact one person in every meeting, we can contact four people in a week and eight people in two weeks. If we are shepherding eight people, we can contact each person twice in a month. We should be able to have good contact with those whom we are shepherding without needing to visit them.</p>
<p>At times we might need to hold a love feast. If we cannot invite eight people at once, we can invite them in smaller groups. A married brother who has children can invite a couple over for mutual fellowship. Forgive me for saying this, but our love feasts seem to have departed from their original intention. We invite the believers whom we know, but the ones who are in need are seldom invited. This situation needs to be corrected.</p>
<p>If a serving one feels that he is limited and cannot supply the spiritual need, he can invite another brother to assist him. Such coordinated care for the saints will not be burdensome. It is best to keep the food simple for a love feast. Such simple love feasts save labor, money, and time. Then most of our time and strength can be spent on spiritual things, such as fellowship and prayer before or after the meal.</p>
<p>These methods are not unattainable ideals. This is the practice in some local churches. A local church baptized eighty people, and without any arrangements the brothers and sisters spontaneously began to care for two to three new believers. The newly baptized ones were borne by the brothers and sisters. For example, the new ones were baptized on Saturday and invited to love feasts on Tuesday. This is the way to sustain those who are newly baptized. In such a church most of the eighty new believers will still be remaining in half a year. This was not several elders or some so-called full-timers caring for the new believers; the local brothers and sisters bore the burden.</p>
<p>After three months some new believers are able to care for others. They spontaneously bear two or three believers. Therefore, this fire of love spreads quickly. This is the practice of love.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Service for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
