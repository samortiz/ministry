   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>COMPILING TRUTH LESSONS FOR THE SAINTS TO BE EDUCATED IN THE TRUTH TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To help us learn the truth, we have specifically assigned three co-workers to form an editorial group to compile a book called Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We hope to have at least four levels: Level One, Level Two, Level Three, and Level Four, each level being progressively deeper than the previous one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Each level will have forty-eight lessons, sufficient material for a whole year.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Four lessons will be covered every month, and the lessons for every three months will be combined into one volume.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, each volume will contain twelve lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Each level will consist of four volumes one volume for spring, summer, fall, and winter respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, there will be a total of forty-eight lessons in one year.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The contents of Level One, Volume 1, will cover various topics beginning with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lesson 1 will be on the Bible; lesson 2, the Triune God; lesson 3, God's creation; lesson 4, Satan's origin and rebellion; lesson 5, man's fall; and lesson 6, God's promise of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we will go on to cover a key view of the entire Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the key view of the Old Testament, there will be a lesson on the difference between the New Testament and the Old Testament, and then we will go on to the key view of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It will take half a year to finish the first two volumes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then in the second half of the year, there will still be twenty-four more lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They will cover God's salvation, beginning with God's foreknowledge, selection, and predestination; continuing through man's being called, saved, and baptized into and joined to the Triune God; and concluding with man's being forgiven, justified, and sanctified, and how to be saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All these topics will be included in these volumes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This will be the content of the forty-eight lessons in the first year.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should teach the brothers and sisters one lesson after another, and there should be different levels of classes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first level should be one class, the second level, another class, the third level, another class, and the fourth level, another class.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church should make arrangements in this matter without putting pressure on anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For instance, perhaps some saints have been meeting for eighteen years, yet they want to start from the beginning, from elementary school.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If so, they may go to level one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If others want to go a little deeper, then they may go to level three or level four.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should prepare different classrooms so that all the saints can receive the education of the truth according to their own need.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this way all the saints will be able to function.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today the nations are all endeavoring to create employment opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By changing our system we will enable many to become "employed."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Previously in Taipei, there were only twenty-one preachers in twenty-one halls; however, after changing the system, even fifty people will not be enough.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is because for one meeting hall we might need five or six people to teach the lessons; therefore, for twenty-one meeting halls we would need more than one hundred people to be "employed."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The problem, however, is that some of the saints have reacted, saying that they do not know how to speak and to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Concerning this matter, we have considered holding a training and a presentation of teaching methods for the teachers of the truth lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We know that even apprentices in the barbershop need several tries before they can learn successfully.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everything is difficult at the beginning, but if we learn by doing, we will quickly learn to do it well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is a Chinese maxim which says that "the young hold potential for greatness."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I hope that all the young people will rise up and put forth their effort.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If they would do this, the situation would be so tremendous that people may not be able to withstand it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ever since my grandchildren started school, whenever they come home, they like to teach me; they talk about history and science, and my head spins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nonetheless, I am inwardly happy because it is a good sign.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the church has one thousand saints and all of them learn the truth and preach the truth, then the truth will surely prevail.</S>
