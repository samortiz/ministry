   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE TWO SPIRITS JOINED AS ONE Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26a; 2:7; Zech 12:1b; John 3:6; 7:39; 14:17; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Tim 4:22a; Rom 8:2, 16, 4; 1 Thes 5:17,19; Eph 6:18 LIMITED BY OUR NATURAL CONCEPTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we read the Bible, it is easy for us to understand and even experience those things which fit our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If, for example, we read about how our environment perfects us, how tribulations make us patient, we can easily accept such a thought and apply it in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is another matter, however, when we come to the matter of God and man being organically mingled, as in grafting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may feel we understand that we need to live such a grafted life, but when it actually comes down to our everyday experience, the truth is that we have not touched even the border of such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a recent meeting when the saints were sharing their experiences, I noticed that one after another testified that tribulation pressed them to experience the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some felt persecuted at home; others, at work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As I listened, I thought how easy it is to know tribulation, but how hard to know life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yes, tribulation forces us to contact the Lord, but what is the result of contacting the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You may protest that it was I who taught you to accept your circumstances as the arrangement of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is true that I preached a good number of messages telling you that all things work together for good, according to Romans 8:28.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, since 1961 I have been preaching mainly about the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How much of this have you taken in?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The persecution of the environment we can easily comprehend, but the matter of the Spirit eludes us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Consider our previous message on the grafted life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may have been impressed while you were reading it, but before too long, you began to consider in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You remembered learning that in grafting the better branch is grafted to an inferior tree.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why did the message say that the poorer branch is grafted to a good tree?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All your inspiration about the Lord and you being grafted into one life fades away, and your mind continues its thoughts: Romans 11 is talking about the nations being grafted to the nation of Israel; it is not about our being grafted to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By all this activity in your mind, the message is made void.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What Romans 11 says is that the wild olive branch has been grafted to the good olive tree, and that its root is supporting the wild branch.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible is contrary to your thought.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The good branch is not the Lord Jesus grafted into the inferior tree.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In that case, we would be upholding Him, instead of His upholding us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The thought is that we as the inferior branches are grafted into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the true vine, but we as the branches have not grown naturally on His vine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have been grafted into it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 11 primarily refers to the natural Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, Christ is joined to Israel, and He is the true Israel see Isa 49:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All Israelites can become the real Israel by being grafted into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, this olive tree in Romans 11 may also refer to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All true believers among both Jews and Gentiles are grafted to this olive tree, so that it includes Christ and all His believers.</S>
