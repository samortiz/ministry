It is spiritual judgment. The first thing we have to realize is that unless we know how to judge and discern, we will face difficulties and will be easily deceived in our service to the Lord. We need to note a few things related to the matter of judgment.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE PRINCIPLES OF JUDGMENT</h2><p>First, there is a difference between experiences related to the truth and experiences related to the discipline of the Holy Spirit. In speaking with the brothers and sisters, we have to pay attention to the lessons they have learned, whether they are in the line of truth or in the line of discipline from the Holy Spirit. Some are strong in one aspect, while others are strong in the other aspect. Some have learned their lessons mainly through the truth, while others have learned their lessons mainly through the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Learning one's lesson through the truth means that one hears the words and teachings of the Scriptures and practices what he hears accordingly. Some are touched through reading the Scriptures alone. Others are touched through listening to messages. At any rate they are motivated by the words to obey the Lord. The discipline of the Holy Spirit, however, involves one's realization of the Lord's molding hand. Such a person may be disobedient, murmuring, insubordinate, and opinionated. But when the Lord subdues him, he becomes obedient. These lessons are acquired through experiences related to the environment. One kind of obedience results from teaching. The other kind of obedience results from dealings. We have to distinguish the experiences of the brothers and sisters. It is best to have experiences of both kinds; this is the balanced way and the straight course. A worker of the Lord must be experienced in both aspects. When others are too strong or too weak in one of these areas, he immediately will know what to do. Some are ignorant about the discipline of the Holy Spirit; they are altogether hard and unprocessed. Others have never been trained in the truth; they are ignorant of many church truths and many biblical commands.</p><p>Second, there is a difference between outward things and inward things. Some people care only for outward things and are short of inward things. They are acquainted only with truth; they are obedient only in outward things, such as baptism, leaving the denominations, head covering, etc. They have not learned any inward lessons. Others have experienced much discipline from the Holy Spirit. They have passed through many situations and difficulties, yet these are only outward things to them. These experiences remain outside of the persons and have never entered into their very being. We can experience the discipline of the Holy Spirit in an outward way or in an inward way. For example, a sick person outwardly can act as if he has yielded himself to God's discipline. But inwardly his sickness has not resulted in any joy or praise in him. Outwardly, he may say, "I will accept my sickness!" But this is only acquiescence and endurance; there is no inward praise and thanksgiving. Such discipline remains an outward matter. If a man accepts the sickness, endures the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and goes one step further to praise the Lord in his heart, the discipline he experiences will become an inward matter.</p><p>If a man cannot utter any praise or thanksgiving, being obedient only because he sees God's hand heavy upon him, his discipline remains an outward matter. But if he can praise God for the discipline he receives and be filled with joy, God's discipline will achieve its intended goal. When the discipline becomes an inward work, he will no longer want the sickness to go away quickly; he will no longer crave ease and comfort. Instead he will praise and thank God for what He has done, and he will acknowledge that all His works are good. A man may realize that denominations are wrong and leave them, yet denominationalism may not have left him. His love for the brothers has not increased, and he knows nothing about fellowship. When he sees a brother, he may be able to turn his face towards him, embrace, and even kiss him. He may have an outward expression of love yet not have an inward feeling of love. This kind of love is not genuine; it is outward, not inward. The virtues that the Bible speaks of are attributes of what a man is, not what he does. In judging a brother, we have to find out whether his living is in the outward realm or the inward realm. We have to lead the brothers to turn to the inward realm. Sometimes we hear people say, "Brother So-and-so is wonderful." But how wonderful is this brother? Is he wonderful in an inward sense or in an outward sense? The difference here is very great. We have to learn to know whether a person is living in the outward realm or the inward realm.</p><p>Third, there is a difference between being spiritual and mental. Many spiritual things are in man's spirit as well as in his mind. It is not easy to know whether a man is in the spirit or in the mind simply by the words he says or the terms he uses. Two men can use the same words and terms, but their source is different. Many people have never been dealt with in their mind. If a man speaks from his mind, others will only touch his mind. If a man speaks from his spirit, others will touch his spirit. The content of the two speakings is different. If we are trained and experienced in our spirit, we will know whether a man is speaking from his spirit or from his mind as soon as he opens his mouth. If a man's word is from the spirit, we will touch the spirit immediately. If a man's word is from the mind, we will only touch the mind. If spiritual things remain purely in the mind, they will be nothing but theories, and they will not be of any spiritual worth. If a man's spiritual life depends only on mental knowledge, he has nothing but vanity; he does not have any spiritual reality. We should never allow our living to be directed by our mind.</p><p>The discernment of whether one's speaking is from the spirit or the natural mind is one of the most elementary and initial lessons in spiritual judgment. If a man cannot differentiate between the spirit or the natural mind, he does not have the ability to make spiritual judgments. Failure to make such a discernment is a big flaw. Wherever we work, we have to learn to have such a discernment. We should know immediately whether a man's spirit is released or whether his natural mind is released. Words that come from the spirit are entirely different from words that issue from the natural mind. When I was in Shanghai some brothers always remarked, "Brother So-and-so really preaches well. He even preaches the same way as we do." When I went and listened to the preaching myself, I found that the words were all coming from the speaker's natural mind. At other times I would hear reports about wonderful preachings elsewhere. When I checked on those reports, I also touched nothing but the exercise of the natural mind. Some words are from the natural mind, and some words are from the spirit. The nature of the two kinds of words is different. We should not be deceived by the superficial appearance of the word. A young man may think that he can say the same thing an elderly man says and even say it better, but the words from the elderly man come out of his spirit, while the words from the young man come out of his mind. The two are different in nature. If we cannot differentiate between the two, we will be deceived easily. If a man retains God's word merely in his memory and has never learned anything in his spirit, his words may have much content, but his spirit is empty. This speaking is vain. A worker must learn to tell the difference between these two things.</p><p>Fourth, there is a difference between things that issue from the natural life and things that issue from the spiritual life. When we deal with a brother or when we listen to a testimony, we have to exercise our spirit to sense his condition before God. We can jot down on a piece of paper the kind of person he is according to his natural attributes and the kind of person he is spiritually. As soon as he opens his mouth, we can tell whether he is clever, quick, lazy, muddled, impatient, sloppy, humorous, jovial, talkative, naughty, or inaccurate. Every person bears certain characteristics; it is not easy for a man to hide his characteristics. If we have the time, we can write down the characteristics of every person in a notebook. A man cannot hide his self for too long. In the beginning he may be able to bridle himself, but in the end his self will be exposed. Once a man opens his mouth, his characteristics will be manifested. When a man speaks to us, we can ignore his first few words because these words are always spoken under conscious restraint. But after a while, the speaker's self will be fully exposed. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks (Matt. 12:34).</p><p>After we have discerned his natural traits, we can go on to examine his condition before the Lord. Perhaps his temper has been dealt with by the Lord. Or perhaps his speech, attitude, or self-love have been dealt with. Some may have gone through experiences in their environment and may have picked up some lessons with respect to trust for material needs. We will find out what God has done in them in life. From their testimonies, we can tell how much they have learned, how much of God has been constituted into them, and how much God has operated in them. All these are edifications in life. We have to know a person's natural life as well as his spiritual life. We have to observe the kind of person he is in his natural state. We also have to observe how much he has been built up in life. We have to observe how his spirit blends in with his natural characteristics. This last point requires particular skill in discernment. Even those who are able to discern this may not know what prescription to give for its cure. Some people are quick in their mind, yet they have also experienced much discipline from the Spirit. Should this quickness be condemned? The answer depends on whether or not this natural trait frustrates them from a proper Christian walk. We have to learn to exercise our judgment. We have to know men's condition before we can give them the proper guidance.</p><p>Fifth, there is the difference between the spirit and the emotion. We have to know what is of the spirit and what is of the emotion. It is easy to distinguish the spirit from the natural mind, but not as easy to distinguish the spirit from the emotion. It is hard to tell at which point a man's spirit is released and at which point his emotion is released. Difficult as this is, we have to learn the distinction. Some speak according to their spirit, while others speak according to their emotion. Like the soul, the spirit also has knowledge and feelings. The knowledge of the spirit, however, is different from the knowledge of the natural mind. If a man's knowledge comes from his natural mind, others will sense nothing of his spirit. If his knowledge comes from his spirit, it will strike a response in others. They will be able to say "amen" and will feel an inner peace. If a man speaks according to his natural mind, his words may be right, but others will not have a pleasant reaction. If a man speaks from his spirit, his words will always bring comfort and joy to others. His spirit will be released, and others' spirits will respond. However, it is not easy to know those who speak according to their emotion. When a man's spirit is released, it is released through and with the emotion. This is the reason it is hard to tell whether a person is speaking by his emotion or whether his spirit is speaking through the emotion. When the spirit of some people is released with their thoughts, the audience is conscious only of the spirit, not the mind. However, when a man releases his spirit with his emotion, others will touch a combination of both. They will sense a mixture of the spirit with the emotion. They will sense the presence of the spirit, but they will also sense the presence of the emotion. Therefore, it is hard to separate the spirit from the emotion. It is very easy for us to confuse the emotion with the spirit.</p><p>How can we differentiate between the spirit and the emotion? It is not easy to explain this process, but I will try. I may not be able to do a good job. Please bear with me. When a man's spirit is released, it is released with his emotion. If his emotion and spirit are in harmony with each other, the release of the spirit will strike a response in us, and we will sense that this release is pure, gentle, and firm. But when a man's spirit is released through his emotion and the two are not in harmony with each other, the result will be an intrusion of the emotion; others will not sense his spirit. His emotion will contaminate his spirit and defile it. When there is only the release of the emotion, without the release of the spirit, this release will be a kind of defilement. Whenever we have such a sense of defilement, it means that the spirit and emotion are not in harmony. When the two are in harmony, we will respond with joy and an "amen." If there is only the release of the emotion without the spirit, we feel defiled and wronged; there is an inward rejection of such intrusion. We have to give special attention to the discernment of this matter.</p><h2 class="head1">BASIC QUALIFICATIONS FOR JUDGING OTHERS</h2><p>Let me speak of another matter. In judging others, there is a basic qualification&mdash;we first must be judged thoroughly by God. I cannot pass on a method of judging others to you. The only thing I can say is that our knowledge of others is based on our knowledge of ourselves. If we do not know ourselves, we cannot know others. If we are thoroughly judged by God, we will easily know the brothers and sisters when we see them. When a man's spirit is released, we immediately will know whether his spirit is right or wrong. We must learn the lesson ourselves, and we must pass through the judgment personally. When we have had the inward experience, we will be able to detect that sickness when others are in similar predicaments. If we circumvent a lesson, we will be insensitive to the same thing when others fall into its snare; we will easily excuse them. But if we have been deeply touched by God in that matter, we will be alarmed as soon as it surfaces in others. Hence, the basis of our knowledge of men is the kind of judgments we have experienced ourselves. The more we know ourselves, the more we will know the brothers and sisters. If we have never been judged ourselves, we will not be able to do anything even if we apply all the methods of judgment to others. We can never lead others through something we have never experienced ourselves. If we have passed through enough dealings ourselves, we will be able to identify the trouble spots in others as soon as they appear. We will know exactly where their problem lies. Since we have gone down the same road, we will know what to do.</p><p>We should seek to experience more dealings. The more experience we have, the more we will know the brothers and sisters. Otherwise, we will be in the dark even when our brothers and sisters are in error. We have to be dealt with by the Holy Spirit in all things great or small. Whatever we have passed through ourselves will be easily picked up by our discernment when others experience the same thing. All men are alike. They are all similar in temperament, nature, and likes. There is not much novelty in the way men commit errors and sin. Everyone is a descendant of Adam and knows all the "tricks" that came with Adam. Once we are enlightened to know ourselves, we will know almost everyone in the whole world. Please remember that every descendant of Adam has the full range of Adamic attributes within him. If we are experienced in discerning ourselves, it will be easy for us to diagnose others. Do not think that we can know men simply by acquiring certain skills. We must learn the lessons ourselves before the methods will become meaningful to us. How useful we are to others depends on how much dealing we have received from the Lord ourselves. Every area that we have circumvented will be an area that we cannot touch in others. We should not be so foolish as to think that we can run away from this "school." If we run away, we will forfeit our spiritual usefulness.</p><p>What is ministry? Ministry is learning some lessons before the Lord and then ministering them to others. If we have not learned anything, we will not have anything to minister to others. All of our environments, arrangements, and disciplines are for equipping us for the ministry. The discipline of the Holy Spirit always increases the riches of the ministry. If we experience little, we can render little help to others. If we experience much suffering and discipline, we will be able to bear much burden, and we will lead others into rich experiences. The scope of our ministry is dictated by the amount of discipline we have received from the Holy Spirit. If we have not learned much, we will only be able to speak to the brothers and sisters in a frivolous way. Our words will not hit home; they will not be sharp and pointed enough to produce any result. If we have learned the lesson ourselves, we will know if others have passed the test. They will not be able to cheat us. In preaching the gospel we will know whether others are saved; they will not be able to cheat us in the matter of salvation. But the same can be said of deeper spiritual experiences. Everything depends on the amount of lessons and experiences we have learned. Those who learn more will know others more. They will know what is wrong with a brother as soon as they contact him. In order to fulfill our ministry of serving the Lord, I beg all of us to place ourselves in God's hand willingly and unreservedly and to receive the discipline of the Holy Spirit. If we are not inwardly built up, we cannot perform any outward work. God does everything within man. He does not work on man's mind alone. We cannot become preachers merely by studying the Bible for two or three years. It would be easy for the Lord to charge His disciples to recite His sermons, but He did not do this. Instead He gave them some practical training.</p><p>We want to know men for the purpose of ministering to them. We are not here to satisfy our curiosity. Our purpose is to build, not to destroy. We have no time to mind others' business. We seek to know men for the purpose of meeting their needs only. In order to become a useful vessel, we have to commit ourselves unconditionally, unreservedly, and willingly to the Lord's hand. We have to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The more we accept, the more useful we will become. Every discipline we receive will increase our capacity and usefulness a little. We must not only seek to teach doctrines. We have to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Only then will we be able to lead others into spiritual riches.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class="title">SPIRITUAL JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="title">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 30, 1948</h1><p>In the last chapter we saw the importance of judgment. In this chapter we will consider the importance of exercising our spiritual senses. In contacting others, we have to give them a chance to speak, and we have to learn to discern with our spirit. If a man does not open his mouth, it is hard to know him. It is rare that one can know others without first listening to them. Perhaps he can get an idea of the general nature of their spirit, but he will not be able to comprehend anything with understanding. Sometimes we know a person's spirit is wrong, but we cannot say how it is wrong. In The Character of the Lord's Worker, we pointed out that a worker must learn to listen; he must develop a habit before the Lord of listening to others. Even when others are pretending or drifting aimlessly, he still has to listen. If he does not develop a habit of listening to others, he cuts off all means of knowing them. We can know others only through listening to their words. We cannot force them to open their mouth, but once they do, God will provide us the opportunity to know them. The more talkative a person is, the easier it is to know him.</p><p>When others speak, we have to touch their spirit with our spirit. In the last chapter we spoke of five principles in judgment. Based on these five principles, we have to sense and know men by our spirit. A man's spirit is expressed through his speaking. His speaking can never hide his spirit. As soon as he opens his mouth, his spirit comes out. When a man speaks, we have to listen to him on the one hand and touch him with our spirit on the other hand. The way a man speaks tells us about his spirit, and a man's spirit tells us what kind of person he is. This is a fact. Therefore, when others speak, our spirit must be unoccupied, open, and pliable so that we can have a proper impression of others. In listening to others and in touching their spirit with our spirit, we have to pay attention to a few conditions.</p><h2 class="head1">SEVEN CONDITIONS OF MAN</h2><h2 class="head2">A Proper Spirit</h2><p>When we listen to others and try to sense their spirit, we first have to find out whether or not they have a proper spirit. If our spirit is open, we will easily form an impression of them. Based on this impression, we will know within whether or not their spirit is proper. Some people are proper in words and wrong in motive. Some people are full of love in their speaking yet full of hatred in their spirit. Some people talk about gentleness with their mouth yet demonstrate nothing but stubbornness in their spirit. A man's motive can be different from his words, yet his spirit will always become manifest when his words are released. Please remember that the Lord said, "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" (Matt. 12:34). A man's words cannot be bridled by his will absolutely; sooner or later they will betray his spirit. A man's own words will always betray his true condition. His words cannot hide his spirit. Sooner or later his "speech" will betray him. A Galilean can hide his identity if he does not open his mouth. But as soon as he opens his mouth, his speech will betray him, and others will recognize him (Mark 14:70). A man cannot suppress and lock up his spirit forever. Some are proud, jealous, or bitter at heart. Their spirit is abnormal. We should not listen just to their words and overlook their spirit. We should not believe the things they say during those moments when their will is in control. The words that they utter when their will is in control do not represent the true picture; they do not represent their very person. Only their spirit can represent their very person. This is very basic knowledge. The real condition of a man is the condition that is expressed when his spirit is released; it is not judged by the words he says when his will is in control. Many people are often deceived because they cannot distinguish words from the spirit. No matter what others say about a man's motive, we have to check his spirit. Absalom was right in the things he said, but his spirit was wrong. His spirit was a rebellious spirit. We have to learn to touch others' spirit. This is the only way to know men, and this is the only way to test the trustworthiness of their word.</p><h2 class="head2">Man's Strong Spot</h2><p>When a man opens his mouth, his spirit is exposed; others will know whether or not he has a right spirit. When the spirit is exposed, the inner condition of a man is also exposed. In listening to someone, the first thing we have to find is his strong spot. We have to ask, "What kind of impression do I have of this man? What part of him is the strongest?" If our spirit is open and pliable before the Lord, it will be sensitive and will detect any conspicuous spots. Once a man opens his mouth, his spirit is exposed. In fact, his whole person is exposed. Those who are strong in their mind will touch others with their mind. Those who are subjective and stubborn will expose their stubbornness as soon as they open their mouth; they immediately will give others this impression. James 3:17 speaks of those who are peaceable and forbearing. It is easy to ask such ones to do something. But others will not yield even when others plead with them for hours. It is hard to ask a subjective and strong-willed person for anything. Then there are those who are very strong in their emotion. Others can sense this as well. A person who is strong in his emotion is easily influenced by others. When he speaks about love, he is not necessarily speaking about what is truly love. If our spirit is pure and meek, we will easily touch others' conspicuous spots. These conspicuous spots are actually the trouble spots; they are the areas that need to be dealt with. We must not only touch others' spirit with our spirit, but we must touch the conspicuous spots with our spirit. We have to know the kind of people with whom we are dealing.</p><h2 class="head2">A Closed Spirit</h2><p>Generally speaking, when we speak to a brother, we can touch his spirit. But sometimes a man's spirit will not come out. We may speak to him for a long time, but we cannot sense his spirit. His real person is hidden, and we do not know what is happening within him. His real person is so deeply hidden that we cannot tell his true condition. Such a one has great problems. God's children should be very approachable. We should live according to the principle of "amen." When a person does something or says something, our inner being should be able to respond with an "amen." This is right. But some people are always hidden behind or within their outer man; they cannot produce an "amen" in others. They are very secretive. No one knows them, and they have fellowship with no one. This is a dangerous position to be in. These ones are so individualistic that others cannot touch their genuine person. As a result they are cut off from the fellowship of the Body. Christians should be deep, but at the same time, they have to be genuine in their expression. They have to allow others to touch their spirit. Those who do not allow others to touch their spirit are cut off from the fellowship. They have not learned the proper lessons of the Body and know nothing about fellowship. Some people have been Christians for eight or ten years, yet others cannot touch their spirit at all. Their spirit is a closed spirit. We have to test whether a man's spirit can be touched by others. If it cannot be touched, something is wrong with that person. In the world, a person can be as subtle as possible. Christians, however, should not be this way; their spirit should be open and free to fellowship with others.</p><h2 class="head2">An Abnormal Person</h2><p>When a person speaks, we should listen carefully. The words may tell us whether the speaker has a strong spirit, a conspicuous mind, or a subjective disposition. Although some are particularly strong in some areas, on the whole they still may be proper persons. Some are particularly strong in their emotion. This is not uncommon. However, there are those who are not only exceptionally strong in their mind and emotion but different to the point of being abnormal. When we contact such ones, we cannot deal with them according to ordinary means. They are distorted, peculiar, and extreme in their mentality. Their psychology is different from that of ordinary men. They are warped. Such ones are not few in number. Among a hundred persons, one always can find a few who are altogether abnormal. Their thoughts and behavior are completely different from ordinary men, and their will is always at odds with others. Such ones become a problem to others. They cannot be tackled in the usual way. They must be dealt with severely by special means. The very constitution of their being is warped. If we employ ordinary means and try to exhort them twenty times, they will come back and disappoint us twenty times. They are set in their character already. Our eyes should be opened to such odd personalities.</p><h2 class="head2">Pretension</h2><p>In judging a man, we have to know whether there is any kind of pretension in him. It is difficult for a pretentious person to grow in the Lord. He needs to experience a double breaking from the Lord. An ordinary man has the flesh within him. A pretentious man not only is corrupted in the flesh but also has a false fa&#231;ade. An ordinary man only needs to deal with his flesh. A pretentious man needs to deal not only with his flesh but with his pretentious shell as well, including his false goodness, false godliness, false humility, false meekness, or scholarly fa&#231;ade. It takes twice as much effort to deliver such a one out of his condition. God must first break down his pretension, performance, unnaturalness, and untruthfulness before He can break down his flesh. When we contact a brother, we have to know whether he is acting naturally or pretentiously. We have to know whether he has a fa&#231;ade around him or whether he has been dealt with by God. We have to identify any hypocrisy in him. He may smile in front of us, but this smile may not be genuine; it may only be an outward fa&#231;ade. Some are very attractive in the way they speak and act, but as soon as an experienced brother spends a little time with them, their fallen state is exposed. If we desire to walk properly as a child of God, we have to learn to identify pretension. Some of us are deceived in this matter because we are pretentious and dishonest ourselves. If we want to deal with others in this area, we must first learn to judge all of our own falsehood. Everything consisting of just outward performance, being void of an inward reality of the heart, must be removed completely. Once we have dealt with all of our own pretensions, our spirit will become very sensitive and pure, and we will detect falsehood in others immediately. Once falsehood is detected, our spirit will react; it will feel uneasy or even angry because it has been defiled.</p><h2 class="head2">The Condition of the Spirit</h2><p>When our spirit reaches out to touch others, we have to be as sensitive as possible. We have to touch the condition of others' spirit. Some are a little shy and afraid to expose themselves. If our spirit is clean, we will feel this shyness. When we talk with such ones, we can encourage them a little. Some spirits are wounded&mdash;perhaps these ones have had family problems or have received unjust treatment or harsh words from others. Once we identify their condition, we have to know how we can best help them. We may have to apply wine or oil to their wound. We have to be certain of our help. With some, we have to inflict some additional hurt to their wound because this is the only way they will receive any benefit. Others may die as soon as we add anything to their wound. Some wounds are only skin deep, and we should hit such ones harder. In dealing with men, we have to be certain of what we are doing. Some people need oil; others need wine. Still others need to be stripped of these things instead. Some should be comforted with the Lord's word. Others should be rebuked with severe admonishment. Some spirits are apparently asleep and must be awakened. We must first know the true condition of a person. Then we should deal with him either harshly or lightly. Some spirits are dozing; others are pressed or squelched. Some people are very indifferent to spiritual things. The condition of men varies. In order to deal with men, we have to know the condition of their spirit and the cause of their condition. These things must be clear to us; we must not be ignorant of them. As workers, we should always be objective. We should always know men's spirit. Some try to render help to others with their natural mind and mental knowledge. This help has no spiritual value whatsoever. It is useless to learn a speech and pass it on to others. We must first go through the dealings ourselves before we can render help to others.</p><h2 class="head2">An Unidentifiable Spirit</h2><p>The above six conditions are more common in the course of our dealing with people. In addition to these six, there is another phenomenon: Some spirits are unidentifiable; they are murky. We cannot identify the source of the problem. When we listen to their words or testimony, we know that they are sick, but we do not know what they are sick of. This phenomenon sometimes presents itself to the brothers who are quite knowledgeable in the matter of spiritual judgment. Some people simply do not fit into any category; we cannot pinpoint the source of their problem. We think that they are sick, they appear to be sick, and yet they act as if they are not sick. In most cases this condition points to the presence of unnamed or hidden sin. It may even point to something more serious than sin, like works of the devil or attacks from Satan. Sometimes a person sins accidentally, and the devil seizes the opportunity and works within him. Experienced ones should be able to detect such special conditions. We have to learn to exercise our spirit to sense this subtle malady. If we are able to identify these seven conditions in the brothers and sisters during our contact with them, we can pinpoint most of their problems. This word applies only to those who are experienced in this work.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO JUDGE WITH THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Let us turn our attention now to a basic question: How do we touch others' spirit with our spirit, and how do we judge men with our spirit? In order for us to be able to judge men, our outer man must be broken. There is no shortcut in this matter. We must be dealt with by God. We must learn the lessons. Our outer man must be broken. When this happens, our spirit will become useful. If the outer man is not broken, the spirit cannot become useful. Our spirit is not useful when it is surrounded and affected by the outer man. When the outer man is too strong, the spirit cannot be released. Our spirit can be bound by either the mind, emotion, or will. God's children have imprisoned their spirits because their outer man is too strong. This is the reason the outer shell must be broken. The spirit will be released only when the outer shell is broken. Something stands between us and other men&mdash;our outer man. In order for our spirit to touch others' spirits, the outer man must be broken. Only then will we know others' spirits. A grain of wheat must be broken before the life within can be released. If we are not broken, our spirit cannot become useful; we will lack the basic organ for diagnosing men. All spirits are similar in nature, and it should be an easy task for a person to release his spirit and to render help to others. But our spirit can be in close fellowship with others' spirits only when the outer man is broken, and we can be in close fellowship with God only to the extent that the outer man is broken. Only those whose outer man has been broken can exercise their spirit to sense and judge others.</p><p>The first thing we should do as we listen to others is to exercise our spirit. During the course of listening to the conversation of the brothers and sisters, our whole being should be calm. (This does not mean that we should be passive.) Every faculty of our being should be in high alert, listening attentively to what is being said. The first thing we should exercise is our spirit, not our mind. Our mind should only be considered as a supplementary organ. If our spirit is clean, meek, and pliable, their words will touch our spirit. Our spirit will receive an impression from their spirit. We will know whether their spirit is defiled or clean, hard or soft. Our spirit will sense any subjectivity, emotion, or thoughts in others. In contacting others, our spirit must be absolutely calm, gentle, and pure before we can touch their spirit. We should not try conjecturing with our mind; we should try to touch others with our spirit. This is a more certain way of knowing a person than listening to a report about him for two hours. This is the spiritual way. We have to humble ourselves and learn this way slowly. In time we will learn our lessons well. I do not expect us to finish our learning within a short time. We have to spend at least three to five years on this. Our natural mind is not the chief means of knowing men. We put no trust in human mentality. If we think we can work with our natural mind alone, we are very far from the truth. We have to learn, and we have to observe the brothers and sisters. When we do this, we will realize that many brothers and sisters are on the wrong track. This learning is not for the purpose of increasing our own knowledge. It is not for finding fault or criticizing. It is for the purpose of edifying, helping, and ministering to others. It is not for tearing others down or for finding faults in others. If we know how to exercise our spirit and if we increasingly contact others in the spirit, we will render them much help.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class="title">SPIRITUAL JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(3)</h1><h1 class="title">THE BASIS OF DIAGNOSIS AND JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:October 1, 1948</h1><p>We have seen the principles of judging men and also discussed the ways to identify and touch men's condition with our spirit. We also realize that there is a need for us to go through dealings before the Lord. In this chapter we will consider two additional matters.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BASIS OF DIAGNOSIS</h2><p>When we try to touch others' condition with our spirit, we may touch their words and spirit. But this does not mean that we can diagnose their problem or even heal their sickness. It is one thing to touch others' spirit and another thing to diagnose it. Touching others' spirit merely enables us to know the condition of their spirit. After we have touched others' spirit, how should we interpret the condition we have touched? Is the spirit we have touched proper? How do we know whether it is or not? After we have touched others' words and touched the spirit behind the words, how should we diagnose the data? This is not a simple task. We must have broad and adequate training before we can know others' sicknesses. For example, a brother may speak to us, and we may sense that he has such a quick temper. If we are not trained adequately, we do not know the reason he has such a temper. An experienced person can tell us that temper comes from pride. A man has a temper because he cannot stand other people ignoring his words. Or he may have very little tolerance for uncomplimentary words. He may also look down on others. We can trace the problem back to his pride. He has a temper because he is inwardly filled with pride. Many people, however, do not realize that temper is merely a symptom; it is not the cause of the sickness. If we realize that temper is merely a symptom, we will search for its cause. But if we are not properly trained, we will not be able to find the root cause. A fever is not the cause of a sickness but a symptom. It is not enough for us to know that someone has a fever; we have to find the cause of the fever before he can be healed.</p><p>Touching others' spirit with our spirit is like measuring body temperature with a thermometer. However, we also must find the cause of the sickness. If we cannot find the reason a man has a temper, we cannot deal with him. It is useless to exhort a man with a temper to be patient. He will always lose his temper. We have to find the reason for his temper. We have to learn the lesson ourselves. We have to find the reason we lose our own temper. If we are clear about ourselves, we can apply our diagnosis to others. Diagnosis is one step towards a cure, and the actual healing is another step. In judging a man, first we have to feel him with our spirit; second, we have to discern him with our spirit; third, we have to diagnose the cause of the sickness; and fourth, we have to render the healing. As we continually practice this on ourselves as well as on others, we will find that pride and subjectivity both lead to temper. Some people lose their temper when their subjective views cannot be accepted. Others lose their temper when their great aspirations fail them or they become frustrated.</p><p>We have to learn to make observations all the time. Brother Sparks once said, "Be observant." In helping others we have to find the root of the sickness so that they can go to the Lord to be dealt with. In order to render others proper help, we have to have the right words to describe the symptoms as well as the cause of the sickness. We have to pray over every case that is presented to us, and we have to examine our brothers and sisters. In the matter of crying, for example, one sister may cry easily, while another one may not cry at all. Our spirit may sense this condition, but we may not know how to diagnose it. What should we do? We have to learn that crying and not crying are both symptoms. We have to find the reason for the crying. Which is right, crying or not crying? Should we advise a sister to cry or not to cry? With some, crying is wrong, and we should tell them not to cry. With others, crying is right, and we should advise them to cry. It all depends on the cause. We should find the cause in ourselves first. We often are our own best teacher. We can ask ourselves, "When do I cry? Why do I cry?" Simply put, there are two reasons for crying. The first is self-love. One loves himself, pities himself, and will not let go of himself. He may think in his heart, "I am such a nice person, yet I suffer these things." The more he thinks about it, the more he feels sorry for himself, and he cries. He cannot bear seeing himself suffer so much. His experience stirs up his self-pity, and he cries. A man's self-love often is asleep until some experiences stir up his self-love. The first reason for crying is self-love. The second reason for crying is that a man is smitten by God. A person may be unbending, hard, indifferent, and unyielding. It is difficult for him to cry or to smile. But after he goes through repeated trials and God's hand deals heavily with him, he is subdued. He then cries because he has been weakened by God. This is the second reason for crying. There are at least two reasons for crying. When someone cries, we can compare these reasons with the case in hand, and we can identify the source of the crying. Crying is not necessarily right, but those who are smitten by God can surely cry. Crying is not necessarily good, but if a man has never cried, he has never been subdued by God. If a man says, "I have never cried," we immediately know that he is a hard person.</p><p>Some people are very stubborn before God. They have suffered many trials and have experienced much chastisement from God. Nevertheless, they have not learned any spiritual lessons or acquired any spiritual knowledge. Others become very sensitive through much suffering. Nevertheless, they have not learned any spiritual lessons either. Those who have passed through many trials and experienced much discipline from the Holy Spirit should have learned many lessons. Yet both of these kinds of people have not learned anything. One group is hard, the other group is soft, and both have gone through many trials. Why has neither group learned any spiritual lessons? We have to find the reason for this. We must not only know the symptoms but must find the root of the illness. As soon as a man becomes hardened before God, his trials will not produce any spiritual effect or bring in any spiritual blessing. Instead, they only will remain painful experiences. In the process of making pottery, a potter discards some vessels because they are ruined and spoiled in the turning process. Some people are like the ruined vessels. They have argued with God and murmured against His dealings. They have not submitted to His discipline. They think that it is wrong for others to ride over their heads (Psa. 66:12). They want God to let them ride over others' heads instead. They are discouraged by the discipline they have suffered. They think that they are misunderstood, that God's way is wrong, and that they are right. They have never submitted themselves to God's discipline. They have never learned to thank and praise. Because of the hardness of their heart, they have not learned any lessons at all. Others, however, appear to be very sensitive. They also have suffered many trials and experienced the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Yet they have not learned any spiritual lessons or acquired any spiritual knowledge either. The discipline of the Holy Spirit has not produced any effect on them because they are short of the supply of the ministry of the word.</p><p>We have to learn to know men's condition, and we have to learn to diagnose their condition. It is not enough to know that a man has a temperature of forty degrees Celsius. We have to know the reason for his fever. We cannot say that a man has a fever because he is generally weak. We have to make observations. We have to be like a doctor who studies diligently for three to five years before daring to practice his trade. We must be meek and open before the Lord. We have to confess our mistakes and acknowledge our own untrustworthiness all the time. If we practice this again and again, we will not only become sensitive in our spirit, but we will be able to discern the symptoms and causes of sicknesses in the brothers and be able to render them healing as well. We have asked the trainees here on the mountain to each give their testimony. This not only touches the spiritual condition of each trainee but opens the way for diagnosis and healing. I hope we all will learn many lessons from this exercise in judgment.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BASIS OF JUDGMENT&mdash;LOVING THE BROTHERS</h2><p>There is one basic condition for knowing men's problems or diagnosing their illnesses: We must understand that the purpose of our discernment and judgment is not for checking others out. A proper Christian should not desire to know about others. Only abnormal Christians would want to pry into others' business. Although we need to know the condition of the brothers, we are not motivated by curiosity. We should not be curious about their affairs. We are forced to do this. Other than for the purpose of serving and helping them, we should not want to know much about others. We are busy enough ourselves. We have no time to pry into the affairs of others. If a man always tries to know about others and pries into their business, he is a big problem in himself; he is the first one who needs healing. What we have learned on this mountain is for the purpose of ministering Christ to others. We are not here to criticize or to find fault. We try to know men for the purpose of serving and helping them. If I know that the Lord has put a certain brother into my hand, it is because He wants me to know him and help him. This is the reason I am doing what I am doing. Unless the Holy Spirit has arranged this contact, I do not want to know about anything concerning my brother. I hope that none of you will have a craving for knowing others' business. I do not wish for anyone to examine the affairs of others and to turn them into conversation pieces. We should not take up anyone's burden lightly. We must not have any intention in knowing men other than for the purpose of helping them.</p><p>Communication among God's children is based on love, not on knowledge. We should not communicate with our brothers and sisters according to knowledge. Instead, we should fellowship according to love. The basis of Christian fellowship is always love, never knowledge. The world seeks like-minded people in its fellowship. But our fellowship is based on our love for the brothers. We love one another. If our fellowship were based on our knowledge, it would be difficult for us to be Christians at all. God has not communicated with us according to His knowledge of us. If we communicate with the brothers and sisters according to our knowledge of them, the Lord will not entrust us with the knowledge of our brothers and sisters. The more we know about men, the harder it will be for us to be a Christian. If we try to know others according to knowledge, we will shake our head about everyone. We will shake our head about this brother and that brother. In the end, I am afraid that we would not be able to fellowship with anyone, and we would even shake our head about ourselves. Our communication and fellowship with the brothers can only be built on the foundation of brotherly love.</p><p>We know the brothers for the sake of rendering help and service to them. We try to know the condition of a person only as we work on them. Our love for the brothers must be separated from our knowledge of the brothers. God can only commit Himself to those servants who are able to separate love from knowledge and who can deal with people accordingly. Those who cannot separate these two things are not qualified to be a servant of God. I should speak a word of advance warning. If we mix these two matters together, we have to take responsibility for the mixture. There should even be a distinction between love and knowledge in the way we deal with our sons. A father must know what problems his son has, but no father will lose his love for his son just because he has gained knowledge of his troubles. The communication between the father and the son is based on love. Love is "foolish." The father's knowledge of his son cannot influence his love towards him. We cannot love our brothers less than we love our son. In fellowshipping with our brothers, we have to act as if we are completely ignorant of their mistakes. This is to fellowship by love. We love the brothers, and our fellowship with them can only be in love, not by knowledge. We should act as if we do not know anything about our brothers' problems. Our communication with the brothers and sisters must always be based on love.</p><p>Let us take another illustration from God's Word. The way the Lord Jesus dealt with Judas is a good example. Judas was a thief; he always stole money from the purse. He was a greedy man. If the Lord dealt with the twelve disciples according to knowledge, He surely would not have asked Judas to keep the money. The Lord was not ignorant of Judas's stealing, yet He still asked him to take charge of the money. He dealt with Judas just as He dealt with the other disciples. During the three years of His ministry, the Lord did not indicate in any way that He knew Judas was a thief. Even on the day of Judas's betrayal, He did not expose him. Up until the time when they last broke bread together, the disciples did not find anything unusual about Judas. The Lord's relationship with the twelve disciples before the cross was not a relationship of the Head with the church. While He was on earth, the Lord was managing the Father's possessions in the capacity of the Son (Heb. 3:6). The disciples were the Father's possessions; they were not the Father's sons. The Lord did not know them as sons but as possessions. This knowledge was outward. The disciples' relationship with the Lord was not one of the Body with the Head. They were not members of the church relating to the Head of the church. The Lord seemingly tolerated Judas because as the Son, the Lord managed and administered God's household according to outward rule. This is the reason He never exposed Judas's stealing. If we judged this according to our knowledge, we would call this a political, not a Christian, move. A man in the world becomes wise and experienced when he reaches fifty; he no longer does anything foolish. He becomes shrewd and cunning. He never falls prey to anything. But this is the way of the world. No Christian should become shrewd and cunning through the knowledge he has gained of other men. If we deal with the brothers and sisters according to knowledge, we can spare ourselves many crosses and headaches by relying on our shrewdness. Today our knowledge about the brothers and sisters is limited. After a few years, this knowledge will increase. Then we will know the brothers as soon as we talk with them, and it will be hard for us to love them. Yet this should not happen among us. If we deal with the brothers according to knowledge, we will become shrewd and cunning. This is not growth, but degradation.</p><p>We must keep ourselves in the love of God. The Lord gives us knowledge of the brothers for the purpose of ministry. Those in the world cannot love after they have been fooled by others. They become afraid. But Christians should not be this way. Among Christians, love is at the very top. Love reigns. We should never become clever by gaining knowledge of the brothers and sisters. If we know men merely to avoid being fooled by them, our knowledge will only make us clever men. If this is the meaning of being clever, then our Lord was the most foolish man. Judas's stealing was a chance to manifest the Lord's glory and greatness. Men's eyes usually are blinded when others steal from them. But the Lord's eyes were open when others stole from Him. The commandment that the Lord received from the Father was that Judas should keep the money. If the Lord had asked Peter to keep the money, the money might have been spent quickly. If He had asked Matthew to keep the money, there might not have been enough to pay the food bill. Others could have stolen more. Judas could have complained that the loss could have been greater had the money been entrusted to others. One tends to accuse others of doing the same thing that he is guilty of. If someone else had been entrusted with the money, the purse might have been more tightly controlled, but the mouths would not have been controlled. At a minimum Judas would have opened his mouth to criticize. The Lord asked Judas to keep the money. Although he stole some of it, he kept it secret. The most that occurred was that money was stolen. If others had been given charge of the money, more problems could have arisen.</p><p>May God give us a greater love for the brothers. We have to pray that God would make our love for the brothers greater than our knowledge of them. May our love for the brothers transcend everything. May our cleverness not affect our love for the brothers. May we know men for the purpose of helping them, not for the purpose of avoiding trouble on our part. We ask God to fill our hearts with love for the brothers. We should act as if we do not know anything about their problems. This is something that belongs to another world. The more we know the brothers, the narrower our pathway becomes. We should not be afraid of being taken advantage of or suffering loss. We should allow love to transcend everything, and brotherly love is the only way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">SPIRITUAL JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(4)</h1><h1 class="title">HEALING</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:October 2, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">HOW TO CURE</h2><p>After we have studied the condition of the brothers and sisters and have discovered their problems, we can start to diagnose their situation. We can begin talking to them and leading them on the way to deliverance and healing. It is easy to speak about this process, but when we are confronted with practical problems, we have to be able to open others' eyes. In order for others to experience deliverance, we must have the adequate experience ourselves. Furthermore, we must be able to relate this experience clearly and thoroughly to others so that they will receive the help, light, and deliverance. We are frustrated in rendering help to others because we are short in experience and short in utterance. If both our experience and utterance are adequate, others will see the light. A few years ago, I was not able to render help to a brother because my own experience was short. He was strong-willed, arrogant, and quick-tempered. Many people have a quick temper, but they are not arrogant. This brother was strong-willed as well as quick-tempered. It was not easy to deal with him. Having a strong will is not disastrous when it is coupled with a well-tempered emotion. In such a case the problem is confined to the person himself; when he loses his temper, he only has to confess his sins. But if a person has a strong will that is coupled with an impulsive emotion and extreme subjectivity, he will be driven to act by impulse. He also will insist on his impulse without any thought of repentance whatsoever. This combination of traits is a great problem. Some people only have one problem. Others have two or three which affect each other and complicate the issue. In pathology, when two diseases in a person do not affect each another, a cure to both is simple. But if they affect each other, they are harder to heal, and the sickness can become more serious. The same can be said of human nature. We have to understand the interaction of different dispositions within a person. A person who is strong in his will and also arrogant and quick-tempered requires strong and severe dealings.</p><p>After we know the condition of a brother, there are two ways to help him.</p><h2 class="head2">Exhortation</h2><p>The first way to help a brother is by exhortation. We should point out the way of deliverance to him. Some people have never seen any light. They are blind to themselves all the time, and no one has ever said an honest word to them. As we talk to them, we should tell them what we have seen. We have to tell them our experience and let them know that they should experience the dealings and the discipline of the Holy Spirit. We have to show them that their pathway is not a straight one, that they are living by the mind and the emotion, and that their spirit is not strong. In addition, their rejection of the discipline of the Holy Spirit in many areas has resulted in their many problems with God. If the light we render is clear, we will be able to save them out of their condition. We cannot be unclear in ourselves. Light always brings in deliverance as well as liberation. We have to point out that they have not accepted the discipline of the Holy Spirit in this and that matter. Our word of exhortation has to be very positive. It cannot be general, and it must be very accurate. We should point out a few things to them to prove our point. Committing accidental mistakes is not a frequent occurrence for a person. Most of the time we commit dispositional and temperamental mistakes. Those who are slow are always slow. Those who are quick are always quick. Dispositional or temperamental mistakes relate to the person. We are here to help others correct their dispositional or temperamental mistakes, not their accidental mistakes.</p><p>Our help to others should not be general. It has to be very specific, and it must follow a definite order. First, we must make note of the facts. We should have a notebook in which we write down the mistakes of others. For example, a brother may speak inaccurately habitually. The first time we hear him we should write down what he said and where he said it. If it is a dispositional mistake, he will surely repeat the same mistake. We should write down such occurrences again and again. After ten or twenty times, perhaps we will be convinced that his mistake is a dispositional one. When the opportunity arises at the proper time, we should point out to him that his words are not accurate. Second, we have to be strengthened in our inner being. We need to build up ourselves in God before we can have the strength to help others. As the entries in our notebook increase, the strength in our inner being should also increase. Our inward condition must grow sharper, higher, and stronger. We have to wait until our inward condition is strong enough before we can extend help to others. A brother may lie once, twice, or many times. Every time we catch him lying we should write down the occasion. As his mistakes increase, the pressure within us to help him should also increase. At a certain point we will be ready to deal with him. Third, we have to wait for a suitable time to speak to him. As time goes on, the burden within us will increase. When the indignation reaches a certain level, we should pray for God to open up an opportunity to speak to him. As we speak to him, we should note the following: 1) We should say to him, "I need to say a few words to you. You do not have to answer me. The words may be right or they may be wrong. But you should take my words and consider them before the Lord." Do not give him a chance to speak. 2) We should continue, saying, "These words are for your own good. I have no desire to meddle with your affairs. I do not interfere with others' business. I am doing this to help you." 3) We can also add, "I say this without any personal motive of my own." We should then point out examples of his lying and let him see that he is accustomed to lying. We should say, "You have to repent before the Lord. Otherwise, you will not have a way to go on." While we are speaking, we should not turn our face aside. Some problems, such as lying, need to be addressed in a solemn way. Other problems only need to be addressed in a light way. Serious sins have to be addressed seriously, while trivial sins need to be addressed lightly.</p><h2 class="head2">Rebuke</h2><p>There are mainly three kinds of people with problems. The first are those with minor problems. We can point out their problems while we are alone with them. We can deal with these problems one on one. The second kind are those with serious problems. These problems have taken root in them and have become part of their constitution. We have to speak a strong word to them before they can turn. If we feel that one person is not enough, we should invite two or three experienced brothers to go with us. We should speak a strong word to their face in the presence of the brothers. The third kind are those whose problems are so serious that it is hard to correct them. We must then bring two or three brothers with us when we talk to such ones. When there is enough indignation within us and we are disgusted with the matter, we should rebuke them severely. The indictment and the rebuke should have been brewing within us for some time. When we meet with them, we should not only exhort them but rebuke them severely. We are representing God; we are not only speaking to them but rebuking them. If we want to rebuke, we must have a proper indignation within us. If the listeners are willing to take our word, they will be saved, and their problems will go away.</p><p>How can a man overcome his weakness? How can he overcome his problems? Intense light burns away problems and weaknesses. When God's light shines into us, we have no place to hide. Everything that is not of God dries up and wilts away. The stronger the light, the faster the wilting. Whether or not a brother can overcome his problem depends on the light he receives from us. Everything that is not planted by God will be uprooted. A hidden leprosy is not easily healed. But when it is exposed and proven to be leprosy, it can be more easily healed. If we want to dispense great light to others, we ourselves must be delivered from personal feelings and interests; we should only be for the good of the other person. If we have personal feelings of our own, we will not be able to deal with others' problems. If we have personal interests of our own, we will not be able to help others. If we speak to others in a frank way and expose their weaknesses under God's light, they will crumple. They will not be able to rise again, and their problems will go away.</p><p>Some may ask, "Why do we have to bring two or three people with us?" Sometimes the words of one person do not afford enough light and exposure. Bringing two or three persons intensifies the light, precipitates the other's mistakes, and increases the exposure and shame of the matter in view. In this way he will break down immediately, and his problems will be taken care of. The light of two or three people is stronger than the light of one. The only question left is whether or not the recipient will acknowledge the light.</p><p>Why is there the need for rebuke? The Bible contains many words of rebuke. Why are we afraid of rebuking others in the church today? It is because we are wrong in the way we live; we are not qualified to rebuke others. As soon as we rebuke others, we are condemned in ourselves. Those who are full of personal feelings cannot rebuke others. In order to rebuke others, we must be free from personal feelings. The rebukes found in the Bible are all free of personal interests. They are all done for God, for the church, and for the brothers and sisters. For the good of the brothers and sisters, we have to speak the truth. In order to rebuke someone concerning a matter, we have to hate that matter deeply enough and oppose it strongly enough. There must be enough indignation within us. Unless we are such persons before the Lord, we cannot rebuke others. If our word is from God, light will come to the brother as we speak such a word soberly to his face, and he will be paralyzed by this light. After two or three days, he will gradually see the light. He will be cut, and there will be a wound in him. As a result, his problem will wither away.</p><p>I have a title for the subject of these messages. I call it judgment or discernment. God's judgment is executed through His wrath. Once He judges, everything is cleansed. One day, when God pours out His wrath, the world will be cleansed, and Satan's work no longer will exist. It is a good thing for a follower of Christ, who has been with the Lord for thirty to fifty years, to be able to express God's wrath upon man. The wrath of an elderly brother often helps other brothers overcome their problems. But young ones should never be tempted to do this. Your time has not come. You can only learn to bear the cross and accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit. When you lose your temper, you lose it in yourself. After you have lost your temper, you must turn back to God. Some elderly brothers do not have to confess or repent when they lose their temper; they do not have to turn back to God for what they have done. There is a great difference between our own wrath and the wrath that comes from God. The wrath that comes from ourselves needs confession; without such confession we are cut off from fellowship with God. The wrath that comes from God does not require a return to God; the fellowship is never cut off in such a case. At most, an ordinary brother can exhort; he cannot rebuke. Only an elderly brother with some inner assurance can condemn a brother's mistake in the wrath of God. We do not talk about these subjects frequently, because they are not ordinary practices. Such matters must be practiced in fear and trembling. We need more training in the matter of judging men according to our spirit.</p><p>Prayer: Lord, we have to offer special supplication for the brothers and sisters. We pray that they would experience an inward deliverance and know themselves thoroughly. We pray that they would no longer indulge in self-love or be discouraged. We pray that they would be able to render help to many and bring many out of darkness to the path of light. Day by day, may they live more in You and less in themselves so that they would receive more light through You and more discipline from the Holy Spirit. May they learn to fear You, and may they learn to be delivered from themselves.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 21, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER L. C.</h2><p>I was saved at a time that I least expected. After I was saved, I loved to read the Bible and pray. My desire was to be a model pastor. Later I entered a Bible school. After three years, I graduated and was assigned a preacher's job. Upon reading Brother Nee's magazine The Christian, I came to know about the meaning of the church. Yet human affection restrained me from leaving my denomination. Later I heard Brother Nee preach at Hardoon Road, Shanghai, about the grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying to bear much fruit in John 12:24. That message opened my eyes to see how the church is produced. Brother Chang Kwang-rong once preached in P'ing Yang, Chekiang province, on the standard of a servant of God. I felt that I was unworthy to be called a servant. I prayed that the Lord would touch Brother Nee to call for a national co-workers' conference once again. The Lord heard my prayer, and I was able to attend the last special conference in Shanghai. My past has been fraught with sufferings. I have encountered pirates three times, bandits once, civil wars twice, and sickness many times. But thank the Lord, He has brought me through safely. I feel that I am too old and that the young people should take up much of the work. Yet the responsibility of the church is still on my shoulders. I do not want to hold on, yet I have to bear it. This is my problem.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Spiritual Contradictions</h2><p>Our brother is the main worker bearing responsibility around Wenchow, Chekiang. He must not retire. For years the war in our country prevented the co-workers from having regular fellowship with each another. It is a good sign that your natural interest for the Lord's work has diminished. It is good to be delivered from the self. But at the same time, you should be more aggressive by the power of resurrection. In the Lord's work, contradictions exist. Brother Hwang should encourage this contradiction. This contradiction will show you how much you are for the Lord. By living under such contradictions, one realizes how he can serve the Lord with more purity. On the one hand, we are no longer driven by natural interest in the work; we can give ourselves to the work, and we also can retire from the work. This is the experience of death. But it is not right to only have death without resurrection. On the positive side, we must be strengthened by the resurrection life so that we can labor even more than when we were young. It concerns me that some people pay much attention to the work but do not produce much fruit. For us to continue working is a matter of responsibility. It is a matter not of preference but of responsibility. Paul said that woe was to him if he did not preach the gospel and that he would receive a reward if he preached willingly. But even if he was not willing, the responsibility was still upon him. It is good to experience more of such contradictions.</p><p>If a man pays too much attention to his work, it becomes hard for him to let go. However, it is easy for him to become passive when he lets go. God often leads men through the valley of death. Brothers Yu-ting, Chin-fa, and Tien-zhu have all died. This puts the churches in P'ing Yang in great trials. I have to ask my brother, "After you are no longer attached to your work, are you clearer about how much of your service is truly for God?" When a man loses interest in the work, he finds out whether or not he is for the Lord. When a man is young, he likes to do this and that. But it is merely a demonstration of the power of the flesh and the natural man. When things are different, that is, when we are in the midst of dark days, we truly find out how much of our work is for the Lord. I am afraid that the things related to our youthful zeal had very little to do with the Lord. Most of them were for ourselves or for others. Only as the self recedes does the Lord begin to work in an inward way. The Lord can purify us so that the more we serve Him, the simpler we become.</p><h2 class="head2">Losing Natural Interest,<br />While Being Strengthened in Resurrection</h2><p>Brother, you have to take care of two things. First, your life of contradiction must be strengthened. Even when you do not find any interest in your work, you still have to go on. Second, you should be strengthened in resurrection. You may have experienced the first point; that is, you have lost your natural interest in the work. But in regards to the second point, you still have a responsibility and commitment, and you have no other choice but to carry this responsibility or else the church will collapse. You have to rise up above death and face the crises in the church. Some people work because they are driven by a lust for work; if we stop those who work in this way from working, we are asking them for their life. Brother, you have to be delivered from any lust for work. Any such lust has to be put to death. But then you must be strengthened in resurrection. You have to know that you are a servant of God. If He has a demand, He will surely give you the strength to meet this demand. When we are old, our service is no longer a matter of preference. The Lord told Peter that when he was young, he girded up his loins and walked wherever he wished. But when he was old, he would have to stretch out his hands, and another would carry him where he did not wish to go (John 21:18). This is the time when a worker is tested. The greatest test of our consecration is when we work for the Lord because we see His need. It is no longer a matter of preference but a matter of the Lord's demand. What we do during times of reluctance is more reliable than what we do during times of preference.</p><h2 class="head2">The Supply in the Body</h2><p>We do not work for God when we feel like it and stop when we do not feel like it. We have to work in resurrection and look for the supply in the Body. Resurrection is found in the church. Therefore, the supply of the resurrection life is also found in the church. We have to experience a breakthrough with all the saints through the supply of the Body. Let us forget about whether or not we have an interest or feeling concerning our work. When all the brothers and sisters give themselves to the church, they overcome together by the resurrection life. Paul was once discouraged. It seems as if he wanted a break from his work. Yet as soon as Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, he was immediately constrained by the word (Acts 18:5). He had been reasoning and persuading every Sabbath. Perhaps he was frustrated and ready to take a rest. Perhaps he was pressed beyond measure. But when Silas and Timothy showed up, he was constrained by the word. He continued to speak about Christ, returning to his former subject. Just when Paul was about to become discouraged, the coming of two young brothers strengthened his spirit. Perhaps you do not have two young brothers to come to your aid yet. But we hope that in the future they will come. It would not be right for you to retire now. If you set your eyes on the problems and do not draw supply from the power of resurrection, your problems will become heavy weights; they will not lead you anywhere. If you have the supply of the Body, your life of contradiction may increase while your natural interest dies out. (On the one hand, death is terrible, but on the other hand, it is very useful.) Under the operation of death, the power of resurrection will be manifested.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 22, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER Y. C.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. In my youth I studied in a non-Christian school. I was saved through reading about the Lord's love in the four Gospels. At that time the school I attended forbade anyone to read the Bible. I broke the Bible into small sections and put them in my pocket so that I could carry it with me easily. One day I read Acts 6:4, which says, "We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word." I received a burden. My family was not agreeable to this, and some of them opposed my desire to seek after the Lord. But God is my all. I brushed aside their oppositions. Later I was enrolled in the Jin Ning Women's Seminary in Nanking. But what went on there was not agreeable to my spiritual taste; I did not receive much help from the classes. I left the seminary and worked among the women in a Presbyterian Church. Once I fell from a train. The next day I vomited blood and found that I had hurt my spine. I knew that the Lord was dealing with me. He did not want me to be bound to the Presbyterian Church by human affections and circumstantial needs. I left.</p><p>Later I went to work at the Shanghai Gospel Book Room. There was friction among the co-workers. It was difficult for me to learn the lessons. I became discouraged and could not rise up. Yet the Lord's love constrained me, and I endured. Through this I learned to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit and to drop the self. Once I incurred a heart disease and suffered much. I was so sick that I was ready to die. But I have never regretted taking this way. When the church was on the subject of giving our all, I struggled for a week and wondered whether I should give my all. I knew that if I did not yield my all, I would be finished. God, however, did not want me to be finished, so I offered up my all. Now I have no more problems, except with my "self." Once I let go of the self, there will be no more problems. I have no desire to do any work. All I want is to live according to God's will.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our sister's testimony shows that she is a frank and straightforward person. But when such frankness and straightforwardness is mixed with the spirit, it is hard to deal with the former characteristics. A man's virtues and characteristics exert much influence upon his condition before the Lord. These virtues and characteristics should be nurtured in the spirit and covered by the spirit. As far as history is concerned, there was a fundamental problem with the church in Shanghai during the time our sister was there: Everyone was doing his own thing. There was no good coordination. There was no supply of the Body, and the work was not in one accord. There was no authority, no arrangement, and everything was left to run its own course. But now we all have seen our mistake. If the light we have received is strong enough, our sister will be spared many sufferings.</p><p>As far as our sister's personal experiences are concerned, I will repeat the statement that unless we are ready to let God touch us, our spirit cannot climb to a higher level. May the Lord bless our sister and manifest more of His work through her.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(3)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 19, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER K. H.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. When I was a baby, I received the rite of sprinkling. Later I attended Bible classes. When I was a teen-ager, I received confirmation and became a regular member of the church, eligible to partake of the holy communion. All of these were formalities of the Anglican Church. During my first year in college, I was led to a clear knowledge of salvation through private conversations with Brother Nee. After I was saved, I began to meet with the local church in my locality. In 1935 I attended the Overcomer Conference under Brother Nee in Chuanchow, Fukien province, and consecrated myself completely to the Lord. After my consecration, I found my life completely changed. In the summer of 1936, I quit my teaching job and began to serve the Lord full-time. First, I worked in Canton and then in Hong Kong. Following this I preached the gospel and built up churches in K'un-ming and other cities in Yunnan province. In 1941 I returned from K'un-ming to Hong Kong and served with the saints in the church. In the spring of 1948, I went to Shanghai and attended the national co-workers' and elders' conference. This summer I find myself able to attend this four-month training at Kuling Mountain, Fukien. I would like to ask my brother a question: How can we tell what our own ministry is?</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Following the Lord by Violence</h2><p>In his pursuit of the Lord, our brother has to be more violent and aggressive (Matt. 11:12). He has to take a few violent steps. When God brings you to a crossroads, you have to make a violent choice. If you do this, the lessons you learn in two or three years will equal what you otherwise could learn only in twenty or thirty years. Our brother has a pure spirit, and he has been going on step by step in a very solid way.</p><h2 class="head2">Controlling Our Smile While We Speak</h2><p>I have known Brother Weigh for a long time. I would ask for his permission to say something. Perhaps I do not have to ask for permission. I want to mention one very small matter. If you want your spirit to be fully released, you have to hold back your smile a little. Your facial expression, voice, and attitude all should be focused in one direction. Your smile sometimes becomes a distraction to you. At times of solemnity, your smile is like a brake on a bicycle rolling down the hill. Your smile in your preaching is a brake; it frustrates the release of your spirit. In ministering the word to others, the smile on our face is a frustration to the power within; it is inversely proportional to the amount of power we have within. We cannot peddle a bicycle and apply the brake at the same time. This will strip our ministry of the word of its effectiveness.</p><h2 class="head2">Rich in Thoughts</h2><p>In the ministry of the word, thoughts are useful. You have to ask the Lord to grant you mercy to have rich thoughts. When God wants to speak through man, the Holy Spirit supplies the speaker with active, living thoughts. When we read the Bible, we have to meditate on the Lord's word by means of the Holy Spirit. This will make our thoughts rich. If our thoughts are not rich, we will lower the level of the Spirit's speaking.</p><p>You have to be more violent in following the Lord. When you speak you have to control your smile. At the same time your thoughts have to be rich and active. You must also push out your spirit to release the word.</p><h2 class="head2">The Formation of Ministry</h2><p>The ministry we possess is based on the work that God performs on us. When God brings us through trials, He makes us certain persons. The kind of pathway a man takes and the trials he suffers determine the kind of ministry he has. Paul suffered much, and he was comforted much. He was able to comfort those who needed comfort. Whatever God has done and is doing in us will make us the kind of person we are. That will be our ministry. We can only handle what we ourselves have experienced. A young man can learn to say something, but the words will be somewhat awkward to others' ears. It will be like a Foochow native speaking Mandarin; the Foochow accent will always be there. If we want to serve all men, we have to go through all kinds of trials. The greater the ministry, the greater the trials. C. H. Spurgeon once stated simply, "If you have never wept for sin, you will tell a sinner not to worry about sin; you will tell him that there is no need to weep." This is, of course, the greatest mistake in the whole world. A doctor with little training cannot rush to treat patients. This will not work. He must have experience with an illness before he can treat others with the same illness.</p><p>If God's intention is to commit more responsibilities to us, we should not be surprised when we face more trials from different directions. Paul received the greatest ministry. This is the reason 2 Corinthians tells us of his many trials. The most precious book in the entire New Testament is 2 Corinthians. Ephesians is the highest book; it tells us about the Lord. But 2 Corinthians is the most precious book; it tells us about a man who reached the loftiest height, and about the kind of things he saw and attained. Other books do not show us as much about the person of Paul. He was a lofty man. This is the reason God gave him all kinds of revelations and allowed him to be tried materially, psychologically, physically, supernaturally, spiritually, and in things related to the church. Whatever way God leads us, that is the ministry that He will work out in us. The lessons we learn will determine the ministry we have. We should not think that we can receive a cheap ministry from the hand of the Lord. God will never let us go. The discipline of the Holy Spirit is arranging everything day by day. We can never escape this education. It is most foolish for a man to try to run away from God or to circumvent His dealings.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(4)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 23, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER T.

But if you spend all your time and thoughts on this matter, you will not have enough time to deal with others, and the work will suffer. Therefore, you have to spend more time and thought in dealing with others. If you will give yourself more violently to the work, you will see fruitful results. A boxer does not just practice in a gymnasium; his goal is to knock men down. Our goal is to serve men.

T.</h2><p>I found God's light through defeat and failure, and this light led me to this way. In taking this way, I have often tried to deal with myself. Why is it that I cannot concentrate my thoughts? I like to read spiritual books, but it is difficult for me to concentrate my thoughts. As I fellowshipped with Brother Nee more and more, I found life and life supply in his speaking. I like to listen to him. Other people have said that I was following Brother Nee. Once I met Brother Witness Lee, and he asked if I had received the Lord's calling. He also asked if I merely was saving people for heaven. He even said that my work was isolated and uncoordinated. These remarks brought me to tears before the Lord. Later I met Brother Nee, and he told me not to go into the seminary or to busily research the Scriptures. I first should learn not to work for the Lord before I can learn to work for Him. Still later I heard another brother say that he had stopped working because it was God's will, and that God's will was to do His work alone. At that time I looked at myself and judged that I was not qualified to be a preacher. I do not have any gift, and I am physically weak. I am always filled with negative and pessimistic thoughts. I also feel that I cannot maintain the constant presence of the Lord, and my spirit is not strong enough.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>There are two sides to God's presence, His side and our side. There is no problem on God's side. On our side, we have to exercise our spirit. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit. Our spirit must be able to flow out in a pure way before we can secure God's presence in a consistent way.</p><p>The first step a Christian should take is not to pursue power for his inward being, but purity in his spirit. The matter of power comes later. Spiritual power comes from the presence of God. If a person wants to have power first and purity later, he is taking the wrong course. In order for the spirit to be pure, we first have to find what kind of mixture there is in the spirit. The main reason for impurity in the spirit is the mixture of the old man. As soon as the old man is broken, purity of the spirit can be realized. The problem with us today is that the opinions of the old man, along with its proposals and feelings, are all mixed up with the spirit. We have only one spirit. If this spirit is contaminated by the old man, it is hard to purge itself. There is only one center in our nervous system, yet the feelings of the various parts of the body are different. If we ask a man with a fever how he feels, he will say that he feels hot. The doctor will explain that he feels hot physiologically because his nervous system is one unified whole. If there were more than one center to his nervous system, the matter would be much more complicated. A doctor has to find ways to diagnose a sickness according to various symptoms and treat it accordingly. This is the way God works. He first removes all of our false feelings so that we become inwardly pure. Some are strong in their mind, confused in their emotion, and stubborn in their will. If they remain in these conditions, their spirit will never be sensitive. For this reason, sometimes God has to give us many sufferings and trials. He uses these things to train us. He has to knock off all the conspicuous corners and deal with our soul-life. Once He does this, we can exercise our spirit as freely as we exercise our hands. The natives of India practice asceticism; they restrict their hands from moving. But if the hands do not move, they will wither away. This is not the Christian way. A Christian has to learn to exercise his spirit. God is Spirit. Therefore, we have to exercise our spirit. We cannot allow any strong spots in our natural life to remain in us. If we do, they have to be knocked off.</p><p>A new believer has a simple spirit. Although his spirit is not strong, neither is it mixed. If he continues this way, he will grow in a balanced way. A man has to pay the price to learn God's presence. It is easier for a simple person to touch God's presence. Although the outer man can be busy working, the inner man can remain calm in God all the time. In order to secure God's presence, the first thing we need is, of course, purity of heart. But the inner man must also be separated from the outer man. If the inner man is not distracted by the outer man, it will have no trouble maintaining God's presence. It is not a matter of leaving and then returning to God's presence, but a matter of remaining in His presence all the time. Our spirit is the organ with which we fellowship with God. We have to manage this organ properly and calibrate it finely. This is not a matter of morality but a matter of exercise. We must exercise ourselves to the point that we can be in God's presence no matter how busy we are. Otherwise, we can hear a great sermon, but it will not do us any good when we return home; the next time we come, we will be the same as before.</p><p>Let us turn our attention to another matter. How can we enter resurrection? At the time we were regenerated, we received all the power of resurrection there is to receive. But God has to grant us a spirit of revelation to see and a spirit of wisdom to know. Ephesians tells us that we know resurrection by the Holy Spirit (1:17, 19-20). Philippians tells us that we know resurrection by the cross (3:10). In Christ we see resurrection. What we see is not the corruption of the body but the power of resurrection. When we pray to God, we do not ask for power, but for a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Once we have this, we will know the greatness of His power. This knowing is a great thing; it is exceedingly precious. The power of resurrection comes from prayer. May the Lord grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation and open our eyes to see resurrection. No power in this world is greater than the power of death. Only the resurrection life can overcome this death. We know the power of resurrection through the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of resurrection.</p><p>The resurrection in Philippians 3 enables us to partake of His death. This "partaking" is very special. Moreover, the cross spoken of in Philippians 3 is different from the cross spoken of elsewhere in the Bible; this is the cross of resurrection. In other places resurrection comes after the cross. But Philippians 3 shows us that we can suffer with Him and be conformed to His death after we have known the power of Christ's resurrection. The sequence between resurrection and death is reversed. Elsewhere death comes before resurrection. Here death is experienced through the resurrection life. The death in Romans 6 is a historical fact, while the death in Philippians 3 is a principle. Christ's life on earth bore the element of resurrection. Although He was crucified on the cross, He could not die, because resurrection was in Him. This resurrection is something spiritual; it is not related to the resurrection of His body.</p><p>Just as the Lord lived the crucified life through the resurrection life on earth, and just as He expressed resurrection in this way, our living should be permeated with the flavor of the cross. We should be the outpoured wine which others can drink. We should be the broken bread which others can eat. The cross in Philippians comes after resurrection.</p><p>It would be good if you could find a brother with some authority to act as your overseer. After some time you will realize the benefit of such a covering. The calling of some people requires them to charge forward by themselves. The calling of others requires them to come under some authority. We have to wait and obey and look to God to prepare the proper authority for us. I hope that there will be a proper center in your region so that you can have a proper way to go on and so that there will be remaining fruits in the church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(6)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 25, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER C. L.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. At the age of seventeen I heard the gospel and knew that I was a sinner destined for hell. I called on the Lord's name and prayed to Him. After I prayed I felt relieved. The next day I dealt with my sins. When I was twenty-one years old, I had a spiritual turn, and I consecrated myself to the Lord. I sold my possessions, including my wedding ring, and gave up everything to follow the Lord. In 1942 I left the denominations and began to meet with brothers and sisters on the ground of the local church. I have two questions: How does a man know whether his inner man and outer man are separated? How can we submit to authority?</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">The Breaking of Man</h2><p>Our brother is a person who can easily accept God's breaking. A broken man will find that his mind, emotion, and will are changed. He will become different from his original natural constitution. A broken man is open to God. God can easily come in, and his spirit can easily come out. For the spirit to be released means that others can touch our very being. How can we tell when the inner man and outer man are separated from each other? There are three signs to indicate this separation. First, when the two are separate, it is easy for others to touch the inner man. Second, the mind, emotion, and will are all broken. They are no longer hardened but flow freely. Third, it is easy to release the inner man. It is hard to point out mistakes to an unbroken man; it is hard for him to accept them as fact. We have to wait until he is well disposed before he will nod his head and agree with us. Some people have experienced much chastisement, yet they are not changed inwardly. A broken man, however, easily receives others' words. He is easily touched. If a man boasts that he is not easily influenced by others, it means that he is not very broken at all.</p><p>However, being broken has nothing to do with introspection. Introspection is damaging. If my mind is obsessed with thoughts about my pulse and breathing, I am surely sick. It is useless for a man to constantly condemn himself for not being broken. A man only needs to be concerned with one thing&mdash;whether or not he has humbled himself under the mighty hand of God, submitting to God's ordering in the environment. That is his business. The way he is broken is not his business. Others know whether or not he is broken, and the church also knows. The knowledge of the degree of our brokenness belongs to the church, not to us. Those who are always engaged in introspection are mainly unbroken. Introspection is very unhealthy. It is our job to pray for breaking. But it is the Lord's job to decide which way to break us.</p><h2 class="head2">Submission to Authority</h2><p>Let me say a word about the matter of authority: In speaking for God, a worker of the Lord should not ask others to listen to him. He is merely God's mouthpiece. If others listen to him, they are listening to God. If they do not listen, they are ignoring God. We pity those who have never touched authority; they are wild and untamed. If a man has never fallen on his face before God, what good does it do if others listen to him? If a man has touched God's authority, he will no longer be wild. A man must see that no offense to authority is greater than an offense to God's authority. Rebellion to authority is lawlessness. There are two sins in this world which God hates: lawlessness and uncleanness. Uncleanness comes from lawlessness. Lawlessness is the root of all sin. In the past we saw the sin of uncleanness, but we did not see the sin of lawlessness. But God hates the sin of lawlessness more than the sin of uncleanness. Submission to authority is the most urgent thing that we need to see today. Breaking deals with us as individuals, whereas submission deals with our relationship with God.</p><h2 class="head2">Rich in Thoughts</h2><p>As far as you are concerned, your power of inference is sufficient and quick. But your thoughts still need to be enriched. Inference has to do with the breadth of one's thought, while thoughts has to do with the depth. A worker must be rich in thoughts, not rich in inference. You have the adequate power of inference to be a minister of God's word, but you still need to be enriched in your thoughts.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(7)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 26, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER F. L.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. I heard the gospel in Chefoo and believed in the Lord Jesus. After I was saved I became very hungry for God's word. But I lived a vacillating and unsteady life for about half a year. I worked in the courthouse and often was ridiculed by others. Yet I loved my Lord. He is so glorious, rich, and real to me. On the one hand, I saw the perfection of the Lord, and on the other hand, I saw my own imperfections. The Lord did some stripping work in me, and for a few years I lived in poverty. Sister Peace Wang once said that poverty is necessary and that one does not know God's riches without poverty. I intended to migrate to northwest China for the gospel, but I was hindered by the outbreak of the war with Japan. During the subsequent years, I touched the Lord's love and could not stay away from Him. At that time I understood how we can live with or without many things. The most important thing is to have the Lord. As long as I have the Lord, I am satisfied. He is the only satisfaction of my life. My relationship with the Lord is like that of a fish with water. I cannot leave Him. As soon as I leave Him, I will be finished. Thank the Lord that I was granted permission to come to the mountain to be trained. I have a few questions, and I wonder whether Brother Nee can answer them for me.</p><p>1) What is the difference between dying with the Lord and the killing of the Lord's light? 2) If we want to preach the gospel, do we ask the Lord to give us a love for man's soul? 3) Can we serve the Lord by taking up a secular profession? 4) How do we separate the inner man from the outer man?</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Dying with the Lord<br />and Being Killed by His Light</h2><p>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ." All of our experiences are of the Lord; they all are part of the Lord's experience. This is like saying that the experiences of a pregnant mother are the experiences of the fetus. Wherever the mother goes, the baby follows inside her womb. Hebrews speaks of the Lord being a priest superior to Aaron. The Lord was of the tribe of Judah. According to the flesh, He could not even be a priest. Judah was the tribe of the king. But the Lord was made a priest according to the order of Melchisedec. This is the reason He was greater than Aaron, who was a priest according to the order of the tribe of Levi. Abraham was an ancestor of Levi. When Melchisedec offered up sacrifices on behalf of Abraham, Aaron was still in Abraham's loins (Heb. 7:10). This proves that Melchisedec was greater than Abraham. In being a priest after the order of Melchisedec, Christ is greater than Abraham. Levi offered one tenth of what he had to Melchisedec through Abraham because he was in Abraham's loins. This is like saying that the entire human race was in Adam's loins. When Adam sinned, the entire human race sinned. We are included in the same act of sin; we have taken the same fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p><p>Individually speaking, I have never been to the garden of Eden. But in Adam I was there. When I was in Singapore, I met a pregnant sister. She visited Amoy for some time and later returned to Singapore. When I visited Singapore a second time, her child had grown very much. I asked the child if he had ever been to Amoy. The child said no. He had never been there as an individual, but he had been there in his mother's womb. This is what it means to be crucified with Christ. Although the child never saw Amoy while he was in his mother's womb, he was there in reality. Individually speaking he was never there. But jointly speaking he was there. Just as the death of Christ is a reality, our death in Him is also a reality. Because I am in Adam, I do not have to commit the same sin as Adam; yet I am still as much a sinner as Adam. Now I am in Christ. Just as Christ was crucified, I was crucified as well. Just as the Lord Jesus died, I have died also. This is what God has done through the cross of Christ. This is what it means to be crucified with Christ. This answers half of your first question.</p><p>The killing of the Lord's light is something subjective in our experience. When a man receives light, the death of the cross begins to work on him and strip him. When God takes away this and that from him, it is death operating in him. This is the meaning of 2 Corinthians 4:10, which says, "Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus." Everything human that has its origin in the self must be gradually removed. This work of the Lord is progressive and cumulative, with the result being "that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake....So then death operates in us, but life in you" (vv. 10-12). The first death relates to our crucifixion with the Lord; through this the problem of sin is settled. The second death relates to the self and the flesh. It strips the self and has nothing to do with sin. This conforms us to Christ more and more. It is the killing work of the Lord's light.</p><h2 class="head2">A Love for Sinners' Souls</h2><p>Concerning the second question, my answer is that you can pray for a love for sinners' souls. First, you have to see the pitiful condition of a sinner. This will stir up your love for him and give you an earnest sense of responsibility which can never be shaken off. It will become a driving force within you. On the one hand, you can ask God to give you a love for sinners' souls. On the other hand, this is a kind of revelation. Once you have such a revelation, your spirit will be empowered.</p><h2 class="head2">A Levite's Living</h2><p>Concerning the third question, my answer is that the Levites in the Bible serve as a pattern for our living. Ordinary brothers and sisters are different from us; they have fixed incomes. We do not have any fixed income. When the Israelites offered up their sacrifices, the meat that was left went to the Levites. This means that when there were many offerings, they had much meat. When there were few offerings, they had little meat. Some think that the Levites had a great deal of meat to eat. But they fail to see that the living of the Levites is related to the living of God's people. The book of Malachi speaks of the people of Israel robbing God's offerings (3:8-10) and thus depleting the supply of His priests. Many people only saw Paul in his abundance; they did not see him in his poverty. Every worker should maintain his dignity before the brothers and sisters and should appear rich to them; he should not appear poor. Anyone who cannot stand on the ground of trusting God in financial matters is not qualified to work for Him. We would rather have men consider us rich than have them consider us poor. Paul said, "But I, I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls" (2 Cor. 12:15). Paul spent himself for others. I am not afraid of criticisms against a worker, who is spending himself on others, for being well-dressed and well-fed. Those who criticize him for this are critical because they are not willing to offer their money. When they see others offering money, they become jealous. This is wrong. It seems that more money has gone out of my hands than from any other person's hand. But it can also be said that I have the experience more than others of holding one last dollar in my hand.</p><p>If the brothers in the church in Chefoo do not intend to support you, take up a secular profession. You do not need to spend their money. Paul had a profession of making tents when he said, "You yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me" (Acts 20:34). For Paul to say this was not a glory for the Corinthians but a loss. Paul had to make tents in Corinth. In Philippi he did not have to do this. When the church is short of regular supply, we have to think of ways to make a living. But we should not pay too much attention to this matter.</p><p>Finally, I do not have much to say to you personally. This is a very critical hour, and we should give ourselves to the work. When darkness comes, no one will be able to do anything.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(8)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:June 28, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER F. R.</h2><p>I am willing to expose myself fully to the judgment of the church. In my family I was the only daughter, and I have been loved by everyone since my youth. This is the reason I am so proud of myself and not afraid of others. When I was in a gospel meeting, I heard a line of a song: "While others have received it, do not pass me by." I was touched by that word and prayed to God to save me. I prayed not to be passed by, and I was saved. Later God revealed Himself to me and told me to serve Him. I came to the local church and began to fellowship with the saints. Later I joined Brother Nee's training in Yu-Hwa Village, Shanghai. At that time I was like a wild horse. I received much help from the training. I saw that everything apart from Christ was vain. Even my prayers were filthy, and my reading of the Bible was unacceptable to Him. For years in the sisters' meeting, I did not open my mouth, and I did not open myself to others. Some have said that I am too arrogant. Later the Lord arranged a spiritual sister to stay with me. Outwardly, I rebelled and would not submit, but inwardly, I said "amen." Had it not been for the grace of God, I would have run away a long time ago.</p><p>I have heard many messages and I thought that I had the reality. But when trials came I found myself being defeated. From the messages on authority and on the breaking of man, I saw that I have weaknesses which I myself was not aware of. I have been slow in running this race. It seems that I move one step only to fall down the next step. May God be merciful to me and speak to me in a strong way through our brother.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>I admit that it is not an easy thing to deal with your natural disposition. You need God to smite you in many different ways before you can fall. Presently, the negative dealings should increase in you. You do not need to seek for too much or to expect too much. These experiences will come to you spontaneously. He will give you the light and the dealings. God Himself will continue to deal with you.</p><h2 class="head2">God Granting Grace apart from Our Reason</h2><p>Someone said one time, "God can grant me grace apart from my condition." This is a very positive word. All those who know God will testify sooner or later to the reality of this. God does things beyond what we can do. The work of breaking is absolutely necessary. Many brothers and sisters will not be softened unless they have passed through the breaking. But this is in the hands of God. We have to look to God to do this work without our interference. God does not deal with us according to our expectations. God grants grace to us apart from any expectation on our side. When we say "apart from us," we are not saying that this work is carried on outside of us. Rather, we are saying that it is carried on apart from our expectations. If we want God to go along with our reasons, we will not receive any blessing. In order to make us a blessing to others, God has to deal with us in a realm beyond our expectation so that we can receive grace that is beyond our expectation. In this race, the positive things are God's blessings, mercy, grace, and power. In Romans 9:15-16 Paul spoke of how God said to Moses, "`I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion.' So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy." If God is gracious to us and grants us much grace, we have to remember that it has nothing to do with us.</p><p>God works on us according to His pleasure, not according to our pleasure. It is a good thing that we are dealt with by Him. But we have to know that our being dealt with and being broken are not the basis and condition for us to receive His blessing. It is a great misconception to think that God's breaking is His basis for blessing us today and in the future. If God wants to use us, it has nothing to do with us. If He finds us useful in any way, we can only say that this is the result of His mercy. God dispenses gifts according to His will, not according to our will. It is God's grace that He breaks us, tears us down, and deals with us through the environment. But we cannot bargain for God's grace according to the dealings we have received. Sister, if you can be free from the self, it will be a great deliverance to you. Those who know God know that we do not receive grace for any reason of our own.</p><p>Esau's life did not have any mark of God's hand. But Jacob experienced God's hand throughout his life. He had times of loss and times of gain. He cheated others and, in turn, was cheated by others. God's hand was heavy upon Jacob. God will have mercy on whom He will have mercy. We have to see that it is a mercy that a man can be broken and destroyed. We can call this a destruction, and we can also call this a blessing. The only thing we are afraid of is God taking away His breaking hand. Today the Lord may want me to speak to others and to minister to them. I obey Him, but this is not my business, it is His business. We boast of His pleasure, not of our accomplishment. The most positive things are those that are according to the Lord's pleasure. If we can take the dealings well, we should thank the Lord for it. If we cannot take the dealings well, we still should thank the Lord. Nothing can replace the Lord's pleasure.</p><p>Putting Paul's word more explicitly, we can say, "If God wants to do something a certain way, what can you do?" Jacob could say that he was stubborn, but if God wanted to use him, what could he say? All positive items such as mercy, blessing, and usefulness are based on God's pleasure and desire. Our eyes should never be upon ourselves. However, eight out of ten people set their eyes upon themselves. My heart rejoices when I realize that God's work is accomplished apart from me. The Lord did not consider how we would react or how the world would react when He came to the earth. His coming was according to His own pleasure; He blesses according to His salvation. We do not have to pay attention to the Lord's breaking; that is the Lord's business. The trimming of the vine tree is God's business. God will do as He sees fit. Once we see that God accomplishes His work apart from us, we will experience great liberation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(9)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 1, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER S. S.</h2><p>When I was sixteen I applied for baptism. But at that time I did not know what faith was and what salvation meant. Later I became clear about my salvation. After a while I became cold once again and even began to doubt my salvation. I was stirred up by others' testimonies when they testified of their fellowship with the Lord, but I myself did not have such fellowship. Later I began to pursue after the Lord and picked up some experiences. I am always sick, and this is quite a trial to me. I used to meet in the denominations but was very dry spiritually. Later I read the publications of the Shanghai Gospel Book Room and touched a flow of supply there. I came to the local church, began to fellowship with the saints, and started to grow spiritually. Many things which had held me back were resolved during my time of meeting with the saints. I have personally received very little directly from the Lord. Many times when temptations come my way, I am too weak to handle them. Although I am stronger than I used to be, I am still behind in many of the basic lessons. In recent years I have experienced frequent condemnation from Satan. Finally, I would like to ask two questions: How does a person receive light? The second question has to do with the sisters' service. What is their proper place and sphere?</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Paying Attention to the Major Issues</h2><p>Absalom failed because he was not clear about two things. First, he fought in the forest, not in the open. A forest is a tangled place. Second, he fought with long hair. This is personal entanglement. Man's hair is his most minor and insignificant part; it is of no major concern. Absalom's hair was not only fine, but long and thick. It became tangled in the branches. This led to his failure. We also have many minor and lengthy affairs that entangle us. On the one hand, we cannot be like some unbelievers, who adopt a philosophy of diffidence to minor issues. Christians should take care of minor matters and particulars, but we cannot pay too much attention to the minor issues. We need to have a sober heart that takes on major issues and commitments. We should not allow the minor issues to frustrate the major ones. I am not saying that we should take care of the big things at the expense of the small things. I am saying that we have to know what things are more important. We have to set our eyes on the greater things of God and not be bogged down by personal, minor dealings. We should assign these minor things to a corner. If we do this, we will become much more useful in our service to the Lord.</p><p>You have experienced many trials and have won some minor victories. But if the Lord grants you mercy to expand your capacity, you will see that the Lord's work is great and that His requirements of us will also be great. I am afraid that you miss the great "good," the great grace, and the great light when you are so concerned with the small "good," the small grace, and the small light. Paul was attentive to small details, but he was careful about the big issues. This is being balanced. During the past years, the church has been in ruin, and there has not been a proper coordination among the ministries. As a result, we were not able to assign to you any major responsibilities. If you come before God's presence, you will realize that you are being hung by the smallest details. Absalom's fine and long hair became hung on the branches before he could fight. This hanging led to his death. I am not saying that there is anything wrong with the minor issues. But many small things have limited our capacity for the work.</p><p>When your conscience bothers you, you have to deal with it. But you should not set your eyes on your conscience all the time. You have to be positive and aggressive before the Lord. Always stand on His side, serve Him, and engage in some works in the church. If a man pays attention to the condemnation in the conscience all the time, and if he constantly sets his eyes on the small things and stretches his thin hair, he will get into trouble. On the battlefield we have to cut our hair short; it must not be long. Warfare is more important than everything. If our conscience condemns us, we take the blood and the matter is resolved in a few minutes. Even if we have been under condemnation for five days, this condemnation can be resolved in a few minutes when we put it under the blood. A brother asked me about my health, and I could only reply that I had no time to be sick. I do not even have time to think about my health.</p><h2 class="head2">Receiving Light</h2><p>All "chastening" light begins in a small way; it moves gradually to larger degrees. When great light comes, everything is settled. We cannot be too absolute with spiritual things. Although the small light cannot replace the big light, it can open the way for the great light. A man first receives light in small measure. Later he receives the great and "punishing" light. Such light will increase the riches in him.</p><h2 class="head2">The Place and Scope of the Sisters' Service</h2><p>Concerning the place and scope of the sisters' service, I would say this: In Romans 16:7 we find women apostles. First Timothy 3:11 speaks of deaconesses. First Corinthians 14:1 and 11:5 speak of prophetesses. Therefore, women can work. But 1 Timothy says that a woman should not teach with regards to biblical teachings and should remain silent when the whole church is meeting together. Paul forbade woman from doing the work of a teacher in 1 Timothy. The ascertaining of truth is a work that belongs to the teacher, and sisters should not do this. Some of the greatest heresies in this world come from women. The founders of the Christian Scientists, the Seventh-day Adventists, etc., have been women. The work of the sisters can be great, but the person of the sisters cannot be great. They should not expose themselves and should not be the ones to discern the truth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(10)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 2, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER Z. Z.</h2><p>(Missing)</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>I will speak one thing concerning you. Your emotion has made you an icy and passionless person. Your natural disposition has gone through such shock in the environment that it has become passionless and cold. You have brought this cold disposition into the work, and this has been the reason you have suffered in the work all these years. Your cold disposition has been molded by your environment and constituted into your daily living. What we encounter before we are saved becomes part of our constitution and growth. Moreover, this growth continues until we develop a character that is very different from our former state. You cannot coordinate with other co-workers in the work, and your attitude is uncooperative because your emotion and character have affected your spirit. Your spirit runs contrary to others' spirits; it does not go along with them. Because of your background, you have acquired a different character. This character spontaneously creates a problem in the ministry. It brings nothing but trouble to the church and to the work.</p><p>I believe the Lord's hand has been on you during the past years and has done some work. You have your own view concerning many things. When you are with the brothers and sisters, your indifferent character insists on what it sees and will not give in. This insistence becomes stronger and stronger. It is a good sign that God has been breaking your hard character throughout these years. This has not only exposed your weakness but has shown you that you have been responding to others according to your kind of weakness. This is the only way to break your hard disposition. It is not easy for God to use any one of us. I hope you will improve during this end time. I hope you will not delay His work or waste His effort on you.</p><p>You should not adopt a hardened stand. When I say this, I do not mean that you should give up being sober or serious. I am saying that the spirit of a minister of the word has to go along with the spirit of the meeting. He has to observe the flow of the meeting and go along with the flow. If he does this, he will have the blessing. In the meeting we should not bring up any spiritual matter in an independent spirit that runs contrary to the spirit of the meeting. In the meetings the brothers and sisters have their feelings, and we cannot offend their feelings. We cannot take care of just our own feelings while ignoring other peoples' feelings. There is, of course, a difference when it comes to preaching the gospel. We should not purposely try to impress others. But we should not purposely try to ignore them. We should not purposely try to render help to others. But we should not purposely try to refuse helping others. We should not purposely try to take care of others' feelings. But neither should we purposely try to ignore their feelings. When we speak, our spirit should have only one goal in mind&mdash;to edify others. If we want to be a minister of the word, we must exercise love. According to 1 Corinthians 13:4 this love is kind.</p><p>Our brother's present character is made up of three things: First, his natural disposition; second, the influence of the environment; and third, the coldness which is the result of a combination of his inherent disposition and his surrounding environment. Our brother indeed needs the Lord's mercy to grant him kindness and gentleness so that his present character will undergo a severe and unrelenting breaking. We should not do something that does not produce any result. In the same way we should not suffer without producing any result. Many sisters become sick or encounter trials. But the sickness and trials do not produce any result in them. This is a pity. God's work always produces results. Our brother does have the ministry of the word. Yet he has a problem with his character. May the Lord be gracious to him. Once a man is broken, he will have a tender spirit. A tender spirit is not the same as a weak spirit. Your character has been hardened by the environment, and this hardness has resulted in self-righteousness. This is the reason you cannot love the brothers and sisters. Your self-righteousness, in turn, has resulted in an independent spirit in the meeting. This is the reason your spirit cannot flow freely and richly. You need God's dealing to bring forth the fruit of the Spirit&mdash;a spirit of kindness and love, a spirit that can mingle with other spirits. This is the only way for your spirit to become rich, and this is the only way for you to gain others. If you can take care of these three things, you will be greatly used in the ministry of the word.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(11)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 3, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER A. G.</h2><p>I was saved in 1936 in Ch'ang-ch'un. Before that I was a merchant. My colleagues pleaded with me to believe in the Lord. I agreed with the Lord's teachings, but I was not convinced by those who believed in such teachings. It irked me to hear men singing and praying. Once I met a preacher who was not at all attractive but who was very sincere. A burden fell upon my heart when I heard him. I had sinned and gambled much. That day I knelt down to confess my sins in tears to the Lord. I also went to my wife and colleagues to confess my sins. Later someone gave me a copy of The Christian magazine as well as other publications like Twelve Baskets Full, A Debate concerning Denominations, The Assembly Life, The Straight Pathway, etc. After two years, I became a deacon, even a chief among the deacons. At that time I was still in a denomination, and everyone in that denomination supported what I did. I changed the form of the meetings. I called holy communion the Lord's table and addressed others as brother and sister. I changed the pastoral system from a paid position to an unpaid one. However, the congregation insisted on having a pastor. There was a split of opinions, and some brothers and I left the denomination. Later I began to meet with the brothers and sisters in the local church.</p><p>At that time I felt that I should offer up myself, as well as everything I had, to the Lord to serve Him singleheartedly. I realized that the Holy Spirit had been working in me and had frustrated me from making any fortune in the world so that I would be rich in heaven. After three years I became dry within. One day I read Colossians 1:26-27, which says, "The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints...which is Christ in you, the hope of glory." I was overjoyed. I was filled with the Holy Spirit for six or seven days. I had been a Christian for over seven or eight years but had never tasted such sweetness. During this time I did not go anywhere except to the meetings. For seven or eight years, I have had the burden to visit the brothers in various places so that both they and I would receive the profit. I have since known more of the truth concerning our calling, our submission to authority, the separation of the inner man from the outer man, etc. I hope that our brother will give me a word of help.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Submission to Authority</h2><p>Submission to authority and our dealing with God are daily exercises. The scope of this dealing should be widened all the time. Many things which were once considered legitimate, upon close examination, are found to contain the element of rebellion. If we go through more dealings and our scope of obedience increases, we will discern even the rebellion that is hidden in others. The principle and exercise of submission should be increased all the time. We have to come face to face with God's authority at least once before we can submit to His authority. As for the consciousness and sense of rebellion, we do not have to pay too much attention to this matter. The more we pay attention to this, the less we can deal with it. It is like sin; the more we look for it, the more sin we will find.</p><h2 class="head2">Avoiding Jokes</h2><p>Concerning yourself, I would like to speak concerning the matter of laughing. Let me first ask, What is laughing? Why does a man laugh? He laughs because some things or words are taken out of context; one sentence logically does not follow another. A worker should learn to avoid words and sentences that are taken out of context, that do not follow one another. Words that are out of context, words that surprise others, are jokes. Let me tell you a true joke that happened in the last century. About forty or fifty years after Robert Morrison came to China, a lady missionary hosted a dinner in Canton. She felt that the soup tasted strange and asked the cook for the reason. The cook said, "There were some sediments in the soup, and I sieved them out." The missionary asked, "What did you sieve them out with?" The cook answered, "Your socks!" The missionary jumped up and said, "How could you do that?" The cook replied, "Please do not worry. I did not use your good socks. I only used your old socks." The missionary was upset about the spoiled taste of the soup, but the cook was concerned only about the kind of socks that were used. This is a joke.</p><p>Laughing always takes away one's spiritual power and effectiveness. A person laughs because something has been said out of order or as a surprise. If a sister combs her hair with her hairbrush, no one will laugh. But if she scrubs her clothes with her hairbrush, others will laugh. If anyone speaks of an ear growing in the middle of the nose, others will laugh. Anything that is illogical makes people laugh. A worker should learn not to make others laugh. He should not say any word or allude to any fact that is out of order or that comes as a surprise. I am not saying that we cannot be funny at all. As long as we have a strong spirit, we can be funny. But if we want to say something funny, we should say it with the backing of a strong spirit. This will make the joke acceptable. If the spirit is not strong, the joke will become a frustration. In the ministry of the word, those who like to joke reduce the weightiness of their work. Jokes reduce spiritual value and power. In fulfilling the ministry of the word, we should try our best not to make people laugh. We should not induce laughter consciously, and we should not use jokes as a tool in our speaking. Although spiritual matters sometimes lead to laughing, we should do our best not to stir up laughter. Any action or word that comes as a surprise to others is spiritually damaging.</p><p>Sometimes the atmosphere is very tense. At such times it is possible to make a turn by telling a joke to relax the audience a little. We must also add that one should not pay too much attention to refraining from joking. This makes us unnatural. We have to exercise some care in the matter of jokes. God does not make all the ministers of the word the same. We should not try to deal with this matter too rigidly, or else our conscience will become overly burdened. There should always be the proper balance.</p><h2 class="head2">The Dividing of the Spirit and the Soul</h2><p>We should not expect a new believer to separate his spirit from his soul too soon. Of course, it should not come too slowly either. There is no uniform timing as to the breaking of the outer man. Some have a big soul, while others have a small soul. The soul of some carries one characteristic, while the soul of others bears no special characteristic at all and is very common. Therefore, those who have believed in the Lord for some time may find their souls being different in size. Those with a big soul require great breaking. Those with a strong intellect require strong chastisement before their spirit can be released. Those with exceptionally strong emotions also need special dealings before they can release their spirit. However, one shining may be all that is needed with ordinary people. They need the empowering of the spirit more than the breaking of their person. Those whose soul is not that strong should seek for the empowering of the spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">The Dividing of the Inner Man and the Outer Man</h2><p>The work of dividing the inner man from the outer man differs in different people. One with a peculiar disposition must suffer a mortal blow before he will experience this separation. First, he needs to receive a deep and painful wound from the Lord. Once this occurs, it is easy to solve the other problems. At the same time he needs the shining and the cooperation of the environment to experience the separation of the inner man from the outer man. After dividing there is still a need for further dealings. If one possesses no obvious peculiarity, the dividing of the soul and the spirit may happen unconsciously and gradually. At any rate, this separation work is one of the most crucial lessons in the work of the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(12)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 6, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER S. Y.</h2><p>I was saved in 1935 despite opposition from my parents. In 1936 I turned to the local church and enjoyed the sweetness of the Word. I consecrated myself to the Lord and became very desirous of the messages. That year I quit my job at the hospital and returned to my village to preach the gospel. Because I was not trained, my work produced very superficial results. For two and a half years I preached the gospel and took care of sick patients on the side. My initial zeal toward the Lord gradually cooled down. I learned the lesson and realized that everything should have its source in the Lord. Even my zeal should not be from myself. I started a clinic with a friend and began to preach the gospel again. I had only one desire, which was to please the Lord. I did not care about men's opposition. I read many of the publications of the Shanghai Gospel Book Room, and they suited my taste. I feel that there is still something wrong with my person. Others have gained something, but I have not gained anything. I used to be an active person. Now I no longer dare to be so active. Recently I picked up a desire for prayer. My inner sense has become more sensitive now. This is my condition.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">The Need for the Sense of Light to Increase</h2><p>I have nothing special to say concerning your situation. I can only say that for a period of time you should take bold strides in your walk with the Lord. You should not take any more detours. Instead, you should take the straight course, the fast course. There is no more time to look back. Additionally, I have two things to say. First, the sense of light within you should increase. If your inner being is not shining, you will not have proper feelings. Your inner feelings are the basis of judging others. If the inner feelings increase, it means you have the proper organ to contact God and to judge men. This will bring you spiritual discernment. When your deposit increases, you will become useful to God. Once the light shines within and the inward consciousness increases, you will spontaneously know whether others are right or wrong when you contact them. You have to ask for more light. Once you have the light, you will be clear, and when you are clear, you will have feelings and know how to discern. Everyone has to learn to judge men, but you first must be judged by the light before you can identify others' mistakes and render them the proper judgment. Do not expect to help others by saying a few words extemporaneously. You must have a particularly discerning spirit before the help you render to others can be proper. The degree to which others receive your help, however, is up to them.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Delivered from One's Own Feelings</h2><p>Second, you have to be delivered from your own feelings. In your going on with the Lord, your feelings have to follow your will. You should not be affected by your feelings, or else you will not be able to finish a year's course in ten years. This is like a broken twig which flows from a stream to the sea. If it is entangled constantly with obstacles in the stream, it will take a long time before it reaches the sea. Some people are too sensitive to things in their lives such as money, criticism, or judgment. These things are like obstacles in the stream, preventing the twig from flowing. There are two kinds of Christians. Some have no feelings at all; they are insensitive to everything. Others have too many feelings, and they are handicapped in their going on with the Lord. A profusion of feelings takes over their whole being. Our going on with the Lord should not have too much to do with our feelings. It is a joy and enjoyment to follow God. If we are led by our feelings, we waste much time. We may end up spending five years doing what could have been done in one year. We should not be running the race with the burden of our own feelings on our shoulders. If a man wants to believe in the Lord but will not commit himself until he first has joy and peace, we should say to him, "Believe first. Do not seek for a feeling of joy and peace. After you have believed, feelings of joy and peace will come to you." We have to abide by this principle for the rest of our life. We believe first and then, after a period of time, feelings of joy and peace will follow.</p><p>Philippians is a book on rejoicing. Paul gave us a commandment which is hard to find anywhere in the world. He said, "Rejoice." Rejoicing typically involves feelings; it is not a matter of will. In the world, joy is controlled by the feelings. But for believers, joy is controlled by the will. When the Lord says, "Rejoice," we should say, "All right, I will rejoice." An unbeliever cannot rejoice when he is asked to rejoice. Christians, however, can bring their feelings under the control of their will. We can rejoice when we need to rejoice. When Paul said to the Ephesians, "Be strong" [KJV], he meant that they should be strong. Everything relates to the will. Brothers and sisters, if we are chained by our feelings, we will need ten years to take a year's journey. A soldier cannot say that he will not fight today because he does not feel good or happy or because he is depressed. This is wrong. When a soldier is called to fight, he has to fight, no matter how he feels or what his temperament is. The same is true of spiritual matters. Today most children of the Lord follow their feelings. This is wrong. The most stable feeling is peace, the most intense feeling is joy, and the most fierce feeling is temper. We cannot be bound or hindered by these feelings. We have to follow the will and be led by the will. If we do this, we will be able to run the race swiftly.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(13)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 8, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER Y. Y.</h2><p>I was born into a Buddhist family. Every time others asked whether I had sinned, I would answer proudly that I had never sinned. But a question remained in me: "What if I have sinned?" My older sister was the first in my family to believe in the Lord. Later I went and listened to the gospel myself and believed in the Lord that first day. On the same day I consecrated myself to the Lord. From that time onward, my life completely changed. I was like Mary who had chosen the best portion. I often got up in the middle of the night to pray. I studied medicine because even though there are many doctors in the world, I asked myself where I could find doctors who were spiritual. I began to preach the gospel almost every day, and I considered myself a spiritual doctor. I tired easily, but many people came to me for consultation, and I did not know what to do about it. Once I heard a voice which seemed to say, "Just follow the footsteps of the flock." Later I found the local church and was baptized into the Lord's name. I began to deal with my dress and my hairstyle. But I suffered persecution in the hospital. The sufferings I went through during that year were unprecedented in my whole life.</p><p>In 1942 I discovered that I had heart disease. The Lord told me, "I will be with you wherever you go." I could not believe this. He said again, "He who does not believe is condemned already." Later I met Brother Nee in Chungking. I asked him how one could hear God's word. He said that a proud person could never hear God's word. I realized that my service was only superficial. My attitude, words, and thoughts were all condemned by God. I felt that my walk and living before God were lifeless. Later I saw that I have died in Christ already and that I live in Him as well. If God wants to say something to me, I ask that He would be merciful to me and open my heart to receive it.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Not Being Self-conscious about Resurrection</h2><p>We do not have to lend a helping hand to resurrection. All we have to do is fall down before God, and we will find strength. God has His way of smiting man. While we are being smitten, we may think that everything is finished and gone because we do not see anything coming back to us. From our side, we feel that we are being stripped and emptied continually. But from the side of Aaron's rod, there is budding, blossoming, and even fruit-bearing. According to the type, all of these happen at night, while we are sleeping. The return of the power of resurrection is something that passes our feelings. When many people go through God's discipline, they try to engineer an artificial recovery. However, all they find is disappointment. We should only be conscious of our own weaknesses. We should not be conscious of any recovery or resurrection. Growth and resurrection are in God's hand; they are outside the realm of human consciousness. Parents cannot watch over their children constantly to see how many inches they have grown. Flowers will always blossom, but we do not know when they will blossom. The more thorough and strict God works on us, the better it is for us. We should not expect any conscious awareness of resurrection itself. The exceedingly great power of resurrection is upon us, but it must not remain in us only. The electricity in the wire is always flowing. As it flows, it lights the electric bulb. But as soon as the switch is turned off, the light goes out. The electricity is generated in the power plant and remains in the power plant, but it does not remain in the electric wire.</p><h2 class="head2">Death Being the Basis of Resurrection</h2><p>Resurrection life is a wonderful thing. No one can grasp resurrection. However, we always know when the Lord's cross is applied to us. As we move on in the way of discipline, we will experience resurrection. We should only be concerned about our own condition; we do not have to worry about how much resurrection we have received from the Lord. Silently and without our noticing it, resurrection will manifest itself in us. After God's dealing hand has been upon us for a while and we experience recovery and resurrection, we will find ourself being empowered. As we go on in this way, God will smite us until we become as good as dead. We will lose all hope, as if we are completely and totally dead. Then all the conditions for resurrection will be in place.</p><p>Before a man dies, he will hope for resurrection. He will want to receive power and grace. But death is the prerequisite to resurrection. We have to pray for light. As soon as light shines, we will see our own evil and weakness, and we will realize that we are useless, hopeless, and dead. Then we will experience resurrection. Therefore, when we are weak, we do not have to ask to be strong. When we are useless, we do not have to ask to be useful. When we are unclean, we do not have to ask to be holy. We only need to ask for light. Once light comes, we will be finished and dead. Then subconsciously God will bring resurrection to us.</p><p>Without death, there can be no resurrection. What a big contrast there is between death and resurrection! Suppose we have seen our own weaknesses. Having lost all hope, we will realize that we are evil beyond all hope, and we will not even expect any blessing. We no longer look for resurrection because we have lost all hope, even the hope of resurrection. Seemingly, this is a contradiction. Actually, this is the time we experience resurrection. We think that resurrection is something that God gives to us. This is why we look to God to somehow grant us resurrection in the midst of His dealings. We forget that resurrection is based on death; without death there is no resurrection. We can say that one prerequisite of resurrection is losing all hope. Another prerequisite of resurrection is extreme weakness. We have to remember that the seed of resurrection is planted in death. God takes care of resurrection; we only need to pray for light. All we have to do is see that we are weak beyond all hope. The most basic error that man commits is in hoping to be not as weak and corrupt as he is. He sees that he is poor, so he asks God for grace, for the power of recovery. But the more he does this, the less he dies. If he does not die, how can he be resurrected? Many people pray for recovery before they have even died. This is a big frustration. Everyone wants to climb up, but God wants to bring us down. The lower we go, the closer we are to death. As we take a step further towards death, we take a step further towards resurrection. Once we die, we resurrect. This is the way we touch resurrection. Those who try to climb up before they die are moving further and further from death. As a result they are also moving further and further from resurrection. The more they move, the less chance they have to experience resurrection.</p><h2 class="head2">The Killing Light</h2><p>I will mention another important matter: We need light to bring us to death. If we have not received scorching light, we should ask for it. It is true that we are weak enough, but when light comes, it makes us even weaker. When we become extremely weak, we die. We are like the lepers; the more the leprosy breaks out in the body, the better it is. When the whole body is covered with leprosy, the leper becomes clean. Scorching light brings us to nothingness. Logically speaking, how can a man resurrect if he has never died? Without death there cannot be the possibility of resurrection. Therefore, any grace that we claim before death takes us further from resurrection. Life, gift, and work should only come to us after death. Genuine light will remain with us until we die. This is not the time to ask for life, power, resurrection, and the new creation. This is the time to ask for a thorough shining of the great light. If we are in weakness, we should not ask for power immediately. Death does not require power. It is God's mercy that we can die. Without death, there can be no life. Those who have not passed through death cannot have resurrection. I hope that the brothers and sisters see this. When you are weak, you should not seek for power, but for light. When you find evil in you, you should not ask for an increase in life, but for a stronger shining of the light. You have to say to the Lord, "I need more light, greater light, intense and absolute light from You."</p><p>The mistake of our human nature is to seek to be useful when we find out that we are useless. Has anyone ever realized that resurrection only comes after a consciousness of extreme uselessness? Those who find death working in them, but who do not overcome in the end, are engaged in an act of suicide. Those who are able to overcome in the end enter the realm of resurrection. This does not mean that we should seek death in order to have resurrection. We should not think that we can exchange death for resurrection. All we should do is put ourselves under God's shining. We should say to Him, "I do not ask for power or anything else. I only ask for light." Our incompetence is absolute, and our corruption is thorough. When we lie down in bed tonight, we do not know if we will rise up tomorrow. It is strange that many people want to resurrect before they die. The light has not done enough work in them, yet they seek for recovery and resurrection. Let me repeat that we should not pray for resurrection or for power before we have died. We should only pray for the Lord's mercy and light. We have to allow the Lord to shine on us until we fall flat on our face. We should not accept help lightly or prematurely when it comes to the matter of resurrection. Asking for resurrection before we have died is the greatest hindrance we can pose. The Lord wants us to fall down, not to climb up. It is impossible for a person, who has not received an intense and absolute shining and who has not crumbled completely, to ask for resurrection. Resurrection is God's business, not ours.</p><p>Another thing we should beware of is looking inwardly at our spiritual journey. We should never look inwardly to find out if we have received any light. This is most foolish. We should trust in God's shining. We should trust in His mercy and trust that He will bring us into resurrection. If we want to be useful in His hand and want to serve as a deputy authority, we need more shining. The more we see our own weakness and corruption, the closer we are to death, and consequently the closer we are to resurrection. Any "grace" that we grasp hold of before we experience the shining of the great light is a delay to resurrection. We have only one basic need before the Lord, which is to know ourselves as God knows us. God exposes us through the light, and we know ourselves through the light. May the Lord be gracious to us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(14)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 9, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER H. F.</h2><p>I was saved in 1924. After I became a Christian my parents began to persecute me. My father said that I could not remain in the house because my whole family was in turmoil because of me. I was sent to a seminary in Nanking and studied there for over three years. After I returned home, my father would not allow me to go out again. Instead, he told me to do my preaching at home. Between 1927 and 1936 I was mostly at home. That time was foolishly spent. The only lesson I learned was submission to family authority. Later I went to Shanghai and lived at Hardoon Road for a year, fellowshipping with the brothers and sisters. Later I felt to have a little house of my own in order to forget everyone else and live by myself. I avoided the brothers and sisters and would not fellowship with them. In 1947 the church in Shanghai began to preach on handing oneself over to the Lord and to the church. I handed myself over at that time. Since then I have lost the freedom to go wherever I want. The church decided that I should move to Customs Lane in Foochow, and I obeyed. After I listened to Brother Nee's messages, I received the supply and was enlivened. When I was in Shanghai, others criticized me for being a closed person. I kept what I knew and would not ask others about what I did not know. Others have told me that I was proud. But this is the way I am. What can I do?</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>A cold person always wants to hide himself and shy away from others. Some people live by the outer man. While their outward activities still continue, their inner man sinks. This is our sister. Her inner man has sunk. Your spirit has sunk, but still you are trying to live by the outer man, that is, by the emotion, thoughts, and ideas. But they are not enough to support you. Your spirit is not strong enough. This is the reason you have become what you are. When you see yourself under God's light, your spirit sinks, and many spiritual things become tasteless to you. This is like a sick man who knows that he should eat but does not have an appetite for any food. Our sister only has spiritual knowledge but does not have spiritual reality. She does not have any spiritual interest and has lost her appetite for spiritual things. You can go on being a Christian, but you will live according to cold knowledge. Fortunately, you have not found a good house. If you had, you would have moved in and hidden yourself. But even if you were able to do that, such solitude would be boring after a while. When your spirit is down, you try to run away from any environment. When your spirit has lost touch with God and you are void of light, you are in darkness and sorrow, and you cannot touch God.</p><h2 class="head2">The Breaking of the Outer Man</h2><p>If we do not have God's light, all outward things become meaningless and tasteless, and all outward circumstances become boring to us. Then God has to do two things. First, He has to deal with our outer man, for the outer man can never replace the inner man. God does not want us to sustain the inner life with anything outward. He does not want us to live by a strong emotion. Nor does He want us to live by a strong will. The Lord will take this opportunity to break and dry up our outer man. We will become discouraged, pessimistic, and negative, and we will realize that there is less and less of a chance for the outer man to reassert itself. Outwardly speaking, this seems discouraging, but by then our outward abnormal activities will have ceased. In other words, the disobedient acts of the outer man will have stopped. This is the benefit on the negative side&mdash;the improper activities are stopped. If the inner man has sunk but the outer man is still active, you will have a problem. It is a good thing that the outer man will not support the inner man when it is down, because this will save some time in the breaking work.</p><h2 class="head2">Living by Faith</h2><p>Second, God wants you to live solely by faith. When the outer man no longer supports the inner man or replaces it, our emotion, mind, and will recede to the background one by one. Then God will teach us the lesson of faith. It will be a kind of calm and cool faith, a faith that believes in all spiritual realities. We will believe that God's throne remains in heaven, that there is still authority in the Lord Jesus' name, that God's glory is above everything, that His victory cannot be overturned, that the Lord's resurrection has transcended over all, that Satan has been defeated, etc. On our side, our feelings and thoughts change. On God's side, nothing changes. In this life of faith, we will gradually crawl out of the tomb. One day by faith we will know what is fact and what is feeling. Facts do not need feelings to support them. A fact is a fact; it needs no evidence or testimony to prove it. It is bare fact, void of feeling, and without need of any aid. Then we will be able to believe in the fact and in the reality with a most unaffected faith. We will be able to believe as if we were a wooden image. For example, we believe that God is love. This does not mean that we feel that God is love or that we think that God is love. We believe in the fact that God is love. When we reach this point, we can say that our faith is pure.</p><p>God's children must be led to the point where their faith in God runs contrary to their own thoughts and is on a level that is beyond themselves. Job lost his family and possessions. He was even covered with boils. He could very well have said that God no longer loved him, that He hated him. But he worked his way out of himself. He acted in a way that ran contrary to his own thoughts. He was able to say in 13:15, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him" (KJV). Job went beyond himself to trust in God. His faith was based on fact, not on experience or feeling. This kind of faith is pure and undefiled. John Bunyan once said, "If God is right, come heaven or hell, I will still trust in Him." It is not a matter of heaven or hell, but our faith in God. Job believed God, and no material thing lent his faith any helping hand. Materially speaking, can we say that God loved Job? His experience consisted of nothing but bankruptcy, the death of his children, and the presence of boils all over his body! What kind of faith is this? This is pure faith. What God wants to do with us through such experiences (in whatever degree they come) is to leave us with nothing but the facts so that we will learn to have a pure faith.</p><p>You say that you want to climb back. This depends on what you mean. If by that you mean you want your outward feelings to come back, there is no such need. We do not need to recover our outward feelings. Of course, if God Himself wants to recover our outward feelings, that is a different matter altogether. Do you want to go up? There is really no such need. It is actually better to go down. We have to learn to live by the facts. What we need is a faith that comes from light; we do not need the many crutches of our feelings. There is no need to worry whether or not our outer man will rise up again. There is a great need for God's servants to live less by outward feelings. All they need is a simple faith that believes in the simple facts.</p><h2 class="head2">Receiving Supply from the Church</h2><p>On the positive side, you have to realize that the church is your supply. If you are by yourself and have closed yourself up, you are on the wrong track. Today we go on by following the footsteps of the flock. We will never go wrong if we serve God in a corporate way. The Christian life has nothing to do with acquiring more doctrines or feelings. When we live in God's light, go along with the supply of the ministry, and give ourselves to these things, our spirit will be strengthened spontaneously.</p><p>In conclusion, there are three things: First, God wants to remove the props of the outer man and to strengthen the inner man. Second, we need a pure life of faith, one that is not mixed with any feelings or thoughts. Third, it is very easy for God to lift up a person's spirit. As long as you go along with all the children of the Lord and receive light and revelation with them in the holy of holies, you spontaneously will be carried forward in God's flow of the age.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(15)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 10, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER P. C.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family, and it was difficult for me to be saved. While I was in my office one day, I asked out of curiosity if there was ever a man on earth who never lied. My boss told me that only Christians do not lie. I began to look for such ones in Christianity. Later I was saved in a China Inland Mission church. I became a seeking Christian and subscribed to The Christian as well as The Present Testimony. At the same time, I wanted to become rich, and the Lord had to stop me through an illness. By then I had been saved for two years already. After I returned home, my sickness went away, and I began to work in the Bible Society, hoping to have an opportunity to go to college and later to study in America. But the Lord caused me to become sick again, this time almost unto death. He showed me that the the world is about to pass away. I told the Lord, "I will crave the things in the world no longer." When I said this, my sickness went away. I intended to go to Chefoo to recuperate, but I wanted to take up a teaching job in order to spend time studying the Bible. Soon my school colleagues rallied together against me. One day I felt that they had insulted me too much. I lost my temper and hit some of them. They hit back, and there was a brawl. At that time Brother Witness Lee came to Chefoo and started the Lord's table, and I had already broken bread with the brothers there. I was overjoyed. But the school increased my work so that I could not go to the meetings. The Lord gave me a word, and I quit my job. Later I began to serve the Lord together with Brother Witness in the church in Chefoo. In 1940 I went to Shanghai and received some training. At that time I had tuberculosis and became sick again. I am like a piece of decayed wood that cannot be carved. For the past few years I have been downtrodden. I lost all interest in the work, my health deteriorated, and I became quite depressed. It is the Lord's mercy that I can come up to the mountain this time. As far as my health is concerned, I cannot even walk around. Thank the Lord that I saw something through the messages on Thursday and Friday. I am no longer struggling to climb up. This will only become a hindrance to me. I ask the brothers and sisters to pray for me.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">The Lord as the Center</h2><p>Many times a man suffers unexpected sickness. Many people think that the Lord will protect their health as long as they are working for Him. Since they have wasted themselves in His service, they think that He surely will preserve them. One day I became gravely ill and was vomiting blood. This came as a great surprise to me. I did not understand God's reason for doing this to me, and I fell into darkness. Perhaps it was because I did not follow the law of the physical body. But it also could have been God's dealing with me to remove my trust in myself. In 2 Corinthians 1 Paul spoke of his afflictions in Asia. He was excessively burdened, even to the point where he despaired of living, having the judgment of death in himself. (Response of death can be rendered "judgment of death" in the original language.) Although this death has yet to be executed, the judgment has been pronounced already. Paul realized that this was so that we would not "base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead" (v. 9b). How strict the apostle was in dealing with his self-love! With many people, as soon as they have an inkling of the judgment of death (such as being found with tuberculosis or vomiting blood), they are decimated, and they sink subconsciously into self-love. Actually, our whole life is a journey towards death. Even as we are sleeping in our bed we are walking towards death. Of course, the reality of death does not come to us until we experience such sicknesses as tuberculosis. Then it seems as if a death pronouncement has been made on us; we sense the transience of human life, and everything seems to be finished.</p><p>When a man is at his critical hour, death becomes real to him. His self-love is severely threatened. Even his own life is at risk. At such times his future hinges on how he reacts to the blows. He may lose his future and everything else. Many times a question will arise in him: "What do I really believe? What am I hoping to receive?" If our faith is based on our physical life, we will only find spiritual respite and faith when our physical life revives. Subconsciously, this means that our physical life has become the center of our being; even our spiritual life is something ancillary. The result of making our own life the center is that every spiritual thing in us leaks away at critical junctures. They leak away like water leaking from a broken barrel. The best test of what is our center occurs when the Lord threatens our life a little. If the natural life is the center, we forget all spiritual work and service because we are about to die. If our natural life has become our center, it is good that God smites us because we have built up a wrong center in ourselves.</p><p>We should center everything around the spiritual things of God. Our center should not be our physical life. The result of having a wrong center is losing everything. Suppose a widow only has one son. She has consecrated herself to the Lord, along with her only son. If her son dies, her consecration will be greatly tested. She will feel as if the floor has collapsed under her. She will say, "All of my prayer, trust, and consecration have come to nothing." This immediately shows that her whole life has been revolving around her only son. The same can be said of our physical life. If we have centers other than the Lord, our true nature will be exposed as soon as these centers are threatened.</p><p>Basically a Christian should be clear where his center lies. The subconscious center of many people is themselves. If their center is the spiritual life and the Lord, it will not matter whether ten physical lives are lost. When we become sick, we should not ask for recovery. Instead, we should let go of the matter. There is no need to worry or hope for anything. If our life fails, let it fail. We have to confess humbly that our center has been wrong. We have to turn back to the Lord and acknowledge Him as our only hope. Every saint should learn this basic lesson. We should find out whether or not our center is Christ. Actually, we may have many centers in addition to Christ. We can ask God why He is not merciful to us and why He deals with us as He does. However, we will realize that our center is not the Lord but ourselves only when death is knocking at our door. This is the reason you cannot rise up. You have to discard all the things that contribute to your self-centeredness. Now is not the time to recover your faith and work. Your center is wrong. If you recover your former faith, service, and zeal, it will not do you any good. The Lord's purpose is to remove your very person. Many people do not touch God's center, and they hold on to everything. This is wrong. You should say to God, "I thank You. I can let go of everything. The God whom I serve is still the Yes. God, let everything that can fall fall! Let everything that can be removed be removed! Even if something can be recovered, I do not want it. If this thing has not passed through death, what good will it do me to seek after it? God, my life is in Your hand. I will let go of everything!"</p><p>No human worry will resurrect you. No human hope will resurrect you. The only One who can resurrect you is the Lord. If your center is the Lord, your course will be straight. The Lord is everything! May the Lord deliver you out of other centers. Some workers have the work as their center. How foolish this is! The work is not the center. Nothing is the center. A man cannot have any center other than the Lord. The Lord alone is the center. Only this will give you the full rest. Any center apart from the Lord will be destroyed by Him. Do not think that this is cruel. This is your protection; it keeps you on the straight pathway. You should have no center other than the Lord. His hand is gradually destroying everything other than Himself. He will not allow anything else to remain. Ephesians 1:10 says, "Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him." Unless the Lord becomes your very center, you cannot serve Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(16)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 12, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER W. C.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. In my youth I heard many Bible stories. At the age of sixteen I began to turn against all religions. In 1935 I graduated from school and became a teacher. I heard the gospel at Fourth Street in Chefoo through Brother Witness Lee, who preached on the sinful woman in John 8. God showed me that I was a sinner as well. I was saved in a clear way. After my salvation I consecrated myself to the Lord, daily caring more for the gospel than for my own food. This peak condition did not last long. Soon I returned to my hometown and became cold toward the Lord. I stopped reading the Bible and praying, and I became the same as an unbeliever. Later the Lord allowed sickness to come to me. At first I almost became blind. Later I vomited blood. Both my grandfather and father died of tuberculosis. In my sickness the Lord spoke to me, saying, "Fear not. Only believe. Nothing is impossible for those who believe." I lay in bed for sixteen months. Although I was extremely weak physically, to the point that I would fall on my knees when I tried to stand up, I was empowered in my inward being. In 1939 I returned to Chefoo, and the Lord gradually recovered my fellowship with Him. The Lord has cleansed me within and without once again.</p><p>During my time in the church, the Lord would not let go of me in many things. I began to coordinate with the brothers and sisters to serve the Lord in the church. I am a timid person. Spiritually speaking, I sometimes find it hard to stand upon my feet. Inwardly, I often feel dry and am fearful of hardships along the way. I once heard Brother Nee as well as Sister Wang say that this way is narrow and hard. Later I went to Brother Witness Lee. Through fellowship I became clear that I should quit my teaching job and give all my time to the church. In 1943 there was a great revival in Chefoo, Shangtung, and I consecrated my all. I consecrated not only my possessions but my self and my whole family to the Lord. My great-grandfather once mentioned me by name and consecrated me to the Lord. As I recall that incident now, I realize God has honored his consecration. This time I said, "From now on, I will offer myself to You. I will give up my freedom." I do not know what the Lord will do to me in the future. I know that He has created me and redeemed me, and I should serve Him in an absolute way.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our brother said that at times he could not rise up, that he felt dry within. I hope that you will ignore these feelings from this point forward. Whether or not you can rise up, you should let go of your feelings. You should only commit yourself to the hand of the Lord, believing that the Lord can accomplish everything. He will spontaneously bring you through. There are many problems that we cannot overcome by ourselves. However, when we look to Him and draw near to Him, the problems go away. When a caterpillar walks, it does not consider whether it should move its eighth leg or its tenth leg first. If it did that, the problem with its mind would become a problem with its walk. In the end it would not be able to walk at all. If it does not think about walking, it will have no problem in the mind. When there is no problem with the mind, there is no problem with the practice, and it walks.</p><p>The more you try to deal with your inner dryness, burden, and debilitation, the less you will be able to get through. If you consider them a problem, they will become a problem to you. If you forget them and let go of them, they will go away. Sometimes we overcome problems by warfare, but sometimes we overcome problems by forgetting them. Many things have to be overcome with power and strength. But sometimes they are overcome by simply forgetting them. If we boast in our weaknesses and give up our struggling and our ways, His power will overshadow us. The secret lies in praying for a vision of God's riches. We should see the Lord's glory while we study the Word, pray, or fellowship with the brothers in the meeting. Once we see this, we will forget our weaknesses. The inward filling often is related very much to our forgetting, and our forgetting is related very much to touching the Lord. Once we touch the Lord, we will no longer look at ourselves.</p><p>Our brother told us that he once vomited blood, but through prayer he was healed. Since he has been on the mountain here, he has vomited blood again. We pray that the Lord would be merciful to him and heal him. There are three things we should know with regard to healing. First, we should not tempt God. Second, we should not accept the symptoms of sickness. Third, we should believe in the sufficiency of His grace for us. Timothy had a chronic ulcer, and Paul advised him not to drink water. At that time the Jews dug water cisterns under their houses and either collected rain water or directed other water into these cisterns. There was bacteria in the water, and it was not sanitary drinking water. Paul advised Timothy to take some wine (1 Tim. 5:23), which could warm and invigorate the blood. Paul had the gift of healing, and he healed many sick ones. But he did not heal Timothy. Timothy himself was also gifted, but he could not heal his own ulcer. God had no word for Timothy. Timothy did not say, "I can drink water, and I can drink wine," because this would be tempting God. Paul said that he could take some wine. Timothy would not tempt God by drinking the dead water from the muddy cisterns. Outwardly speaking, there is no difference in the conduct of those who tempt God and those who trust God. The difference lies in the fact that one does not have God's word and the other does. Outwardly speaking, there is no difference in the conduct of those who walk by God's word and those who walk without God's word. But if one stands up to walk without having God's word, he is tempting God. If he has God's word, he can ignore all rules of hygiene. When he does not have God's word, he cannot act contrary to any natural law. In the Gospels, the Lord healed the man with the withered hand because He had spoken to the man. Once the man had the Lord's word, he did not have to wait for his symptoms to go away; he only needed to believe that he was healed. He could ignore the symptoms of his sickness, stretch out his hand according to the Lord's word, and be healed. The Lord's word is trustworthy; symptoms are not trustworthy. The lame man did not need to wait until he became strong to take up his bed and walk. When the Lord told him to take up his bed, he took up his bed. If we have God's word, we do not have to consider our pulse or our fever. But if we do not have God's word, we have to abide by the rules of hygiene. Once we have God's word, we can be extreme; we do not need to be afraid of anything.</p><p>Only one third of Charles Stanley's lungs function, yet he is constantly engaged in open-air evangelism. The audience can range in number from two or three thousand to six or seven thousand. He has been preaching this way for thirty years. He has God's word, and there is no problem for him to work this way. But if one does not have God's word, such a thing would be suicide. If we have the Lord's word and can trust in Him, we can rise above all symptoms of sickness. When I am sick and I know that God wants to heal me with His word, I only need to deal with His word; I do not have to deal with the sickness itself. If God says that I will be healed, I only need to focus on God's healing; His word will stop my illness. If I continue to deal with the sickness itself, I will make God's word of none effect. I can rejoice when the fever goes down a little, but I do not need to fret when it goes up a little. If God has a word for us, we do not need to worry even if our fever goes up tomorrow. We do not have to listen to the blood cells, and our eyes do not have to be set on the thermometer. We lay hold of God's word. The fever and the blood cells are not our lords. The white blood cells can increase, but we do not have to worry about them. We need to learn to obey God's law. We can laugh at the fever; whether it is high or low is not our concern. We have to learn to trust in God's word, not the symptoms. If we have God's word, we have the spiritual reality, and this spiritual reality is more real than the symptoms of sickness.</p><p>I was once sick myself. However, God gave me His word and healed me. I only knew to answer to God's word. I only dealt with God's word and refused to deal with the symptoms of sickness. When God said that He had healed me, it meant that He had stopped the illness. If I had dealt with the illness again, I would have made God's word of none effect. I did not rejoice when the fever went down a little, and I did not fret when it went up a little. My eyes were not set on my temperature, but on God's word. My temperature and the number of blood cells were not my lords. Only the Lord is Lord. We should learn to smile at our fever and not be concerned with our temperature. We have to learn to trust in God's word, not in our symptoms. Only God's word is true; the symptoms are false. If God's word says that we are healed, we are healed. If God's word says that we are well, but we still spit blood, this is a time when our faith is being tested. God's word says, "You are healed," but the symptoms say, "You are not healed." At such times we have to believe in God's word, not in the symptoms. The sickness will change. In my experience, I was not able to believe at first because I did not have God's word. But one day His word came. Yet the symptoms became worse. I stood up and said, "Lord, if the symptoms are deceptive, I ask You to rebuke them." Within one or two hours, my sickness was gone. Do not forget what the Gospel of John tells us: God's word is truth (17:17).</p><p>I had problem with my lungs, kidneys, and pancreas. Even now I have a problem with my heart. In 1923 I had peritonitis for the first time. I was in bed for over a month. When I breathed I felt pain. I had a high fever, and the pain was excruciating. At that time Brother Simon Meek gathered some brothers and sisters to pray for me. When he prayed, I did not feel anything. Another sister (M. E. Barber) prayed, "Lord, no one praises You in the grave; if our brother dies, You will not have his praise." As she prayed, something broke through in me, even though the fever was still present, and I was still in pain. The next day I rose up and went to Lo-hsing Pagoda to work on the first issue of The Christian. If we do not have God's word, we should take care of our body. If we have God's word, we should never look at the symptoms. We should consider the symptoms temptations and lies. They cannot remain; they have to go.</p><p>Some sicknesses go away immediately. Others do not. Once I was sick, and I asked the Lord for healing. The Lord said, "The healing will not come that quick. But My grace is sufficient for you." He showed me a ship that was unable to sail on a river because of rocks. He said, "Do you want Me to remove the rocks so that the ship can go through, or do you want the water level to rise so that it covers the rocks, and the ship can sail through?" I was immediately clear within about the Lord's desire, and I said, "Lord, I do not ask for the removal of the problem but for the increase of grace."</p><p>Removing the rocks is one way, and increasing the water level is another way. Both are acceptable, and either is good. There is no sickness in this world that a Christian cannot overcome. If we have the Lord's word, our eyes should not be set on the symptoms. We must believe that God is faithful. We should only contact God's word. There is no need to look to the symptoms to justify our faith, and there is no need to worry if they contradict our faith. The rocks may still be around, but the water level has risen, not just a little but a great measure, and the ship is able to sail through. This is our way.</p><p>In summary, there are three things we should pay attention to: First, if we do not have God's word, we should not tempt God. Second, if we have God's word, we should not look at the symptoms. Third, if we have God's word but are not healed immediately, we should realize that His grace is sufficient. The Lord has no intention to leave us in sickness without granting us sufficient grace. Paul was sick, yet he labored more than anyone else. Sickness did not stop Paul from working, nor should it stop us from serving our God. We have to learn to be simple, committing ourselves to the faithful and trustworthy Lord. The Lord will deal with us according to what is best for us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(17)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 16, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER K. Y.</h2><p>I was born into a God-loving family. My parents loved the Lord very much. At the age of five or six, I had a consciousness of God's presence. In August of 1928 I was saved. I am an optimistic person. God dealt with me by putting a love for men's souls within me. When I was in Peking, I encountered some difficulties and hard circumstances, and I sought help from Brother Nee. At that time he was preaching on overcoming. I was constantly in frustration and pain, even to the point of death. Through Brother Nee's messages, I saw that Christ is my victory. When I looked at myself, I saw nothing but weaknesses, frustrations, and failures. But when I looked to Him, I received joy and peace. Later I moved to another place to work for the Lord, but no one was saved. I suffered for three and a half years. In 1948, the Lord arranged for me to come to Kuling Mountain. During my stay here, I suffer every day. I am buffeted every day. The Lord buffets me through the words of His servant. I cannot stand it. A few times I tried to run away. Sometimes I even wanted to kill myself. I can do nothing about myself. I hate myself. I love Brother Nee because the Lord has indeed spoken to me through him. Although I suffer so much outwardly, inwardly I am full of joy. May the Lord deliver me through His word.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Among all the testimonies that I have heard, no other testimony has used the words joy and suffer as much as yours. It seems that these are two extremes. On the one hand, you are easily touched in your emotion. On the other hand, you are hiding behind your feelings, and it is very difficult to touch you. You are a person who lives completely in your emotion. You are far from what your true self is. This is your biggest problem. You think that you have received some help in your emotion. Actually, you have not received any help at all. The word restriction does not apply to you at all. Your prayers are full of your emotion, and your spirit has never been released. Your emotion is so strong that it is impossible to separate it from your very self. Your prayers are so emotional that they are void of heart and reality. Your testimony was filled with rejoicing and sufferings from beginning to end, yet one did not find the Lord or the church in your testimony. When you feel joyful or painful, your whole being is taken hostage by your emotion. You should separate yourself from your joy and pain; that is, you should separate yourself from your emotion.</p><p>The Christian life has nothing to do with joy or pain. The Christian life should only be in Christ. Whether or not I feel joyful or painful means little. The main thing is whether or not I am in Christ. Only that which is spiritual is real. Your emotion and feelings are illusory. For example, your name is Chow, and my name is Nee. I have never in my life felt that my name is Nee. But whether or not I feel that my name is Nee does not alter the fact that my name is Nee. My name is Nee; this is a fact, not a feeling. How can you confuse your feelings with the facts in the spiritual pathway? It seems as if the Lord is not your Lord, but emotion is your lord. You simply cannot work for the Lord this way. Spiritual facts far transcend feelings. Before the Lord we should consider if our life is one that is in the Lord. You have only seen what you are in your emotion; you have not seen the facts that are true in the Lord. When we say that a man has eternal life by believing in the Lord Jesus, it does not mean that he will feel that he has eternal life. It means that he will have eternal life. This is a spiritual fact. Your whole being is immersed in your emotion, not in Christ. Once you realize that all the feelings in the emotion are false, you will be delivered from your emotion. Suppose I say that I am saved in Christ, yet I feel that I am perishing; this feeling is a lie. If you have any feeling that runs contrary to the facts in Christ, you should declare, "This is a lie." You have made your emotion your lord. You do not consult the Lord; instead you consult your emotion. This is your problem. You should not be so easily touched. You should praise God in the darkest room, saying, "God, Your throne remains in heaven; it is forever unchanging. Your throne never changes. You are forever trustworthy." Not only feelings of joy and pain, but all other feelings should be dissolved in the presence of His throne.</p><p>If we have faith within, we will touch the spiritual facts. These facts transcend all feelings. When an airplane is tens of thousands of feet above the earth, one only sees the brightness of the sun. But when one looks up from the earth, he may see nothing but layers and layers of clouds; he may not see the sun at all. He may even see lightning and hear thunder. Our walk is based on spiritual facts. We must forget how we feel. We must live above the doubting clouds, not below them. We must be so objective that everything we do is based on God's word. Even so-called spiritual feelings are not warranted. Once I could not believe in God's word. I told Him, "Lord, I am in doubt about everything. I only believe in Your word." It has been ten years since I said that, and I can still testify that God's word is faithful. If we build our faith upon God's word, we will move away from Satan's battlefield. In nautical studies, there is one kind of calculation called a "dead reckoning." It means to ignore everything. If you can set aside all your feelings and declare them false, you will be released.</p><p>Your condition is very serious. You have been deceived by your emotion for a long time, to the point that you can now no longer separate yourself from your emotion. When a man walks up a hill, he may feel that he has a temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit. But if one measures him with a thermometer, he will find that there is no fever. The hotness is only a superficial feeling; it does not reflect the true condition of the body. From today onward you cannot trust in any of your joyful or painful feelings. Even if heaven falls down on you, God's word will still stand. No matter how you feel, you have to remember that spiritual facts are the foundation of our Christian life. The facts are facts. If you believe them, you can praise God for them. If you cannot believe them, you should still praise God for them. Spiritual facts are contained in God's word. All we have to do is believe God's word. One brother pays attention to nothing but confession of sins. From morning till evening, he does not do any work; the only thing he does is confess. We know that such a one is deceived by Satan. It seems as if he exists for his confession. He confesses for what is true and he confesses for what is not true. I told him once, "Listen to me. From now on do not confess anymore. Just say to the Lord, `Lord, I can be wrong. But I cannot even tell what is right from what is wrong.' You should not try to differentiate between what is right and what is wrong, because it is not the right time. When the time is right, you can try to distinguish it." Not long after I said this, our brother was recovered. May the Lord use such incomplete words to deliver you from your problems, that is, from the falsehood in your emotion. May the Lord lead you to trust in His word alone.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(18)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 17, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER K. C.</h2><p>I have seen that my body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and is made for prayer. This is the reason I spend a few hours every day praying. Brother Nee returned from England in 1939 and spoke about God's purpose in creating man. At that time I made a strong consecration. I saw that anything that is not of Christ, no matter how good it may be, should be condemned. In 1942, I had many family affairs to attend to, but I could not move my hands because of weak health and rheumatism. Later the Lord gave me the faith to reject this physical weakness. My hands were healed, and I was able to do many things. In 1945 my health took a turn for the worse again. At one point there was blood in my sputum. Meanwhile I still had to take a job. I began to realize that I had loved myself too much and that I was full of the self in many things. My limbs were completely without strength, Satan was attacking me, and my heart was full of fear. I became very sick and my feet became numb. One brother came to visit me and told me to stand up by the Lord. I stood up by faith. (Prior to that I had been in bed for 85 days.) At first I was about to fall, but someone held me tight. I declared the Lord's victory immediately, and the fear and the weakness went away.</p><p>When Brother Nee called the meetings in Shanghai, my heart was somewhat cold at the beginning. But I looked to the Lord to provide an opportunity for me to attend. Later the Lord said to me, "You can never be wrong if you follow the footsteps of the flock." My inner man became stronger every time I opened my mouth in the meetings. When I heard the message on handing oneself over, I felt that I had become different. Now I am willing to serve Him under His headship and in submission to authority.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Before a man's body receives the infusion of life, others touch death when they touch such a body. With many people, the supply of the natural life has not run out. As a result, they are not conscious of God's supernatural life. Only after a man has lost his natural life supply does he begin to treasure the supernatural life of God. God supplies the resurrection life only to those who have need. Paul was characterized by the little strength he had in his natural life. Actually, his physical body needed much energy to sustain him for the work. He accomplished more work than ten strong men. Yet he was sustained by the supply of the spiritual life. This is the reason he could do what others could not do. Whenever he labored for the Lord, he derived his very breath and pulse from his faith in God. This was his characteristic. It tells us what kind of supply he received from God for his spiritual work. He was able to say, "For when I am weak, then I am powerful" (2 Cor. 12:10). The times when he was weak were the very times when he was strong. Those were his strongest times. Such a spiritual contradiction occurs as one pays the price to learn the proper lessons before the Lord.</p><p>We should remember the Lord's word: "My power is perfected in weakness" (2 Cor. 12:9). This weakness was a weakness that Paul accepted. He asked the Lord three times to have the thorn removed. Today we do not know what this thorn was. We only know that it referred to something that never left him, that irritated him and weakened him. Paul prayed three times and then stopped. From that day forward, Paul accepted this weakness. If it had been an unwelcomed weakness, it would have done him no good. Paul accepted this weakness. This is the reason he was different. This is the reason he could boast in his weakness and the reason the power of Christ could overshadow him. Sooner or later the day will come when a man bows his head and says, "I accept the weakness that the Lord has placed on me." Paul was not the only man who was weak, but he was one of the very few people who would accept his weakness. Most people bargain with God when they are weak. They have their own opinions. They murmur against God and wrestle with Him. These ones will not see the power of God perfected in them. We know that there are more weak ones than strong ones in this world. But this does not mean that everyone who is weak will experience God's power being perfected in him. God's power is perfected only in those who accept the weakness. A man has to go through many scorchings, refinements, strugglings, and perils before he will bow his head, accept his weakness, and say, "I do not understand how I was lifted up. Yet I am! God has brought me through. I am still physically weak, and my inward being is still crippled and imperfect. Yet I am alive! I have accepted my weakness. The Holy Spirit spoke through Paul when he said, `For when I am weak, then I am powerful.' It seems as if I am able to say the same thing now." Once you reach this point and accept your weakness, you will spontaneously experience the next step, which is "when I am weak, then I am powerful." As for you, you will only boast in your weakness.</p><p>One day your eyes will be opened, and you will see that weakness is not a hindrance to, but a manifestation of, God's power. From that day forward, you will be able to boast and glory in your weakness. Many people can memorize the words: "I boast in nothing of my own. I only boast in my own weakness, that the power of Christ may overshadow me." Yet they may not know what they are saying. You have to be brought to the point where you see that weakness is not a hindrance but a condition. Then you will no longer long for your former health. You will no longer feel sorry for your present weakness. You will no longer pity yourself for the loss of power or health. On the contrary, you will realize that your weakness is your boast and glory. Many people have been Christians for decades, yet they have always lived by their natural strength; they have never come face to face with God's power. Many people suffer physical weaknesses, yet they have never known the meaning of God's power. We should not ask for sickness or poor health, but if God permits sickness and weakness to come to us, we should seize these opportunities to touch and know God's power. If we have become weak through the loss of physical health, we should realize that this is our opportunity to touch God's power. Not every child of God has such a testimony of power. If the Lord puts us in a position where we can choose or reject chastisement, we should choose chastisement, because this will perfect God's power in our mortal, weak body. Twenty or more years ago, I saw the meaning of God's power, and I gladly chose weakness for myself. This is to boast and glory in weakness. The more I choose weakness, the more I express God's power and strength.</p><p>I hope we will learn to choose God's way in the environment which He has arranged for us. The shining and discipline we receive from the Holy Spirit vary. The choice we make depends on the kind of person we are. Rebellious ones always return empty-handed. They suffer from one fundamental drawback&mdash;they despise the Lord's chastisement, and they do not afford the Lord a chance to renew or reconstitute them. On the one hand, they have sacrificed the natural part of their constitution, but on the other hand, they have not received anything on the spiritual side. If we have never come under God's hand, our natural self will remain, while our spiritual deposit will still be empty. If we come under His hand, our natural self may be destroyed, but we will achieve something spiritually. Three things can happen: First, the natural elements can remain while the spiritual deposit remains empty. Second, the natural elements can be destroyed but the spiritual deposit can remain empty. Third, the natural elements can be destroyed and the spiritual goals can be achieved. The second kind is the poorest, while the third kind is the most blessed. I do not care for the first and second kind, because I do not want to be devoid of my spiritual deposit. It matters little whether or not my natural elements are still intact. The greatest loss that can happen to a man in his weakness is for him to negate and shut out God's power. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we would bow our head and accept all His work in us. If we do this, the natural elements may be destroyed, but the spiritual goal will be achieved. When we are so weak that we cannot choose anything or oppose the Lord anymore, then we are strong. If we do not look back or treasure our former strength or become jealous of others' strength when we are weak and powerless, we will be strong. May the Lord be merciful to us so that from now on, whether we are strong or weak, we no longer take the way of the world and no longer care for natural power. May we no longer follow our own cravings. May we remove all anxieties and worries. Instead, we should only boast in our weakness. If we do this, we will begin to understand God's power. We will be happy that we are weak. The Lord has arranged for this to happen to us so that in the process of losing our natural health we will discover what is spiritual.</p><p>Paul was raptured to the third heavens and received the revelation of the third heaven in a moment. He also received the revelation of Paradise in a moment. Yet he himself remained weak. He prayed three times (not three days) for his thorn to be removed. After the first prayer, perhaps he waited for a long time before he prayed again, but he was still weak. He prayed again and again for the thorn to depart from him. He prayed this way three times, but the Lord did not take the thorn away. Instead, He granted him the sufficient grace. This stopped his prayer. To those who have an ear to hear, the Lord's speaking is not a matter of frequency but a matter of intensity. Consider the Lord's word in 2 Corinthians 12:9: "My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness." Many in the church have read this verse thousands of times, yet they still have not touched anything. The Lord only asks us to touch it once. When we read this word, have we touched the spirit behind it? The woman with the issue of blood only touched the hem of the Lord's garment once, and the Lord acknowledged it. The Lord is sifting all the dregs of unbelief in us. It is not a matter of frequency, of how many times we have touched Him, but a matter of intensity, that is, of how deeply we have touched Him. Young people should not be impatient. They have to learn this lesson again and again and receive the deeper and deeper dealings. If God is merciful to us, He will guide us in a rich way; that is, He will guide us into weakness. The way of the cross is not finished with one encounter; the Lord forever leads us on. Time after time, we are led to deeper depths, further weaknesses, and more penetrating cuts of the cross. Those who are willing to take this way will know what weakness is and will know the meaning of strength and grace.</p><p>We must also consider the sovereignty of God as revealed in Romans 9. God's mercy leads us on time after time. If we fall into error, it is God's work that is destroyed. If we do not pursue after God, we get nothing. If we are too eager in our pursuit, we also get nothing. I have not seen one lazy man who is after the Lord's heart. Yet this does not mean that a man is approved when he is eager, impatient, or insistent in his pursuit. God has to break down the extreme impatience and insistence in us. He does not want us to be too hungry or too satisfied. One day we will look to the Lord for His mercy and revelation alone. Then our pursuit will be proper. Our overzealous pursuit will be over. We will prostrate ourself before the Lord and acknowledge that we have no strength or power in ourselves, that all we have is weakness, not power. We will acknowledge that if there is any power in us at all, it is God's power. If God does not grant us mercy, no one will find this way. Every spiritual realization is gained by paying a price before the Lord. If the Lord turned the clock back twenty-five years and asked us to choose the weak health that we have now, what would we do? We have passed through these experiences. But if the Lord gave us the choice of whether or not to go through them again, what would we choose? Those who know what weakness means would say, "This is what God has given me. I would not even consider another choice." We are not those who seek after good health. Too many people are seeking after good health and have failed to know God. At the same time, many people have come to know God through their weaknesses. We pursue God's way, His work, and good health for the sake of knowing God. If we set our mind on knowing God, every circumstance will become an opportunity for us to know Him. We will not be God's children in vain. If a man does not know God in his lifetime, he has wasted his whole life. May we be willing to accept His dealings in all circumstances so that we may know Him more.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(19)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 19, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER D. Y.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. My father loved the Lord. In 1932 I was married, and that winter I took hospitality with a friend who talked to me about the Lord many times. I argued with her often, yet I realized that many believers have a change in their living. Later I was touched by Brother Witness Lee when he preached on grace and truth, and I believed in the Lord. I testified to my family and took them to the meetings. Formerly I had been zealous for religion and thought that I was quite good. At that time I was still ignorant of the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Yet every time I was somewhat off in my conduct, I would be rebuked and would deal with it. In John 21 the Lord speaks of following Him singleheartedly. My husband was put into prison for political reasons, and I went to visit him in Hankow. The doctor said that he was in the third stage of tuberculosis and was hopeless. I felt it would be a shame if I were to lose my husband at such a young age. When I saw him, I exhorted him to accept the Lord. He nodded and soon after died. On my way home, I wanted to jump off the train and kill myself. But something within reminded me that suicide does not result in salvation. I did not want to go into perdition so I did not jump. After I returned home, the brothers and sisters all came to visit me. Brother Lee also came to visit me, comfort me, and pray for me. One day the Lord told me that it is not a shame for me to remain single, but it is for the purpose of glorifying God. In 1940 Brother Witness Lee sent me a telegram and asked me to go to Shanghai to have fellowship with the brothers and sisters. Later my mother became sick and died. My adopted son also became sick. For a few days I did not eat. I asked the Lord, "Why do You treat me so harshly? My husband and mother have passed away, and now my son is sick. Are You going to take him away too?" The Lord told me, "I am a jealous God." I realized that the Lord is better than everything. Peace came to my heart. I was able to eat again, and soon my child became well. Later I returned to Chefoo from Shanghai and became seriously sick. I had bronchitis, my stomach was not good, and my mental state was unstable. Through prayer I gradually recovered. I am willing to hand over myself to live in the Body. Brother Lee said, "You know that you cannot make it, but the Body can make it. What the Body has inherited is what you have inherited." This word comforted me. I am willing to pay the price, but I do not know how. I do not know what I should do. I hope that our brother will give me a word of guidance.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Whether or not a ministry is high and adequate depends not only on the kind of light it renders but on whether the light is strong enough. Light has to be so strong that it burns and scorches a person and puts a halt to his work. Ministry does not mean that a man hears the word first and then reacts to the word after some time. As soon as the word comes, a man should react. Under normal circumstances, a man is broken as soon as light comes.</p><p>As far as our sister's condition is concerned, we can say that God has done some breaking work in her. However, I am not saying that the breaking is complete. Her past experiences show us that she has followed the Lord indeed, and the Lord has used her indeed. Yet she has to follow the Lord more absolutely and thoroughly before she can be of better use to Him. Her experiences with her husband's and mother's deaths, her son's sickness, her uncle's and aunt's treatment, and the political turmoil she has gone through all speak of one thing&mdash;that God's hand has been clearly behind her environment. God did these things to increase her usefulness.</p><p>I feel that there is a famine in the knowledge of God in all the local churches. Every brother and sister should increase his or her usefulness. When some become sick, they become broken vessels in the Potter's hand. Our sister must continue to humble herself under the mighty hand of God so that she can learn more. Peter spoke too quickly. But our sister needs a quickness like Peter's. We should humble ourselves more under the mighty hand of God. We should allow His smiting to increase. We should give God the total freedom to chastise us. Only those who have learned much can dispense much. If we are totally crushed by the Lord, we will bear fruit. God desires to see a harvest of the work that He has done in us. Some harvests brings thirtyfold, some sixtyfold, and some a hundredfold. Two people can receive the same dealings and sufferings, but the amount of fruit they bear may be different. Let me say an earnest word: A person does not have several husbands to lose, more than one mother to lose, too many children to lose, or too many times to get sick. If our sister has not yielded fruit from these experiences, she has suffered in vain, her husband has died in vain, her mother has died in vain, and her children would have died in vain. With some people, when their husband dies, their spiritual world is gone; they themselves become useless and have no fruit to satisfy God.</p><p>We do not have too many years to waste. In a short time we will find ourselves middle-aged and soon after that an old man. It is a pity that our sister's past sufferings did not bear enough fruit. It is all right for us to go through just a little experience, but we have to gain much from whatever we go through. Only those who have gained much will have much to give to others. We cannot let the sufferings and the smitings go away easily. Our sister has experienced much. She should have learned much, have gained much, and have much to give to others. Otherwise, she has wasted her time. Some can reap a hundredfold when they sow their seed. If I can only reap thirtyfold, it means that I have suffered a loss. If we are willing to put ourselves in the Lord's hand and to allow Him to work deeper in us, we will bear abundant fruit. The way to serve God is to allow Him to work deeply in us in all of our experiences. We should not let Him go. This is the only way to have abundant fruit, and this is the only way to meet the need of all the places. Whenever we have an experience, we should allow the Lord to do a thorough work. We do not face political turmoil all the time. We do not experience loss and separation from our family too many times in our life. We have to take advantage of our environment and humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God. We should say to Him, "God, may Your work be thorough in me. I gladly place myself in Your hand." If we gain a little when we go through one suffering and a little more when we go through another suffering, after ten times or more, we will bear some fruit. If you suffer this way, I can share your tears. You will have fruit; your suffering will not be in vain, and my tears will not be shed in vain. If we can reap such abundant fruit time after time, many will come to know the Lord, and the outward needs will be met. It is most pitiful if we can only reap a little fruit. May the experiences we gain every day not pass away in vain.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(20)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 20, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER J. C.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. I studied in a non-Christian school and joined my classmates and teachers in opposing Christ. In 1934 I attended an evangelistic meeting and was touched to accept the Lord one night. After I believed in the Lord, I prayed with tears for my unbelieving family. My father was put into prison for his business, and my mother became sick from anxiety over my father; she vomited blood. I became quite worried and wept often. In one revival meeting, I consecrated myself to serve the Lord. Later I met with the church in Tung-An, Fukien, and was baptized in 1938. My father stayed in prison for six years and accepted the Lord during this time. Two years after my mother became sick, she passed away. After staying in jail for six years, my father was found not guilty and released. Because of my father's bankruptcy and my mother's death, I could not pray for two years. One day the Lord told me that I had to humble myself under His mighty hand. For three years I stayed quietly at home. The deep shock stripped me of all burden for the gospel; I could not open my mouth anymore. In April of 1947 my family was robbed by bandits. Thank God for His grace. I was spared from any danger. Later Brother Nee allowed me to come to Foochow to be trained. It is the Lord's mercy that I can be on the mountain now to receive the training.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>In the four Gospels we see many people being healed yet receiving no spiritual blessing. Their physical eyes were opened, but the eyes of their heart were still closed. The four thousand and five thousand who ate the fish and the bread were fed materially, yet they were not fed spiritually. Both Lazarus and the son of the widow came back to life, yet they were not transcendent and victorious in any way. This is a basic principle: A man can go through many experiences with the Son of God yet be still void of any spiritual blessing. Those who were fed with bread could be fed again and again, but they would still not have received the spiritual blessing. This is a big problem. Although our sister encountered many troubles, such as misfortunes with her father, mother, bandits, etc., and although she has received some spiritual blessing, I feel that the light she has received is still too weak. Although she can thank the Lord for His grace, she still does not realize how great this grace is. Although she has experienced some sufferings, she does not realize how deep the sufferings are, nor does she realize how obvious God's hand behind these things is. Some are veiled in their eyes; they cannot see. They know that they should thank the Lord for many things, but they do not know what they should thank Him for. This is like a lame man who is able to walk again. He only knows the fact. He only realizes that his sickness is healed. Yet he does not understand the spiritual benefit of this healing. Whether or not a man has received spiritual benefit from an encounter depends on how much light he has received from it.</p><p>The crux of the matter is whether or not one encounters the Lord's great light in the midst of all his difficulties and trials. When some people go through difficulties, their inner being is enlightened, and they realize what the Lord is doing. Others realize the Lord's sovereign hand in everything, yet all they see are the outward facts; they do not know anything about the inward reality. The five thousand who were fed might have gone home thanking the Lord for His compassion and love. What they said might have amounted to more than what they ate. Yet they only touched the outward bread; they did not see the great light before God. They only knew that the Lord is rich and that there is a rich supply with Him. Behind every trial there is God's light. Those who receive mercy see the light. The supply and charm of this light enlighten their understanding like flashes of lightning in a darkened sky. Everything becomes clear. Suffering can make us understand what we otherwise could not understand.</p><p>Was God dealing with Job merely concerning his sons, his houses, and his livestock? These things were dealt with, but in addition to dealing with these things, God had another purpose in mind, which did not relate at all to Job's children, houses, and livestock. There was another far more hidden issue: Job himself needed to be dealt with. Job's children, houses, possessions, and livestock were not the target of God's dealings; Job was the target. You have to see that God was actually dealing with you when He was dealing with your father. In dealing with your mother, He was also dealing with you. It is not enough for a person to see that God is dealing with his children, houses, and livestock. He has to see that in addition to these things, there is another far more hidden thing which God is dealing with&mdash;himself. When he sees this, his eyes will become bright. If another Job would join us today and testify in our meeting that his three- or four-story house, which was covered with red tiles, was blown down by the wind because it was too high, this testimony would only expose his darkness. He would still be far from the goal of God's dealing. If we were to hear such a testimony, we would surely sigh, saying, "Job, God is not dealing with your house. He is dealing with you." Job had houses, children, livestock, and camels, and all of these needed to be dealt with. Yet even if he did not have all these, he still needed to be dealt with. God's dealings are never focused on the individual things alone. It is a pity if a man's mind is set on these things alone. God deals with you through dealing with your parents, family, and environment. The one who is attached to your parents and who is behind all things is yourself.</p><p>When our Lord was on the earth, those who witnessed the miracle of the breaking of bread only saw the bread, those who witnessed the healing of the lepers only saw the healing, and those who witnessed the healing of the blind only saw the opening of the eyes. The grace they received was too shallow. Here is a grace that is far greater than the visible bread, the healed leprosy, and the enlightened blind man. If these ones had received more than healing and bread, there would have been more than twelve disciples at that time. Every major dealing must be understood in a major way, a profound way. If all you saw during the past six years were the things and events themselves, it is a pity. If God is merciful to us, He can deal with us in a great way and speak to us great things through the smallest incidents. God can speak spiritual things to us through material things. A toothache may be a small thing and tuberculosis may be a big thing. But to God, healing one is just as easy as healing the other. Many people are trapped in medical healings or in matters having to do with their family, their spouse, their children, or their money. They have no idea what the feeding of the five thousand and the four thousand means. They only know that God's grace is manifested through these miracles. This is the principle of eating bread and being filled (John 6:26). If we are not careful and our eyes are set on the trials around us, we will be taking the way of "eating bread" as well. We will only know the grace of the bread; we will not know the God who imparts grace. We have to be delivered from touching merely the superficial things that surround us. We have to see that the Lord is dealing with our very person. In Job's experience, we find God dealing with his self-righteousness.</p><p>A small revelation often is a hindrance to bigger revelations, a small blessing often is a hindrance to bigger blessings, and a small grace is often a hindrance to greater grace. In dealing with us and trying us, God is not only dealing with the things around us. He does not want our eyes to be set on the trials and the things around the trials. He has far greater things that He wants us to see. God intends to speak great matters of spiritual significance to us through our surroundings. Once the great matters are settled, the small matters will be resolved. God wants us to lift up our eyes to see the kind of persons we are. Once we see this, other problems will be solved easily. Many people only pay attention to the scourging when they are scourged. They may even have received some benefit from the scourging. But others who are scourged receive great light; they see what God wants to do through them. This is to know great things through small incidents. Although the incidents are small in themselves, the transaction is great. Children, houses, and livestock are small things. They are for the purpose of perfecting the great things. You can pray to God for His guidance, saying, "Lord, what is the deeper and greater thing that You are dealing with me about?" Humanly speaking, the deaths of Job's sons, the collapsing of his houses, and the perishing of his livestock were big things. God's finger and work, however, only point to one thing, which is what God Himself wants to do.</p><p>You can ask God to grant you the light to see the great thing that He is doing. Once you see it, everything is settled. You have to realize that God may deal with you through this and that means, but His finger is always pointing to one thing. Once you see that one thing, God's will is fulfilled. Therefore, none of God's dealings come in a fragmentary way. If you see the great thing, the small blessings will not mean much to you. If you dwell on the small things, you will miss the great thing. If your dealings are fragmentary, your blessings will be fragmentary. If you do not see the central, great issue that the Lord has for you, but instead dwell on the fragmentary things, you will become proud. Job was very strong-willed. He had to be hit with item after item before he fell down on his face and said, "I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear,/But now my eye has seen You;/Therefore I abhor myself, and I repent/In dust and ashes" (Job 42:5-6). In your past experiences, you only saw the superficial things; you did not see the things beyond the dealings themselves. You have to realize that God's dealing involves things far higher than what you can imagine. Once you touch those things, you will be able to render help to others. May the Lord be merciful to you so that you do not dwell on the small things. Even if you deal with the small things fifty times, they will still come back to you. There will be a fifty-first time. But if one is dealt with in the fundamental and great issue, he will overcome the other things even when they come back the fifty-first, the five hundredth, or even the thousandth time.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(21)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 22, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER S. D.</h2><p>I was born into a Buddhist family. At one time I was a Buddhist monk. At the age of eight or nine I began to love chanting, and at the age of ten I began to listen to Buddhist sermons in the temple. I knew that the world is evil, and I desired to reach Nirvana and to save all beings. I was a monk for nine years. My brother was a businessman and had been a Christian for over ten years. His whole family believed in the Lord, and they sent me gospel literature many times, hoping that I would believe in the Lord. Once an elderly believer spoke with me at length about the gospel. When he began to pray, his expression reminded me of heaven. I felt that there is indeed a true God in this universe. Later my brother wrote me and told me that my father and family had all believed in the Lord. My mother was sick and no doctor could cure her, but through prayer she was healed. At that time I saw that Buddhism is a big mess. I was vomiting blood. I began to ask God to heal me. A few days later my vomiting stopped, and I accepted the Lord Jesus. After I was saved, I sought the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Once while I was praying, I became acutely aware of my extraordinary sins and peculiar disposition. I wept bitterly for half an hour, after which I felt happy inside. One Buddhist teacher that I used to learn from came and visited me and demanded that I immediately answer whom I would choose, Christ or Buddha. I told him that I wanted Christ. After I was saved, I was like a madman for half a year. I was intensely zealous, and I preached the gospel to whomever I met.</p><p>At one point I began to come under Satan's attacks and fell into darkness. I argued with Satan. He accused me regarding the many sins I committed as a youth. I dealt with my sins and placed them under the cleansing of the precious blood of the Lord one by one. My heart loves the Lord and I desire to go into the villages to preach the gospel and to suffer for Him. The Lord said that I have to give up everything to follow Him. Formerly, I dared not say this, but now I do. Once I was sick, but I did not take any medicine. God alone has been sustaining me. For seven or eight years I did not receive any financial support from my family or from the church. I taught in a village and supported myself this way. In 1941 I was introduced to Brother Nee through Brother Ji Yung-tung, and I was told that I could go to Shanghai to be trained. I have written a note of consecration and have handed over myself and my all to Him. I weep and repent often for the years that I have wasted. I hope that my brother will grant me much light.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Purging Rawness</h2><p>Two or three months ago, while I was in a prayer meeting in the church in Shanghai, I met our brother for the first time. This is the second time I have seen him. Brother Shia has to learn to launch his spirit further into deeper depths in God. He has to learn to grow and be matured. When a man first begins his pursuit in God, everything with him is raw and "uncooked." Anything that is raw needs to be cooked. In our pursuit of the Lord, we have to drop what is raw. Before a person believes in the Lord, everything with him is raw. Even his righteousness and morality are raw. His entire living is raw. But after he has followed the Lord and learned some lessons for a while, the raw things drop off. The deeper the cross works on a person, whomever he may be, the less raw he becomes. God grants us sufferings and chastisements not only to afflict us but to remove our rawness. Every time we go through trials, sufferings, or chastisements, we should reap some benefit not merely in our thoughts, feelings, or emotions; our spirit should be purified through these processes as well. Our brother's spirit is scarcely touched. We only find the fruit of the mind and the emotion in him; we find very little fruit of the spirit. This is the basic problem. Every experience should purify a man's spirit. Two of the Lord's disciples asked Him to send fire to burn up the cities of Samaria, but the Lord told them that they did not know their spirit. Our brother's trouble is that he does not know his spirit. Many people can talk. They are zealous, and they have pure motives, but they never know their spirit. It is not enough to have fruit in the emotion and to realize that the Lord is love. Love comes from the emotion, while teaching comes from the mind. But the spirit needs frequent dealings before it can be purified.</p><h2 class="head2">A Stricken Spirit</h2><p>Christianity is not about changing the mind or the emotion; it has to do with the purifying of the spirit. Let me illustrate my point this way. A naughty boy may be severely punished by his father. At first he may think that the father has been too harsh. But later he will think that his father loves him and that he was wrong. In his mind he knows that he should be punished, and in his emotion he realizes that his father punishes him out of love. But these feelings only reach as far as the emotion and the mind; they have not produced a stricken spirit in him. If they have produced a stricken spirit in him, he will be sober after he has been punished. He will no longer make noise at the dinner table, and he will no longer be naughty. He will no longer be rowdy in his bedroom. Instead he will calm down. He will feel ashamed of the things he has done. This is the expression of a stricken spirit. We can say that he has the mark of the cross. In our service to the Lord, God deals with us in such a way that our mind and emotion are touched and our feelings before God are changed. However, in His dealing, something is seared into our spirit so that our spirit is stricken as well. The pain, the shame, and fear that we bear at the time of being stricken remain fresh in us. Everyone who has passed through the cross has a mark on him, the mark of a stricken spirit, which remains in him day by day. He can no longer be careless or jovial but bears a wound with him. Only such ones can impart life to others. Every time we suffer, it is for the purpose of producing a stricken spirit. Take the example of the child that we spoke of earlier. When his spirit becomes haughty and loose again, he will suffer another chastisement from his father. Every time we are chastised by God, we should end up with a chastised spirit. This is how our spirit is purified. This does not mean that we will no longer speak to our Father or that we will no longer dare to do anything. It means that our spirit will become different.</p><p>Naughtiness, looseness, and carelessness are marks of rawness in man; they are reflections of his original state. Such a one has to pass through the fire before he is "cooked." There is a mark with those who have a stricken spirit&mdash;they become fearful of God. They bear a spirit of fear within them. They are not only changed in their attitude, words, emotions, and thoughts, but they bear the expression of chastisement in their spirit. Such an expression is demonstrated through their daily life. Those who have a stricken spirit simply have it. When others touch it, they know it. Those who do not have the scar of the cross do not have it, and others know it; no one can fake this. We encounter sufferings and chastisements all the time. It would be a pity if these do not produce a stricken spirit in us. Every time God sends us suffering, it is for the purpose of producing a stricken spirit in us. If this is not produced in us, we are wasting our time. This is the way of the cross, and this is the way to spirituality. After the Lord resurrected, He allowed Thomas to touch the wound in His hand and His side. After we are wounded by the cross, we also should have clear marks of the cross in us. This is the way to be delivered from rawness. Daily we should live in this spirit of chastisement. Such a spirit will keep us from acting rashly or speaking carelessly. A person with such a spirit will come to God in fear and trembling. He will no longer be rough and coarse; he will become tender.</p><p>Our brother has to have a purified spirit. The Lord has done a great work in him. He has suffered over ten years, from 1936 to 1948. If he has not learned the lessons, he has wasted all this time. I have been too frank with you, but I cannot hide anything. Do not replace the fruit of the spirit with the works of the emotion and the mind. The spirit should not be entangled or polluted by the emotion and the mind. It should be fearful, disciplined, and careful. I feel that your spirit has been too free. It should bear the mark of the cross. In your speaking and praying, you should have the scar of the cross. A loose spirit is raw and cannot edify others. A rubber tree that has not been cut cannot supply others with its sap. A man who has not passed through the cross cannot bring others into the deep. A raw person cannot participate in God's work. Only those who have been made mature by God can lead others into the reality of life. During the past few days I have been a little impatient because I have seen many people who have been stricken but they have not received much spiritual benefit. I hope that as the days go by, a stricken spirit will be found in you. We are no longer young. We cannot waste the Lord's time any longer. Every time we experience trials and sufferings, we have to produce abundant results. This is a great thing. If we do not take care of this, we will be of little use to the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(22)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 23, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER T. G.</h2><p>After I was saved, I studied the Bible but did not understand very much. Later I read 1 Peter 4, and I was touched by it. I was quite seeking in the local church and often experienced the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in my prayer. Sometimes I would jump, weep, or laugh. I often went out with brothers to preach the gospel. In 1940 the Japanese bombed us, and three bombs fell into my house. My wife was killed, but the Lord comforted me. In 1942 the Japanese bombed us for the second time, and my home was destroyed again. I was in debt and began to work as a water carrier to repay my debt. In 1943 there were harvest proceeds derived from ancestral lands, but I could not collect them because the lands were in my son's name, and he had been adopted by someone else. Later I became sick, and my life was in danger. On top of that I was criticized and misunderstood. For four months I was short of food and clothing. Later I moved to Tai-Shun, Chekiang. The cost of living was much lower there, and I lived for a year in abundance.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">God's Ways and God's Acts</h2><p>Our brother has received the Lord's supply through His guidance and protection. This is a good thing. However, we have to know that the Christian pathway consists of two things. First, there are God's acts, such as God leading His children through prayer. Second, there are God's ways. This is what one sees behind God's acts. The way of God is the pathway of God. God has His way of doing things. God's thought, method, and will reflect His way. The Israelites only knew God's acts, but Moses knew His ways (Psa. 103:7). On the one hand, God guided the people of Israel by means of wonders and miracles. These were God's acts. At the same time, Moses knew God's ways, that is, God's method of doing things. First, we have acts, which are outward. Second, we have ways, which are inward. God has certain ways of doing things. I can say with utmost respect that God has His "temperament." In their exodus and through the ten plagues, the supply of manna, the living water in the wilderness, and all the other things, the people of Israel saw God's acts. Yet Moses knew God's ways. Every time God moved His finger, Moses knew what He was doing. One's inner understanding has to be enlightened before he can know God's ways.</p><p>Our brother needs to know not only God's acts. He needs to pray to have his inner understanding enlightened to know His ways. Many people can relate God's outward acts to others; but they do not know God's inward ways. God's acts are mainly for delivering us out of tribulations. During the war many brothers and sisters experienced deliverance. We can only say that they experienced God's acts. But many have not seen God's ways. In the four Gospels men saw the wonders and miracles, but they did not see the Holy Spirit. If a man only sees the outward blessings without having adequate inner light or knowledge of the inner way, he cannot help others to go on. The Jews witnessed many miracles of the Lord, but few knew the inward things of God. This is also a big problem in Christianity. It is not enough just to have outward blessings. We have to ask God to enlighten our inner understanding to know His ways. In this way we will make progress ourselves, and we will lead others on. We must be enlightened within before we can take the straight course. May the Lord grant us to know His acts on the one hand and His ways on the other hand. These are two aspects of the Christian pathway.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(23)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 24, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER Y. G.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. When I was young, my village had over ten workers of the Lord. I was baptized at the age of eighteen and worked as a teacher for a girls' elementary school under the China Inland Mission. Later I went into business and did fairly well. Once I got sick and was able only to take a little food. My body was completely immobile. The doctor said that I was going to die. However, without knowing how, eventually I got better. When I was twenty-eight years old, a classmate of mine gave me a copy of Issue No. 24 of The Christian while I was attending a teacher's training course in Foochow. After I read it I became very clear within. I asked a brother concerning the matter of taking this way. He introduced me to a brother who is a worker for the Lord. I received much help from this brother and left the denomination where I was. Then all kinds of crosses came to me. There was criticism, slander, poverty, and suffering. Two or three of us brothers began to work and serve the Lord in one accord. Neither personal affairs nor material attraction could touch us in any way. In 1935 I attended Brother Nee's Overcomer Conference. Afterwards, I returned to Wu-Li-Pai County, Chekiang, to preach the gospel for three weeks. Over fifty people were saved. During the past few years, my condition before the Lord has not been good at all. I have had thoughts of spending the rest of my life farming and planting potatoes. While I was considering this, a cable came and told me to attend a conference in Shanghai. It is the Lord's arrangement that I can come to the mountain to be trained. I do thank and praise the Lord for this.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>I do not know this brother too well. But from his testimony I can tell that he is an intelligent, articulate, and frank person. God has no use of the foolish, and He has no use of the wise. We have to realize that in the spiritual journey, our work is not the main thing. God pays more attention to our personal history before Him. Our brother should no longer put an emphasis on human wisdom and work. It is a great grace from God that you feel that your condition is not that good today. Day by day and time after time we should develop a hidden history before God. For years you worked in the P'ing Yang, Chekiang area. You felt dry and had no history before God during this time. This means that your pathway was not straight. The parts of the human body have their proper proportions. Whether or not a man looks well depends on the proportions between the different parts of his body. To look well means to have the proper proportions. If a man's ears were five times larger and his eyes half as big as those of other men, he would look ugly and would be like a monster. The same is true with the spiritual condition of man. There must be the proper balance. If a man is clever and frank, he must have a strong spirit to match these attributes. Our brother is strong in thoughts and eloquence, yet his spirit is weak. Things are out of proportion to each other. He has taken the outward way. No brother's disposition should be stronger than his spirit. No one should have a mind, emotion, or will that is stronger than his spirit. If he does, his pathway will not be straight.</p><p>Our brother's strong mind is far stronger than his spirit. You have to ask the Lord to break down your cleverness and quickness. Otherwise, your strong mind and your quickness will become problems to your spirituality. I am not saying that we do not need cleverness and quickness. I am saying that we should have the stamp and wound of the cross upon all of our cleverness and quickness. Such a wound marks our way. Paul was intelligent, but we do not touch his intelligence; we touch his person. When we touch his intelligence, we also touch the wound of the cross. He had no confidence in himself, and it was easy to take others' word as well as change his own ideas. His knowledge of God's way made him a fearful and trembling man. The outer man must be broken, or else we will be useless.</p><p>One brother testified how he used to be naughty and how he used to play pranks on his teachers. Every time he spoke about this, he would condemn it and say that it was wrong. Yet while I was listening to him, I did not feel that he considered them as mistakes. I did not feel that he was condemning his naughtiness and pranks. Instead, I felt that he was showing off his naughtiness. His spirit was taking pride in his pranks. There was no mark of the cross on him. The same can be said of our brother's testimony. There is no wound of the cross upon his intelligence. Naturally speaking, he is sharp and clever, but these attributes are to be rejected and accursed. You should be ashamed of them. You must have the wound of the cross. Your quickness and cleverness must bear the mark of a knife-wound that causes you pain when you touch it. This does not mean that a clever man should become foolish, or that he should deny all his natural attributes. Rather, it means that he should feel pain even before he moves. This will spontaneously humble him. Once the light shines, a man falls to the ground spontaneously. If a man truly condemns himself, his spirit will always refresh others. Everyone who has come under the light is clear in one sense and foolish in another sense. After Paul saw the great light, he was blind for three days. For years you have been taking the way of cleverness and quickness. This has frustrated you from taking the straight course of the Lord. The Lord will bring you through failures, and these failures will be more profitable to you than victories. If you realize that we are all proud by nature and that everything we do amounts to nothing, you will find the knowledge of God's ways, and you will learn the proper lessons in the work of the Lord.</p><p>In Philippians 3 Paul said that he counted all things as loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus. He also told us what he was like. His words certainly nourish our spirit. In reading Paul's Epistles, we sense his talents and his wisdom, but at the same time, we realize that he was a man wounded by the cross. He dared not be self-confident or boastful; he was always in fear and trembling. We have to take the same way. We must have the mark and the scar of the cross. It is not wrong to be clever or quick. Yet these things must pass through the cross, and there must be wounds upon them. If there are wounds upon them, a man will not glory in them or boast about them. He will consider them a spiritual hindrance, and he will abhor and part with them. He will no longer be proud of them. In fact, all pride will disappear. He will fall in the dust and set his eyes on God alone. The self will be put down, become useless, and be exposed to its foolishness. He will have no way to go on. When he has no way to go on, then he will be ready to take the straight course.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(24)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 26, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER P. S.</h2><p>I was saved in a clear way in a prayer meeting. I was very happy about my salvation, yet I suffered persecution from others. Although I suffered outwardly, I was still rejoicing inwardly. I have also learned some lessons about divine healing. Many times I was weak, and I prayed to the Lord. He became my strength and power, breaking through my problems to bring me to the meetings. The Lord wanted me to work in the kitchen, but I felt that I was behind in my spirituality, and I wanted to serve the Lord in a spiritual way like other sisters. In the past I did not like to visit the sisters. But the Lord empowered me, and I have been able to go out to visit others. This has actually brought profit to me. In the past I felt that I was completely useless and that there was nothing in me that I could hand over or offer. Later I felt that I should hand myself over to Him because I belong to Him, whether or not I am useful.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>From your testimony I can see that your spiritual life is a very simple one. If you are willing to hand yourself over to the Lord and commit yourself to His hand, He will take you up. But you have to be stronger than you now are before you can become more useful. One does not necessarily have to be in a spiritual environment before he can be useful to the Lord. The main thing is to accept God's limitations and the Spirit's discipline. In pursuing spirituality, we should not overlook the limitations that God has placed upon us. Many people think that the only way they can receive spiritual blessing is through the meetings and through listening to messages. Yet many times the Lord grants us great blessings through the environment He arranges. Many people have the concept that they will know God more as long as they can attend more meetings, listen to more messages, and remain in a certain spiritual environment. Little do they realize that they have more opportunity to know the Lord in a constricted environment. If a man rejects God's limitations, he will lose his usefulness.</p><p>A man becomes useful in God's hand by accepting the discipline placed upon him in the environment. The Holy Spirit disciplines and perfects man through the environment. A man should not pray just for opportunities to experience direct grace, while refusing the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Limitations in the environment often are great opportunities to receive grace. Working in the kitchen and doing housework for others are both means through which the Spirit disciplines a person. Many people want bright and glorious prospects but are not willing to humble themselves under the mighty hand of God. However, one often receives more grace through humbling himself under God's mighty hand which lies behind the disciplining environment. A young person may find this lesson hard to take. He is full of self in his spiritual pursuit, and it is hard for him to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit in his environment. But nothing affords us better opportunity in the spiritual pathway than the environment that the Holy Spirit has arranged for us.</p><p>As the Holy Spirit operates in us, He must also arrange outward circumstances to match this operation. This is the only way for us to learn. The inward operation is part of the Spirit's work, and the arrangement in our outward circumstances is also part of the Spirit's work. We cannot eliminate the element of circumstantial arrangement from our Christian life just because we do not like it. Strictly speaking, a believer does not have many so-called "circumstances"; he only has the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Nothing happens to us by accident when we are under men's authority. Everything that happens to us is part of the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit arranges circumstances for us according to our need. The inward working of the Holy Spirit is accomplished only in conjunction with the environment He arranges for us. As the Spirit operates within us, He knows the environment we need, and He arranges the most profitable environment for us. We have no way of knowing ahead of time what kind of environment the Spirit will arrange for us. Therefore, we cannot choose our pathway according to our own will. The Holy Spirit works within us on the one hand and arranges our environment on the other hand. Therefore, a Christian must submit to the inward working of the Holy Spirit as well as to His arrangement in the outward environment.</p><p>Our sister has been learning spiritual lessons in the kitchen and at home during the past years. This is the right way. It is better to serve the Lord in the kitchen than to seek for freedom from the kitchen in order to work as a preacher. If God wants us to remain in the kitchen, no place, not even the meetings, can match its excellence. The kind of spiritual training each person needs is different. Some need to suffer loss. Others need to go through sickness, troubles, calamities at home, or other things. All these things are the discipline of the Holy Spirit. We all need God's limitations, and we all need to be disciplined by the Spirit before we can become useful to the Lord. We should learn to reap profit from all the discipline in the environment. We often try to push away the environment, but we should learn to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God. The term environment may not be too good; we should call it God's limitations or, still better, the Spirit's discipline. Brothers and sisters, do not learn rebellion; learn obedience. If the time has not come, do not seek to be free from your environment. Some feel that they cannot serve the Lord in a constricted environment. Actually, this is the preparation that God has ordained for their future service.</p><p>After we have learned our lesson through discipline, God will first release us inwardly and then change our environment outwardly. If we are not released inwardly, we should not argue with the environment. If we do, we are arguing with God. We have to obey the Lord according to the environment that He has arranged for us. The environment often is a chain provided by the Lord. These sufferings and pressures are meant to train us. We should not complain, murmur, or rebel. Instead, we should accept the discipline that the Lord has measured for us. When God places us in situations where we cannot receive grace in a direct way, we should never struggle, complain, or murmur. Struggling, complaining, and murmuring have destroyed many people. We are like a vessel. When we are placed in a certain environment, we are being molded. Once we complain, the vessel cracks. If we continue to allow such complaints to come out of our mouth, the vessel actually will break and become useless. Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that the benefit we reap from submitting to the discipline of the Holy Spirit is far greater than we can fathom. What a pity that most of us have spent half of our lives fighting our environment. If a man does not have any argument with the Lord, everything that comes his way will become a spiritual blessing to him. A person who does not know God's acts will curse the day of his birth (Job 3:1). But one who knows the Lord's acts will praise Him for everything that befalls him in his daily life and will reckon it as a God-allotted blessing.</p><p>We must learn to make our inner world the same as our outer world. We should be able to thank and praise the Lord for everything that we experience. The Bible says that in everything we should give thanks, because every environment is measured by the Lord for our greatest training. This is the reason we can give thanks in everything. Although we were not able to fellowship with each other for years because of the war, we have to confess that this was a discipline of the Holy Spirit under the Lord's sovereignty. The Lord's Spirit worked within us, and He also worked around us. If we have not experienced the former, we should have experienced the latter at least. The one thing that disappoints me the most is that I do not find much progress in the brothers and sisters. If we are willing to learn our lessons and submit ourselves to the disciplining circumstances arranged by the Holy Spirit, we will receive light and abundant life. Otherwise, we will remain poor.</p><p>God's children should realize that the persons, things, and events that are around them are environments arranged by the Holy Spirit for their discipline. Let me repeat: We should not complain, murmur, or rebel under such circumstances. We have to realize that everything God has arranged is for our good. We have to bow our heads, fall in the dust, and worship God, saying, "God, all the environments that You have arranged are for me to experience Your grace." If we do not stand on God's side, we will not receive anything, and we will eventually become useless. There are two ways for us to receive grace. First, we can receive it directly from the ministry. Second, we can receive it through the disciplining environment arranged by the Holy Spirit. If we fight against the latter, we will lose our chance of receiving grace. But if we obey, we will find grace.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(25)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 27, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER M. Y.</h2><p>I was saved in a clear way through Brother Nee's preaching on Ephesians 2:8. In May of 1927 I was baptized. After this, my spiritual life took a big turn. I returned to my village to preach the gospel to my grandmother, mother, and brother. They all accepted and believed in the Lord. My father was in America, and he wanted me to go there. I did not want to go, and he was very unhappy. He became more unhappy when I told him that I wanted to serve the Lord full-time. Prior to that, he regularly sent me money. After he heard that I wanted to serve the Lord, he stopped sending me money. But I had faith. As the Bible says, when my parents reject me, God accepts me. Later I began to serve the Lord in the church in Hong Kong. It is the Lord's mercy that I am able to come to the mountain to receive this training. I also have consecrated myself to the Lord. I used to be very healthy; however, I suddenly have found that I have high blood pressure and other ailments. I began to be afraid. Later the Lord told me that my sickness was not unto death but for the glory of God. I dropped my anxiety and committed my sickness to the hand of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>When we have little light, we do not see anything. When we have a medium amount of light, we see clearly. But when we have great light, we become blurred again. When a man is in a very bright room, it is hard for him to see anything. Some lights provide guidance, while other lights subdue and make men blurred. If a man can describe what he has seen after a meeting, it proves that he has not seen anything. If a man can describe in detail how he fell like Paul, whether his head went down first or his feet went down first, he surely has not really fallen. He has only pretended to fall. As far as the knowledge of God is concerned, the more light we receive, the more we know Him. But as far as the breaking of our own self goes, the more light we have, the more unclear we become. A sober-minded person has never received any light. There is a preciousness to being blurred. After a man is enlightened by a great light, he becomes blurred and confused. The more he gropes in darkness and confusion and the more he places himself in the Lord's hand in the midst of weakness, the more he experiences grace. We are delivered by God through weakness. The Lord leads our way, and although the way is not always clear and we are not always certain of anything, we can look to Him moment by moment.</p><p>Paul asked the Lord three times in his weaknesses what he should do. The Lord only said, "My grace is sufficient for you." For Paul, this word was good enough. What this grace was, Paul did not know. Grace is a principle; it is not the fine points. When the Lord said, "My grace is sufficient for you," Paul did not have to ask about the fine points. All of God's revelation to us requires no thinking on our part. In the way of grace, we can only go on blurrily. When light comes, we do not have to be too concerned, analytical, or probing about it. We only need to stand calmly at a distance and look to the Lord. There is no need to be anxious. After Aaron's rod remained in the ark for a night, it sprouted, blossomed, and bore fruit. The night signifies the period of darkness which comes before resurrection. In the dark night no one saw how the rod sprouted, blossomed, bore fruit, and grew. We do not know how that dead stick sprouted, blossomed, and bore fruit. This is not of concern to us. Our responsibility lies in the fruit bearing; we do not have to be concerned about how the fruit is borne as long as it is genuine fruit. Our responsibility is to put the dead stick in the ark. What happens between the time that the dead stick is put in and when it becomes a fruitful stick is none of our concern. It does not matter to us anyway, because it is the Lord's business. As long as there is fruit, we are satisfied. What happens during the night is God's business. We can remain in our unclearness. After a while, we will see the fruit. During the night our responsibility is simply to wait on God.</p><p>Many people have forgotten that before the dead stick was vivified, the night was a dark, puzzling, and incomprehensible time. Everything related to the Lord becomes clear to us as soon as we are enlightened. But everything related to us remains altogether a mystery as to how it comes about. It is something veiled in darkness. This is the reason we have to set ourselves aside and put our situation totally in the Lord's hand. Anything that can die should die. Anything that cannot die will live. May the Lord be merciful to us.</p><p>The Lord did not put the stick in Aaron's room or in his hand for him to study, analyze, or investigate. The stick had to leave the owner's hand and be placed within the ark in the Holy of Holies; it went from Aaron's house to the sanctuary. It had to go through a long night. Aaron knew nothing about it. But the next day, everyone saw that the stick had sprouted, blossomed, and borne fruit. The same principle applies to our spiritual condition. We should only put ourselves in God's hand and remain there throughout the dark night. We should turn from the self and look to God's hand, until we see the blossom and the fruit. No one saw how the stick blossomed, but everyone saw the blooming flower. We should not worry and not try to understand anything. If we do, nothing will happen. It is a joke for a child to constantly think about whether or not he is growing up and about how much weight he puts on each day. We should never look at ourselves. If we are a failure, let it be. It is the way of the world to try to find out how one can avert his failures. This should not be a concern to us. We often do not know how we rise up after we have fallen. We have to learn to trust, not to know. All we need to do is believe; we do not need to know anything. We do not have to be smart, and we do not have to try to find out everything that God is doing. Those who are smart in their mind are usually void of light. Those who are enlightened and who look to the Lord all the time are never busy in their mind.</p><p>Many spiritual things only call for our faith, not for our knowledge. Paul was a wonderful person. After he heard the Lord's word, "My grace is sufficient for you," he became silent. "My grace is sufficient for you" only speaks of a principle; it gives no definite pattern and does not define any specifics. Paul was not concerned about what to do. His eyes were set on the principle; he did not push for the fine points. This is wonderful. Paul genuinely believed, and that was good enough. In pursuing the Lord's grace, we should not push for the fine points. We are apprehensive of messages that have no light, but we are equally apprehensive of messages that have so much light that everything becomes crystal clear immediately. If we are truly subdued by the light, we will not know anything; we will be satisfied with God's grace alone. May the Lord preserve us so that we can trust Him in the midst of our ignorance.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(26)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 29, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER W. S.</h2><p>I was raised in a non-Christian family. First, my mother heard the gospel and believed in the Lord. Then, I was saved through a sister who preached John 3:16 to me. Later a sister introduced me to the publications of the Shanghai Gospel Book Room. After I read them, I realized that denominationalism is wrong, and I left the Baptist Church. I worked in the villages for eight years and brought some people to the Lord. Later I became sick from a tumor in my belly. A doctor operated and told me that I was in grave danger. At that time I felt lonely, and I wanted to die. I did not want to wait to be raptured. When a person is about to die, he loses all desire for anything. In desperation I gave up on myself and committed myself to the Lord. He was merciful to me. I stayed in the hospital for fifty days. The day I was discharged from the hospital, I was like a person walking out of the grave. The glory of God was manifested. During the past few years I have suffered much but have not learned enough lessons. Although I have covered my head outwardly, my head is not covered inwardly. By nature I am an active and outgoing person. Recently, the Lord arranged for me to come to Foochow, Fukien, and I handed myself over. When I found out that I could participate in this training, I seemed to find my support and my trust once again.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>You have wasted too much time in the past. I hope that from now on, you will take the straight course. If you want to receive God's grace directly and definitely, you have to follow the footsteps of the flock. This will do you good and will save you much time. If a man only contacts the Lord directly and will not receive any help from the church, his pathway is individualistic. Those who take an individualistic pathway often end up with curses. Of course, as long as one learns some lessons, his time is not wasted entirely. You have to remember Moses' word, that a curse can be turned into a blessing. You have to ask the Lord to turn the curses into blessings. It is the Lord's mercy that you are preserved up to this day. In the coming days if you will give yourself to serve in the church, your pathway will be shortened and you will be spared many unnecessary detours. The church is the Body of Christ, and you have to submit to it. Otherwise, you still will have a long way to go. You have to learn to accept the judgment of the Body.</p><p>The judgment of the Body is much more trustworthy than our own judgment. When we fall into darkness individually and are short of light, we can find light in the Body and in the Holy of Holies. To many people the knowledge of the Body is nothing more than a doctrine; there is little practical testimony. We, however, have to learn the lesson of submission in the Body. We are all middle-aged now. We can no longer waste our time on inconsequential things. We have to accomplish much within a short time. We need the Lord as much now as we did the first day we met Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(27)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 30, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER K. F.</h2><p>I grew up in a China Inland Mission Church. Someone preached the gospel to me and told me that my sins would be forgiven if I believed in the Lord. I secretly accepted the Lord, and peace filled my heart. Later I bought a small Bible and began to read it by myself. I heard that there were meetings at Hardoon Road, Shanghai, and I attended some. I felt that my condition was far behind the others. I could understand Sister Wang, but I could not quite understand Brother Nee. I felt that I should be a preacher. I did not know whether I should be a preacher for the sake of making a living or whether I should make my preaching my living. The nature and goal of the two things are entirely different. Eventually, I chose to take care of my daily necessities for the sake of being a preacher. Once while Witness Lee was preaching, I had a sudden thought of wanting to serve the Lord full-time. I wrote over twenty letters of confession to deal with my sins. The last letter did not go into the mailbox for several months after it was written. During my fasting and prayer, I felt the burden of sin lifted from me, and I was full of peace and joy. Later I went to Shanghai, and on the third day I heard the messages about handing over all. A brother said that if I did not hand over myself, the church would not know where I stood and would not be able to speak an honest word to me. I became afraid. I thought, "What if the church is wrong?" Later Brother Nee told us that some needed to go to Foochow, Fukien, to be trained. I said to myself, "Either I do not take this way at all, or I have to go all the way."</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our brother has been taking a straight course in this way. It is true that we face difficulties in our work. But whenever we encounter problems and difficulties in the work, such as opposition and rejection, we discover whom we are really serving, what is the center of our service, and for what we serve. This was the problem between Paul and Barnabas. During times of trial, the attraction of the work, the natural human elements, and our own inclinations drop away; our work begins to be purified. Our service must not be based on natural attraction, human affinity, our own inclinations, the attraction of the brothers and sisters, or the work itself. It must be only based on God.</p><p>If a man is successful in his work and has never encountered any difficulty but instead is welcomed everywhere, having no burden of the church upon his shoulders or friction with the saints anywhere, it is easy for him to be attracted to the work, the people, and the things. He may even think that he is serving the Lord in all honesty. Actually, he does not know how much is of the Lord and how much is of himself. However, the day will come when everything will change. His work will collapse, men will oppose him, and the Lord will allow everything to fall. Even he himself will collapse. The work, himself, and others will no longer be an attraction to him. Then he will know whether or not he is serving the Lord and how much of his work is for the Lord. This is a purifying work. When the attraction of work and men and the inclination of the self are all removed, our service will be solely under the direction of the Lord, and our labor for Him will be pure. Then we will not dare to involve the self in the work any longer. We will begin to stand on resurrection ground. We have to put our own life to death, and we have to put the work to death. After everything goes through the test, something will disappear through death, while something will remain on the other side of death. That which remains and rises up again is resurrection. If we plant a seed into the ground, it will resurrect. But if we plant a stone into the ground, it will not resurrect. What should die will die, and what will not die will rise up in resurrection. When we place our work in death, whatever withers away should be dead anyway, and whatever corrupts should become corrupt anyway. Whatever cannot die is resurrection. Whatever the Lord does will not die; it will always rise again. This is the way of our work today; it is the way of death and resurrection. We can no longer return to our old way. We should ask the Lord to put to death the elements in our work that deserve death. Anything that is not built up by the Lord should be torn down. If a thing is not torn down the first time, it will be torn down the second or the third time. Sooner or later it will be torn down. If something can be torn down, it proves that it is of the self. Anything that is of God will never be torn down&mdash;not once, not ten times. Resurrection is that which will never die. Anything in me that can go away should go away; the only thing that should resurrect is what the Lord has built up. Whatever is left after the demolition is God's work. We have to drop and purge ourselves of many things that are hanging on to us. Only then will we be able to say, "I no longer want to work. If there is still any willingness in me, it is something that the Lord has done." Anything that has passed through God's fiery furnace will be purified. From that point onward, every work will be done by the Lord alone.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(28)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 31, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER H. B.</h2><p>When I was young I suffered from pneumonia in both my lungs. I was seriously ill. My family even prepared for my funeral. I looked to the Lord and at the same time took medicine for my healing. When the war in Europe broke out, my family lost several million U.S. dollars within a few days. My father had a stroke because of this great loss and died from it. I began to fellowship with the Brethren, but I was still not clear about my salvation. I met Brother Nee for the first time in Shanghai. Later I went to Peking and began to meet there. I once argued with the brothers concerning some points of truth. The responsible brothers even hit me with a chair and kicked me. I also attended some meetings of the Bethany Congregation, and my name was among them. Later I left that denomination and asked to have my name removed. For a while I cherished some hope for the denominations, but I have since lost this hope. Today I no longer act like I did before. My eyes today are on the Lord Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Taking the Straight Pathway</h2><p>You should take a less detoured course in the work and should no longer busy yourself with the minor and inconsequential jobs. A worker must maintain his special characteristics before the Lord. At the same time, he should not be without coordination; he should work in coordination with others. God's way of leading can produce two results. In the first case, the potter works on the vessel, and the vessel breaks as the wheel turns. Cracks appear, and the potter does not mend it. In the second case, the same thing happens, but the potter decides to mend the crack. Man's intention is to take the second way, the mending way. If something is spoiled, mend it. But Jeremiah 18 tells us that the worker does not mend; rather, he discards what he has broken and makes a fresh vessel out of new clay. This is a parable; it speaks of God's way in leading men. Once a man takes a wrong step, he cannot turn back. God will not use those who have taken a wrong turn. He does not mend. The only thing left to do is to ask God for mercy to make another vessel. Some have made the wrong turn in their profession or their marriage. God will not recover them. Brother, you have to forget about the past. Let the past go and close the book. You have to ask the Lord to make a new vessel. Do not ask God to mend the broken pieces. Rather, present a new lump to His hand, from which He can make a vessel fit for His use. God does not turn back to remake old vessels. It is a serious thing to take the wrong turn. Some mistakes can never be remedied. God may have to raise up another vessel for His glory. If one slips and stumbles on the right way, he can be recovered; all he has to do is stand up again. But if his pathway is wrong, it is not easy to recover him. It is impossible to try to be a mended vessel. If we have taken a crooked pathway once, we have to accept our mistake. We should not hold on to the past. Instead, we should ask God to make a new vessel.</p><p>We have to be pliable, and we have to know that our past ways were wrong. The vessel is broken, and we need to have a new one made. Do not hold on to the past. We must consider the past as gone. We should not try to mend the broken vessel, but we should have a new beginning, a new vessel. When a vessel becomes broken, God does not remake it. Instead, He makes a new one. Therefore, you have to humble yourself before God and pray that He will turn all curses into blessings. God may make you a more glorious vessel than you were before. But whatever God does, you will not be the same vessel. In the church some do not want to become God's ordained vessels, while others do. Those who do, bring glory to God. If the brothers all know the church, the way of the work will have less detours.</p><p>The churches everywhere may have problems, and their conditions are different. The churches have their local situations, and there is no way we can unify their conditions. This problem also existed at the time of Paul. The more sectarian a group is, the more uniform its members are. But the more a local church is according to God's standard, the less uniform it will be. If the churches are churches at all, they are different from locality to locality. There was the church in Corinth, and there is also a church in Ephesus. Paul said, "All who are in Asia turned away from me" (2 Tim. 1:15). Paul was a great servant of the Lord, yet even he could not unify all the churches.</p><h2 class="head2">Accepting the Dealing of the Cross Willingly</h2><p>Our brother's testimony shows us that he suffered through his father's death and the loss of family fortune. If our brother considers all these to be crosses from God and accepts them willingly, they will become life to him. Otherwise, they will become death to him. If your experience is merely a shame to you, this shame will bring in death. But if it is a cross which you take up for the Lord, the mark which is left behind will be life to you. If you only revile me, I only need to allow you to revile. But if you strike my right cheek, then it becomes a matter of the cross: Will I allow you to strike my left cheek as well? If I turn my left cheek to you, considering it God's sovereignty for me to suffer, and I suffer willingly, I have peace and joy in my heart. In this case I am accepting the cross. However, my psychology may be affected after I am struck; I may become combative or closed toward others. My mind may become set against others, and I may hate them or feel unjustly treated by them. These are all human wounds. They can never become part of the Christian life. They should all be removed. A woman may love her husband very much. After her husband dies, she may become a very sullen person. If she believes in the Lord and still holds on to these sullen feelings, she is clearly wrong. She should learn the lesson of the cross. If she does not, she will become hard, cold, and even bitter. We should learn to be pliable and meek and accept the crosses that God has arranged for us so that we can reap life and spirituality. If we do, these crosses will become blessings to us. The same principle applies to sickness. Some gain life through their sickness, while others merely go through the sickness; they gain nothing. What we gain depends on whether or not we are willing to accept what has come upon us as being from God.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we have to re-evaluate everything we experienced before we were saved, that is, everything we did before we took God's way. Do not think that we should let the past be past. We have to deal with the whole sequence of events all over again. We have been separated to God from our mother's womb. Everything that happens to us individually should produce some spiritual result in us. If others revile or scold us, and we hate them or murmur against them in our heart, even though we do not argue with them, we can develop serious heart trouble. In this case the reaction is physiological. If we oppose them or fight against them, we may become disturbed mentally. In this case the reaction is psychological. But if we have learned the lesson of the cross, we will not react physiologically or psychologically; the matter will only produce spiritual lessons that are meaningful to us. We have to worship the Lord for our past. If all our experiences are viewed in the light of the cross, they will become spiritual blessings to us. Only the cross will bring a person to a greater degree of glory.</p><h2 class="head2">Gaining Revelation and Not Being a Spectator</h2><p>The revelation you have received from the Brethren is not enough. You have been like a spectator watching a show, not an actor participating in the show. Outwardly you seemed to have seen this way, but you do not have enough inward revelation. This is the reason the truth has not become something absolute in you. Saul not only saw the great light shining on the way to Damascus, but he heard the voice of the Lord from heaven; he received an inward revelation. This is the reason he did not have to go to Jerusalem to ask the twelve disciples about the Lord. As long as he had seen something within, he did not need any outward evidence. If we are inwardly clear, we will believe in Him even if the whole world tells us that Jesus Christ is not the Son of God and the Savior. A gospel candidate may say that he does not want to be baptized because he has been stumbled by a baptized sister who is still arguing with her husband at home. Another brother may disagree with the practice of head covering because a sister who practices head covering is too talkative at home. Another friend may not want to believe in the gospel because he has a Christian neighbor who always loses his temper. All three cases speak of men who reject God's way because they have not seen something real inwardly. Had they seen the inward reality of baptism and head covering, they would not have thought that they could dispense with these things. If a man really sees who Christ is, he will believe. If I argue with Brother Liu, you should not be stumbled just because we are arguing. You cannot negate the fact that we both have the Lord. We cannot change our footsteps because of human affections or worldly reasons.</p><p>If our direction is not straight, our pathway will become crooked as soon as we set foot on it. We will become a spectator. If I am a Christian and do not have any revelation in my work, the opposition and criticism of other brothers and sisters who are working together with me in the field will naturally affect my work. But if I work according to revelation, I will go on even if others oppose me or criticize me. I will work until I am justified. I will not lose heart or be discouraged. No one knew the rebellion of the people of Israel more than Moses, yet he led them out of Egypt. No one knew the church in Corinth more than Paul did, yet he called them saints (1 Cor. 1:2). Moses needed to have a vision. Without a vision, he would have been the first to bring the Israelites back to Egypt. The Lord's workers need to have a vision. Once they have a vision, their pathway will be straight. Some local churches do not appear to be up to the standard outwardly. We have to bring them up to the standard. We have to have a proper start. An inward vision is the greatest source of power.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Concentrating Our Thoughts on the Self</h2><p>We need to be careful when we speak of the things of the past. It is possible that in speaking of these things, our attention will become focused on ourselves. Some people need to be delivered from their emotion. As for you, you have to be dealt with in your mind. Those with a strong mind are arrogant. You come in contact with people every day. If you are a self-centered person, it is easy for you to get hurt. You have to know that the world does not live for your sake. The only reason that hurt and offenses exist is that the one who is hurt is living for himself. Even after one is wounded, he can still be self-centered. We should not be bothered by others' treatment of us, whether it is good or evil, with or without sympathy. I choose to ignore all these things. We should learn not to be touched by outward things. Once our thoughts center around ourselves, we become self-centered, arrogant, assertive, and domineering. At the same time, we become very private. We do not want to talk to others or mingle with them. We become lonely and cold. But if we touch the cross, these conditions will go away.</p><p>Our brother should have a specific pathway; he should no longer waste his time on minor and inconsequential work. You have to learn to be lowly in your thoughts. Do not aim at the high things, and do not be a spectator. You should not be offended easily and should not be self-centered. In everything the Lord should be the center; everything should revolve around Him. Moreover, do not consider yourself to be so wonderful. Instead, always remain meek and obedient to the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(29)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 2, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER C. C.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. It was a wonderful environment. I was not contaminated too much by the world or sins. At the age of about seventeen I accepted the Lord and was baptized in a China Inland Mission Church. Later I was sent to preach the gospel. Once I read The Christian published by Brother Nee, and I was moved to leave the C.I.M. Those in the denomination thought that we were creating a division. In 1935 Brother Nee spoke clearly in Chuanchow, Fukien, about consecration. Although I had consecrated my will to the Lord, there was not much reality to my consecration. I admit that I do not have the eloquence, knowledge, or light. I can only speak a little. I know that if I can edify others a little today, it is altogether the Lord's work. In the past I thought that I was not bad. Today I feel that I no longer can stand up among the brothers and sisters. I became sick with tuberculosis through overextending myself in the work. The sickness comes and goes. However, I reaped much profit from the Lord through my sickness. I have to exult Him. I have vomited blood during my stay here, but I am somewhat different now. If you send me home, I will die. If I stay here, I have the confidence that I will not die. The Lord wants to break me, and the blessings I experience will multiply. Although I am over fifty years old, I am still like a child. I have been working for the Lord for twenty-eight years, but I still feel empty. I want to commit myself completely to the Lord's hand. May the Lord be merciful to me.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>I hope that our brother will take more rest. When a person reaches middle-age, he has to exercise more care. You are working in the region around Wenchow, Chekiang, which is the area with the greatest concentration of believers. You should remain there and work there. If one wants to have thicker and firmer ice, he should not break it when it is still thin. In the church the knowledge of God's will is something committed to those who are more elderly; the older ones hold the reins. The younger co-workers can take care of the preaching, the gospel work, and the business affairs. The older ones also have to take some responsibilities in initiating the new moves, but they should not be burdened too much by the many affairs of the church; the young ones should be allowed to join in and to coordinate in the service.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(30)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 3, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER Y. U.</h2><p>Before I was saved in 1933, I was addicted to novels and drama. Later I borrowed some spiritual books from a sister and attended prayer meetings regularly. I am an optimistic person and I like to laugh and joke. After my mother passed away, I felt lonely. Every afternoon at three o'clock I would shut my doors and pray. At the end of 1940 I heard Brother Nee speak on the cross, and I felt as if he were speaking to me. Later, because of the pressure of my teaching job, I developed a heart disease. Prior to that I walked quickly and spoke fast. After I became ill, I could no longer move around freely. I often thought that I would die. While it seemed as if I was dying outwardly, I was also dying inwardly. A sister told me that this was a thought from Satan and that I had to reject it. I wondered how others could live the Christian life so joyfully while I lived in such pain. An elderly sister came and visited me and told me that the day of my salvation had come. I had a strange experience that day as I was washing my clothes in my room. A voice came and said, "I, Jehovah, am your help." Some sisters also prayed for me, and I was strengthened. From that time forward my joy came back. I am not working, yet God has supplied me richly. I live in a sisters' house. I do all the washing, cooking, heating, and other chores; they do nothing. I do not ask God to change the environment, but I ask Him to change me. Spiritually, I feel that I am poor and have many manifested weaknesses. I see the weaknesses in others, and I see the weaknesses in myself all the more. I have also seen that the Lord has given me one talent. If I deny this, I offend the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Being in Harmony with the Environment</h2><p>With respect to our past experiences, the Lord wants to bring every one of us into harmony with our environment. Everyone who is at odds with the Lord is at odds with his environment. We cannot choose our own experiences, and we cannot escape our own environment. We have heard three or four brothers and sisters who have testified to this fact, and we should have received some light from their testimonies. None of us can choose our own pathway. God's goal is to bring us into harmony with our surrounding environment. We should not argue with our experiences. Instead, we should submit to the Lord who arranges these encounters. The Holy Spirit is the One who makes all the arrangements inside of us and around us. As soon as we accept the Lord who has arranged these inward and outward circumstances, our many turmoils will be settled. The more we advance and progress along the way, the more we will be one with our environment. Of course, when we face sickness in our environment, we can ask for healing. When our emotions suffer a blow, we can ask for peace. We always expect others to treat us well, but often just the opposite occurs. Please remember that most of the time we lose our peace, joy, and blessing this way. If we can accept and approve of all of the environment and experience that the Lord has measured to us, peace, joy, and blessing will come to us. The Lord always brings us into harmony with the environment around us.</p><h2 class="head2">Accepting God's Arrangements</h2><p>It is easy to talk about the discipline of the Holy Spirit but very hard to see it in a genuine way. The Bible says that even our hairs have been numbered. It is easy to say this, but how much do we really know of this? Everything is under the Lord's arranging hand. At the beginning of our Christian life, we are wild and raw. It is not easy for us to accept God's arrangements. As we grow, we become more in tune with God's arrangements. Many people ask for things that are apart from the Lord's arrangements. If the Lord will not change and we cannot accept His arrangements and change ourselves, the only thing that will happen is that our days of struggling will be prolonged. They will become days of loss. The Lord does not have to change His ways, but we have to accept His ways. It is best to say, "Lord, I am willing to accept everything that You do." Spiritual progress has nothing to do with outward changes, but with inward acceptance. If God's hand lets go of us, we are finished; we have nowhere to turn. Everything falls into place if we accept God's arrangements in the environment. If we cannot accept them, we have to look to God for mercy to enable us to accept them.</p><p>We often think that we are withstanding Satan. Actually, we are withstanding God. The sooner we come into harmony with our environment, the better it is for us. The more we inwardly complain, the more the Lord's hand will be heavy upon us. We should be pliable, harmonious, and even transcendent in the Lord's hand. If we are dissatisfied with all that the Lord has done, there will be few alternatives for us. We have to believe that the Lord is arranging everything. Every time a strand of our hair turns white, we should praise the Lord. God's arrangements are so minute that even a strand of hair is in His hand. Can something greater than a strand of hair not be part of God's ordering? If a man presumes that he can reject his outward circumstances, he is rejecting God. The cross is heavy only if it is upon us. But if we are crucified on the cross, it will not be heavy to us. On the contrary, our own weight and burden will be upon the cross. The more we accept and give up fighting, the less problems we will have.</p><p>On the subject of spiritual poverty, we should realize that our way depends not on rich feelings or feelings of riches. We should only have the feeling of death in ourselves. Yet we bring life to others. If the Lord brings us to the place of death, neither poverty or riches are our business any longer. If we learn to accept poverty, the Lord will be rich in others. The sense of weakness and weakness itself are two different matters. The Lord will bring us to the point of weakness, and He will also bring us to a sense of weakness. This takes time. Many brothers who are beginners in His service feel as if they can do everything. They are strong because they have not passed through the experience of weakness; they have not gone through many years of stripping.</p><p>The Lord only gives us one feeling&mdash;the feeling of weakness. We feel that power is not with us but with others. In reality, we may be rich or we may be poor, but the Lord always puts a sense of weakness in us. This is the only way He can use us. It is not a matter of the Lord's power becoming our power. We remain weak all the time. The Lord's strength only rests on our weakness; it does not remove our weakness. None of us should crave a sense of power. We should not feel or sense this at all. Our feeling should always be one of weakness. We should leave it to others to feel our power and our riches. We must never advance from a feeling of poverty to a feeling of abundance. Instead, we should advance from a feeling of poverty to true poverty. On our side, we should only feel weak. Power and riches are the Lord's business. Moses' face shone, but he did not know about it. I am afraid many young people look into the mirror every day to see if their faces are shining. If we really knew that our faces were shining, probably we would soon lose the light. It is better that we do not know. This is the way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(31)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 5, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER J. Y.</h2><p>In the past I was an agnostic, believing in nothing at all. One day I asked myself, "Should I reject everything unreasonably? Is Jesus God?" Once in my distress I called on the name of the Lord Jesus and vented my sadness. Immediately I felt the peace. I was later baptized with little knowledge of what I was doing. At that time I still did not know the meaning of salvation. In spite of this, I began to deal with the sin of lying. However, the more I tried to deal with it, the more I lied. At the same time, my health was deteriorating. I consulted the doctor, who told me that I had tuberculosis and would soon die unless it was properly treated. While I was in the hospital, a voice came and told me that I was healed and that I would completely recuperate in three months. Shortly thereafter I was indeed healed. During those three months I put on over thirty pounds. Later a sister preached the gospel to me, and I was clearly saved. Upon reading some publications by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room, I became clearer about the truth. I often failed in minor sins. One day a thought of quitting everything to serve the Lord came to me. I was not certain about this and inquired of the Lord about three matters concerning this thought. All three matters of my prayers were answered. I often tried to deal with my temper and my tongue, but was never successful. It seems that my temper would go away for a while and then come back again. I struggled but still could not overcome. This brought me to tears many times. I became aware of my own evil. Once when someone spoke about my parents, I became furious. The Lord disciplined me, and I was able to submit myself to Him. Coming to this meeting is a "first time" school experience for me; it is not a "make-up" lesson as it is for some others. The evening meetings are very suitable for me, but I cannot comprehend very much of the morning messages.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Sister Ji has many minor sins that she is trying to deal with, such as temper, tongue, lying, etc. She said that her temper would go away and then come back again and that she was not able to overcome it. I believe this is according to the Lord's counsel. Every one of us has our own characteristics and our own special sins. Our special sins represent our very person. The kind of dealings we need are all different because that which represents our self varies. If temper is our special sin, we have to deal with it. After dealing with it, the other problems associated with us will be dealt with easily. In addition to all the common sins that most people have, each of us has a special sin. Experiencing grace means that we experience grace in that special area. For example, in Romans 7 Paul did not break all the Ten Commandments. He only broke the tenth commandment, the commandment against coveting. In Greek coveting denotes a kind of inward, lustful craving. All other commandments are outward. Only the tenth commandment is inward; it is related to one's motive. Paul did not have any problem with the other nine commandments. Coveting may be too strong a word. Every time Paul tried to shake off his desire or craving, he found this lust still clinging to him. This was a special sin to Paul before he believed in the Lord. It seems that if Paul could have dealt with this one sin, he could have dealt with all other sins. Consider again the example of the young ruler in Luke 18. He could do nothing about his riches. He did not covet others' possessions; he was merely attached to his own riches. This was his special sin. He did not seem to have any other problem. If he could have solved this problem, he could have solved all of his other problems. Everyone has his own "trademark," his own special sin. Once this special sin is dealt with, he is free from sins.</p><p>There are thousands of sins, but each person has one or two special kinds of sins that belong to him alone. Once these special sins are dealt with, the whole matter of sin is settled in that person. Many people are bound or hung up by just one kind of sin. The Bible speaks of one special case&mdash;Jacob. He was a greedy man who would only do things that would profit him. As long as something profited him, he would do everything he could to gain it. When he was born, he held on to his brother's ankle while still in his mother's womb. He was fighting to come out first. In his wrestling with God, it appeared as if God could not prevail against him. God just touched the hollow of his thigh; He did not dislocate all the joints of his body. Once Jacob's thigh was dealt with, his legs became crippled. Jacob's legs represented his very being. God dealt with his strongest part and stripped him of his strength. Every one of us has our own special traits before the Lord. God will identify these traits and deal with them. It is a great thing to know that God is dealing with our special traits. If we can identify the strong areas in our life, we have identified our problem spots. The day we identify these spots is a great day. Everyone should be able to find his own special weakness, his root ailment, his personal typical weakness, the sickness that represents his very being. Only after he finds it will he find healing.</p><p>When we go through dealings, we first have to find the areas in which God is dealing with us. Many people do not know in what area God is dealing with them. As a result, they suffer in vain. There are many kinds of sins, and their ramifications are all different. But with Paul there was only one sin&mdash;lust or craving. The self can be manifested in a thousand different ways, but in the case of the young man in Luke, it was simply the love of his own money. With Jacob it was simply a matter of selfishness. Everyone has a powerful self or a particular sin of his own. If a man does not know where his problem lies, he is far from the day of deliverance. The fundamental problem that I speak about here refers to the special sin that a person possesses, such as an unbridled tongue, self-exaltation, a craving to be the first, etc. When such a person appears, we could say, "Unbridled-tongue or Self-exaltation or Craving-for-the-first is here." These special sins represent the very persons themselves. The Lord can pressure us through our environment in such a way that our special sin, or the two or three particular sins, becomes fully exposed.</p><p>Those who are under the discipline of the Holy Spirit are not necessarily more sinful than others. God deals with a person by concentrating on one or two of his particular sins. When a person is saved, the light of the gospel points to the many sins that he has committed; these are common, ordinary sins. After a man is freed from the general sins, the Lord will point out his special sins to him. This does not mean that he has no other sins. Rather, it means that when he overcomes these basic sins, his other sins no longer will have a swaying power over him. You may say that your basic sin is temper. But to me, it may not be your temper. Temper is only a symptom. The real cause of your sickness can be pride, self-centeredness, subjectivity, self-love, self-confidence, or self-righteousness. Temper is like a fever; it is merely a symptom, not the sickness itself. If we can find out the cause of the sickness and allow God to deal with it, the sickness will be gone. You are clever and articulate, but the Lord wants to point out your underlying problem. Jacob's leg did not need to be completely broken. He only needed one of the tendons of his thigh touched. Then all of his other tendons became as good as dead. Once the Lord breaks our special trait, everything else will be broken. God deals with our circumstances by pointing His finger to the particular spots. Miscellaneous dealings only increase your pride; they do not deal with the fundamental sin. If God can deal with your sin, your special sin, the sin that best represents you, everything else will be over with for you. You will have a way to go on, and you will be able to lead others on. Had the young ruler given up all his riches, he would have been finished as a person, because his money was his very life. Yet this also would have saved him. We have to ask the Lord to show us where our strong point is, what our fundamental sin is, and in what area He is dealing with us. If not, our problem will become the problem of our lifetime. Once that problem is dealt with, all other problems will be settled.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(32)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 7, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER E. S.</h2><p>I was saved in 1938, but I touched the Lord's way only five years ago. In the past my life was caught up with people in military-political circles. One day I read in Matthew 7 about entering the narrow gate and taking the constricted way. I began to cry. I saw that the Lord is my Friend and my world. I was willing to become a gospel preacher. After I was saved, I testified to others all the time. I loved to sing hymns, to study the Word, and to pray. Yet I still cherished other things. First, I loved my own life; second, I loved my wife; and third, I loved antiques and calligraphy. My love for the Lord occupied the fourth or fifth place. Later, I offered up my antiques and calligraphy, and I had a great release. I began to live by faith. The Lord said that I should seek first His kingdom and His righteousness and all these things would be added to me. I worked in northwest China. In 1947 I came to Shanghai and saw Brother Witness Lee, Brother Yu Cheng-hwa, and Sister Wang and Sister Lee for the first time. I received the life supply from them. My inner eyes began to open, and I saw the Body life and the life of coordination, etc.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>I thank the Lord for His past guidance in our brother. I hope that the Lord will fill up his lack this time on the mountain. Our brother has experienced much leading and dealing from God, but he is still short in faithfulness. The discipline of the Holy Spirit in our brother is never wrong. Unfortunately, our brother's spirit is not strong enough, and his thoughts are not rich enough. I believe our brother would not mind me saying this. It is the Lord's grace that He would deal with us time after time, but our brother needs a fundamental dealing. If he experiences this fundamental dealing, all other problems will be settled. I am not talking about general dealings in life, but about a fundamental dealing for our brother's living. His spirit also has to be empowered for the work. Our brother's problem is that he has a weak spirit. As ministers, we must have a strong exercise of our spirits; we should push out our spirits. Some people can never release or exercise their spirit on the platform. A person with a strong spirit can exercise and use his spirit all the time. To exercise the spirit is to push it out. Our brother has the flow of the spirit, but there is little exercise of the spirit. He cannot bring others to any high-peak experience. If we cannot exercise our spirit freely, our work and testimony will not bring others to a high peak. If we can bring others to a high peak, our work will become fruitful.</p><p>Our brother has only experienced some fragmented dealings in life; he has not experienced a fundamental dealing. He is short of a strong spirit in the work; he cannot push out his spirit or bring others to a high peak. Our brother must learn to be a good minister of the word. He must learn to lift his spirit to new heights. Once our spirit is pushed out, it is released. When our spirit feels something within, we need our mind to translate this feeling into words and then release them. If we are rich in thoughts, we will be able to know the feeling of the spirit, and we will be able to release the spirit through words. We have many words but little spirit because our thoughts are not rich enough. Therefore, on the one hand, we have to pray for a strong spirit. On the other hand, we have to have rich thoughts. The spirit is released in a spontaneous way; it does not require a loud voice or a solemn face. Such a release cannot be imitated, and one cannot force himself to release his spirit. If a minister of the word cannot use his spirit, he will not know when his spirit is supplying others and when his burden is discharged. We have the Holy Spirit within us; He gives us feelings and rich thoughts. When we capture these thoughts with our own spirit, our words will become powerful. We are short of utterance because we are poor in thoughts. But sometimes an increase in words is not accompanied by the release of the spirit. We have to ask the Lord to give us proper words and rich thoughts. When we have feelings in our spirit again, we can convey them with proper words through enriched thoughts.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(33)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 9, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER M. A.</h2><p>At the age of eighteen I called on the name of the Lord and was saved. A pastor told me that if I sinned again, I would be crucifying the Lord again. Because of this I would cry every time I sinned again. My mother thought that I had lost my mind. Someone told me that there is a difference between preaching the Christ of the Bible and the Christ of inward revelation. I did not understand what this meant. Others said that one can feel the Lord's presence and that if one does not have any feeling at all, he does not have the Lord's presence. I did not understand that either. I am often sick. But the Lord said that my strength would be as my days. Since that day, I have been sick no longer. From the book Rethinking the Work (The Normal Christian Church Life), I learned that one cannot accept a salary for preaching. I quit the job of a salaried pastor in the denomination. The Lord wanted me to drop everything to follow Him, but my wife did not understand this. One person was a spy. When he saw the love among the brothers and sisters in the church life, he believed in the Lord Jesus. Formerly, he was a Confucianist, and he believed that all men were brothers. After he was saved he knew that this theory could never be put into practice.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our brother has to pay attention to two things. First, I hope that he will receive a fundamental and thorough dealing while he is on the mountain. Everything in you has to be repeatedly and thoroughly torn down before you can have a way to go on. Although you have experienced some miscellaneous dealings in the past, you do not have much revelation. If our brother experiences a deep and great dealing, he will have a deep and great scar, and he will not be able to climb up again. You need a deep and great dealing because you will climb up again if you suffer only a small dealing, and you will forget about your lesson. But great dealings and great works of God always remain with you and will remind you. You do not have to try to think about them consciously; they will automatically produce fruit. Even if you try to revert back, you can no longer do so, because a wound is upon you. The Lord had scars after He was crucified. Paul had a scar of blindness after he received the light on the way to Damascus. Jacob also had a scar when the hollow of his thigh was touched. All of these men had scars on their bodies. Your mind may forget about the dealing, but the lameness in your thigh will always be a reminder to you. Once God leaves a scar of His work, you will not be able to climb up again. Before you have such an experience, you may repent for your pride, you may weep for the sin of pride, but as soon as temptations come you will become proud again. If God's work is deep and thorough enough, you will not need to remember to be humble. When God's work is deep enough, pride will cease in you. Man's mind can forget, but his scar will not allow him to forget.</p><p>Jacob had a scar of lameness throughout the remainder of his life. This is the reason he worshipped God upon his staff at his deathbed. He did not have to imitate a lame person. He was genuinely lame. If a man pretends to be lame, he will run when a dog comes to bite him. I know a couple who lost their beloved, precious son. When I met them ten years later, it was still difficult for them to smile. They suffered a great shock in the loss of their son. We must go through a fundamental dealing. We must be so wounded that we no longer can recover ourselves. When Paul boasted, others did not feel that he was being arrogant. Instead, they saw a beautiful picture in the man. His "pride" was more humble than the humblest men. Jacob's most beautiful moment was when he worshipped God upon his staff at his deathbed.</p><p>The second point about our brother is that his spirit and words do not match one another. However, his prayers, both in Shanghai and on the mountain, are very pure; these prayers match his spirit. If you can speak like you pray, matching your words with your spirit, you will be able to serve well in the ministry of the word.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(34)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 10, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER U. C.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. I tried to commit suicide by hanging myself a few times because I could not stand the constant pressure. I became very pessimistic and thought of becoming a monk. First, I became a vegetarian, and then I joined a monastery. Later I heard the gospel in my sister-in-law's house and was saved. My parents opposed my faith and always tried to bother me when I prayed. These persecutions forced me to build up a sweeter fellowship with the Lord.</p><p>I went into the salt business, but I did not have the peace to stay in that business because there was tax evasion related to that business. I left for other jobs. When my second daughter became sick and was about to die, I had the Lord's word. It was the story of Elisha with the son of the Shunammite woman. I kept this word in my heart and did not consult the doctors. I prayed unceasingly. My father prepared a coffin for her, but the Lord told me that I did not need to pray anymore but that I should praise Him instead. I began to sing and to praise the Lord. After two or three days, my daughter gradually recovered. Once we had to move to another house, but my wife and I were not in one accord. We knelt down to pray, and the Lord touched my wife and told her to submit. We were able to move in peace. In hearing all the messages on the mountain and in comparing them with my experiences, I have found that I am short in everything. I thought about quitting and giving up serving the Lord. But I realized that I have handed myself over and that I have no right to do anything according to my will. The Lord has to make the decision. I have been saved for over ten years, but I still make mistakes in many things. I can only look to the Lord today and ask for His mercy. I want to be like a newly regenerated person, starting all over again.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our brother clearly has handed himself over to the Lord. Therefore, his future should be decided by the church. We have some brothers who have returned from southeast Asia, and they tell us that a rubber tree must be cut before it will yield its sap. Similarly, a pine tree must be cut before it will yield resin. A man must be cut by God and dealt with by Him before life will flow out. In talking to others or in working with them, we have to give them the impression that we are very close to them. We should not give them the feeling that we are unapproachable. The Lord arranges circumstances around us in order to cut us. Once we suffer a cut, we become very approachable. Some people release their spirit as soon as they open their mouths or as soon as they pray. Once we have a wound, the sap flows, and we become very approachable. When some people preach, their spirit is released. When others preach, their spirit is not released. Older ones can release their spirit more easily. If the young ones will humble themselves under the mighty hand of God, they also will release their spirit quickly. Our brother has been running a straight course. However, he still needs to receive some cutting from God's knife so that he will have a wound and his shell will be broken. When this happens, he will be released and life will flow. He will become approachable and will be able to touch others. I hope you will lift up your head and say, "Lord, I am willing to let You work on me, whether this work is gradual or sudden. May You inflict a wound on me, and may I afford You a way to go on."</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(35)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 12, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER G. S.</h2><p>I graduated from a seminary in 1928 and knew that it was wrong to be a salaried worker. Later the Lord led me to live by faith. I began to take the Lord's way. One day I read an open letter by Brother Nee which said that it is not enough merely to observe outward signs like baptism, the breaking of bread, head covering, and leaving the denominations. One has to take care of the things related to the inner life. When the war broke out, I went to southeast Asia and engaged in business for a few years. The business went well, and I thought it was my ability that made this happen. I began to become proud. Later the Lord disciplined me, and I failed in my business. The employees were not in harmony, and I had much vexation and tears. Finally, I wrapped up my business, returned to the Lord's way, and decided to be a servant of the Lord once again. When I came to the mountain, I felt that I was bruised all over and that this would be a good opportunity for me to recuperate from my wounds. But when I heard Brother Nee's messages on resurrection, I realized that I am not here to recuperate or to care for my wounds, but to experience the power of resurrection. This power and life of resurrection is in me already. The recovery of my whole being actually seems to have come about much quicker than I expected.</p><p>I have also seen that Christ is my Head and that I am a member of His Body. Whatever the Head has, I also possess as a member of His Body. This fills me with joy. The Lord's power and grace are in me. I am like an empty vessel in the sea. Water is all around me. As far as the Lord's work is concerned, I know that I am not qualified for it.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>God does not need a long time to accomplish His recovery work. In resurrection, we gain back what has been lost in death in an instant. As long as a person is in resurrection, he is in total and complete recovery. Resurrection is not a progression; one regains everything in an instant. In resurrection there is not only a recovery, but the recovery is complete. A tree has to go through a long process from sprouting to fruitbearing, but in resurrection, Aaron's rod budded, blossomed, and bore fruit all at the same time. The budding, blossoming, and fruitbearing all happened in one night. This is the principle of resurrection. Resurrection is different from nature. It is a great matter, and it is something that the natural man cannot understand. You have to drop the idea of recuperation. If your recovery is in the principle of resurrection, it will be instantaneous, not gradual.</p><p>You said that you are not qualified for the work, but none of us are. We only need to be torn down. The building up is not in our hands. When a man falls into the water, he does all that he can to keep himself from sinking. Those who struggle with their last breath are not ready to be saved. A sinner must be allowed to remain a sinner until he finds that he cannot save himself. Only then can he be saved. Just as a man cannot save himself in the matter of salvation, he cannot save himself in the matter of the Lord's work. If a man can empty himself completely like a sinner and does not try to save himself, but rather falls down completely before God, he is qualified to work for Him. If a worker has not been stripped of all his props, he cannot do God's work. He will think that he has a fine record, and that he still has the strength to prop himself up in his work. Unless, however, these props are completely removed, he cannot work for God. A worker must allow these props to fall down completely, allowing nothing to remain, before he will find the Lord coming to his rescue.</p><p>When a man tries to build up his own righteousness, he offends God's righteousness. Before Paul was called, he considered killing others as a service to God. This was more extreme than Peter, who only considered cutting off the ear of the servant of the high priest as a service to God. When Saul fell down on the way to Damascus, a worker fell down, not just a sinner. His salvation was not only the salvation of a sinner but the salvation of a worker. He had been serving God in an absolute and self-sacrificing way. When he fell down, it was a total and complete fall.</p><p>In principle, we should fall down from our many services as well. What we consider as a service to God is just persecution, rebellion, and destruction in God's eyes. To us, it is obedience and building, but to God it is opposition to Him and alienation from Him. During the past few years, I have alluded to Saul's story over a hundred times. After Saul fell and met the Lord, he did not ask to whom he should deliver his letters. There were many who were traveling with him. Instead he asked, "What shall I do, Lord?" (Acts 22:10). Before he met the Lord, Saul probably prayed every day. He could claim that he had a clear conscience, but actually he was in darkness. He feared God, but he was a murderer who considered that it was a service for God. When he fell on the way to Damascus, everything was finished for him. He was completely emptied. It was then that he cried, "What shall I do, Lord?" We should not think that we were unqualified at some point and that we will be qualified as some later point. Beginning from Saul and Peter, who failed completely before God, all the way to the present time, I have not seen one servant of God who has been used by God without first falling down completely. The prayer of the tax collector and that of the Pharisee give us a comparison. The tax collector's prayer was not for progress. He was not like the Pharisee, who fasted once a week and tithed. He prayed for God to have mercy on him, a sinner. If he ever accomplished anything, he would have acknowledged that it was the Lord's work. As workers, we must sooner or later fall down on our face and say, "The Lord is the only One who can make it; I cannot make it." Unless we do this, we will never know what the Lord's work is and what our own work is.</p><p>A worker should not remind himself to be humble and meek; he has to fall down. Humility is useless. The only thing that is useful is falling down. A worker has to fall in the same way that a sinner falls. We have to realize that humility is not something worked up by ourselves but something wrought into us by the Lord. Daily we have to have a stricken spirit. When we have such a spirit, we cannot be proud even if we want to. We can tell a child to be careful, but he will forget all about it after two minutes. But if we spank him first and then tell him to be careful, he will behave himself immediately, even before his tears are dry. This is the reason I say that our humility must come out of the Lord's chastisement. Let me repeat: A man must fall and fall completely! In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, "It is no longer I..but it is Christ." He could say this so easily because he had fallen. When he said that he was crucified with Christ, it meant that he had fallen down. Then he was able to say, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." It is not easy for a person who has gone through such an experience to be proud or to give glory to himself. Today many people have to consciously resist pride; they have to remember to be humble. This only proves that they have not fallen down completely.</p><p>I do not expect our brother to stand up again. Rather, I expect him not to stand up again. Will he do everything by himself from now on, or will he do everything by the Lord? He will have to make a clear distinction between the two. After he leaves the mountain, even if he finds that he is able to do something, he should still fearfully say, "I cannot do it. It is not I but the Lord who is doing it." Everything that we have must go into the grave. It must then come out on the other side. If it can come out on the other side, it is resurrection. Even Paul's boastings were meek, comely, and beautiful. With us, however, even our humility is ugly and uncomely. The self does not have to be recovered; it needs to fall down. It would be terrible for a gospel preacher to tell a sinner to fast, pray, and improve himself. Instead, we should say, "We do not make any resolution of our own. We have not run. Everything is of God who grants mercy" (Rom. 9:16). We must fall down and realize our utter inability. If there is any worth in us, it is the result of the Lord's mercy. This is the way to serve.</p><p>I would also point out that our brother possesses lucid utterance and thoughts. But he also must have a strong spirit so that he can impart his words and thoughts to others. God has great things for us to do, but we need a strong spirit to match them. If a man is strong in his spirit, his thoughts and words will become useful to him. When a worker speaks for God, he has to push out his words with a strong spirit. This is a glorious way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(36)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 13, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER D. K.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. Once I heard the gospel and was touched to believe in the Lord Jesus. Later I became quite effective in working for the Lord. I thought, however, that this was due to my ability. I did not realize that it was the Lord's grace. I became proud and failed and then fell into darkness. This pitiful state continued for seven or eight years. During this time my parents passed away, and my brothers, sisters, and cousins were under my care. Sometimes as I was reading the Bible or praying, Satan would accuse me of being a sinner and tell me that my sins could not be forgiven. No one came to help me, and I could not prove my salvation. One night I rose up to pray in the middle of the night. Hell appeared to open to me. I wanted to commit suicide, yet I was too afraid. I was very bothered. One day I read 1 John 1 and began to doubt the matter of forgiveness of sins. Later I thought that since I did not sin willfully, the Lord would surely forgive my sins.</p><p>Concerning the pursuit for holiness, I saw that this is not something that I can accomplish, but that the Christ on the throne accomplishes. For two years I was very busy in my job, but I was actually living a dry and wilting spiritual life. In the middle of one night, only being half-conscious, I heard a voice crying, "Fire, fire." I rose up hurriedly to put out the fire. There were over twenty people sleeping upstairs, and the fire was downstairs. The Lord's voice awoke me to put out the fire, and all of them were saved. Once I was a manager of a company, but in name only. I received good pay, but I did not have peace within. I realized that I had never submitted to any authority. I am a rebellious person. I prayed and asked the Lord to deal with me without concern for my pain. Shortly thereafter, I was hurt in an accident. I felt that my being was split into two parts. I was in much pain, but inwardly I was full of peace. The doctor said that I needed to stay in bed for a few months. Thank the Lord that He spoke to me. He healed my wound, and in one or two days I was able to get up from my bed. I had many questions in the past, but I no longer have any questions. I believe the Lord will enlighten my way through our brother.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>I do not know how much of God's speaking we have missed throughout our lifetime. If a man misses the discipline of the Holy Spirit, he misses God's speaking. If we are willing to humble ourselves and accept everything under the discipline of the Holy Spirit, the result will be the ministry of the word. If the discipline of the Holy Spirit does not consummate in any result, it will be a loss both to ourselves and to the church, because it will be a loss in the ministry of the word. If a man obeys God and does not rebel, the result will be a spontaneous uplifting of the ministry of the word. The many experiences we have of God's dealings are for the purpose of producing a word within us. We often are in His hand, yet we foolishly miss the opportunities that He has provided for us. The fruit of the work of the Holy Spirit is the ministry of the word. We need to have the ministry of the word before we can serve others. Under the discipline of the Holy Spirit, a vessel may break; that is, a man may lose his temper and begin to argue with God. Such a man is not able to meet others' needs. If a man neglects or fails to learn his lessons under the discipline of the Spirit, he has suffered in vain. The worst thing that can happen to a man is when he has the Spirit's discipline yet does not have the necessary result that comes from the discipline. It is a pity that some pass through the sufferings foolishly and ignorantly without learning any lesson.</p><p>There are two negative things that can possibly result from the discipline of the Holy Spirit. First, a man can go through such discipline ignorantly. Second, a man can begin to argue with God, murmuring and complaining against Him. The discipline that affords proper lessons to some can be ignored by others. These latter ones go through such experiences blindly and do not understand the Lord's intention behind them. They do not learn any lesson from them. I met a brother whom I have not seen for over ten years. He has suffered much, but he did not learn any spiritual lesson from his sufferings. On the one hand, we can attribute this to the shortage of supply in the ministry of the word in the church. Yet the discipline of the Spirit is never lacking, and we should never say that there are no lessons to be learned. A person who has lost the time of his discipline cannot supply others with the word. This is a loss in the discipline of the Holy Spirit. This loss in discipline is actually a loss to the ministry of the word.</p><p>In all the dealings we face, we have to see the Lord's hand. We have to see that the Lord is constituting, carving, and molding us. The constitution of the Holy Spirit is not just an idea; it is constituted through the experience of all the circumstances around us. All the experiences we have in our environment are the result of the Spirit's constituting work. His discipline is actually His constitution. The golden lampstand is beaten out of pure gold. The beating produces the mark, which is the result of the discipline of the Spirit. Everything that goes on in our environment is for the producing of the beaten lampstand. The way of the ministry of the word is not the way of gift, but the way that is wrought through God's beating. We are all clear within that the way today is the way of the Spirit's discipline. Where there is the discipline of the Spirit, there is the ministry of the word through the New Testament ministers. Everyone who is used by God is beaten and molded by God. To speak only by gifts, doctrines, truths, and teachings is not our way.</p><p>Once we acknowledge the discipline of the Spirit we will have fruit; we will have the speaking, the ministry of the word, and we will be able to supply others with Christ. But if we pass our days under the Lord's discipline in darkness or rebellion, we have suffered in vain. The church also will have suffered great loss. It is too great a loss to suffer without bearing any fruit. We must learn some more so that God can speak to us more. The Lord has been dealing with us for years, yet we often have neglected His dealings and wasted much time. May the Lord be merciful to us so that every one of us can function in the ministry of the word and supply others with Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(37)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 14, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER H. G.</h2><p>In my youth I considered Christianity to be a cultural invasion by the Western world. At the age of sixteen I went to Shanghai to study and began to attend the Apostolic Faith Church. There I saw many people healed of their sicknesses, and demons were cast out. I began to believe in the Lord Jesus. In 1925 I was baptized, but I did not know that I was saved. After I believed in the Lord, I immediately went to the streets to pass out gospel tracts. That was the happiest thing I had done in my life. I also enjoyed visiting various places and listening to different preachings. Later I went to Wen-teh Lane, Hardoon Road, in Shanghai and attended meetings there. Spiritual things became real to me, and I stopped going to other places. I also saw that denominationalism is wrong. After I met Sister Peace Wang, I became clear concerning the matter of the breaking of bread for the remembrance of the Lord. Once in my prayer, the Lord rebuked me for loving the world. Although I said in my prayer that I did not love the world, I still loved it in my heart. I had beautiful clothes in my room which I could not give up. I prayed to the Lord to deliver me from the love for beautiful clothing. He was merciful to me and heard my prayer. I was able to free myself from it. Now I am no longer bothered by such things.</p><p>Once, I read in Acts 9 about God's selection of His own vessels. The words of that chapter suddenly enlarged before my eyes. It seemed as if the Lord had chosen me. Yet I was not willing to answer His choosing. I was afraid, and I told Him, "I am satisfied to be an ordinary believer. I do not want to be a preacher." Once, I passed through a trial. I was wrongly accused and condemned. From that time forward, God began to strip me. He dealt with my playing of the piano and my love for food. Last summer I became weak, and by fall I was laid up in bed. As I lay on my bed one day, I realized that everything was vanity. I began to let go of everything, and I was willing to go along with the discipline of the Spirit. I dropped all my spiritual plans and told God, "If You want me to be weak, I am willing to be weak." After that I was at peace. At that time I felt that I could never be one with God, but now I believe that I will be one with Him one day.</p><p>After resting on my bed for a few months, I heard that there was going to be a special conference on April 9 of this year. I wrote to Brother Nee and told him that I would get out of bed to attend this conference. I told him, "I will be the first one to hand myself over." That night I was so overjoyed that I could not sleep. After that I continued to attend meetings until I came to the mountain. On the mountain I saw that I have none of the things that I should have, and I am full of all the things that I should not have. I am extremely sad. I have shed more tears during the past two weeks than in my entire life. One day as I was praying, I saw my failures as well as the failures of the brothers and sisters and the church. I became very sad. In my fellowship with the Lord, I heard one word: "God has put Christ in the church. The church is the only vessel that expresses Christ." When I saw this, my tears began to dry up. Man can fail, but the church can never fail.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our sister is on the right track. God wants us to know who is doing all the work. Today there are many mixtures in the Lord's work, and sometimes we cannot tell which work is of the Lord. God Himself wants to do all the work. Only then will He get all the results and glory. Whoever does the work will get the glory. God cannot say, "It is My work, yet the glory goes to you." This is like one fighting the battle, while another receives the medal. This is not possible. God is just as jealous for His work as He is for His glory. Any possibility of misunderstanding in the work will produce a possibility of misunderstanding in glory. Unless God does all the work, He cannot get all the glory. God does not allow a little of man's hand in His own work. Therefore, He has to bring us to the point where His work has nothing more to do with you and me.</p><p>We must learn to see that no work belongs to us. Once we relax, we become proud and give glory to ourselves. In the Lord's work, all artificial props have to go. They have to fall so utterly that we do not have any strength to even lift a finger. A brother once said, "I have to ask the Lord to cleanse with His blood the tears which I shed for my sins." This shows us that even our tears for sins can be impure in nature.</p><p>Before a man has fallen completely, the Lord cannot have a way through him. A Christian must have clear knowledge and discernment about one thing: Who is doing the work? If we are not careful, we will end up being the one who does the work, and we will become proud. The cross in 2 Corinthians 13 has to do with weakness. In His work God requires that we become weak with Christ. We have to be so weakened that we could not be proud even if we tried. It is a good sign when God's children are led to such weakness. It is good when they cannot even stand up on their own. If the wound a man suffers is deep enough, he will not need to try to remember anything; the Holy Spirit will remind him. If we still need the help of our memory in practicing such things as humility, patience, and obedience, it proves that the dealings we have received are not adequate. If we need to exercise our memory to remember to love, that love is not reliable. If we need to exercise our memory to remember to be patient, that patience is not reliable. If we need our memory for our humility, that humility is not reliable as well. Peter became so fallen and defeated that he dared not even confess his love for the Lord. He had no confidence in anything. When the Lord tested him, he failed completely. His fall was genuine. His stubbornness, confidence, and everything fell. He became truly weak. Such a weakness is kept in the memory of the Holy Spirit; Peter no longer had to rely on his own memory. A big wound was there. He had truly become weak. His fall was a fall of his very life. After this he could only work by the Holy Spirit. Not even an ounce of energy could come from him; from that point forward, every work belonged to the Lord.</p><p>We have to be so weakened in the work that no one will be confused as to who is working. Even if the work is very small, it will be apparent to everyone that this work is of the Lord. We will no longer have the slightest thought that we are doing the work. We have to be enlightened by the Lord to see our total uselessness and to see that not even the slightest work originates from us. We have to acknowledge wholeheartedly, "I am like a dead dog in the Lord's work." The principle of work is the principle of death and resurrection. Without death there is no resurrection. Man always wants the Lord to make up his lack. But this principle is basically wrong. The Lord's principle is first death, then resurrection. We have to know that we are dead already and that we need the Lord to resurrect us. Resurrection comes only when we see our utter uselessness. Only then will we give glory to God. When this happens, humility will be a spontaneous thing. If our humility is something that we can forget, it proves that there is still self effort in our humility and that we have not fallen enough. The goal of humility is that we give all the glory to God. We must forever be conscious that we are totally useless.</p><p>Our sister has to pay attention to another thing: Your prayer must be like your speaking, which means that the words must match the spirit. This is different from what I said about the other brother. With him, his speaking should be the same as his prayer. With you, your prayer should be as restricted as your speaking. When we speak, we know how to restrict ourselves; we know how to hold ourselves back. You should learn to hold back yourself in prayer and to be restricted. If you do, you will touch reality, and you will touch something powerful in your prayer. Your spirit will match your word. I believe the Lord will be gracious to you.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(38)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 16, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER F. T.</h2><p>I was saved in 1925 at the Bible school established by Sister Dora Yu in Jiang-Wan, Shanghai. My mother and husband passed away, and I lost all interest in the world. Two years later I returned to Canton and began meeting at a sister's house. Once I met Brother Nee's mother, who told me the truth concerning the church. I began to have a desire to serve the Lord full-time. After World War II, I returned to my hometown. It had third-and-fourth-generation, nominal Christians there who did not know any truth. After I explained the truth to them, they were saved in a clear way. Later we began to meet and break bread in my home. What I have heard this time on the mountain has caused me to condemn myself. All of my prayers are prayers of confession. Without the Lord's blood, I cannot lift up my head. I thought that I was poor. Now I realize that I am poorer than I realized.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>There are two aspects to Christianity. One is supernatural, and the other is spiritual. One is God's power manifested in the environment, and the other is God's power manifested in the heart. One is outward work, and the other is inward crafting. One is God answering our prayers, and the other is God molding our inward being. One is outward, and the other is inward. These two aspects result in two different kinds of Christians. Among God's children some pay attention to prayer, work, and supernatural things. Their eyes are on God's arranging hand in the environment. These ones know grace in an outward way. Others pay attention to inward dealings, inward teachings, inward light, the inward experience of God's hand, and the inward spiritual way. We wish our sister would realize that according to the revelation of the New Testament God wants to establish us in the inward spiritual way. Every outward thing that God has done is for the purpose of building up the inward things. Outward answers to prayer, outward arrangements, outward deliverances, and outward care are all for the purpose of edifying the inward being. It is good that you can come to the mountain and listen to all the testimonies and things concerning the Lord. God's children, however, face a greater danger than backsliding&mdash;caring only for the outward concerns and blessings while missing the inward fruit. If a man receives many answers to prayer and deliverance in the midst of his warfare, we can say that God has shown mercy to him. However, if a man only sees the outward care yet misses God inwardly, he is in a dreadful state. Once God's children are stuck with only outward blessings, they have fallen to the standard of the Jews.</p><p>The Christian blessings in the New Testament are spiritual, inward, and intrinsic. The blessings spoken of in Ephesians 1 are all spiritual. The New Testament Christians receive inward blessings, not outward ones. In Leviticus 26 God promised the Israelites that they could be spared from many sicknesses. Today there are many who have received the blessing of health. There are also many who have become sick and yet have received inward spiritual blessings. In Christ we have inward blessings as well as outward blessings. If a person only has outward blessings, he is standing on Jewish ground. We do not want any outward blessing to frustrate our inward progress. God pays attention today to spiritual blessings. Whether we receive blessing or chastisement, we have to understand God's way with us today. When we understand it, we will be enlightened within, and this will be genuine Christian salvation. God wants to turn us daily from outward blessings to inward blessings. Whether our outward circumstances are smooth or rough, everything should turn around eventually and become our inward blessing, including what apparently seems to be God's rejection. If we take this way, we will be full of light.</p><p>Paul prayed for the removal of his outward thorn; this was a prayer for outward blessing. The Lord did not answer this prayer. Instead He said, "My grace is sufficient for you." When Paul heard this word, he rejected the outward blessing for the inward blessing. God allowed the thorn to remain in order that Paul would know what weakness meant, what sufficient grace meant, and what the Lord's power being perfected through man's weaknesses meant. The outward thorn brought him spiritual profit. We must learn to take the inward way. Do not be distracted to take the outward way. The Lord is always taking us by the hand to go the inward way. We have to be clear about this way. We have to know what genuine Christian salvation is. We have to learn to accept the inward blessings. Sometimes the Lord perfects us through answering our prayers, but sometimes He perfects us through not answering our prayers. We do not have to pay too much attention to whether or not the Lord has answered our prayer. We only have to see whether or not we have received any spiritual blessing. There is no doubt that we have to know the Lord through the outward things, but we must see Him through the inward things as well. If we do this, our way will not only be straight, but we will be able to be a guide to others.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(39)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 17, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER Y. T.</h2><p>I was born into a family steeped in Buddhism and Confucianism. When I attended school at a denominational parochial school, I heard the Lord's gospel and immediately accepted Him. I loved to subscribe to spiritual publications, in particular those put out by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room. Once a brother helped me understand the truth concerning assurance of salvation. I had thought about going into a seminary, but when I met Brother Nee, he told me that very few great servants of the Lord had passed through seminaries. I did not have the light at that time and went through and graduated from a seminary anyway. From there I foolishly spent four years teaching in a Bible school. Others used me during this time to oppose the local church. Later I read the article "A Debate concerning Denominationalism" in The Christian, and I realized that the local church is right. Although I saw this truth, I did not take the ground myself. Later I moved to southeast Asia and worked in the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church. It was during this time that I began to feel dry and condemned. I felt that I merely had doctrines; I did not have any life supply. I began to lose interest in the denominations. Later I received from a brother the book Rethinking Our Work (The Normal Christian Church Life). After I read it I received the light and quit my job at the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church. Brother Nee agreed that I would go to Shanghai to be trained and to live by faith. Yet I had too many considerations. I was uneasy at heart and did not submit to the discipline of the Holy Spirit. I am not qualified to serve the Lord. May the Lord be merciful to me so that my one talent will become useful. May this uncomely member become comely, and may the Lord be glorified.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>On the one hand, you are quite seeking, and you are doing your best to take the Lord's way. On the other hand, as you have confessed, you spend too much time considering many things. There are two kinds of people with regards to spiritual things: those who admire and those who consecrate. The second kind have offered up everything in an absolute way and have cast every consideration aside. You have enough admiration, but you are short in consecration. Because your consecration is shallow, your way is not straight. In order to take this way, a man has to give up his all and offer everything to the Lord. If a man only admires but does not consecrate, he will be wasting his spiritual future. You have turned from one problem to another, from one way to another. In the early days a group of people in Foochow admired much but accomplished nothing; they wasted their life because they were short in consecration. You have enough light to turn away from the world, but you do not have enough light to destroy the love for the world. You have enough light to know the errors, but you do not have enough light to depart from the errors and do the right things. This kind of life is painful. I hope that you will receive enough light this time to drop all the enjoyments of the world to follow the Lord.</p><p>A man can only choose one kind of joy; he cannot have two kinds of joy. He cannot have spiritual joy and worldly joy at the same time. If he does, he will be unhappy in both worlds. It is impossible to have spiritual joy and worldly joy at the same time. You are better than many spiritual Christians already, yet you are still not strong enough. You have to be a little more violent when it comes to the kingdom of the heavens. You have to be a little more violent in paying the price, in offering up your all. You have to put everything into one basket. To use a less refined term, you have to take a big gamble. If you have never consecrated yourself absolutely to the Lord, you will turn away at the first sight of a test. The discipline of the Holy Spirit will not produce any result in you. I hope that you can have a fresh start and that God's tests will consummate in good results. You have to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Otherwise, you will suffer great loss before the Lord. You have been a believer for twenty years. You cannot say that the discipline of the Spirit has not produced any fruit during these twenty years. But you must not run away before the discipline finishes its work. If you do not humble yourself under the mighty hand of God, instead always planning a new start of your own, you will not see any result to your discipline. We become rich when the discipline of the Holy Spirit is turned into spiritual teachings for us. If we cannot suffer to wait for the result of the discipline of the Spirit to consummate in us, we will waste His work. We do not have many decades to waste. It is a pity indeed if we do not receive the fruit of the discipline of the Spirit during this time. Only those who have accepted the discipline of the Spirit have God's word, and only they can serve Him. Brother, I advise you to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit. This will produce fruit, and you will be able to lead others on. You have to be delivered from all forms of laziness and ease. You have to make up your mind to offer yourself to the Lord. Do not just admire the spiritual pathway. You will not receive anything if you only admire but do not sacrifice. When the Lord operates in you, you have to stand on the Lord's side and allow the Spirit's discipline to produce some fruit in you.</p><p>Our brother also has to learn to hold himself back when he speaks. If he is able to hold himself back, the spirit will be released. Of course, there are those who need to release themselves before their spirit can come out. Usually, however, a man has to hold himself back before his spirit can be released.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(40)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 19, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER T. S.</h2><p>I accepted the Lord in the midst of a sickness in 1932. The next year my mother consecrated me to be a preacher. I dropped many of my bad habits after I believed in the Lord. I began to love reading spiritual books. After I read them, however, I would feel condemned for not being able to practice what I read. Later I got a word: "Whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us walk," and I was at peace. In 1935 I attended the Overcomer Conference by Brother Nee in Chuanchow. In January of 1948, my right eye became blurred, and I was reminded of Matthew 6:23, which says, "If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!" I gave this matter to the Lord. Although I did not have the Lord's word, I trusted that I would be healed by His mercy. I did not expect that I would be able to come to the mountain this time. I have had some realization that I was incapable. But this time I want to know how incapable I actually am, so that God will have mercy on me and grant me deliverance.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>We are incapable in the sight of the Lord, and we are also incapable in the sight of God's work. Even if we think that we are capable, it does not mean that we can make it on our own. Those who think they can make it are incapable, and those who think they cannot make it are also incapable. This is a basic qualification for the work. On the negative side we have to see that we are incapable. On the positive side we have to learn to look to the Lord. The principle of 2 Corinthians 1:9 is always with us. Once we acknowledge our poverty in everything, having the sentence of death in ourselves, we will no longer trust in ourselves. Rather, we will look to the Lord who raises the dead. Only then will the work be the Lord's. When the Lord shows us that we cannot do anything, then we will be able to take up God's work. We have to realize that all works are done by God Himself. God's work is God's business. Any work that is done by man can only be called man's work. I cannot call Chang-san's work Lee-shi's. Anyone who puts his hands to a work can claim that work to be his. What is God's work? God's work is God working. God's work is not done by you and me, but by God Himself. Many people claim that they are doing God's work. This is not only wrong but actually impossible, because if it is truly God's work, this means that you and I are not the ones who are doing the work. If a work is done by a man, it is certainly not done by God. Many people have to waste much time before they find out that no work of God is done by man. We have no part in God's work; we are not related to His work, and we are absolutely useless in His work. Only when God shows us that we can do nothing will we look up to Him and acknowledge that no work is ours; all the works are His alone. Once we have this knowledge, the way is clear. God has no desire to mix man's work with His work. He is waiting for the day when no one will be confused, when everyone will see that all works are done by Him alone and that we have no share in them at all.</p><p>Many people struggle and wrestle for power because they cannot accept weakness. As a result, the Lord cannot build up anything in them. How God wants to work on us and build us up is His business. We only need to accept our weakness. The problem with man is that he tries to be strong and refuses to be weak. However, Paul was so weak that he despaired even of living. Many people still seek power to overcome their weakness when they are excessively burdened beyond their power. We should be like Paul, who did not put his confidence on himself "but on God, who raises the dead" (2 Cor. 1:9). He did this when he was excessively burdened beyond his power and despaired even of living, having the response of death in himself. If we do this we will be able to rest as Paul did, and we will no longer struggle to overcome our weaknesses. We will know that all works are the Lord's. We will find these works to be apart from us and absolutely of the Lord. When this happens, we will be filled with joy and peace.</p><p>Our brother also should be more released in his speaking. When the Lord's dealings are not deep enough, a man can hold back himself. But if the wound of the Lord's dealing is deep enough, our speaking should be more released. Unfortunately, when some people release themselves, unclean and mixed elements also are released. Therefore, on the one hand, we should not release ourselves easily. On the other hand, we should release ourselves when it is the right time. The most important thing is that we should accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and we should have wounds, that is, the mark of the cross. If we have these things, it will be easy to release the spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(41)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 20, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER W. M.</h2><p>I was born into a Buddhist family. My mother was a vegetarian for over thirty years. Later a Western missionary invited her to hear the gospel, and both she and I were saved. Afterwards I became an elder in a denomination. Still later I went to Shanghai and heard Brother Nee, who said that when we come to meetings, we should not only come for sermons, but we should come to pray as well. I listened to the brothers praying, but I dared not pray myself, and I did not know anything about prayer. I was not even that clear about my salvation. Three brothers in northern Kiangsu left the denominations. Later they disagreed on the matter of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. I saw that I am a witness of the Lord, and I prayed for the gift of healing. The Lord gave me the gift. By the Lord's mercy, I received the gift outwardly, but I was still very dry inwardly. Later I read the book In His Presence and other books by Madame Guyon and turned from the pursuit of gifts to the pursuit of the inner life. When the war broke out, I was not able to fellowship with spiritual brothers, and I was short of spiritual books. As a result, I did not receive any supply from others but had to struggle in myself. During this period of spiritual pursuit, I often found myself grieved in spirit and losing my peace. I did not enter into rest until I heard Brother Nee release the messages of life on May 25, 1948 at Customs Lane in Foochow. I realized that the discipline of the Spirit comes before our conduct, while the condemnation of the conscience comes after it. I also learned something concerning spiritual feelings. I am willing to start all over again in learning to subject my mind, emotion, and will to spiritual discipline.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>I want to speak two things in particular to Brother Wu. First, in spiritual matters, we should not seek to understand too much knowledge. It is better to be a little foolish and ignorant in spiritual things. We have to learn to commit everything to the Lord. In spiritual matters, we should not say too quickly, "I have understood." Nor should we analyze too much with our mind. We only have to be clear about the principles; we do not have to insist on knowing the fine details. With many spiritual matters, we touch death as soon as we begin to analyze. The more we know about our inward condition, the more we die. Once I asked a doctor in Shanghai, "What do you touch when you operate on a human body, a living body or a dead corpse?" He answered, "I only operate on living persons." I responded, "But the parts that you operate on have been visited by death." Wherever a surgeon's scalpel goes, death is present. The same principle applies in spiritual matters. We cannot analyze, understand, and clarify too much. If we try to analyze, understand, and clarify our inward condition too much, we will touch death. We can only understand our inward condition to a certain degree. We cannot go beyond a certain line. Once we cross that line, we cross into death. My speaking here on the mountain is spoken with reservation. Many spiritual things cannot be discussed or analyzed. Even if one can analyze some things, he can only do so in a limited way. But I myself do not know the extent of it. Once a man crosses a certain boundary, he touches death. If a child cuts open a man's heart because he wants to know what the heart is like, he will kill the man. I wrote The Spiritual Man under duress in sickness. It was bad enough that I wrote it, but it hurts me more to see brothers and sisters discussing, studying, and analyzing it. My delving into the subjects of that book was a taunting of the boundary line (like a frontier line between two nations at war). If anyone tries to study or analyze these subjects, he has crossed the boundary line, and the result will be nothing but death.</p><p>Our emphasis now is on the breaking of the outer man for the release of the inner man. This has to do with facts. Therefore, we do not have to analyze too much, and we do not need to be too clear about it. We should not be too meticulous about the details. If we are, we will be led into death. If an organ is dead, the doctor can handle it and examine it, but anything living cannot be easily touched. When the Lord grants us mercy and gives us the light, everything will be clear to us. Today we can only stop here. If we analyze and study too much, we will end up in death. All we need to do is trust in the Lord positively and obey Him. There is no need to study or analyze too much.</p><p>What we really need is to experience the positive wound of the cross. Only those who have such wounds will afford the Lord a free way. Whatever we do, we have to have the wound of the cross. This is the only way for life to flow out in our service.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(42)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 21, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER D.

Before I was saved, I could not find any rest from the world, even though I read a great deal of Buddhist literature. Later I read the Bible and discovered that there is an explanation to every person, thing, and event in our life. I believed in the Lord. Later I subscribed to The Christian and read an article about leaving the denominations. I decided to leave my denomination together with another brother. After this we began to meet with about a hundred people on the ground of oneness of the local church. Most of them were poor, illiterate farmers, but all of them loved the Lord in one accord. They all lived a simple life and were full of peace. My oldest son did not believe in the Lord. I prayed for him earnestly with tears, and eventually he accepted the Lord. Every time I faced a trial, I would fellowship with the Lord, and this fellowship was so sweet to me. I do not know how many years I have left, and I do not know how to go on in the Lord's way, but I pray for the Lord's mercy and guidance.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>In China the greatest number of churches are found in the Wenchow, Chekiang area. Some workers have passed away. Among the older ones, only Brother Du-xin Yu's course has been a straight one. He has committed himself to the Lord, and the Lord has never failed him. God has led him to build up many churches. You say that you are an ordinary man with little education, but this matters little in the eyes of God. I hope that our brother will be much enriched in the spiritual life. Although you have touched the right way and have run the straight course, this is not enough. You have to ask God for mercy so that He would guide you to receive more abundant grace within a short period of time.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(43)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 23, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER Y. S.</h2><p>My father was an atheist. When I was seventeen I saw a demon being cast out of a man. I was touched by the Lord's authority and believed in Him. Four years ago I became sick and vomited blood profusely. Through prayer I was healed. In 1933 Brother Nee conducted a special conference in Shanghai. The subject of the messages was Christ and the church. Christ is the victorious Lord. I received much help from these messages. I also received much help from Ministering to the House or to God? The Lord wanted me to consecrate everything to Him. My wife was not of the same mind, and I gradually became more lax. Two things happened last year which took away all of our money. I became very sad. Once our house caught on fire. The Lord heard my prayer; He changed the direction of the wind and sent rain to us. I was spared from death. I asked my wife, "I could have died from this fire. How many husbands do you have to spare? You and I and our whole family have to hand ourselves over to the Lord." Later I went to Foochow and handed myself over.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our brother's course has been quite straight. The Lord has been merciful to him in this way. Yet God's children should not pray for outward grace all the time. We should learn to receive inward grace. The grace we receive from the Lord outwardly should not exceed the lessons we learn inwardly. We should, of course, thank the Lord for the outward grace. But if our flesh is never dealt with, we will still be strong and stubborn. The Lord healed ten lepers, but only one came back to thank and praise Him. We have to learn to pick up the inward lessons even when there is no outward blessing. Sometimes we know the Lord more when He does not answer our prayer. Of course, we should not go to extremes like the ascetics. We have to be balanced. We can thank the Lord for His outward grace. But we should not force God to do anything. We can ask God for outward grace, but we should not force Him to do what He does not want to do. Once I was talking to Sister M. E. Barber in the living room, and two sisters were praying in the back room. One of them was quite forceful. Miss Barber asked, "Should you pray like she does?" Before I could answer her, she said, "You should never pray like she does. You can never force God to answer your prayer." When a man is desperate, he wants to force God to do what He does not want to do. The spiritual condition of God's children involves a balance between the inward and the outward. If there are many outward experiences with very few inward experiences, it means that there is very little inward knowledge. We must always maintain a balance between the outward and the inward.</p><p>The fundamental exercise for a Christian is to pick up the inward lessons first. When a man is under God's mercy, he will experience outward grace frequently, and this grace is indeed necessary. But if a man has not learned the inward lessons, no outward grace will profit him anything. The Israelites experienced much outward grace, but they did not know the Lord. No one witnessed as many outward miracles as the Israelites, yet no one rebelled against God as much either. In the same principle, the church in Corinth received much outward knowledge and many gifts. Outwardly speaking, it could have been the most blessed church. Yet it lacked inward grace. The Corinthians did not learn the lessons inwardly. This is the reason Paul said that they had become kings, while he with the other apostles were still among the least (1 Cor. 4:8-9). We must turn inward for our lessons. I believe our brother has maintained an inward knowledge of the Lord all these years. When an incident arises, we have to see what God is doing and what lesson we have to learn from it.</p><p>Our brother's spirit has everything to do with the way he took in the past. When one speaks, we have to notice whether or not his spirit is pure. The first half of his testimony was weak in spirit. His spirit became a little stronger in the second part. Our brother should have wounds in his spirit. Otherwise, others will only hear his words but not touch his spirit. In serving the Lord a worker should learn to have a broken spirit. In the Old Testament we find the expression a contrite spirit, that is, a spirit that is broken and not whole. We can call it a "scarred spirit." After a man is smitten by God, he will become broken; he no longer can be whole again. It will be easy for him to prostrate himself and for his spirit to be released. The worst thing that can happen to a worker is to have a whole spirit. After a man is smitten, he will not be able to lift up his head again; he will no longer be whole. There is a difference between brokenness and strength. Brokenness is a matter of taste, while strength is a matter of power. A broken spirit is a stricken spirit; it has to do with taste. After a father or mother disciplines his or her children severely, the children behave differently. Although they still eat, work, listen, and speak, the flavor is different; they now have a disciplined spirit. Spontaneously, they are no longer nonchalant or careless; there is not the need for them to consciously check themselves. A disciplined spirit spontaneously cultivates a fear for the Lord. It is not a performance but a restriction that comes naturally. Such a person can easily prostrate himself, and he is always pliable. Those who have never been disciplined do not know what this taste is like. As I was listening to our brother's testimony, I felt that his spirit was released yet the wound was not deep enough. I hope that there will be more wounds in our brother so that he will not be able to stand up again before God. The increase of wounds always facilitates the outflow of the spirit. Once the spirit flows out, it is easy to touch others and approach them. Some people remain at a distance from others' lives; their words can never reach others' hearts. If the spirit is broken, not only are words released but the words are released through the spirit as well. Although our brother has deeper wounds than other brothers and sisters, these wounds are not deep enough. Our wounds should be as deep as possible. The more wounds we have and the deeper they are, the easier it is for our spirit to be released.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(44)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 24, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER C. P.</h2><p>Before I became a Christian, I was very prejudiced against Christianity, and for a long time I opposed and rejected it. In my youth I lived a free and romantic life, visiting theaters, playing card games, and learning to dance. Once I took hospitality at a sister's house and heard the gospel. I heard that there is a God in this universe and that He desires to draw near to man. He sent Christ to the world to seek for sinners. That day I felt that I was a great sinner. I knew that the Lord Jesus loved me, and I accepted Him as my Savior. After I became a believer, my life was greatly changed. I made confessions to my father, and I began to lose my taste for the theater. I changed my attire and let my hair grow long. Later I taught in a parochial school and met a Christian colleague. We began to serve the Lord together in one accord, and we began to have meetings with brothers and sisters at home. Unconsciously, I became proud, and my spiritual condition deteriorated. The Lord disciplined me and put me through a serious illness. Although I have no lack in material things, I constantly live in anxiety. I cannot control my own thoughts, and I always try to sustain God's work with my own goodness.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>I think you were very nervous in your fellowship. It seems that you find the spiritual pathway very hard and that you are pressed by some heavy burdens. You are like a child climbing up a mountain with a heavy burden on his shoulder. We have one brother who was always condemned in his conscience. He confessed his sins continually and constantly was anxious about his mistakes. One day I told him, "From this day forward, I forbid you to confess any more sins. The brothers will bear your responsibility. You do not have to confess any sin." I know that you want very much to be strong and that you are very desperate. This is the reason you are so nervous. You are very desperate, and this vexes your heart. You should not be too subjective in your pursuit. Do not insist that the Lord do anything for you. Instead, rest in Christ. Although you desire progress, holiness, and meekness, it is impossible for you to enter into rest unless you see the perfect accomplishment that Christ, who is now at the right hand of God, has obtained. God told Balaam that there was no evil in the house of Jacob. But later the Israelites fell into idolatry and fornication. We first sit, and then we walk. We do not walk first and then sit. We rest, then we can walk. We have to see that in Christ and before God, we cannot be any more perfect than we are now. The garment that I have is the same as Christ's; we are most perfect in the eyes of God. We are accepted by God to the same degree that the Lord Jesus is accepted. You have to learn to rest in Christ's perfect work. You have to see that in Christ you can access God's throne immediately. We have a basic need, which is a conscience void of offense. This is a conscience that is free from sin and even from the consciousness of sin. The Lord Jesus' blood can make you this clean. You are perfect in God. There are two places in the Bible that speak of our sins being dealt with: "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 8:1). "Having once been purified, would have no longer had the consciousness of sins" (Heb. 10:2). On the one hand, there is no good thing in our flesh. On the other hand, we are perfect in Christ. This contradiction is normal.</p><p>We have to learn to see that we are already buried in the grave. There is no need to waste any effort on ourselves. The Lord's work is perfect. The blood of His Son Jesus has cleansed us from all sins. Our conscience is at peace. There is no need to be nervous. You have to rest in the Lord. Do not be a living person who constantly deals with a dead corpse. The Lord is your holiness, and there is no need to seek holiness in yourself or to deal with yourself any longer. You have to accept the perfection that is in Christ. Do not struggle to improve yourself. Even if you are wrong, there is no need to be anxious. You cannot control your self. Let go of the self. Let go, and you will be anxious no longer. I think that you have not only been anxious during the last few days, but anxious for over ten years. If you keep your eyes on yourself, not on the perfection you obtained in Christ, you will never have the rest. Suppose you had an enemy who always tried to hurt you, but who is now dead. Perhaps you have even seen his grave with your own eyes. If you are still afraid that he will knock on your door and hurt you, your fear is groundless. On the one hand, you have seen the perfection you inherited in Christ. On the other hand, you still find so many things wrong with yourself. There is no need to try to deal with the wrongs. There is only a need to rest in Christ's perfection. Unless you can do this, your sleepless nights will not end; you still will be unable to sleep at night. Once you try to deal with your problems by your own strength, you become anxious. Relax and do not be introspective. Do not look at yourself, but on the Lord alone, and you will have rest. If a man keeps looking at himself, he will not be able to stand in front of Satan. Man was not able to remain in a covering made of leaves but needed a covering made of animal skin, because coverings made of leaves could be torn apart, while coverings made of animal skin could never be torn apart. If you put on Christ, God will not see your wrongs. God will not set His eyes on the covering of leaves. He will only set His eyes on the covering of skin, because only skin lasts and covers forever. The more a man looks inward, the worse he becomes. Never look inward. Even if you are wrong, you should not care. If you are not clear about your position in Christ, you will not be able to deal with your self. We are indeed very near to God. Christ is our all; He is our perfection. Through Christ, we can draw near to God in the most intimate way. Our sister does not have adequate knowledge of the objective facts. She is involved with too many subjective dealings. Once she sees the Lord of glory, perhaps her own problems will go away.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(45)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 25, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER G. G.</h2><p>I was born into a poor family. In 1927 I accepted the Lord. Soon after, I began to confess my sins to others. I also began preaching the gospel to children. I was married at the age of eighteen. My husband was an unbelieving doctor who was involved with all kinds of evils. He loved his sins, but I loved my Lord. I began to suffer as soon as I married into his household. I have one girl and one boy, who died at the age of one month. When he died his finger was pointing toward heaven. Although my son died, I dared not look sorrowful, for fear of being criticized. I was still full of joy in my heart and was still able to sing hymns. Others thought that I was out of my mind, but they did not know me. I knew that I was the mystery of God.</p><p>Once Brother Witness Lee came to our hometown to conduct conferences. I became clear about the ground of the church and left my denomination. Everyone in my family opposed me and even beat me up. Later my mother had a stroke and was sick for four months. I took care of her all that time and learned some lessons. I prayed for a mind to suffer. The Lord's hand seemed heavy upon me all the time, and I was kept in lowly works. I have been meeting with the brothers and sisters in the church and have received the life supply from them. Gradually, I led my family to serve the Lord together in the church. Thank the Lord that my house has become a center of hospitality for the brothers and sisters. Once, I seemed to hear a voice which said, "You should be separated unto Me completely." I answered readily and said, "Lord, this is what I should do. I belong to You." I am willing to put myself in the hand of the Lord and the church and to serve the Lord together with all the brothers and sisters.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Sister, you have to realize that it is not good for a person to be entirely ignorant of God's dealings, but neither is it good for him to be entirely clear about these dealings. It is wrong for a man to be completely ignorant or completely clear about God's dealings. Just as it is not good for a man to be entirely ignorant of his breathing, neither is it good for a man to be completely conscious and aware of his breathing. In the spiritual pathway, it is a wonderful thing for a man to always be in God's light and in ignorance at the same time. On the one hand, he should know everything that the Lord is doing. On the other hand, he should know nothing that the Lord is doing. Moses did not know anything about the shining on his face. Do you think his face would still have shone if he had looked into a mirror every day? No, he would have fallen into an unhealthy practice if he had done this. In our spiritual pathway, we know on the one hand, and we trust on the other hand. We have to exercise faith for at least half of the things we do. In the Christian journey, it is not a good sign if a man is totally in darkness and ignorance. However, it is equally bad if a man knows everything that God is doing in him. In God's dealings with the believers, we need to know some of His dealings, but we do not need to know others.</p><p>We have to learn to know the basic principles. Some are completely in darkness regarding the spiritual way. They are ignorant of everything that God is doing. They are totally void of light. Others know everything; they are confident about everything. This is too much. Under normal circumstances, a man should be like Paul: "For now we see...obscurely" (1 Cor. 13:12). The Christian life should strike a balance between the two extremes with regards to past knowledge and experiences. We have to maintain a blessed ignorance. There are times when we have to exercise faith in the midst of ignorance. If our sister wants to advance in spiritual things, she should not insist on knowing anything from now on. She should believe that the Lord is never wrong. If something should be known, let it be known spontaneously; she should not insist on trying to know. If a man becomes too clear of spiritual things, there is the temptation that he will become proud. When Moses' face shone, it was better for him not to know about it; it was better still for him not to look into the mirror. If he were to look at himself, it would be better for him to look when he was not shining. It is a glory to not know about one's own shining. As soon as one knows it, there is no more glory. The same principle applies to the case of Stephen's shining face. It is blessed ignorance when one does not realize that his own face is like that of an angel's. That is the time when glory shines. We cannot go to the extreme. We have to maintain a proper balance. By not knowing and not seeking to know, we do not lose any blessing. When we know too much and become too clear, it is easy for us to fall into pride, and we lose the blessing. The more ignorant we are, the easier it is for us to keep the blessing. If we can enumerate all our spiritual experiences and can clearly explain them one by one, they no longer are blessings to us. Such an action will make us proud on the one hand and chase away the blessing on the other hand. Our sister's pathway has been straight, but she has bothered herself too much with explanations and perhaps knows a little too much. You have to guard against possible pride.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(46)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 26, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER H. L.</h2><p>I do not know the exact date when I was saved. My parents were both Christians, and I am by nature a quiet person. When I was ten years old, I began to sit through sermons. Because my older brother and sister passed away early, I became the darling of the family. While I was in medical school, I heard Dr. Stearn's preaching. Some of the words pricked my heart. At that time I was busy with my school work. One day I became sick with an almost incurable illness. I prayed, "Lord, if You heal me, I will consecrate myself to You." I became well soon after that. The matter was forgotten, and I put away my consecration. Although I read the Bible often, I had no desire to seek after the Lord. In 1942 the church received me, and in 1943 the Lord wanted me to offer up my possessions to Him. After I made the offering, I became proud, thinking that I had done something that deserved merit. The Lord's word came to me: "I love mercy, not sacrifice."</p><p>In spiritual things, I am easily affected. Some time ago I became sick again. This time I needed long-term convalescence. I stayed in bed for a few months. Because of my prolonged stay in the hospital, I neglected my family. As a result, my wife and I were not in harmony very much. When my children were disobedient and my wife reported these things to me, I would become unhappy. One day the Lord seemed to say to me, "Honor your wife." I did not agree in my heart, because I thought that my wife was the one who should submit to me. Later I saw that I was actually behind my wife in everything, and I began to honor her. Once I obeyed the Lord this way, the problems in the family went away. It is the Lord's mercy that I am able to come up to the mountain without many hindrances.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>First Corinthians 7:14 says, "The unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother; otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy." The gospel preacher always tells others that there is no middle ground. Actually, between salvation and perdition there is another ground. An unbelieving wife is different from other kinds of wives. Although children born into Christian families are not automatically saved, they are on a different ground. They are closer to the Lord, but few of them ever are saved in a dramatic way.</p><p>God deals with men in fragmentary, fundamental, or supplementary ways. Sometimes God deals with men in a fragmentary way. At other times He deals with men in a fundamental way. At still other times He deals with them in a supplementary way. Supplementary dealing is similar to fragmentary dealing, except that the significance of the two dealings is different. Supplementary dealing is additional; it is something added to a fundamental dealing. Fragmentary dealings are like symptomatic cures in medical treatment. Fundamental dealings are like major operations, and supplementary dealings are like post-operative treatments of supplemental medications that help recover the health of the body. Fragmentary dealings must be accompanied by fundamental dealings before the former will become beneficial to a person. If there are no fundamental dealings, the fragmentary dealings will become a frustration to the fundamental dealings. After there are fundamental dealings, supplementary dealings come as an added benefit. Outwardly, fragmentary dealings appear to be the same as supplementary dealings, but they are not the same inwardly. The main difference is in the experience of a fundamental dealing. Once a person has a fundamental dealing, all fragmentary dealings become supplementary dealings. Our brother was raised up in a Christian family. The Lord has not dealt with him in any drastic way. It seems as if it is easy for him to simply pick up supplementary dealings. This is a great blessing. He has an advantage over others in that he can be spared of many miscellaneous dealings and can save some time.</p><p>In our course of following the Lord, there are many big things and big revelations that we have to see. We should not be distracted by the small things. If there are supplementary dealings, we have to accept them. When the Lord is doing something big, however, we should not be held down by small things. We have to learn to pay attention to the big things. If the president of a nation is conducting a meeting on national policy, and his wife cables and tells him that the servant has overcooked the rice, the president should not tend to such a small matter, even though his wife or servant may think that it is a big matter. The same can be said of our Christian experience; we should not allow the small things in our living to affect the big things. Today God is doing many big things in the believers and in the church. But He often is frustrated because the believers have set their eyes on small things. Our brother's view should be uplifted to see the big things. In order to take care of the overall need, he should turn away from insignificant and unrelated things. The experiences you had in the past can be considered as God's supplementary work in you. However, you have overlooked the fundamental and great things. Our brother has indeed been taking a straight course, but as he just now confessed, he is afraid of being influenced by others. It seems as if he has to be led by the hand before he can walk. I hope that in the coming days our brother will place his attention on gaining knowledge of the major things.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(47)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 27, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER C. S.</h2><p>I was saved in 1938. For two years after I was saved, I was a prodigal son. I went into business in my own zeal but did not accomplish anything. Then I became sick for a few months. In desperation I knelt down to pray and confessed my sins with tears. Later I went to Chefoo and was touched by Brother Lee when he spoke on the kingdom of the heavens. I began to experience the discipline of the Holy Spirit. As a result, I resolved to choose Jesus and nothing else. At the time the Japanese surrendered, I also surrendered myself to the Lord. The Lord lives for me, and the brothers and sisters also lived for me. They sold their possessions, lent me money, and helped my business. Later I was able to return all the money. When I was in a bread-breaking meeting in Peking, I saw the Body life. I knew that I could not live without the Lord. As soon as I live unto myself, I lose my peace, but as soon as I live to the Lord, my peace comes back.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Brother Sun is a frank and zealous person. His words are bold, and he loves God. His pathway in the past has been straight. There are two ways in front of our brother. These two ways will result in two different kinds of Christians. Today I can advise Brother Sun to take either of these two ways. One is to soften himself before God and to restrain his speaking a little. This will cool our brother down a little and bridle his tongue. Once his tongue is bridled, his spirit will be purified. But if our brother takes this advice, he may lose his zeal as well as his boldness. Now he is released, but if he restrains himself, his thoughts may not be able to meet his needs. Now he is released, and his spirit is strong. These factors somewhat mitigate the poverty in his thoughts. If he restrains himself, his spirit will not be as strong, and his thoughts will not be able to meet his needs. The other advice I can give to our brother is to tell him to continue to be strong, zealous, released, and bold. (It is a delicate thing to help the brothers. The responsibility is great. There is always the danger of emphasizing one thing while neglecting something else.) If we advise him to be zealous, bold, and released, we must tell him that he must also match these things with a greater and purer spirit. But how can such a matching be accomplished? I do not have a ready answer. I will instead point out a way&mdash;the way of passing from death to resurrection.</p><p>The way that I will point out is the way of passing through death to resurrection. We all know that Peter was a strong and bold person. His words could influence others. He was a born leader. Yet he had not learned the adequate lessons before the Lord. God allowed him to fail miserably, even to the point of denying the Lord in front of a maid. Then his boldness was gone. A man who had boasted that he would die for the Lord denied Him with a curse. After the Lord resurrected, He went to Peter and restored him. He asked Peter three times, "Do you love Me?" Peter had lost all of his confidence. Yet he passed through death to resurrection. At Pentecost he was the one among the twelve disciples who stood up to speak. It was he who spoke at the Beautiful Gate in the temple to the lame man, saying, "Stand up and walk." It was he who spoke at the house of Cornelius. How bold he was when he spoke! Moses in the Old Testament was an able speaker. Yet at first he only had a fleshly boldness. He killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew. He was dealt with by the Egyptians and ran away into the wilderness. After a long period of time, he became weak. When God called him, he had lost all confidence in himself. He once considered himself very qualified to save the people of Israel, but when God sent him to Pharaoh, he was reluctant to take up the commission. He said that he was slow in speech. God comforted him and told him that Aaron would be his mouth. Yet in Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy, we do not hear Aaron speaking; Moses always did the speaking.</p><p>The stories of both Peter and Moses show us that something died within them. However, there was also something that did not die, something which rose from the dead. This is resurrection. If everything had died, there would have been no resurrection. However, if everything remained alive, there would have been no death. Resurrection means passing through death but not being held by death. Something comes out of death. Moses died completely to his speaking. He said that he was slow in speech. In resurrection, however, he did all the speaking. When the Lord asked Peter, "Do you love Me?", Peter dared not answer. It seemed as if everything had died. Yet eventually this same Peter fed the Lord's lambs and loved Him. If we bury a book in the ground, it will remain there until the Lord comes back; it will remain dead. If we bury a seed in the ground, however, part of it will die, but part of it will not die. The part that does not die will sprout because it has life in it. The same principle applies to those who have God's life; there is a part in them which will not die. This part is the resurrection life, the life of God. Resurrection means allowing the parts that can die to die and allowing the parts that will not die to live.</p><p>In Brother Sun's case, if by weakening himself a little, he ends up being truly weakened, we could only say that there is death but no resurrection. Therefore, it is not a simple thing to exhort others to accept the dealings of the cross. If a brother who is full of the flesh is dealt with, everything with him will be terminated; nothing will remain, because everything will have died. If anything in him is after God's will, it will remain after passing through the cross. This is resurrection. Some are very zealous in the work, in the gospel, and in their love for the Lord. But as soon as they are dealt with, they sink into the ground and give up everything. Yet in Peter and Moses, we see many things which did not die. They passed through the cross and came out on the other side. What emerges from resurrection is something totally different because it bears the mark of the cross; something fresh and living emerges that is pleasing to God. We can exhort Brother Sun to accept the cross so that his natural strong points can be eliminated. Anything in him that passes through death and resurrection will be accepted by God. He still will be as bold and zealous as before, but it will be accompanied by the wound of the cross. Some people have said that those who are good at conducting revival meetings in the denominations become powerless and quiet once they join us. We need to ask such ones how much of what they have is beyond death. This is a good test. Peter's boldness after his experience of death and resurrection was many times greater than his boldness before death. Previously, he was afraid of a little maid. But eventually he was not afraid of even Roman soldiers and prison.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(48)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 28, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER O. C.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. My father wanted me to study theology so that I could be a preacher. I joined a seminary in Shao-Kwan. After I graduated in 1927, I began to work as a preacher around the Hakkas people of south China. I was able to support myself and my co-workers from 1928 to 1938. Later, when I had used up my money, I prayed to the Lord for supply, and He answered my prayer. My grandmother wanted me to get married, and after I was married, she demanded that my wife do all the manual work, such as carrying water, cutting grass, and cooking for her. I was quite bothered. Later I moved to a place and started a mission hall. It was not like the local church, and I felt quite dry. For eight years I did not bear much fruit. I have been idle for the past twenty years. The thought of this puts me to shame before the Lord. I am unable to anything, as I was unable to do anything in the past. I have the Lord's word. I have heard it and seen it, but I am still unable to do anything. I need the Lord's mercy.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>The things that happened to you during the past twenty or more years are over. I hope that from now on you will receive the supply from the brothers and sisters and the church so that your pathway will become straight. You have to pay attention to two things. First, your mind is very quick. I do not know if you feel this way or not. What you have learned from the Lord is not as much as you think you have learned. Your inward experience does not match your outward mind. You are a very smart person. If the Lord made you strong and powerful inwardly, your inward condition would match your outward condition. The outer man of some people cannot match their inner man. With you, it is the opposite; your inner man cannot match your outer man. You should pay attention to this first.</p><p>Second, you have to restrict yourself and be a little more weighty in your ordinary conversation with the brothers and sisters. Some terms and expressions should be avoided. I am afraid that in your ministry of the word, your own clever and flippant words sometimes slip out of your mouth. A clever word is never as effective as a weighty word. I am not saying that you have said anything wrong. I am saying that you have to pay attention to how you say things at ordinary times. You have to learn a lesson here: Your words are not weighty enough. Your speaking is too clever and flippant. You have to learn to speak weighty words. Your mind is quick, and this is not a good sign. In spiritual things the mind should never be ahead of the spirit.</p><p>Every time the Lord works in us, that is, every time He deals with us, we should reap rich results from such experiences. If our emotion and mind do not have any "leakage," we will surely reap rich results. Suppose a brother has a problem, and he weeps and cries about it. If a jovial person comes along making jokes and laughing, these jokes will nullify the tears and the weeping of the brother. The sorrow and pain will become less cutting. The same principle applies in spiritual matters. A clever thought or a flippant word will cancel out the desired effect a dealing should produce in a man. Sometimes a spiritual subject should carry a heavy weight, but a flippant word nullifies it. One cannot joke about spiritual things. God's work in man can be weighty or flippant, depending on what we make of it. We have to reject everything that tends to reduce spiritual weight. When God deals with us in a weighty way, there should be a weighty result. If the result is not weighty, there must be a leak. If a water bucket receives a great quantity of water yet is never full, there must be a leak. God has dealt severely with you with regards to your marriage. Yet when you speak about it, it does not sound as if you have received any deep cut from the dealing. This is because the result has leaked away. Bearing the cross does not mean that we are nonchalant about things. It means that we accept these things for the Lord's sake. Our brother has to ask the Lord to restrict his thoughts, and he has to guard against diluting spiritual things. His inward being has to be strong, and his mind has to be under his control. If he can do this, his spirit will be strong, and he will become more useful in the ministry of God's word.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(49)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 30, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER S. C.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. In 1937 I saw that I was a sinner and believed in the Lord Jesus. At that time I was very zealous, but later I became cold and backslidden. At a certain point I repented in tears, yet I dared not turn back to the Lord. The brothers exhorted me to go back to the meetings, but I dared not go. While I was praying one day, I cried, "Lord, be merciful." I felt like a prodigal son returning. I began to read the Bible and to pray again. When I came to John 18, I felt like I was Judas, the Lord's betrayer. I loved money and the world. I could not help weeping and repenting. Later one of my sons became ill, and I prayed much. The Lord did not answer my prayer, and he died. I began to wonder why God treated me in this way. After that I began to love my wife and children more than the Lord. I am not worthy to be called the Lord's disciple.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our brother has to learn to exercise his spirit. He has to judge people and things by his spirit. To judge means to discern. Some brothers and sisters first discern with their mind and then with their spirit. I am not saying that we should not use our mind. I am saying that we should first exercise our spirit and then explain things with our mind. If we only exercise our mind, we are just a psychologist. Our spirit should be very available. It should be like an ink pad; others' words should easily leave an impression in us. I like what Brother Yu wrote in the first issue of The Present Testimony. He said that the spirit is not the organ for understanding. When our spirit is calm and available, we will have a clear impression of others' testimonies, and their spirit will make its mark on our spirit. We will be able to sense others' peculiarities. We have to learn to free our spirit from all distractions. This will enable us to know others' spiritual condition. A worker must learn this lesson sooner or later. We are not like the doctors, who use instruments to diagnose their patients. We have our spirit which examines the true condition of every person.</p><p>If we continue to exercise our spirit, our whole being will be held solemnly in check like a thousand horses held silently by reins; it will wait earnestly for a command. When a man comes to us, we will have a strong spirit to discern him. A worker must serve others by exercising his discerning organ&mdash;the spirit. We must be able to exercise our spirit as freely as we exercise our emotion, mind, and will. Brother Yu said that the spirit is not the organ for understanding. The organ for understanding is the mind. This is a unique statement. We should not try to guess what others are doing by our mind. Rather, we should try to get an impression of others with our spirit. A subjective person cannot exercise his spirit, nor can a confused person. The spirit is the organ which receives impressions. After we receive an impression, we interpret it immediately with the mind. This interpretation is like developing an image on photographic film with chemicals. We must stop all noise around us before our ears can pick up singing at a distance. We should exercise our spirit like a man who concentrates himself to pick up sounds from far away. Once there is a little interruption, the ear will not hear clearly. We have to listen with our spirit and receive impressions with our spirit. This is the reason our outer man must be broken and torn down. This is the only way for the inner spirit to remain calm. This is our way. First we exercise our spirit. Then we exercise our mind.</p><p>Our brother's pathway has been relatively straight, and we have much hope for him. But he needs to go through deeper lessons and experience deeper dealings. He needs to receive a severe breaking that comes with the discipline of the Holy Spirit before he can launch into the deep in spiritual matters and before the living water will flow. The Lord will tear you down in a deeper way and follow up with a deeper breaking work in you, in addition to all the fragmentary breakings that He has done. The goal of this breaking is to straighten your pathway. Some people receive a series of dealings from the Lord, but there is a big question as to whether or not these dealings are deep enough.</p><p>As for the time that you were backslidden, perhaps the Lord was dealing with you to turn you from trusting in yourself. There is profit to not sinning, and there is profit even to sinning. Sometimes God breaks down our self-confidence through our failures. When we fail, not only should we stand up again, but also we should learn some lessons through our fall. In the future we will experience more discipline of the Holy Spirit. At any rate, we have to dig the ditch deep before water will flow in. The Lord allows many failures to happen to us for the purpose of breaking our self. There are blessings for falling, and there are blessings for not falling. We should not only learn to stand up when we fall, but also we should learn the proper lessons in the midst of our falling. Romans 8 says that all things work together for good to those who love God. This means that even when we fall, the Holy Spirit can turn it into our good. We have to learn deeper lessons through our falls. We should learn not only to refrain from sin the next time but also to give up our self-confidence and self-righteousness. What we need is not just to learn how to stand after we fall, but also to learn how to fall through our falling. We must daily experience the breaking and tearing down by God before we can experience the building. God has to tear down our self-justification, self-arrogance, and self-trust. All these things will be torn down through our falling. Jeremiah 1:10 says, "To pluck up and to break down,/To destroy and to tear down,/To build up and to plant." May the Lord remove our self-confidence. May He break us day by day so that we can be built up.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(50)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 31, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER G. C.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. At the age of thirteen I accepted the Lord. When I asked to be baptized, I was told by the brothers that I was too young and that I should wait until I was older. Later my father apprenticed me to a shop, and I worked there for three years. Once, I was in a certain place, and I observed that only the rich were allowed to be baptized, and I became very angry. Later, a brother baptized me. At the time I was baptized, I was hoping that heaven would open to me and that a voice from heaven would witness that I am a son of God.</p><p>I confess that I am wicked and selfish like Jacob. A brother told me that we have to leave the superficial things and seek after the deeper things. I thought I was very zealous, but there was no depth to my condition. Later I realized that I had not learned that many lessons and that I was actually quite superficial. At the age of twenty-one I prayed to the Lord and asked for a good sister. The Lord heard my prayer. At that time the brothers and sisters meeting with me asked me to give messages. I was afraid to speak. I feared that some of the things I said would be beyond my own power to carry out. But the responsibility of the Lord's Day morning message was on my shoulder, and I had to speak. The business affairs in the church became more complicated, and I found no one to coordinate with. There were many opinions. Even I had many plans. It seemed I was taking the way of the recovery, yet I found that I could not make it. I was monopolizing the work of the church, and I felt that the responsibility was too heavy for me. Later I heard that there was a young peoples' meeting in Shanghai. At that time I was twenty-four years old, and I wanted to join it. Later there was a conference in Foochow, Fukien, and I was able to attend. When I heard that we have to exercise our spirit, I wished so much that I could be broken. Then I heard that we have to fall down before God, and I became quite discouraged. Afterwards, it seems that I received a revelation. I know that it is the Lord who is doing everything and that I cannot do anything.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>In order to know this brother, we have to consider him in relation to his age. The measure of a person's spirituality can only be expected to be commensurate with his age. Spiritual condition has much to do with age. If there are strong peculiarities in us, we need strong breaking. For example, some people are particularly strong in their emotion. Others are particularly strong in their mind or their will. These are not problems related to age, and they require the Lord's particular breaking, without which there can be no building. For example, a cancerous tumor in man has nothing to do with his weakness. It grows because his body is strong. It is a kind of cell that grows independently without restriction. The whole body resists other diseases, but the whole body feeds this disease. It takes up all the nutrition in the body. The same is true in the spiritual realm. Christians who are strong in certain areas require all kinds of supply to support these areas. These strong areas are actually cancerous cells. Anything you put into them will be used to feed such cells. Therefore, God has to destroy them.</p><p>We do not detect in our brother anything that is inordinately strong. He is a clever man, and his thoughts are clear and logical. Perhaps these elements are somewhat too active in him, but we cannot say that these are his strong spots. They are not his problem. He is only in his twenties, and the Lord has given him only so much. At the present time, we cannot expect him to see too much. Young ones have to realize that older ones are more experienced in many areas. At least the Holy Spirit has been in the older ones longer than in them. Within the constraints of your age, you should take in as much as you can. It is good for our spiritual pursuit to be compatible with our age. In spiritual things, it does not mean that one gets more by seeing more. Spirituality has much to do with time. As much as you can, you should try to understand the things you have heard here. Whatever you do not understand, you should wrap up and store away in your closet. At a certain point they may become useful to you. You have to ask the Lord to show you when they will become useful to you. Now you know that it is not that easy and simple to be a Christian and to work for the Lord.</p><p>This time on the mountain, I have shown you a little of the "scene behind the veil." Now you can ask the Lord to bring you into deeper depths. The thing that worries me the most is when young people or young co-workers think that they have reached the peak. You still have a long way to go. If you can cover this journey in twenty, thirty, or forty years, it would be exceptional grace from God. Moses saw the land of Canaan on Mount Pisgah, but he was not able to enter. The knowledge, doctrines, and teachings that one receives in his mind, but which have never been wrought into his being, are easily erased. They are like letters written with a pen of reed; as soon as trials come, they are gone. Such a person has not actually possessed these things. The Lord has to burn them into you before they are unerasable. When pottery is burned in a kiln, a picture that is drawn on it will not easily be removed.</p><p>Our brother has an advantage of still being young. He has a straight course ahead of him. If he continues to learn and gain experience in the next twenty years, he will become very rich. Today he is only twenty-four years old. We cannot ask too much of him. If he were forty-four years old, my word to him would be much stronger. Our brother must fall down totally at least once. You do not have to be concerned as to how you will fall. You have to ask the Lord to show you what He showed Moses on Mount Pisgah. Sister M. E. Barber once said that whoever places himself in the Lord's hand will be broken. You have to pray that the Lord will deal with you without reservation, and you have to place yourself in His hand without reservation. Consecration is not a light matter. The Lord will break us according to our prayer. If you want to be a whole piece of bread, you should not offer yourself to Him. Once you offer yourself to Him, you should not murmur and complain when you are broken. Only those who are broken bring blessing to others, because they have changed; they have become rich, and they are now able to nourish many.</p><p>Peter tells us not to consider it strange when fiery ordeals come to us. Those who consider it strange are short of light. There is nothing unusual in the Lord breaking us when we place ourselves in His hand. This should be expected. During these few months on the mountain, you have to see that the discipline of the Holy Spirit is a lifelong spiritual pathway. This is the only pathway to take. We all must go through great trials. None of us can avoid this. The clay has to be burned in the furnace. It is useless to merely paint something on its surface. Every person whom God has greatly used has passed through fire. There is no ground for boasting in the spiritual pathway. You still have a long way to go. Whether or not you will be a rich person depends on how much experience you pass through. The more experience you pass through, the more you will learn and the more supply you will have. This is like a doctor who gains experience through seeing a multitude of patients. He would be ineffective and inefficient if he only saw one patient a year. The same can be said of the Christian pathway. We have to go through much experience before we become rich and before we have something to minister to others.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(51)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 2, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER B. H.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. When I was young I went with an elderly brother to a church to listen to sermons. The more I listened, the more I became interested. Eventually, I believed in the Lord. I did not know that much about the gospel, yet I knew that something came into me that would never go away. In 1934 I came to the local church and sensed an atmosphere that was full of joy and mutual love. I thought that if this is how it was on earth, it would be even greater when we are in heaven. I attended a meeting by Brother Witness Lee and learned more about my salvation. I began to have a turn. I loved to read books published by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room, and I built up for myself a firm foundation in the truth this way. Later, I began to doubt my own work. I could not see any worth to my work, and it became a burden to me. Although I spent much time searching through the Bible and reference books, it was hard for me to find material for my Sunday morning sermon. I felt dry. When I saw that others had the utterance but I did not, I felt that God had abandoned me. Based on these experiences, it is God's mercy that I could attend this training.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>From your speaking I can tell that you are a clever, logical, and articulate person. However, you have to realize that in the spiritual pathway, we do not receive a word for the sake of meeting the need of the audience, but for meeting our own need. A man can receive general help from God, or he can receive specific help from Him. A doctor can prescribe medicine to you that will add to your nutrition and energy. This is ordinary help. However, if you have a tumor on your finger, you need a specific cure. This is something special. From your testimony I can see that you have received some general help, but little specific help. A man can have a great deal of spiritual appreciation, but little spiritual reality. If he only appreciates, he has probably only touched something in his understanding. You must be enlightened by God to deal with specific issues. If God's light is strong enough, it will kill your problems. Only after your problems have been identified in a specific way, will you find a specific treatment. In Romans 7 Paul did not refer to all ten commandments. Rather, he pointed to the tenth commandment only, the commandment against covetousness, and he dealt with it specifically. Jacob's naughtiness and Peter's boldness were their specific problems. Superficially you do not seem to have any problem before God. In the spiritual pathway, however, we have to ask the Lord to show us our specific problems, and we have to deal with them. Everyone has a peculiar problem, and it is not enough for a person to just continue in his appreciation while never allowing his problems to be touched. Once God works on us and exposes our basic problem, we will be open to His dealings. These dealings will bring in deliverance. Many have said that they appreciate this and that by coming to Kuling. But none of that will do us any good if our particular problem is not identified and dealt with.</p><p>Suppose a man is a robber. We can say that he is a sinner. Suppose another person is a liar. We can say that he is a sinner as well. But these descriptions are too general. If a man is a robber, we should say that he is a robber. If a man is a liar, we should say that he is a liar. This points out what kind of person he is in a specific way; it does not just describe him as a sinner in a general way. I have to name specific sins before I can deal with them in a specific way. While your mind is not very strong, it is still quite strong. You are not that earnest in your seeking. There is more of an element of appreciation in you. Once your need becomes more apparent, you will need specific dealings. General dealings are like window-shopping; your stomach is still hungry after such a trip. You still have to go and find food. Since you feel dry, you should prostrate yourself. Once you realize that you are incapable, you should set your eyes on the Lord. You should not stop at the point of merely appreciating spiritual things with your mind. You cannot fill your hunger by drawing bread on a piece of paper; you still have to eat real bread. Man will gain something only when God's word is formed in him. If you do not have specific problems to deal with, you will not have specific supplies. No matter how beautiful a painter paints an apple, it will never prompt you to eat it. It is wrong to come to the mountain just to appreciate what you hear. If this is the case, you are only a spectator; you are a third party. We need a strong desire to find God's light. Once we have such light, we will be delivered from our problems; we will be brought into His grace, and everything will be fine. Once you experience specific dealings, your pathway will become straight, and the Lord will use you.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(52)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 3, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER O. J.</h2><p>I heard the story of Christ and His cross and was moved to believe in the Lord. When I attended a revival meeting in Canton, I experienced a great change and saw the importance of saving souls. I quit my job as a teacher and accepted the invitation of a denomination to be their woman preacher. At one point I felt uneasy in the denomination where I was, and I left. In April of this year, two brothers introduced me to Brother Nee and allowed me to come to the training. The training makes me realize that the standard is very high. I am afraid that I will not be able to meet the standard, and I am somewhat discouraged. Yet I do not want to return empty-handed. Once, I heard the story of Absalom and was touched to commit myself to the Lord. I subsequently was revived in soul and body. My locality does not have any co-worker or local church. May the Lord send someone there to build up the church.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our sister has one merit: She is more disciplined in her character than most young people. A young person can boast of knowledge and gift, but he cannot boast of the character that is formed in him. After we live with a person for a long time, we spontaneously pick up the idiomatic expressions and gestures of that person. Similarly, if a man yields to the Lord, he will be conformed to the Lord in godliness. He will be like Him in character, and he will be built up in his disposition. A young person cannot match an older one in character. Many young people are raw, hard, bitter, and caustic in their disposition. I hope that the shining of God's great light will yield greater results, not merely general results in your character. Suppose a man waits for heavy rainfall to come yet only has a small cup or spoon to contain it. Would that not be a joke? The same can be said of spiritual things. When God wants to give to man, man should open his mouth wide. He should stretch his capacity for God's dispensing. As the Holy Spirit works, every vessel should be full. We should ask God to increase our capacity so that we can be fed and our thirst fully quenched. When God grants us grace, we experience wonderful days. But unless God grants us grace, it is not easy for us to receive anything. Therefore, when God gives, we should increase our capacity to receive. He will fill us. We should be like the woman in 2 Kings 4, who went out to borrow more empty vessels. All the vessels she borrowed were filled. When she stopped borrowing, God stopped filling. Only then did God's oil cease. We can tell the Lord, "Give me what I need today, and even give me what I do not need today. Give me what I can take today, and even give me what I cannot take today. Give me what I can understand today, and even give me what I cannot understand today. Give me everything." This is the principle of borrowing vessels. God will fill us beyond our own measure. The Lord's word will create the need and satisfy us. His word is full of light and will produce an earnest desire in man. Chinese produce goods only when there is a demand for them. But Americans produce goods first and then create a market by demonstrating their usefulness. We should not pray according to man's need, but according to God's riches. We should ask for things that we do not know. This is the meaning of increasing our capacity.</p><p>In working for the Lord, a worker has to learn to diagnose man's condition with his spirit. Some people only need to speak five minutes, and we know whether or not they are even a Christian. Once we have the experience of salvation, we know how to discern the genuineness of salvation in others. It is useless for a doctor merely to prescribe medicine to others. He must know a patient's sickness and find the cause of this sickness before he can write the prescription. You have to start learning while you are in the training here on the mountain. After you leave the mountain, you have to exercise your observation, pray and consider before the Lord, and listen more to God's speaking in you. If you do this, you will have a good knowledge and a firm understanding of men in another ten years. But unless you practice this, you will not be able to know men even after ten years. The knowledge of men does not come as an accident. Some people know men by exercising their natural discernment. This is not how we know men. If we try to know men by exercising our natural discernment, we will suffer great loss. We have no intention of minding other people's business or of criticizing them. For the sake of helping them, however, we have to learn to know them. We are not here to gossip. A doctor does not seek to know a sickness for the purpose of talking about it. He speaks of it for the purpose of curing it. The work of a doctor is to discern, not to criticize, to heal, not to nitpick. May the Lord help us to learn our lessons first. Then we will know men and be able to help solve their problems.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(53)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 4, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER K. K.</h2><p>I was greatly touched in 1928 when Brother Nee spoke on the story of Mary the Magdalene. I became clear concerning my salvation in 1932 when I heard Dr. John Sung speak on the Samaritan woman. For years I worked as a teacher but was weak and fraught with sickness. In 1935 I joined the Jin-Ning Bible College. I thought that the college was the highest Bible institution on earth. Later I had neuritis and became very sick. In my sickness I saw the transiency and vanity of human life. As a result, I was baptized in 1937. From that point forward my spiritual pathway had a turn. Later I read Rethinking the Work (The Normal Christian Church Life), and I saw the need to be clear about my calling. I was afraid that I was only a volunteer, so I decided to take up a teaching job instead. While on the mountain this time, I have seen the matter of authority as well as my need to submit to authority and to be under the discipline of the Holy Spirit. I am willing to commit myself to the Lord. If the Lord will grant me mercy, He will bring me through all my problems. Otherwise, even my pursuit of spirituality and my love for Him will amount to nothing.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our sister speaks quickly and softly. Being quick in speaking means that one's mind runs fast. It also means that too many thoughts are running through the mind. The mind is not calm, and the emotions are too strong. Our sister's obedience is based mostly on doctrines. Her mind is linked most readily to matters of doctrine because it is fast. But her spirit is not strong enough, and there is not enough discipline of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>There are two kinds of obedience. First, there is obedience to the truth, and second, there is obedience to the Lord Himself. Although you spoke of the discipline of the Holy Spirit, you did not emphasize it. I advise you to pay more attention to this subject. Your mind is strong, and your understanding of the truth is strong. You also have a desire to obey the Lord, but your spirit does not match these attributes. Your spirit is not strong enough; it does not match your mind and emotions. Do not allow your mind and emotions to become too strong. Learn to make your spirit strong instead.</p><p>How can the spirit be strong? In order for the spirit to be strong, a man must have wounds. He must experience a breaking and a tearing down. Some experience some dealings, but there is no wound in them, and they do not have a feeling of hurt. Such ones cannot have a strong spirit.</p><p>There are two ways to know the Lord: in the mind and emotion or in the spirit. It is not enough just to know Him in the mind and emotion; one has to know Him in the spirit. If a man wants to serve the Lord properly, he has to know the Lord in the spirit. A man can direct his love for men toward loving the Lord, but it is not enough to love the Lord with an emotional love. He must touch something in his spirit; he must know the Lord according to the spirit. Hence, three things are needed: a strong mind, the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and knowing the Lord in the spirit.</p><p>In order to know men, we first must be rich in our own experience. When a brother has a problem, simply saying a few simple words to him will not work. First, we have to see the problem more clearly than he sees it. Next, we should render a helping hand. If he accepts it, we can lead him to the straight way. There are definite ways to know men. First, we have to be calm in ourselves. We must know the way ourselves before we can lead others to the way. We must be judged ourselves before we can judge others. I can deal with a person because what is happening to him was judged in me some years ago. A psychologist judges men only according to their words. However, we first must go through the inward dealings ourselves. After we have passed through these dealings, we will be sensitive to the same things when they surface in others. We may not be able to describe them, but inwardly we will be clear. Our judgment of others is based on our own condition.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(54)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 6, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER L. D.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. My father was a deacon in a denomination. My mother often told me Bible stories. I was nurtured in a good way in my family. By nature I am a timid person, and from my youth I was afraid of hell. When I was twelve, my father passed away. I fainted, and my mother comforted me. When I grew up, I went into business and lost money many times. I was mocked and criticized by my colleagues. I had insomnia for a few months and tried to kill myself a few times. My love for my family stopped me from taking my own life. My cousin introduced me to Brother Nee's magazine The Christian. I received much help from it and was actually saved through it. After I was saved, I came to know more about the truth and had the assurance of salvation. I know that no one loves me in this world like the Lord does. His love constrains me, and I have consecrated myself to Him. I began to have a burden for the gospel.</p><p>In 1941 I was a teacher in a commercial school. The principal of the school considered me quite highly. After working there for five years, I was given the highest position in the school. I also received spiritual profit through my spiritual pursuit during this period. I became proud on account of my few good works. For years I had been learning to serve in the church, but I was dry spiritually. I was up and down all the time, living a vacillating life. When I saw others loving the Lord and found myself not being able to do the same, I felt condemned. One day a brother fellowshipped with me, and I was revived. For a year I rose up every morning before daybreak to read the Bible and to pray. I experienced victory during this time. However, this fed my pride once again. The Lord allowed me to fail again. This time the fall was too great; I no longer could stand up. In 1945 a brother visited me, and I was revived once again. In the winter of 1947 I returned to Swatow and received some help. I had the strong intention then of dropping everything to serve the Lord. God showed me something through a dream. I saw all of my relatives coming to my funeral, and I was on my way to my grave. I told them, "Either you separate yourselves from me, or you will have to take the same way I have taken."</p><p>At the end of March 1948, I received a letter from Brother Witness inviting me to come to stay for a short time in Shanghai and to attend the national co-workers' fellowship. Brother Nee also agreed to let me come. I arrived in Shanghai, and the brothers arranged for me to be a learner in the service through taking a secular job. I was not happy about this. In my fellowship with Brother Witness Lee, I was told that I was unfit, and I knew that I was unfit. Later I left to join my uncle in Nanking, but I was still troubled. Now Brother Nee has agreed to let me come to the mountain to be trained. However, I was told that I should not consider myself part of the work. I feel bad about this. I am confused, and I am not able to touch God. I know that I am wrong in many things. I do not know how to pray. I feel that I am lazy, yet I cannot quite fall down. I am facing a crossroads. I do not know what I should do. Although I have experienced many dealings from the Lord, I have not learned many spiritual lessons. I am a very emotional person. I love the brothers and sisters very much, but now even my emotion has no taste for anything. As my emotion cools down, my love for the Lord cools down as well. However, I must say that this love for the Lord is still within me.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Indeed, our brother's problem is his emotion. He is bound by his emotion. Anyone who is bound by his emotion will feel happy when his emotion is up. Our brother is bound by his emotion, yet he is suffering. He said that he was deeply affected by his environment when he was young. I would like our brother to see that the world does not have the time to ridicule you constantly. It does not sit idly by and pick on you constantly. It is your thought that tells you others are paying too much attention to you. In reality, no one may have paid that much attention to you. We often are too self-centered. In actuality no one has the time to try to purposely despise you. Others may have ignored you, but they may not have been despising, disdaining, or mocking you. The truth is that others do not have that much time and energy to pay attention to you. You may have certain feelings about how others treat you. But others may not be paying attention to you at all. You think too highly of yourself. You are too self-centered. You are so concerned about the attention of others that a martyr's complex has developed in you. Many people have a martyr's complex, and it is wrong. In following the Lord, we can never be bound by our emotion. We have to be decisive about many things. We cannot be concerned about so many things and be bound by them. If we are bound by many small matters, our time will be wasted on these things. We will not be strong, and our way will not be straight. Those who are constantly on the defensive about themselves cannot run the race properly.</p><p>When you were in Shanghai, I fellowshipped with Brother Witness Lee about your desire to serve full-time. We were concerned that you do not know what it means to serve the Lord. You do not know how high the sky above you is or how thick the earth below you is. This is the reason you should wait for a while and learn your lesson through taking a secular job in Shanghai. This would work out to your benefit. Later I allowed you to come to the mountain because I did not want you suffer too much shock and thus be stumbled. I granted your request to come because we wanted you to receive the help. But I did not grant your request to serve the Lord full-time. Man does not enter God's work lightly. However, if a man is not given the chance to work, how can he serve the Lord? I feel that our brother will eventually end up serving the Lord. A believer serves because there is a serving life within him. No matter what his pathway turns out to be, he will always end up serving the Lord.</p><p>Every Christian has a certain sustaining power which carries him through his present life. For example, a person who loves his mother derives much of his meaning of existence from his mother. The strength behind his life is his beloved mother. If one day his mother no longer loves him or if she dies, he will lose all interest in life. The driving force behind some people is money; it is their sole interest in life. When they have much money, they find interest in everything they do. When they lose their money, they lose interest in the human life. Money is the driving force behind their life. Every person has something to interest and attract him in his human life. He has to maintain this motivating force and the power of attraction because it is the meaning and essence of his human life. Some consider their intellectual activity to be the essence of their human life. The driving force behind Brother Sun is his emotion. If he cannot get what he wants, he shrivels away. He likes to work. As long as he can work, he will live. His work is based on his love of work. If this love is taken away from him, his emotion is taken away, and he no longer will be able to live the Christian life.</p><p>A Christian should have the Holy Spirit as the driving force behind his life. Emotions can shrivel away, but we still have to live the Christian life. It is wrong for our brother to be driven by his interest in his work. We cannot live by our emotion. It is wrong even to borrow the appeal of the emotion for spiritual things. In our service to the Lord we must not be influenced by the old man. The driving force behind our life must come from the interest we derive from the Holy Spirit. Your self-centeredness has to be destroyed. The power of your emotion has to be abandoned. You have to reject your emotion. You have no more time to take care of your emotion. You have to dismantle everything that is related to your emotion. Whether you feel happy or unhappy, poor or rich, you should ignore your feelings. As a Christian you have to act decisively. Nothing should be a problem to you. A believer must learn to ignore his feelings as well as his anxiety for a lack of feelings.</p><p>You said that you have been confused and stunned after coming to Kuling. Actually, you are not confused and stunned enough. If you could be genuinely confused and stunned during this period of time on the mountain, it would be wonderful indeed. You will be blessed if you become completely ignorant of everything. You will be blessed if you become too weak to stand up any longer. There is a difference between jumping down and falling down. When a person jumps down, he is conscious of what he is doing; it is a conscious choice. But when a person falls down, he does it unconsciously; he has no choice. When your fall becomes genuine, you will commit everything fully into God's hand. You will say to the Lord, "I commit everything to Your hand. I do not know what to do anymore." Then the Lord will begin His work on you. The Lord does not tear down for the sake of tearing down; He tears down for the sake of building up. All the tearing down of the Lord is for the purpose of resurrection. The Lord does not want you merely to die, but to pass from death to life. A person who has genuinely fallen does not need to know about his fall. All you have to do is tell the Lord that you cannot make it, and the Lord will do the rest.</p><p>Our brother has to be more natural in his speaking. There are many reasons for speaking in an unnatural way, such as fear, concerns, pretensions, unfamiliarity, etc. When you are unnatural, the spirit is choked. Therefore, we have to reject all fear, concerns, and pretensions.</p><p>The spiritual pathway is a long one, and spiritual responsibility is a heavy one. We cannot retreat, and we cannot lurch ahead. We can only look to the Lord for His leading and grace that we would learn our lessons. Many young people think that the Lord's work is easy and simple. Such ones are in darkness. The Lord will only use those who wait in fear and trembling. The more a person considers the work to be a simple task, the less he will be used by God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(55)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 7, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER S. S.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. Through my sister's death, God turned me to believe in Him. At that time I was not clear about salvation, but I felt that I was different inside. Every time I confessed my sins to the Lord, my heart was filled with joy and peace. After I believed in the Lord, I began to study the Bible and was interested in attending the meetings. In 1928 I worked at the China Inland Mission. Later I did not have the peace to stay there, and in 1937 I quit. The pastor in the C.I.M. Church rebuked me, saying, "You want to follow Watchman Nee. Is not our Hudson Taylor just as good?" That pastor had loved me very much, but after I resigned, he treated me like an enemy. In 1941 the meetings in various places in Chekiang were going on well, and the Lord heard many of our prayers. Later the condition of the church turned for the worse, and I began to bear more responsibility. I wanted to resign and ask God to raise up others. I could not drop the work, yet I could not advance in any way either. It was a painful experience. I found that there was a training in Kuling, but I was not a co-worker. Later one brother recommended me; he knew that my spiritual condition needed this training, and I was granted permission by Brother Nee to come. In looking back at my work, I find that I have come short of the Lord in many things. I have repented in tears, and the Lord has granted me mercy. Now I am rejoicing. I do not know what the way ahead of me is. May the Lord speak to me through our brother.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our brother needs to learn more lessons in the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Other than this one need, he has no great problems. His pathway is straight, and his spirit is pure. But he is short of some basic dealings. It is right for you to feel that the responsibilities in the church are too great. I would like to point out that your measure of service is determined by the amount of training you have received in the spiritual pathway. All the things you spoke of, including the services you have taken up in the church and your obedience to the truth, are all commendable. But you have to learn some personal lessons as well. A worker must learn obedience not only to the truth in the church or in the work; he must also learn to submit to the discipline of the Holy Spirit in the environment. The Spirit's discipline is God's building work, which He carries out through a man's personal environment. We should be like Paul, who learned his lessons through his many afflictions and who was able to comfort those who were in every affliction (2 Cor. 1:4). Some learn their lessons through biblical truth. Others learn them through the environment that the Spirit orders for them. A man who has totally committed himself to God will find Him to be unrelenting; he will find God operating on him through the permitted environment. I have said many times that it is a pity so many people have not learned their lessons through God's arranged environment.</p><p>We have to hand ourselves over to the Holy Spirit and yield to His arrangements in our environment. We should learn what we need to learn and not waste time. Whether or not you are rich depends on the kind of lessons you have learned in your ordinary daily life. The more you learn, the richer you will be in the church service. If you are not that rich, you will only be able to lead others according to the biblical truth. Some are able to guide and help others with the things that they have learned from the Lord through the Spirit's discipline. A person who has experienced much discipline from the Spirit should be richer than others. But I know of many brothers and sisters who have not learned much, even though they have experienced much discipline of the Spirit. I know of one sister in Shanghai who was stumbled every time she was disciplined by the Spirit. Such ones are like broken vessels littered in a pottery factory; no new vessel is produced. This is a pity. When the discipline of the Spirit is shallow, the earthen vessel of these ones remains intact. But as soon as the discipline of the Spirit becomes stronger, their earthen vessel breaks. May the Lord lead you to beseech Him every day to learn something through the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>We have to differentiate between the way of guidance according to the teaching of truth and the way of guidance according to the discipline of the Spirit. Some have not obeyed the truth, yet they have obeyed the discipline of the Spirit. Others have not obeyed the discipline of the Spirit, yet they have obeyed the truth. There is the need for a balance between these two kinds of obedience. One cannot neglect either kind. When a worker applies himself to his work, he has to know whether or not the brothers and sisters are balanced in these two aspects in their daily walk. I am saying this to those children of God who have learned some lessons in the spiritual pathway. When a man comes to us, we should know whether or not he is balanced in these two kinds of obedience. Many brothers and sisters have learned good lessons in the discipline of the Holy Spirit, but they are short in their obedience to the truth. We cannot be short in either aspect. We must have the proper balance so that God's pathway will be straight before us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(56)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 9, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER K. B.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. In my youth I always pondered the meaning of the human life. I searched through Chinese traditions and ethical teachings, but I did not find any answer or profit. Later I turned to the pursuit of temporal recognition and wealth for myself. I decided to join the army. Twice I had close encounters with bombs. I began to realize the vanity of this world. One day in 1937 a friend of mine invited me to a gospel meeting. I had been a mocker up to that point, and I had criticized pastors for not practicing what they preached. I went along with my friend and attended the meeting, but I did not try to listen to the message. Instead, I was checking out the stories and snooping around. The second day I went, I was moved by the sincerity of the preacher. The third night I went again, and the Lord worked on me. I saw my own evil, and I saw that the Lord Jesus had died on the cross for me, a sinner. I believed in Him and accepted Him as my personal Savior. I recalled the two incidents in the army when I was bombed. If I had died then, I would not have been able to sit here today. Thank the Lord that I am still alive and that I can still believe in Him. After I accepted the Lord, I began to testify for Him. Eventually, my father also accepted the Lord. The most painful thing was seeing my mother pass away without having a chance to accept the Lord.</p><p>I was a traditional Chinese doctor. After I became a Christian, I still desired to build up a career. I became successful, but this success turned me away from spiritual things. At one point in my life, I became very bothered. The Lord began to deal with my business. I obeyed the Lord and prostrated myself before Him in confession. Outwardly, it was a bitter experience, but inwardly, it was a time of joy. I recovered my intimate fellowship with the Lord. From that time on, everything else became a secondary profession; my primary profession was to serve the Lord. I began to serve Him earnestly in the church. At first my messages were mostly borrowed from reference books. I sought for the Lord's light but did not receive anything. This bothered me very much. Later I decided it was simpler to invite evangelists to come and conduct meetings. Yet inwardly I felt that something was wrong. This was like giving people a stimulant; it only revived them for a little while.</p><p>In January 1948 I received an invitation from a brother to attend a meeting by Brother Witness Lee. I first thought it was just another revival meeting. However, after listening to the message, I realized that I had heard something that I had never heard before. I became very hungry within. Later I learned that Brother Nee was giving conferences and talking about the truth of handing oneself over. At the beginning I had reservations, but later I realized that it was only right for me to break my alabaster flask. I am willing to commit my ways to the Lord from now on. I am a quick person, both at heart and in my speaking. I like to criticize and judge others. Now I truly realize that this is wrong.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Concerning our brother I would like to point out one thing in particular. There are two ways to live the Christian life. We can say that there are two types of Christians. First, there are those who try to control their outward conduct. Some are very successful in doing this. They learn to bridle their outward conduct by their will. Through their own cultivation, they are able to act calmly, humbly, and politely. Second, there are those who have learned inward control through the discipline of the Holy Spirit. This control also restricts a person, but not by means of the will like the first kind. In the first case, a person observes others speaking with a certain tone of voice or acting quickly, slowly, or calmly, and he tries to imitate this in an outward way. This outward imitation is not the outflow of inward activity. A person may think that he is holy. Actually, he is only acting in an outward way. He may say that he has a certain degree of humility, but even he himself does not know his real self. He cannot put his finger on the things he has acquired through imitation. At the most he has borrowed others' conduct to change his own acts. Other than this, he knows nothing. This is a very dangerous course for one to take in the spiritual pathway. These ones are like crows with many white feathers glued to them; even they themselves do not know what kind of bird they are. God's children should live their Christian life before God; they should not simply borrow a set of behaviors from others. Instead, they should learn the proper, inward lessons themselves. Only these ones will have the proper growth. Those who will not give up their outward restrictions and outward godliness will not advance; they will not grow in the Lord.</p><p>When I was in London, I asked Brother Austin-Sparks concerning a certain missionary. He told me that God only needs to destroy the part that is natural in a natural man. But if a natural man has acquired things in addition to his natural self, God first has to destroy the imitations which he has picked up. Many people have acquired many things that belong to others. They are actually adding materials to themselves that need to be broken down. In order to break down the natural man of these ones, God must first break down the foreign elements that have been added to them. This adds to the breaking process, and it is foolishness.</p><p>During the past two thousand years, everyone whom God used was unpretentious and spontaneous within and without. We have the treasure, but it is in the earthen vessel. The outward vessel always remains impure. There is no need to embellish or paint it. We do not treasure the outward earthen vessel; we treasure the inward reality. Many people only imitate the outward things; they have picked up nothing at all inwardly. Our treasure is within us. We can be unpretentious because we have the treasure within us. In order for us to be unpretentious Christians, we have to start from the inside. We should not draw others' attention to the outward elements. Instead, we should draw their attention to the inward reality.</p><p>Our brother is quick in thoughts and words, but this is not the kind of Christian God wants. Our brother should not just learn outward lessons. He should allow the Lord to do a breaking work in him. You have to experience inward afflictions. The outward innocence should not be given up, while the inward dealings should be deepened. Then you will be able to express His life. I am not saying that our brother's attitude and words have to change. I am saying that he needs the inward working of the Holy Spirit to change him from a "raw" state to a "cooked" state. Being "raw" means to be innocent but with no maturity. Our brother has to seek to turn from "rawness" to maturity. He has to touch God in an inward way, and then his rawness will go away. On the one hand, you have to preserve your innocence. On the other hand, you have to experience the work of the Holy Spirit so that you will not lose your balance. Once you are balanced in both aspects, your rawness will go away. God does not destroy our innocence; rather, He dispenses the discipline of the Holy Spirit to us, which results in a deeper destruction of our living. The inward operation of the Holy Spirit always produces wounds. We should have ample experience of the Holy Spirit and allow His discipline to be added to our innocence. Some people are still in the old creation; they need to be broken in many aspects. In Shanghai I once told a sister that if God had mercy on her, many of the things artificially "installed" in her would be dismantled. Brother, you must experience the building-up process of the Holy Spirit within you. In order for the self to be destroyed, all the foreign elements that have been added into you must be removed first. Much time is needed for the inner being to be strengthened. When your inward spiritual condition is strong enough, your outward innocence will be a complement to you and will render the Lord a way to go on. If your inward spiritual measure is too small, it will not match your outward innocence. If one has the discipline of the Holy Spirit, the release of the inward man will bear the outward innocence upon its wings. Unless you have such an experience, you will only give others the impression of your rawness. God only needs to deal with the natural elements in an innocent man; He only needs to constitute His life into such a man. When the spirit of such a man is released, he will not lose his innocence. This is a beautiful picture.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(57)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 10, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER L. Y.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. Because of my active personality, I did not want to be bound by the job of a shopkeeper. I had revolutionary thoughts, and I joined the Revolutionary Army at one time. In the army I saw an opium addict who experienced a great change when he believed in the Lord. He took me to a gospel meeting. I became acquainted with Christ through his influence and picked up an interest for the Bible, prayer, and spiritual books. Once I knelt down to pray and confessed my sins, and joy filled my heart. Later I attended the church and was baptized into the Lord's name. At my baptism, tears rolled down my cheeks. I was a very tough person, and it was hard for me to cry. Later I read Rethinking the Work and learned the truth concerning the church. Through reading The Orthodoxy of the Church, I also came to know the history of the church. Later I found out that there was a training on this mountain, and with Brother Nee's approval, I was able to come. It is the Lord's mercy that I am able to be here.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our brother has been running a very straight pathway, and his spirit is fairly strong. I hope that our brother will understand that there are two aspects to our service to the Lord: First, there is obedience to the truth, and second, there is obedience to the discipline of the Spirit. Our brother should learn more lessons in obedience to the discipline of the Spirit. He should learn to yield to the environment and allow God's breaking hand to operate on him. Some people have strong experiences of obedience to the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Others do not experience the same thing. A person with a meek disposition does not need strong discipline from the Spirit, but a person with a stubborn disposition needs strong discipline from the Spirit. With some it is not a matter of difficulty in the work of discipline but a matter of their unwillingness to accept the discipline. If a man refuses to learn the inward lessons, he will never be clear about the way of life.</p><p>On the one hand, God grants us the knowledge of Himself through His truth. On the other hand, He arranges the environment around us in such a way that we can become clear of His ways. When these two things combine together, we have a balanced experience. Some submit to the environment, but their obedience to God's commandment in His Word is not that clear. This is not enough. Some have learned some lessons concerning God's commandments in the Bible, but they lack the discipline in the environment. As a result, they also become a problem. Actually, we learn to submit to the outward environment for the sake of taking care of our inward needs. If a man only pays attention to his inward feelings, it is easy for him to become self-confident. When he makes a mistake and others exhort him, he may say, "Let me pray and see how I feel about it." Such a person will have a problem obeying the commandments. If an officer issues an order to his subordinate or if a master tells his servant to do something, it is totally wrong to respond, "Let me consider it a little." He should obey immediately. If I tell my cook to prepare some porridge, and he says he will consider it, his consideration will cost his job.</p><p>The same can be said of spiritual things. If you tell a person who has believed in his heart to be baptized, he should not say that he will consider it. The Bible clearly says, "Believe and be baptized." It does not give anyone the ground for consideration. Many people, however, have their own thoughts. Some are quick to obey the truth but short in obeying the inner lessons. Some have their own plans, preferences, and opinions, but when God deals with them, they drop these things. Others cannot drop them and cannot submit. In any case, God will lead you into His will. The truth will make your outward pathway straight, and the discipline of the Spirit will deepen and purify you, encouraging you to go on. The more we are on the way of the truth, the more we will experience the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Naturally, both aspects of God's work are for our edification. These two ways are one, and they work together to produce one kind of riches. In fact, the two ways eventually become one way. In other words, there will be no difference between the inward and the outward. When both lines have done their work, God will have a useful vessel in His hand.</p><p>Many have received supply from the truth and the discipline of the Spirit, enabling them to serve others. The discipline of the Holy Spirit begins the day you place yourself unreservedly in God's hand. Once you genuinely consecrate yourself to the Lord, He will begin arranging everything. He will not spare anything. Once you place yourself in the Lord's hand in a definite way, the discipline of the Spirit will come. He will not let you go. He will surround you, smite you, wall you in, and force you to take His way. It is a pity that many Christians have neglected the discipline of the Spirit. It is possible for a man to say that he has not received any supply from the church because he cannot find fellowship, or that he does not have the supply of the ministry because something is wrong with the ministry. But no one can say that he does not have or is short of the discipline of the Holy Spirit. It is possible for a brother or sister to be without the supply of the church or the ministry for five or ten years. However, it is impossible for him to be without the discipline of the Holy Spirit. This discipline is always present. God will never give up those who have committed themselves to Him; He will always discipline them.</p><p>We have to learn to take care of two principles with regards to the way of life. The first relates to one's ministry, and the second relates to the way one deals with others. Both aspects involve great principles. Some Christians have both, while others have none. Some have only one aspect, while others are strong in one and weak in the other. I hope that the church will have a straight pathway in the future. But this pathway greatly depends on us. People may be different, but that will not make much of a difference. The few dozen people here on the mountain can serve as a fairly representative group of all men. We can all learn to serve in the ministry, in the way of life, and in our dealing with other people.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(58)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 13, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER I. S.</h2><p>I was born into a poor family, and at one time I was a street hawker. While I was on the street one day someone invited me into a little chapel to hear the gospel. When I heard that Jesus loves sinners, I became very happy. Although the world does not love me, Jesus loves me. At that time I dared not accept the Lord. One or two years later, when I was fifteen years old, I heard the gospel again and I raised my hand to receive the Lord. After I became a Christian, my life was greatly changed. I was delivered from the sins of foul language, gambling, and stealing. I went with others to preach the gospel and served as a janitor of a church. Later through the recommendation of an elderly Baptist pastor, I joined the Far East Christian and Missionary Alliance Seminary. A year later I graduated and became a leader and a trumpet player in an evangelistic band. I became proud. Once, while preaching near an army school, I was taken into prison. I had been to prison before, but this was the first time I went into prison for the sake of the gospel. I was not afraid at all. The prison in the countryside, however, was a scandal; it was a taste of hell. I went into prison with my Bible. Others thought that I was a spy, but I continued to preach the gospel in prison. Soon over ten people were saved. When I was released from prison, the inmates were sad to see me go and shed tears for me. Soon after, I became a lieutenant officer. I was even promoted three times within a year. This stirred up my pride again, and I lapsed into sin. I knew that the Lord was disciplining me, and eventually I repented in tears and prayed for the Lord's mercy. Later I read books published by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room and began to understand the truth of salvation and the truth concerning the church. When the war broke out, I moved inland and took up a menial job. During those few years I learned many lessons. Later I became greedy and went into business. I fell into sin once again. This was the Lord's disciplining hand. I confessed to the Lord with tears for a few hours and asked Him for mercy.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>The first problem with our brother is that much of his outward life has been spent in falsehood. This is the fruit of his inward condition. No outward change or cover-up in conduct will do him any good. Your prayers have all been said before men, not before God. Our life before men can never replace our life before God. The only kind of spiritual life that counts is what is conducted in the presence of God. All spiritual things spring from within. Figs cannot be attached to a vine tree. Your problem is not over yet. Your speaking at the beginning of your testimony was very much under the control of your will. By the time you finished a third of your speaking, your real testimony finally came out. When a man first opens his mouth, he can somewhat control himself. But the more he speaks, the more his self is exposed. You are making a spiritual performance in the presence of men. I am not condemning you alone; many people are like you. They live their Christian life before men. We should never try to be better before men than before God. I would rather be misunderstood by men than have any pretense before God. I should be spiritual before God. But many people pray and live their lives before men. This is something that we should deal with at the present moment. We have to be a broken man before God. We should never worry about how we look before men. Our condition before God should always be stronger than our condition before men.</p><p>The meal offering in Leviticus 2 is a type of the fineness of Christ's humanity on earth. Every grain of wheat has to be finely ground before it can become flour. When Christ was on earth, His inward and outward being, His character and feelings, were like fine flour. The first problem with our brother is that he has, in a manner of speaking, been "plucked from the street." His second problem relates to his character. His emotion is not fine and tender; it is not like fine flour. His disposition is like that of Peter in the Gospels. All the apostles, including Peter, however, grew out of their coarse feelings. When we come to the book of Acts, we find that their feelings had all become tender. When we read Peter's Epistles, we find that his feelings were very tender. The rawness and coarseness went away after the kneading and the grinding. Whatever has not been ground remains coarse and uneven and cannot be part of the fine flour. Our brother will only become useful after he passes through God's fine grinding through the environment. If our brother truly sees himself, he will fall down. He said that he had wept and cried much in the past. But I have to say a seemingly cruel word to him according to the standing that I have been given here: Your tears are not enough. You have to shed many more tears than you have done. You have to pass through two pieces of grinding stones. I believe the Lord will be gracious and merciful to those who give themselves to the grindstones. We have to realize that only those who have fine feelings before God can serve Him.</p><p>With regards to the spirit, our brother has to realize that his outer man must be broken before his spirit can gradually be released. We have witnessed something of a start in our brother, and this is a good sign. However, he needs more breaking with regard to the things he built up in the past&mdash;his pretensions and his coarse feelings. Only then will he be able to run on the spiritual pathway. I hope that our brother will not seek man's approval in any spiritual things but only seek the Lord's approval. When difficulties come, he should not circumvent them. He should learn to yield to the difficulties and to be ground into powder. Our brother needs many make-up lessons. Our work must be far from sin. We should never allow ourselves to be dragged into sin. It seems that the Lord has done some work in you in the most recent part of his journey. You should not hinder the Lord in any way, but should humble yourself under His hand and allow Him to give you a fundamental breaking. If you do, you will have a way to go on in the Lord's service. You will become useful as you learn to allow the Lord to tear you down completely through all the trials.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(59)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 14, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER I. T.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family and studied in a parochial school. Others considered me to be a good and well-behaved student, but I was not clear about my salvation. I thought that a man is saved by his works. Later I found out that salvation is by faith. I was baptized on September 6, 1929. Later I was married, and my second daughter died at the age of nine months. Fortunately, the Lord's word comforted me. In 1936 I became gravely ill and almost died of an intestinal disease, but the Lord healed me. During the Second World War the Lord preserved me so that I did not die from starvation, bombs, or sickness. I am timid by nature and do not like to expose myself. I am shy about talking to others. It is the Lord's mercy that I am able to come to the mountain to be trained. After listening to all the truths, I realized how far I have been from the standard. At the same time, my poor health has precipitated self-pity. My heart is active, and I want to do many things, but I often find myself unable to do anything. I would like to know what is the relationship between treating the body according to the natural law and temperance.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>At the end of your testimony, you spoke of your timidity. Timidity or fear is a symptom, not a sickness. An underlying reason for fear is self-preservation. The more a man tries to preserve himself, the more fearful he becomes. The less a man is willing to suffer, the more he fears. Our sister has to put herself in the Lord's hand decisively and unreservedly at least once. You have to be bolder. You have to stand up against self-love, self-pity, and self-preservation. Do not be afraid of being hurt. If you will do this, your pathway will be straight. Those who are physically strong can do many things. Even though you are weak and unable to do many things, you still are full of fear and self-love. This is from your own confession. You cannot decide whether you should go along with the natural law of health or whether you should ignore yourself. A man can maintain the natural laws of health without indulging in self-love. In contrast, a man can break natural laws and be still very much indulgent in self-love. Keeping the natural law is one thing and being indulgent in self-love is another thing. We should only be concerned with whether or not we are indulgent in self-love while we are taking care of the natural laws. We should take care of our health before God. It would be wrong, however, for this care to become a form of self-love. That is not the straight way. Once a man indulges in self-love, he misses the opportunity to learn many things. It is very easy for a man to indulge himself in self-love. If a man cannot be free from such love, he should seek to touch God. It appears that those who do not abide by the natural laws tend to be more self-loving than those who do. It is good that you can ask this question. It shows that you are sensitive to this issue. You have to ask the Lord to save you from self-love.</p><p>Naturally speaking, you are a gentle and tender person. Your outer man is not hard, and your spirit is also sensitive. Considering your background and personal condition, it is interesting that others are able to touch the tender side of your human nature. For this reason you should express God all the more. If you allow the Lord to inflict wounds, scars, and bruises in you, you will express God's life more and will become rich. If you cherish your self-love and hesitate to deny your self, you will not have many scars, and others will only touch your natural meekness and goodness. Your spirit will not be released freely. If the wounds are not deep enough, there will not be the outflow of a wounded spirit. If your outer man is broken, you will have the following results: Others will easily touch your spirit; your spirit will easily be released, and there will be less distance between you and others. If your old man is broken, your inner man will flow easily, and others will be able to approach you easily. When your spirit does not flow easily, others cannot approach you easily. This is the reason you feel far from others. There is distance between men because there is little breaking of the outer man. A man whom God uses is one who has no distance between him and others. Paul and Peter were such men. The obstacles between you and others must be removed before your spirit can flow. Do not love yourself, preserve yourself, care for yourself, or cherish yourself. You have to place yourself in the Lord's hand and allow Him to break you. You should not have any reservation or any thought of self-preservation. If you can do this, you will have no fear. As soon as you are delivered from these feelings of self, your fears will go away.</p><p>You can see God's hand while you are in the training here in Kuling. It seems that God has started the breaking work already. You have to say to the Lord, "I have seen this way. Make me one who can deny myself. I pray that Your breaking hand will work on me more each day." You have to see your own frailty, and you must not seek glory from men. Rather, you should be satisfied with being despised. You have to ask the Lord to remove all thoughts of self-love. If you have these spiritual dealings with yourself, you will have a bright, spiritual future, and you will be able to go on in the Lord's work.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(60)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 16, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER P. H.</h2><p>In myself, I find nothing worthy of a testimony; there is nothing but corruption in me [weeping as she testified]. I was born in 1909 and almost died the day I was born. My family put me on the floor and called for a doctor. They placed me in a tub of hot water. My parents prayed for me the whole night. After fifty days I became well. When I was a child, I consecrated myself to the Lord in a gospel church. After I grew up, I decided to study medicine. I graduated from Peking Medical College. Others considered me a saint in school because I was both the leader of the Bible study group and the superintendent of the Moral Department. When others asked if I was saved, I would retort arrogantly, "Are you more saved than I am?" Later someone else asked me the same question. I was convicted, for I was not clear about my salvation. In time someone showed me the book Why Did He Come? After I read it, I became clear about my need for salvation. I accepted the Lord but still had many questions. When Brother Nee came, I presented these questions to him. Later I began to cover my head and was baptized. I also had a desire to go to the inland regions to preach the gospel. Three years after I was saved, I married a brother. Later I went to Yunnan, Kunming, and worked in a hospital through the Lord's arrangement. I had one son who died soon after he was born. I have often grieved over this.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Your words today show that you are not yet free from your past feelings. Some of the events, like your son's death, happened seven or eight years ago. These feelings should have faded after so many years. You should have been dealt with in your emotion already. Of course, the death of a dear son is a great thing to a mother, but if you have indeed experienced God's dealing, this should have been set aside already. If your present state still reflects your past feelings, it means that you need more dealings. If your emotion is truly dealt with, your feelings today should not be so entangled with your emotion. You should only be slightly affected now. Any dealing that you have is reflected in the degree of intensity of your feelings.</p><p>Apparently, the dealings our sister experienced were very cruel. Even though she cried, her crying was not bitter enough. Although she was sad, she was not sad and heartbroken enough. Although she was sorrowful, her sorrow did not make others sorrowful. Please forgive me for saying such a strong word. A man's spirit is like a camera; it must be in focus. If the focus is proper, the pictures are clear. If the focus is not proper, one can still identify the shapes, but he cannot know who is in the picture. If your spirit is calibrated to the Spirit of God's Son, your spirit will also be calibrated to others' spirit. In order for your spirit to make an impact on others' spirit, it must aim accurately. If your spirit is without emotional mixture and if your scars are deep enough, it will easily reach others' spirit. But if your spirit is mixed, it will not be easy to direct it toward others' spirit. The mixture of emotions will reach others first. They will not be able to feel what you feel. They will not be able to sense the problems you are facing, because your spirit will be contaminated by your emotion.</p><p>It is the Lord's wonderful arrangement that you have a very emotional husband. Although your emotion is strong, your husband's emotion is even stronger. A joyful spirit can make everyone joyful, and a wounded spirit can touch others' spirit. This is not like shaking hands with gloves on. If your spirit is without any mixture, everyone will respond with an amen when you speak; that is the ministry of the spirit. If the Lord has operated on you once, whenever He is released through your spirit, there will be an impact on others' spirit. It will be like touching some with ice or scalding others with hot water. Let me say a cruel word to you again. If you contact others in your present condition, they will never feel your pain. Although you have experienced some dealings from the Lord, your spirit has not broken through; it is not released enough. A man with a strong spirit will release his spirit as soon as he testifies, and the spirit of others will be revived. They will feel as if they are taking a cold shower in the hot summer. If your emotion is dealt with seriously, you will no longer be able to return to your former feelings. If you can return to your former feelings, it means that the dealings you have received are not deep enough. If your emotion is truly dealt with, you will forget about the feelings you had a few years ago. They will seem as if they are the feelings of someone else. The apostle Peter denied the Lord, but a month later, he was able to forget everything and rebuke the men of Israel, saying, "But you denied the holy and righteous One" (Acts 3:14). In Greek the word deny is the same word that is used when Peter denied the Lord. Peter was a man with feelings. Yet he put the greatest denial in the whole world, which he himself committed, behind him. His denial was more serious than that of the people of Israel. Therefore, you have to ask the Lord to deal with your emotion in a strict way. You have to ask Him to deal with you to such an extent that you become absolutely free from your past feelings. Then you will live in an entirely different realm.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(61)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 17, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER D.

After I heard the messages on overcoming, my knowledge of the truth increased, and I felt closer to the Lord.</p><p>Once I went with a brother to preach the gospel in Ku-Tien, Fukien.

He consecrated himself at that very moment to the Lord and vowed to preach the gospel for Him. Prior to that I was very timid, and I would blush as soon as I opened my mouth. The squalid man's consecration touched me deeply. I became bold to preach the gospel. Fear left me. Later because of my strong craving to attend school in Shanghai, I turned away from the Lord and became cold.</p><p>The Lord did not let me go. One day while I was waiting for a bus, a voice within rebuked me, saying, "Why are you so stiff-necked? Why are you fighting with God?" I began to read the Bible and pray again, and I vowed to follow His will once more. When I read 2 Kings 15:20, the words turned back touched me. My heart was softened, and I asked for the Lord's forgiveness in tears. Once I heard the testimony of a preacher who threw his three Ph.D. diplomas into the sea in his determination to be a preacher for the Lord. The story touched me, and I dropped my thought of furthering my education. I returned to my village and worked as a common teacher, using that opportunity to spread the gospel.</p><p>Soon afterwards I quit my teaching job and worked in a transportation business. My spiritual condition deteriorated. I was not able to stand up again. The Lord allowed me to suffer twice from typhoid fever. In my sickness I prayed to the Lord and received His deliverance. During the past few years my involvement in business has unavoidably led me into cheating, deceit, and greed. I have asked for the Lord's forgiveness, and I have trusted in His blood for a purged conscience. During this time I asked the Lord for a revival. When Brother Witness Lee came, I was revived. I have a question now: Where does the line between God's work and man's responsibility lie? I have had the experience of Romans 7. After listening to the truth on this subject twice, a brother told me that I had still not broken through on this matter. I thought he meant that I did not understand the truth. Later I found that I had to break through in experience before I could know the overcoming truth. Brother Nee's word on the mountain concerning Aaron's rod has enlightened me. I see that God is the One who does all the work.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our brother has all kinds of problems in his mind. Your mind is strong, but your disposition is weak. This is your real problem. In spiritual matters, do not try to solve the problems in the mind first. An unbeliever has many problems in the mind, but we do not try to solve these problems. Rather, we tell him to believe in the Lord first, and then the problems of his mind will be solved. If you learn to trust in God, the problems in your mind will go away easily.</p><p>The many problems in your mind have become a spiritual problem to you. Originally, they were not a spiritual problem. The worst thing with you is the combination of a weak disposition with a strong mind. Your will is weak, and your disposition is weak. You cannot expect to change these traits by doing something. Yet you can ask for the Lord's mercy and grace. He can make you the same as Peter, who was reconstituted with a durable and strong character. After the Lord's resurrection, Peter became strong, except for the one incident in Galatians 2 when he flinched. In the coming days you need to be strengthened in your character. You have to be stable, and you have to ask the Lord to make you simple. You have to learn to look to Him, rest in Him, and trust in Him. Once your character is strengthened, the problems in your mind will go away.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(62)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 21, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER S. M.</h2><p>I became a Christian at the age of seventeen. In my youth I was always sick. I was married in Luo-Yang and met with the local church in Sian. At that time I was very seeking. I dealt with sins and also experienced the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. I consecrated myself to the Lord and my whole family eventually was saved. Once, I became sick during a period of darkness, and I asked God to take me away. Later, my husband and I mutually confessed our sins. The next day the swelling in my stomach left, and I recovered gradually.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Being Enlarged by the Cross</h2><p>Our sister has not learned many lessons, because her years in the Lord are short. She is not very experienced. Both the work of the cross and the discipline of the Spirit are for the purpose of enlarging man's capacity before God. The cross can enlarge man's capacity. We are narrow because we experience little working of the cross. The more the cross works on us, the more our measure is enlarged, and the more we are willing to deny ourselves and all that we have. We know that the Lord's heart is large. Through His cross man's heart can also be enlarged beyond measure. As soon as a man touches the cross, he begins to be enlarged. He can even pray for his own enemies. Those who can pray for their enemies are enlarged. The cross can enlarge a person and make his heart as large as the heart of the crucified Lord. The more crosses a person receives, the more he is enlarged. The fact that Stephen was able to pray for his enemies proves that he was enlarged by the cross. The cross was manifested in him as much as it was manifested in Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Accepting God's Arrangements</h2><p>Our sister prayed for death. She also prayed for repentance, for recovery, and for healing. A person prays for death only because he does not appreciate the environment that God has arranged. He despises and hates God's arrangement, and he is disappointed by it. You are not willing to accept God's arrangement and are disappointed by it. This is the reason you prayed for death. Please remember that this is not a matter of right and wrong. It is a sign that speaks of your hidden rejection of God's right. It speaks of a secret, rebellious spirit, a disobedient will. We should learn to bow our heads before God and submit to all of His arrangements. When we find God's arrangement different from our will, we should ask for grace to appreciate it. Although what happened to you is over, you should find out why these things came upon you. A Christian should learn to kiss the hand that orders his environment. We become disappointed when we encounter many things that we dislike and are unable to change them. When God orders such circumstances for us, we should learn submission. We have to know that many things are impossible with man, but all things are possible with God. We have to learn to trust and obey.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Careful and Serious</h2><p>Our sister's speaking gave me the impression that she is not a careful person. Her testimony and prayer show that she is not that concerned with small details. She is careless, unfocused, and unconcerned about many things. I hope that our sister will receive mercy. A sister should be careful and serious. She should not be negligent or sloppy in anything before the Lord, and she should consider everything in a sober way. Everything that you do should be done to God, not to those around you, such as your husband and children. We live before God. Our immediate relationship is not with man, but with God. Men may excuse us for many things, but we should be sober before God concerning these things. Careless persons are off in the eyes of God. Our walk and our living are before God. Men may let us get by with many things, but we have to seek to walk perfectly before God. God told Abraham to be perfect before Him. Our God is a God of perfection. Perhaps this is what you need. You have to accept God's arrangements, and you have to be more sober in your living. You should no longer be careless or sloppy. Otherwise, your daily life will affect your Christian life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(63)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 22, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER G. R.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. When I was young I became sick and sought for healing from the idols. After I became well, I was given to one idol to be its adopted son. Later I learned the trade of dressmaking. I became tired of life and considered becoming a monk. I saw many nominal Christians whose walk did not deserve their name, and I despised Christianity, refusing to believe in Jesus. Our entire family worshipped idols. When my first two sons became ill, I prayed to the idols. But both of them died. I became angry with the idols and gave them up. I burned all the images and things related to the idols. Once I went to a gospel meeting and heard that there is God and that man has a soul. I accepted the Lord Jesus. When the Japanese invaded China, I moved inland. Once, I received the promise of Psalm 91.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Spiritual Understanding Not Yet Opened</h2><p>You should ask why your spirit is so weak. You have experienced many things but have learned few lessons. You are still very weak. You must not only find the reason for your weakness but the way of deliverance. If you remain self-assured, self-justifying, and hard, your experience will not result in God's breaking, and you will not receive any good. Perhaps you are unable to have much spiritual knowledge and understanding and are unable to take advantage of your environment because of the lack of supply from the ministry. In all your experiences in your environment, you only found yourself related to the things themselves, not to the God who ordered the environment. This is the reason all of your experiences have flown away one by one in a meaningless fashion. Those whose spiritual understanding is opened will reap spiritual result in everything they encounter.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lack of Supply<br />from the Ministry of the Word</h2><p>Our brother's experiences are merely outward events to him; they have not become spiritual lessons to him. If a man's spiritual understanding is enlightened, he may not know what an event means at the time it happens. After a while, however, he will know that God's hand is behind it. The problem with our brother is that he is short of the supply of the ministry of the word. He has encountered many things, but he remains weak and has not learned many spiritual lessons. We can see that the ministry of the word is very much related to the way a man runs the race. If a man has spiritual understanding, he can turn worldly things into spiritual things. In order to understand the discipline of the Holy Spirit, a man first must have spiritual understanding. Only then can he be brought into the spiritual realm.</p><p>I hope that from now on our brother will see God's mighty hand in everything great or small. I hope that he will not oppose the Lord but submit to Him instead. Once he submits, his spiritual understanding will be enlightened, and his spirit will be strong. Our brother must also learn to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit. As soon as our spiritual understanding is enlightened, our experiences will turn into spiritual blessings. Otherwise, we will waste our experiences and live our life in vain.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(64)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 23, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER P. G.</h2><p>In reminiscing over my spiritual journey, I find that I was following a brother for a long time. Later I felt that I could no longer catch up with him. He was too fast for me. I tried to catch up but failed. In the end I could only stand still, and I finally sat down. I have been sitting for over ten years until today. When I was saved, I did not have any strong feelings, yet I definitely believed in the Lord. At one time I was very seeking, getting up at three o'clock in the morning to read the Bible and to pray. In 1927 I left my denomination. Once I was gravely sick, but later was healed. I also suffered from a plague. When the plague was rampant, I came across Psalm 91, and I was preserved from any harm. I have a son who became very sick when he was nine. He actually died a few times but came back to life again.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">A Strong Will</h2><p>First, our brother is a very calm and confident person. You know what you should do, and you are not easily confused. Those with a strong will are always confident about themselves. Yet for a Christian, a strong disposition is hard to break. If it is hard to break a person, it means that it is hard for him to go on. He has to be driven to the point of despair before he can experience deliverance.</p><h2 class="head2">Quick and Active in Thoughts</h2><p>Second, you are quick and active in thoughts. You have to hold your thoughts in check. Being quick in the natural mind is useless when it comes to spiritual things. The natural thoughts must be broken.</p><h2 class="head2">Self-assurance and Self-satisfaction</h2><p>Third, you are quite satisfied with yourself. Once a man trusts in himself, believes in himself, and justifies himself, he becomes loose, impolite, rough, and coarse towards others. This makes him an arrogant person. He will have friction with others, and his relationships will not be fine and tender. These are outward signs.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for Spiritual Understanding</h2><p>Fourth, every time a Christian goes through an experience, there should be some spiritual result. Spiritual lessons have nothing to do with the number of outward experiences or their duration in time; they have to do with the result that is produced. In order to have spiritual results, one has to have spiritual visions and spiritual understanding. The lack of results in our brother from God's dealing may be due to the lack of supply from the ministry of the word. Or it may be due to his self-satisfaction, which turns away God's blessings. A man can reap spiritual results and enhance his spiritual understanding without the ministry of the word; he can produce spiritual fruit in the midst of all his experiences. Our brother needs a broken spirit before he can receive the ministry of the word from others. You have to wait in humility and drop your self-confidence before you can receive any spiritual good. While you are on the mountain, you have to see the spiritual pathway. Spiritual knowledge is very important. When something happens to you, you have to acknowledge the Lord's hand. There is a kind of oldness and sense of seniority with you. You have to repent and become like a child. You have to remove your self-satisfaction, self-complacency, and self-confidence before you can obtain mercy. Do not retain what you have heard here on the mountain as a doctrine in your mind. You have to receive it in your spirit. You have to have a new evaluation and a fresh view concerning yourself. You cannot go on like you have before. This is your way of deliverance.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(65)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 27, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER H. N.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. At the age of sixteen I heard Paget Wilkes in a conference and came to realize that I was a sinner and needed the Savior. From that time onward I believed in the Lord Jesus as my Savior. Once I went with my brother to cast out a demon. The demon knew that we were Christians and was scared. It left the man, and our faith was strengthened. When I was in school, I knelt down to pray three times a day. Once when I was praying, I seemed to hear a voice, saying, "Just as I have saved you, you should save others." I asked the Lord whether I should be a preacher and told Him that I was willing to be one. Since that day I have not heard any voice.</p><p>In February of 1931 our school invited Brother Nee to come to preach the gospel. He preached on the subject "There Is God." After I heard it, I felt that it was different from other preachings. After this, I often went to Wen-teh Lane in Hardoon Road, Shanghai, to meet with the brothers. In fact, I did not go to any other place. At that time Brother Nee asked me to take shorthand notes of the meetings. I have been doing that since then. Once I was deceived by Satan. Brother Nee told me that everything Satan says to us is false and should be rejected. I was bothered by Satan so much that I became confused in my mind and sick for a few months. I could not focus my thoughts. I was full of confusion and fear even while I was sleeping. I called on the name of the Lord, saying, "Lord, I am afraid." Soon the fear left me, and my sickness gradually went away.</p><p>Once the Lord's word came to me: "Seek Jehovah while He may be found;/Call upon Him while He is near" (Isa. 55:6). I went to the meetings of the church in Shanghai. I was willing to seek Him and to call upon Him. There I saw many people handing over their all. I was touched to do the same thing. After that, I came to Kuling. Brother Nee wanted me to take shorthand notes again. I said I could not do it because my head hurt. Brother Nee said that I should not worry and that the headache was not my business. I said, "My head belongs to me. How can you say that it is not my business?" He told me just to work anyway. As I was taking the notes of Brother Nee's message on "The Holy Spirit, the Church, and Resurrection," I began to believe his words. The Lord's resurrection power uplifted me and sustained me to continue in my note taking.</p><p>The messages on the mountain show me how subjective, proud, and self-loving I have been. I also have discovered a strange phenomenon: My head hurts under certain circumstances and does not hurt under other circumstances. Whenever I set my mind on unrelated subjects, my head hurts. But whenever I reject these distracting things, my head stops hurting. Within my being I discovered that my mind is mixed up with God's will, my feelings, and Satan's accusations. When my mind is under control, my condition improves. Since 1935 Brother Nee has been telling me that my mind needs to come under control. Yet even today, I have not learned this lesson well. I feel that Satan, the father of liars, is always tempting me to think wild things. I can only ask my dear Lord who loves me to control my thoughts.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Being Simple in Thoughts</h2><p>Our brother is very strong in his mind. Before the Lord our mind should be as simple as possible. Your thoughts are wild, active, and complicated. Even while you are being dealt with, you cannot stop thinking, and your thoughts run out of your control. This makes it difficult for you to get through before God. It also prevents you from having a straight pathway.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Delivered from Self-love</h2><p>During these years you have accumulated enough knowledge and heard enough messages, but you have not denied yourself enough. You are still very self-centered. Those who are discouraged are all self-centered. The same is true with those who love themselves. In fact, a self-loving person is very easily discouraged. Your thoughts are more active and stubborn than others'. Your thoughts probably have gone beyond the spiritual reality you have attained within. They are not real, but false. When a brother rebukes you, your mind suffers a blow. Then your thoughts, which should fall only to the level of the reality you have attained, fall below this point, and you become discouraged.</p><p>A self-loving person is very easily discouraged. A mark of those who do not love themselves is that they refuse to spend too much time thinking about themselves. A self-loving person devotes much energy thinking about himself and loving himself. There are two reasons a person cries. First, he is smitten by God, and he cries on account of God's dealing and breaking. Second, he feels sorry for himself because he loves and pities himself too much after God's smiting. In the first kind of crying, there can be praises in the midst of weeping; one acknowledges that what the Lord is doing is right. With the second kind, there is only self-love in the crying. One kind of crying is the result of God's breaking. The other kind of crying is the result of self-love. Our brother is very strong in his mind on the one hand, and very indulgent in self-love on the other hand. For years you have not been able to give up your self. You must reach the point where you no longer think about your self. You have to make a resolution to ignore your self and let your self go from now on. If you do this, your problem will go away.</p><h2 class="head2">Accepting the Dealing of the Cross</h2><p>In your speaking, your spirit was coarse. The feelings of your spirit also were very coarse. If a man has not been smitten and ground by God, his spirit is surely coarse. The degree of fineness of a man's spirit is determined by the amount of breaking and grinding he has received from God.</p><p>It is not right for our brother to be discouraged. The cross never discourages a man. The cross always leads to resurrection. Since the time of creation, there has been nothing more positive than resurrection. The cross is very positive because it removes all the undesirable elements in man. God's dealings only cause us to be discouraged about ourselves; they do not cause us to be discouraged about God. It is right for us to be discouraged about ourselves, but we have to be positive towards God.</p><p>There are two results to God's dealings through the environment. First, we become defeated, useless, and knocked out on the ground. Second, we experience resurrection. God's smiting is not merely to ruin and destroy a man, but it is also to cause him to rise up once the smiting work is finished. The smiting of the cross ushers us into the realm of resurrection. Some cannot rise up again after they pass through the cross. This means that they are sick and sunken in self-love. The cross is not the last thing that happens to a man. It is a necessary pathway to resurrection. The smiting of the cross may be severe, but it enables a person to rise up. The work of the cross destroys a man completely, even to the point of death. At the same time, however, on the other side of the grave, there arises the hope with God; one feels he can rise and have faith again through Him. Discouragement is not breaking; it is self-love. It is wrong for you to be discouraged for so long. You should say to God, "I am hopeless in myself. I am a hopeless man, but with You there is hope. You are the God of all hope."</p><h2 class="head2">Ignoring Confusing Thoughts</h2><p>You have to learn to continually turn your thoughts away from introspection. Do not look inward or analyze yourself. Introspection and self-analysis will never help us obtain deliverance. Sometimes we wonder how we can understand the things of God without using our mind. But many thoughts will not solve our problems. They are all lies. The best course for you to take is to not turn your mind inward at all. If you are wrong, you have to ask the Lord for His shining and judgment to tell you what is right and what is wrong. Do not try to replace God's light with your own thoughts. If God does not enlighten you, forget about whether or not your inward condition is good or bad. Just take care of God's light, and ignore your own thoughts. You should pray, "Lord, give me light and let me see. I will not replace Your shining with my own thoughts." No one can know whether or not he is right in himself by exercising his own thoughts. Only light will show us where we are. There is no need to set our mind upon ourselves. Simply drop the thoughts. What happens after they are dropped is none of our business. If we try to make it our business, we will come under the enemy's attack. Every self-loving person is under the enemy's attack. The best course of action is to ignore confusing thoughts. We should simply hand ourselves over to the Lord and fling everything into His hand. If we do this, the enemy will not be able to attack us.</p><p>Forget about your own confusing thoughts. Do not pay any attention to them. As long as you do not consider yourself so lovable, you will not be discouraged. You should not cherish any love for yourself. Revelation 12:11 says that the brothers overcome Satan by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life unto death. Only those who do not love their own soul-life will overcome Satan. You have to look to the Lord absolutely and be freed from your own thoughts. You have to believe that you are crucified with the Lord and are resurrected with Him. If you can ignore the confusing thoughts, you will run a straight course, and your spirit will become tender and fine. Forget about all your problems and resolutely cast your self aside. If you do this, you will find a straight pathway in front of you.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTY</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(66)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 24, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER N. S.</h2><p>I believed in the Lord Jesus and consecrated myself to Him through the gospel preaching of Brother Nee. I read many books published by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room. My husband was a preacher. He was very good at preaching, and his messages were full of life. He wrote a letter to me once, saying, "You have to take this way. This way gets narrower and narrower." Three days after I was married, I began to experience rejection and slander from his relatives. During the first seven years of my marriage, I cried almost every day. I heard Brother Nee's messages on overcoming, yet I often lost my temper. One of my children died of sickness, and I became very sad. During that time my husband was away from home.</p><p>The hardest person to deal with in the family was my mother-in-law. Her word always pricked me. I could not stand it. I also suffered much on account of family finances. My husband went into business at one time and was quite successful, but he soon failed. I exhorted him to withdraw from business and to give himself to preaching again. I asked God to have mercy upon me and to bless me. One day I prayed desperately and asked the Lord to fill me with His love. I told Him, "Lord, I am not worthy. I am not worthy. I am willing to obey You unconditionally." May the Lord remember my tears which I have shed throughout the years.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our sister suffered much criticism from the day she was married to her husband. These unjust words stirred up many feelings in her. The words from her mother-in-law were especially unbearable, but all these were for one purpose. God wants you to learn one fundamental lesson&mdash;you have to go on no matter what others say to you. If you had ignored the criticism, you would have felt better. When our Lord Jesus was on earth, others criticized Him as a gluttonous man and a drunkard. This was a great insult to Him, but He did not harbor any feeling about this and did not say anything. Others said that He was possessed by demons. He was not affected by these words either. The Lord turned a deaf ear and was dumb towards these piercing and untrue criticisms. He did not answer and did not react in any way.</p><p>Our Lord was mocked on the cross by a robber beside Him and by those passing by, who said, "Come down now from the cross that we may see and believe" (Mark 15:32). The Lord did not mind these things. He did not answer one single word. You have lived this way for over twenty years. When you were in school, you were innocent and full of feelings. As soon as you started your family, everything seemed to turn upside down. Nothing seemed to match your plan and expectations. You began to have a temper. That was the first time you encountered the cross in a serious way. Of course, this was hard for you to take. But it was the Lord disciplining and purifying you through the cross. The Lord allows two kinds of people to remain on this earth: Those who criticize and those who are being criticized. If God gave you a choice of having a sharp tongue to criticize others or having an ear to receive sharp criticism, which one would you take? If you love the Lord and take His way, you would choose the latter.</p><p>You have to learn to be an overcomer, one who accepts criticism. In your testimony you confessed that you often lost your temper. You have to know that temper is not a sickness but a symptom. This is like saying that fever is not a sickness but a symptom of a sickness. A person has a fever because he is sick. In the same way, temper is only a symptom to a man; there may be many reasons for having a temper. Some are proud. As soon as others touch their pride, they become angry and lose their temper. Others have a temper because they love themselves too much. If such ones need eight hours of sleep, they become angry if others disrupt their sleep for one minute. They love themselves, and they need every minute of their sleep. Temper has a cause behind it. Unless the cause is removed, the temper will always come back. Unless one removes the root beneath the temper, his temper will explode sooner or later.</p><p>Our sister is quick in feelings and thoughts. All who are quick in feelings tend to love themselves. They are also easily offended. Those who are slow in feelings do not easily indulge themselves in self-love and also are not easily offended. Those who have a desire to be good and victorious can easily become arrogant. Our sister has a temper because first she loves herself. She also wants to be ahead of others. You are sensitive in your feelings, and this can easily turn into a kind of self-love. You have to remember that your sensitivity can easily lead you into arrogance. It is true that your mother-in-law is a hard person to deal with, but you did not lose your temper because of your mother-in-law. I am not saying that she is right. You lost your temper because of the spiritual problem you have before God. If you love yourself and want to do well in everything, you will lose your temper when others touch or frustrate you. This has nothing to do with an impetuous disposition. You have a temper because you are proud, you want to be ahead of others, and you want to be good and victorious.</p><p>You have to learn two things. First, let others say what they want to say. Second, do not be concerned about what others are saying. If others say that I am possessed by a demon, that I am a gluttonous man and a drunkard, or that I am evil, what difference does that make to me? The most they can do is consider me to be these things. You have to take others' criticism in stride and use it as a means to deal with your self-love. You have to know that the Lord has special arrangements and leadings for you. He is purging all pride from you. Others can speak as they please, but we can choose to ignore their words.</p><p>When a man is hurt, he closes himself up and takes care of his own wounds. He is like a wounded dog who moves away from other dogs to lick his wounds. In principle, you are acting this way. Your mother-in-law has criticized you, and you have heard much criticism among the brothers and sisters. When you come to the meeting, you are a bystander. You hide inside your shell and have become a lonely person. A Christian may be crucified, but he should not have the feeling of being a martyr. It is all right to be a martyr but never all right to have the feeling of being a martyr.</p><p>Consider your own life. After you were married, your life took a big turn. You were married to a brother, and you knew that the way was difficult. During the war you suffered material shortages for two years. On top of that, the Lord prepared a special trial for you&mdash;your mother-in-law. You had thoughts of serving the Lord and helping the brothers and sisters, but when your mother-in-law ill-treated you and the brothers and sisters criticized you, you wanted to quit. You no longer had a heart to be a Christian. So you chose to sit on the last row in the church meetings. For twenty years you have been licking your wounds. Now I will not let you go. I hope that you will deal with your problem today. If we cannot help you to get through now, we have failed. You have to see the Lord's hand. He is dealing with your self-love and pride. Unless you go through such dealings, your self-love and pride will never go away.</p><p>For years you have acted like an ashamed person. You have been criticized, ill-treated, and embarrassed, but if you overcome these things and accept the discipline of the Spirit from now on, you will become a useful person. Otherwise, you will be the same as before. If you suffer and lick your wounds, constantly complaining of your lot in life, you will become a useless person. Once you learn your lesson, you will enter other people's feelings and be able to render help and guidance to those who are in the same condition. Do not think that you are finished because you have lost your temper, failed, and become weak. If you overcome today, your failures for the last twenty or thirty years will become history. You will see that there is no reason to pity your own wounds or to love yourself. You should only accept the environment and experiences that the Lord has arranged for you. You should allow them to trim you and destroy all that is important to you. This is your way.</p><p>You may think that you have nothing more to say with all of your history of failure. When a man fails to learn his lessons from the thousands of failures he experiences, he may think that he has lost his testimony and is hopeless. But as long as you overcome this last time, all of your past failures will be covered. Peter denied the Lord three times. We all know that this was a great failure. He would have been finished indeed if he only tended to his wound and looked at himself. The Lord told him to establish his brother once he had turned again (Luke 22:32). Today your future is the same as Peter's. The question now is what are you going to choose. If you overcome now, you will render help to many. When other younger sisters have similar problems, you will be a guide to them.</p></body></html>
