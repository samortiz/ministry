<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Verse Twelve</H2><P>Verse 12: "And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands."</P><P>Before the apostle was to see the future judgment and glory, he was to first consider the condition of the church. The seven golden lampstands that John saw were a symbol of the seven churches (v. 20). It is God's boundless grace that made Him speak to the churches even then. However, they would soon be rejected.</P><P>Hebrews 8:2 and 5 say, "A Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man....Who [the priest] serve the example and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to complete the tabernacle; for, `See,' He said, `that you make all things according to the pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.'" The golden lampstand in the tabernacle of the Israelites was but a shadow of the heavenly reality. Scholars studying the book of Revelation often want to ascertain whether or not the lampstands John saw here were the heavenly reality. After careful studying, we will see that they were not. We have to admit that there are similarities between them and the lampstand in the tabernacle. However, we must also realize the difference between the two. The golden lampstand in the Old Testament tabernacle was unique; there was only one lampstand divided into seven branches. The one in the middle was the trunk, with six branches coming off the sides. The golden lampstands that John saw here were different from the one in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament it was one lampstand divided into seven branches. What John saw were seven individual lampstands. That is why the Lord Jesus could stand in the midst of them. The golden lampstand in the tabernacle is a type of Christ. What John saw was a type of the churches. The golden lampstand in the tabernacle is a sign of Israel's union with Christ. That was the reason it could shine in the holy place. What John saw was the condition of individual churches in the world. Every lamp has its own stand. Every church has its own responsibility. The Lord Jesus was standing in the midst of these seven lampstands. He was not joined to them, but was judging them.</P><P>There is a lesson for us here. We learned that the Israelites, God's chosen people according to the flesh, were earthly. Hence, for them, there was an outward union. This is the meaning of one lampstand (not seven) composed of seven branches. However, the church, God's chosen people according to the spirit, is heavenly. Her union is not a unity in earthly forms. Rather, they are administered locally and are each responsible to the Lord. That is why in their form the lampstands are not joined as one but are separate as seven lampstands, each responsible for the shining in its own locality. In life and communion, the churches are one like a body, but in their earthly responsibility and appearance, the churches are administrated separately as seven lampstands. When we read chapters two and three, we see how the seven churches at that time were different in their works, circumstances, failures, rewards, punishments, and responsibilities. To deny this fact is to create confusion.</P><P>This is God's thought towards the different churches on earth. These seven churches do not have a common or unified name. They are not collectively called a certain denomination. In the original language, they are designated as "the church in Ephesus," "the church in Smyrna," etc. There is only one church in one locality. Furthermore, there is no name to these churches. How different this is from the present sects! In appearance, they are seven churches and not one combined church. How different it is from the present demoninations! Because men are not willing to obey the Bible, and because they consider their own organization better than the Bible, we often hear excuses like: "Churches nowadays are not like those in the time of the apostles. They are ten or one hundred times bigger in size than those then. How can the organization of the Bible be applicable?" However, the Bible does not have the practice of joining all the churches to become one denomination! If these people would remember the Scripture concerning the seven lampstands and the seven churches, they would probably not do such things. May God keep us faithful in this time of apostasy. May we not be sectarian and divide the Body of Christ into pieces. One thing grieves me much: whereas formerly God's children were not one according to God's will and have divided themselves under many names, now, while they have the motive of union, they are still acting contrary to God's will in aiming for a unification in name and in form only. It is not a bearing with one another in love in the uniting bond of peace. Such union only opens up the way for the great Babylon of Revelation 17! How sad this is!</P><P>There is much significance to God's use of the golden lampstands as a symbol of the church. Gold is the most precious, glorious, elegant, pure, and holy of all metals. In God's eyes, the church is the rarest treasure in the world. God established the church in righteousness and ordained that she should shine in the world. The church's responsibility is to express God's glory. This is the meaning of gold. However, in reality she may not have this expression. Even though God allotted this privilege and responsibility to her, the church has unfortunately disregarded this entrustment.</P><P>The lampstands are seven in number, yet this is not to say that these seven churches are combined into a perfect church. Seven here does not refer to moral perfection because these seven churches are far from perfect. The word seven represents perfection in number, that is, these seven churches typify a whole church.</P><P>Lamps are used only at night. The lamp of the tabernacle in the Old Testament was lit "from evening to morning" (Exo. 27:20-21) before the Lord: "when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even" (Exo. 30:8); the lampstand "of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening" (2 Chron. 13:11); "and ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep" (1 Sam. 3:3). It was in the dark night that the lamp was lit. Spiritually speaking, the present age is an extremely long dark night. The Lord Jesus is the Sun of righteousness, and from the time He was rejected by men and crucified on the cross, the Sun of this world set and the earth fell into great darkness. Our Lord is now dwelling in the heavens. He has established us to be a lamp in the world and charged us to shine. Hence, as the lamp of God, you must now shine. However, our excuses are excessively numerous! "My environment is too poor, so I cannot go on." "The outward opposition is too much, so we can do nothing but hide." "People's hearts are too dark, so we shouldn't waste our efforts." Are these excuses reasonable? Are there hardships? Is there darkness? This is the time for us to shine. If the world were already bright, why should there be the need for us, the lamp? Darkness is the proper time for us to shine.</P><P>Naturally, there are difficulties in shining. Perhaps sometimes it leads to persecution. If, while the true light Himself was in the world, it is said that "men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil," and that everyone "hates the light" (John 3:19-20), how can we, the students be higher than our teacher? However, the time will come, which will not be too long, when we will no longer have the opportunity to suffer and to shine for the Lord. "The night is far advanced, and the day has drawn near" (Rom. 13:12). In this final hour, let us shine faithfully for the Lord in our living and speaking. When the Morning Star arrives, we will be raptured.</P><P>However, the lampstand by itself does not have the light. The shining of the lamp is dependent on the oil and the fire. It is most crucial to remember this. If we are to shine for the Lord, we must rely unceasingly on the Holy Spirit of God and partake continuously of His holiness. If at any minute we are without the oil of the Holy Spirit (Zech. 4:1-14) and the holy fire, then immediately we will cease shining. We often seem to hear the terms "Holy Spirit" and "holiness," but have we actually been filled with these? We can speak of shining later; for now let us first search ourselves to see whether or not we actually have the oil and the fire of God. Oh, how thick is the darkness around us! We earnestly hope to "shine as luminaries in the world, holding forth the word of life" (Phil. 2:15-16). How we desire to be "the light of the world" (Matt. 5:14), to reflect "the light of the world!" (John 8:12). Do we not often feel that we cannot make it? We should lay hold of the oil and the fire of God. O Lord, grant these to us!</P>
