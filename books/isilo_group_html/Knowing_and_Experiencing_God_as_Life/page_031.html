<h1 class="title">THE CORPORATE ASPECT<br />
OF EXPERIENCING GOD AS LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:16-19; 2 Tim. 2:22</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning another aspect of experiencing God as life. Experiencing God as life is not only an individual matter; it is also a corporate matter. God wants to be life not only to an individual believer but also to all those who believe into His Son. As those who have been saved, we have God in us as life. If we experience Him as life merely by ourselves, our experience will be very limited. Our experience of God as life is mainly through the experiences of other believers.</p>
<p>Every saved person is a member of the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:5). A member of our physical body often can enjoy the benefits of our body only through the other members. Similarly, under normal conditions a believer does not enjoy God as life only by himself. An isolated brother who enjoys God as life will gradually realize that his enjoyment does not last long and that his experience is limited. In order to experience God as life, we should pay attention not only to our individual experiences but also to the experiences of other believers. This is the corporate aspect of experiencing God as life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPREHENDING CHRIST WITH ALL THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:18 says that we need to apprehend the dimensions of Christ&mdash;His breadth, length, height, and depth&mdash;with all the saints. We apprehend the dimensions of Christ with all the saints because no one can apprehend all the riches of Christ alone. No one can apprehend or grasp by himself the breadth, length, height, and depth of Christ.</p>
<p>Christ is immeasurable, just as the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe cannot be measured. There is no way to measure the length of the universe. Likewise, we cannot describe how high is the height. There are high-rise buildings in Hong Kong and in New York City, but there is still quite a distance between the top of those buildings and the sky. They are not as high as the sky. Likewise, we cannot measure the breadth or depth of the universe.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3 says that when the saints experience Christ together, they can apprehend the breadth, length, height, and depth. The breadth, length, height, and depth refer to Christ. This is the only portion in the Bible that speaks of Christ in relation to the dimensions of the universe. The breadth of the universe is Christ, the length is Christ, the depth is Christ, and the height is also Christ. The breadth, length, height, and depth are Christ. He is immeasurable and unlimited; we cannot exhaust Him. When the apostle Paul wrote of the unlimitedness of Christ, he could not find more suitable words. According to verses 17 through 19, when Christ makes His home in our hearts, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God. Apprehending the unlimited fullness of God requires all the saints. Each of us can touch only a little of this fullness, just as a bucket cannot hold all the water in the ocean. Not only so, our personal experience is not independent; it is our experience with all the saints. The more we experience Christ, the more we will feel that we need to apprehend and experience Him with all the saints. We cannot experience Christ by ourselves; we must experience Him together with others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO FIND SPIRITUAL COMPANIONS</h2>
<p>The best way for the young brothers and sisters to experience Christ is to find at least two or three companions in the Lord. This is spoken of in 2 Timothy 2:22, which says, &ldquo;Flee youthful lusts, and pursue...with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bible contains many examples of companions. There are many spiritual companions in the Old Testament. Caleb and Joshua were companions who followed God together (Num. 32:12). David and Jonathan were also spiritual companions (1 Sam. 18:1). When Daniel was taken to Babylon, he had three friends who feared God and lived in His presence (Dan. 1:6). When Daniel encountered difficulties, they prayed together in one accord. Thus, their prayer was powerful and received the Lord&rsquo;s specific answer.</p>
<p>The principle of companions also exists in the New Testament and is strengthened. When the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples, they went in groups of two (Luke 10:1). This is the principle of companions. In the book of Acts the disciples rarely moved or acted alone. When Peter went out, John was with him (3:1). When Paul went out, Barnabas, Silas, Timothy, and Luke were his companions (12:25; 17:10; 20:4; 2 Tim. 4:11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BENEFITS OF HAVING SPIRITUAL COMPANIONS</h2>
<p>The best way to have spiritual growth and receive spiritual benefit is to find a few brothers and sisters to be our spiritual companions so that we can open to one another, seek one another, help one another, and solve one another&rsquo;s problems in all spiritual things. On one hand, we should regularly seek the Lord on our own, and on the other hand, with a pure heart we should frequently have open fellowship with a few brothers and sisters. We would be blessed if we would fellowship concerning our weaknesses or problems, concerning matters that we cannot overcome, and concerning matters that cause us to fall. We often cannot overcome a certain sin alone, but if we are willing to fellowship about it, the sin will be overcome. This is quite marvelous.</p>
<p>Suppose a young brother is having trouble understanding the Lord&rsquo;s leading concerning a certain matter. He can invite a few brothers over and fellowship with them about the problem. From our experience we know that he can become clear even while he is speaking. If he does not fellowship, he will not be able to understand the Lord&rsquo;s leading, but once he begins to speak, he often will become clear before the brothers even respond. The brothers have helped him, because without them, he would have no one to fellowship with, and he would not become clear. It is because he has people to fellowship with that he is able to understand the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<p>Suppose we are weak and do not have any joy. We might not be able to rise above this situation no matter how much we pray. This is when we should find some brothers with whom to fellowship. The topic of our conversation may not be important, but after the conversation, we will be refreshed and uplifted.</p>
<p>Spiritual companions are such a great benefit because of the principle of the Body. God is our life, but He is not only in us individually; He is in us corporately. Therefore, whenever we fellowship, we will be helped by the other members, and they will be helped by us.</p>
<p>In order to kindle wood in a stove, there must be at least three pieces of firewood. It is very difficult to start a fire with only one piece of firewood, and if a fire is started, it will easily be quenched. This is an example of our condition before God. In order to pursue the Lord in a good way, we must find three to six brothers and sisters with whom we can come together regularly. We should be open and fellowship with one another without any reservation concerning our condition toward the Lord and our situation before Him. If we would practice this, our weaknesses will be swallowed up, our problems will be solved, the light in us will become brighter, our spirit will be strengthened and refreshed, and our love for the Lord will be more fervent. The benefits of having spiritual companions are too great.</p>
<p>Since there are so many benefits to having spiritual companions, all the young saints should find a few brothers or sisters to be their spiritual companions. Without such friends, their condition before the Lord will be hazardous, and many problems will arise. Therefore, they must have friends so that they can be balanced and steady. Some people are loners; they do not like to have friends. The more they are inclined to be alone, the more necessary it is for them to have friends, because friends will help them be more open. Some brothers and sisters were the only child in their family and were spoiled in their youth. As a result, they have a closed temperament and a secluded disposition, which greatly hinder their Christian life. The only way to remove this tendency of being closed and secluded is to have a few companions. Then such a brother will become one among many brothers, and such a sister will become one among many sisters. This will deliver them from being closed and secluded. In order to be broken, to be delivered from the self, and to become open instead of closed, we must have companions. Regardless of what we do, in ourselves we are closed and have no way to be open. We need companionship with some brothers and sisters in order to be open.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Knowing and Experiencing God as Life &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
