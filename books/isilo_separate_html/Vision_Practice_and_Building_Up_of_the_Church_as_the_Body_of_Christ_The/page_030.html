<p>The more gift a person has and the bigger the gift is, the more danger there is. He will be tempted by the gift. He may think he can do everything, so it will be difficult for him to trust others to do anything. We need to stress this because we have learned from the past. Some of the local churches in the Far East have the proper practice. We can see persons produced there all the time. Co-workers are raised up, elders are built up, and deacons and deaconesses are produced because the work is carried out in the proper way. However, in some local churches this is not the case. For many years they have had only &ldquo;pastors,&rdquo; even though they do not call them that. In fact they are simply pastors, doing everything for the congregation. This is the wrong way to take. In name they are not a division, but in fact they become a division, because what is there is merely a work, not a local church built up by the work.</p>
<p>If we work in the wrong way, sooner or later there will be a division. The more we work, the more the work must be passed on to the saints, and the more the responsibility must be in the hands of the local saints. The local saints need to be raised up. Some will learn to be the called ones, called by the Lord to work for Him. Some will be built up as the elders, and some will be perfected as the deacons and deaconesses. Then whether or not workers are there, they will be able to go on by themselves. Eventually, all the matters of the church must be in the hands of the local saints.</p>
<p>If we are not clear about this, then the longer we work, the more things will be in our own hands. On the contrary, it must be that the more we work, the more things are out of our hands. After three or four years, everything should be out of the worker&rsquo;s hands. Even if he is raptured, the church still can go on, even in a better way, because the local saints will improve it. First, the saints are perfected by the worker, and then eventually according to how they are perfected, they can build upon the work and make some improvements. This is the right way, and in recent years we have been practicing this way. Sometimes people come to me and ask, &ldquo;These brothers are too young. They cannot do this job. Why do you let them do it?&rdquo; We must let them do it. We cannot stay here for our whole life, and our ministry is not to build up our work. Our ministry is to build up the local churches. Only this way can save us from making divisions. Eventually a local church must be built up under the hands of all those persons who have been perfected by the gifted ones. All the gifted persons must learn this lesson. Otherwise, the many gifted persons will make many divisions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking the Proper Way<br />
to Perfect and Raise Up All the Saints</h2>
<p>We have learned this lesson in the past. For many years there were many prevailing co-workers with Brother Watchman Nee, but no divisions were formed among us because we all learned the lesson not to keep any work in our own hands. We do not work for our own work. There is no work that belongs to us. We work only for the local churches. I can testify from the depth of my heart that Brother Nee kept nothing in his hand. His work was wholly for the local churches. It was to perfect others. I was perfected by him very much. He perfected many by his ministry. He raised up, perfected, and trained the saints to be the elders, deacons, and deaconesses in different places. We all have to learn to do this. I am not merely giving a lecture here. Rather, I beg you to put these things into practice. Always learn to do things to perfect others, not simply to do things by yourself. While you are doing things, you need to perfect others.</p>
<p>In certain large local churches in Taiwan, twenty to fifty co-workers were produced after only five or six years. In addition, many elders, deacons, and deaconesses were established. If you go there, you will realize that these are genuine, proper elders, not in position or name but in reality and in bearing responsibility. Likewise, the deacons and deaconesses have a genuine service. In other places, however, even after fifty years it is still difficult to find a co-worker who was produced there. There may be ten or twelve elders, but many are elders only in name and position. There are also deacons and deaconesses there, but they do not know how to serve. The responsibility is still in the hand of the one worker. Does this mean that the Lord had only one person He could raise up there? We cannot believe this. The Lord would have raised up more saints. The only problem is that the co-worker there took the wrong way, working all the time without perfecting others.</p>
<p>I look to the Lord. I must exercise my spirit to have the assurance that after five years in the locality where I am there will be a good number raised up, some as co-workers, some as elders, some as deacons, and some as deaconesses serving in a practical way. Moreover, after five years some must go out from this country to other countries. It is not right for us simply to meet together and fellowship without anyone being raised up by the Lord to go out for Him. After a certain time there must be some who would be willing to sacrifice everything for the Lord to go out to other countries. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace we must work this out. We cannot work it out ourselves, but if we coordinate and cooperate with the Lord, He will work this out through us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Dealt With in Our Motive</h2>
<p>There is a proper technique to learn, but first we need to be purified in our motive. If our inner motive for working in a certain place is to build up something for our own desire or purpose, it is not pure. This motive must perish. It is wrong. It is even an idol; we are building up an idol for ourselves. We need to be dealt with in our motive. We must be able to say, &ldquo;We are working here not for ourselves but for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, His Body.&rdquo; In this way many saints will be perfected. We all have to learn this, and we must also learn how to be perfected by others. This is why we have our trainings. The trainings are simply for the purpose of perfecting. I believe that after a certain number of years my responsibility will be discharged. I will be innocent before the Lord, and you all will be responsible because all these matters will be passed on to you.</p>
<p>All these matters are not insignificant, and we all need to learn them. On the one hand, we are working, while on the other hand, we are perfecting others by our working, not simply doing things by ourselves. We do things in a coordinated way so that others can be perfected by us. This is the right way. If we work in this way, eventually all the saints will be brought into their function.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
