<h2 class="head1">GOD BLENDING THE NATIONS ON EARTH<br />
THAT WE, THE GOD-MEN,<br />
MAY BE BLENDED INTO ONE BODY</h2>
<p>According to our genealogy, we were scattered far away from one another. How could we be blended into one Body? This is now possible because of the great changes that have taken place on earth during the past fifty years. Through the modern means of transportation and communication, people from all over the earth can be blended. In our semi-annual trainings saints come together from as many as fifty nations. The globe today has become a small earth-ball, making it possible for me to speak the holy Word to people from so many different nations.</p>
<p>On the day I was saved I told the Lord that from that time onward I wanted to travel from village to village in China, preaching the Bible and telling people about Jesus Christ. My intention was to speak only to my countrymen. I never dreamed that I would be here in the United States speaking to saints from fifty nations. From this we see that God has blended the earth together so that we may be blended into one Body.</p>
<p>One day, in 1938, I received from a sister in Peking a letter containing two checks. This sister told me that she believed that God would send me to America and that one check was for my trip there and back and the other was for taking care of my family while I was gone. I answered her, saying that I did not have any burden to go to the United States. But she told me that I should keep the checks and that sooner or later the Lord would send me to the United States. Twenty years later I visited this country, and eventually I became a citizen. This was the Lord&rsquo;s doing. Acts 5:31 tells us that in His ascension the Lord Jesus is the Leader and the Savior. He is the Ruler of all the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5), and I was sent here by Him.</p>
<p>God created the earth and made man according to His kind. Man fell and became mankind. From fallen mankind God chose Abraham to be the father of another people, and then two thousand years later God became a man and lived on earth as a God-man. I am glad that I have become an American, but I am much more glad that I have become a God-man. I am an American by naturalization, but I am a God-man by regeneration.</p>
<p>Do you know what God wants today? We may say that He wants Christians and believers in Christ. Actually, what God wants is not merely Christians or even believers in Christ; He wants a big group of God-men. I believe that our God, who is sitting in the heavens, is happy whenever He looks upon a gathering of God-men, especially a gathering of God-men from fifty nations. In such a gathering everyone has the appearance of a God-man.</p>
<p>At this juncture I would ask you to consider <em>Hymns,</em> #203:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>In the bosom of the Father,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the ages had begun,<br />
Thou wast in the Father&rsquo;s glory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God&rsquo;s unique begotten Son.<br />
When to us the Father gave Thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou in person wast the same,<br />
All the fulness of the Father<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Spirit to proclaim.<br /><br /></li>
<li>By Thy death and resurrection,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wast made God&rsquo;s firstborn Son;<br />
By Thy life to us imparting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Thy duplication done.<br />
We, in Thee regenerated,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many sons to God became;<br />
Truly as Thy many brethren,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are as Thyself the same.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Once Thou wast the only grain, Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falling to the earth to die,<br />
That thru death and resurrection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou in life may multiply.<br />
We were brought forth in Thy nature<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the many grains became;<br />
As one loaf we all are blended,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Thy fulness to proclaim.<br /><br /></li>
<li>We&rsquo;re Thy total reproduction,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy dear Body and Thy Bride,<br />
Thine expression and Thy fulness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Thee ever to abide.<br />
We are Thy continuation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy life-increase and Thy spread,<br />
Thy full growth and Thy rich surplus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One with Thee, our glorious Head.</li>
</ol>
<p>This hymn says that once Christ, the only begotten Son, was the only grain. Through His death and resurrection He has made us the many grains. As such grains, we are the many sons of God (Heb. 2:10), Christ&rsquo;s many brothers, His many &ldquo;twins.&rdquo; Now the many grains are blended as one loaf, which is Christ&rsquo;s Body, His reproduction.</p>
