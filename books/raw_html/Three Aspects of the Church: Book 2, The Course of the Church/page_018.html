	 <h2 class="head2">Cleansed from Dishonorable Vessels</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Gold, Silver, Wood, and Earth<br />
Being a Matter of Nature</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 2:20-21 says, &ldquo;In a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels but also wooden and earthen; and some are unto honor, and some unto dishonor. If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, prepared unto every good work.&rdquo; In the preceding verses Paul speaks of those who preach heresies and damage the work of God, like Hymenaeus and Philetus (v. 17). He refers to these people as vessels. Thus, even modernists who preach heresy are vessels in the great house. However, they are wooden and earthen vessels. <em>Wooden</em> refers to the fallen human nature, the flesh, and the natural man; <em>earthen</em> means &ldquo;of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The modernists in today&rsquo;s Christianity preach Christ, but they do not believe that Christ came in the flesh; they are wooden and earthen vessels. <em>Wooden and earthen vessels</em> refers to false believers who are not truly saved. Because God is great, His house is a great house. In His great house there are vessels of gold (those who are divine), vessels of silver (those who are redeemed), and wooden and earthen vessels (those who are constituted with the fallen human nature). We were all earthen vessels, but we have been redeemed and have had a change in nature inwardly to become vessels of silver and gold.</p>
<p>The church today is in desolation and has become a great tree (Matt. 13:32). In this great tree, that is, in Christianity, there are all kinds of preachers and workers, such as Paul, Timothy, Hymenaeus, and Philetus. In the desolation of the church, the Lord wants us to cleanse ourselves from dishonorable vessels, from those who are fleshly, worldly, and natural. The Lord wants us to become vessels unto honor. Although we should not argue with people about doctrines, we need to discern their nature. We should discern whether the nature of someone&rsquo;s work is wooden and earthen or if it is gold and silver. Is it a work of wood and earth or a work of gold and silver? Some people build with wood, grass, and stubble; others build with gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12). We must discern the nature of the work.</p>
<p>Doctrine and nature are two separate issues; we must be able to discern both. Suppose, for example, that two brothers speak the same gospel message, but their ways are different. We should decide which one to follow, not based on the doctrine they preach but based on the way and result of their work. We must base our decision on the nature of their work. Are they building with wood, grass, and stubble or with gold, silver, and precious stones? Is the nature of their work earthen and wooden or gold and silver? When we consider this, we will see who is working according to the flesh with a worldly method. The result of such a work will be earthen, or worldly, and wooden, that is, full of the human &ldquo;flavor.&rdquo; We need to discern the &ldquo;flavor,&rdquo; the nature. We cannot consider doctrine only; our consideration must also be based on the nature of the work. We must discern if its nature is of God. Does it contain the element of the cross, the silver of redemption, and the golden, divine element? We must also discern whether it is human, natural, and full of the element of the world.</p>
<p>In the desolation of the church, many people teach the doctrine of overcoming. However, if we make decisions based on doctrine, we will be blind and unable to obtain the blessing. With respect to ourselves, we need to care for our conscience; with respect to others, we must discern their nature. Second Timothy shows that in the desolation there are workers with different natures who use methods with different natures that produce results with different natures. Some are honorable and some are dishonorable. If we do not experience God&rsquo;s transforming work, we will not have the golden, divine nature operating within us or the dealing of the cross&rsquo;s redemption. Rather, we will merely be wooden and earthen, that is, dishonorable. If we cleanse ourselves from dishonorable vessels, we will be vessels unto honor.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Cleansed from Others<br />
Because of the Difference in Nature</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 2:21 says, &ldquo;If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor.&rdquo; <em>These</em> refers to vessels &ldquo;unto dishonor&rdquo; (v. 20). Cleansing ourselves from dishonorable vessels does not mean that we separate ourselves from those with whom we cannot have mutual understanding on doctrine. Rather, it means that once we recognize the wooden and earthen nature of dishonorable vessels, we stay away from them. We may not like the phrase <em>cleanses himself from,</em> because when we cleanse ourselves from people, we must stay away from them. However, <em>cleanses himself from</em> is the command of the Holy Spirit. Of course, keeping the oneness is also the command of the Holy Spirit, but keeping the oneness applies only to those who have the same nature that we have; we must cleanse ourselves from those of a different nature.</p>
<p>We can discern the nature of others only to the extent to which we have been transformed by the divine life. The more we are transformed, the more we will be able to see the nature of others. If we are not transformed by the divine life and have not passed through the dealing of the cross, we will not be able to discern the true nature of things, even when we touch earth and wood. Some people speak of oneness and tell others not to be divisive, but the real oneness is in the golden life and the silver redemption. The New Jerusalem is not of earth or wood; it is of pure gold.</p>
<p>God never tolerates mixture. The heavenly things are heavenly, and the earthly things are earthly. God does not mix gold and silver with wood and earth. Two kinds of seeds should not be sown together in one place, two kinds of material should not be woven into one garment, and two kinds of animals should not be bred together (Lev. 19:19). We must cleanse ourselves from dishonorable and earthly persons but not because of differences in doctrine. We should stay away from them because of a difference in nature. In the desolation of the church there are different kinds of workers with different kinds of natures and methods. If we do not allow God to work in us, we will be unable to discern the nature of the workers, because we will be the same in nature. Therefore, we must allow God to work in us and deal with us.</p>
