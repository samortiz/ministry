   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>19.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Along with the revelation concerning the overcomers, Brother Nee saw the truth concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was mainly helped by the teachings of Govett and Panton.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The truth concerning the kingdom is scriptural and deep.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Much of fundamental, traditional theology condemns the revelation of the kingdom truths.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the proper teaching of the New Testament, not all the believers will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, the thousand-year kingdom, when the Lord returns.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only the overcomers will be kings with Him in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The kingship with the Lord Jesus in the coming age will be a reward to the overcoming saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>20.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Rapture</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The revelation of the rapture goes along with the revelation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the general teaching of today's fundamental theology, people are told that the entire church will be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, according to the truth of the Scripture, this is altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we pointed out in the previous chapter, Brother Nee saw that there was a difference among the saints concerning their belief concerning the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the truth, the overcomers will be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The kingdom is a matter of reward, and rapture is a matter of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be raptured can be compared to a crop being harvested from the field.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The crop cannot be harvested when it is not ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the crop is ripe with the maturity in life, the farmer takes it from the field and puts it into the barn.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, all of us need to become ripe in life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need the maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then the Lord will harvest us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Nee saw the revelation concerning the overcomers and the kingdom as a reward to the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He also saw the truth concerning the rapture, which needs the maturity of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>21.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Spiritual Warfare</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Somewhere around 1925, Brother Nee began to see the truth concerning spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He saw God's divine purpose and that there is the need of spiritual warfare for the accomplishment of God's divine purpose in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Especially on this earth, there is a conflict, a war, between God and His enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This warfare involves all of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we take sides with Satan, we are fighting against God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we take sides with God, we are fighting against Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the overcoming saints have to realize that they are on the battlefield fighting for God's divine purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brother Nee called a conference in 1928 in Shanghai and gave a number of messages concerning spiritual warfare.</S>
