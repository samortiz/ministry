   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO THINGS IN ISAAC'S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to pay attention to two things in Isaac's life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first is Isaac's relationship with Abraham, and the second is Isaac's relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Isaac's Relationship with Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 24:36 says, "And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This son was Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Isaac means that we do not do anything ourselves or seek for anything ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Isaac is the enjoyment of everything of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everything is from the father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Unto him hath he given all that he hath."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Read 25:5 again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Isaac received nothing and acquired nothing through his own efforts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His prosperity had nothing to do with himself; it was from God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible shows us that Isaac's characteristic was to inherit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everything he had was from his father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He did not have to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His father came to Canaan; he was born in Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not have to worry about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Isaac's Relationship with God</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Isaac's relationship with Abraham was one of receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What was Isaac's relationship with God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Genesis 26:2-3 says, "And the Lord appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we stopped here, we would think that God had established a direct relationship with Isaac and had made a covenant with him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But then God clearly said, "And I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God did not bless Isaac because of himself, but because of his father Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's oath was given to Isaac's father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now God was blessing Isaac as a confirmation of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 4 says, "And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God had spoken these words to Abraham 22:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He did not give anything new to Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He gave to Isaac what He had already given to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How could all the nations of the earth be blessed?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Genesis 26:5 says "Because that Abraham"; it was not because of Isaac but because of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God says that He is first the God of Abraham and then the God of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Genesis 26:24 says, "And the Lord appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the relationship between God and Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then God said, "Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God's Word shows us clearly that Isaac's relationship with God was based on Abraham's relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God blessed Isaac because he was the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God was the God of Abraham his father.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, He blessed Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>EVERYTHING WITH ISAAC BEING RECEIVED</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From these two relationships, we can see Isaac's characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Throughout his entire life, everything he had was a matter of enjoyment and receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What does it mean to know the God of Isaac?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Knowing the God of Isaac means only one thing: knowing God as the Supplier and that everything comes from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we want to know the Father, we have to know the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to know the God of Abraham, we have to know the God of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are helpless if we only know the God of Abraham because He dwells in unapproachable light 1 Tim 6:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But thank the Lord that He is also the God of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that everything that Abraham had was Isaac's. It also means that everything comes by receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a Christian does not know the God of Isaac, he cannot go on.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a Christian does not know the meaning of Isaac, he cannot reach God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In other words, if we do not know how to receive, we will never reach God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Those who do not know Isaac can live only under Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Those who do not know Isaac in life and do not express Isaac in living possess nothing but the law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When God has a demand, they try to do it according to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When God wants something, they try to offer it according to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is not Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This kind of Christian eventually can only sigh and say, "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not" Rom 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The person in Romans 7 was willing to do good; he was very desirous of being good.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But he himself was doing the work; he did not see that God must deliver him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He did not see that everything is in Christ, and he did not see the riches God has prepared in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He did not see the inheritance in Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He did not realize that the secret to victory is in receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He did not realize that Christians are Christians by virtue of who they are; they do not act out the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He did not see that God delivers a person by giving him the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, he could only exercise his will.</S>
