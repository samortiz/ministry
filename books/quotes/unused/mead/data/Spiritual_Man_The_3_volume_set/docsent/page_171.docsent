   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONSCIENCE AND FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The following verse shows us the relationship between the conscience and man's fellowship with God in the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Heb 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If man wants to fellowship with God and "serve God," his conscience must first be cleansed by the precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because the conscience of the believer is cleansed by the Lord's blood, he is regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, according to the Bible, the cleansing by the blood and the regeneration of the spirit happen at the same instant.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The conscience must be cleansed by the blood so that a believer can obtain a new life and have his intuition quickened; then he may serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The spirit can only serve God in the intuition if the conscience receives the cleansing of the blood first.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The relationship between the conscience and the intuition cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hebrews 10:22 says, "Let us come forward to the Holy of Holies with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we come forward to God, we do not use our bodies like those in the Old Testament, because our Holy of Holies v. 19 is in the heavens; neither do we use our thoughts and feelings because these parts of the soul cannot have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only the regenerated spirit can come forward to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The believer can only worship God through his revived intuition we have said this in the past .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse of the Bible shows that washing away the offenses of the conscience is the foundation for fellowship with God in the intuition; if the conscience is conscious of any offense, there cannot be any fellowship with God in the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the conscience has any offense, a believer will spontaneously condemn himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then the intuition, which is closely knit with the conscience, is immediately affected.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The believer therefore dares not, and cannot, draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, when the believer is fellowshipping with God, there cannot be a lack of "a true heart in full assurance of faith."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once the conscience has any offense, the believer will draw near to God with reluctance and not out of a true heart; naturally, he will not be able to believe that God is for him, and that He has nothing against him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This type of self-condemnation and doubting oppresses the intuition so that it cannot freely have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The believer must not have any condemnation from the conscience at all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He should know that he has already been washed of his sins by the blood of the Lord, and that there is nothing to oppose him Rom 8:33-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A tiny offense in the conscience is sufficient to oppress, hinder, and stop the work of fellowship by the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever a believer is conscious of any sin, all of the spirit's power is concentrated on getting rid of this particular sin, and there is no strength to go outward or ascend toward heaven.</S>
