   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR ENJOYING CHRIST BY DENYING THE SELF AND EXERCISING THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 12:24-26 ENJOYING THE RICHES OF CHRIST BY THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Gospel of John shows us that God in Christ as the Spirit becomes our enjoyment and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is expressed and embodied in His Son, who is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When a thought is expressed by a word, that thought is embodied.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our word expresses our concept and is the concrete embodiment of our abstract thought.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The very God who intends to be our enjoyment as everything to us is expressed and embodied in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Son, as the Word become flesh, was God's manifestation on earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then He was crucified and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By means of His death and resurrection, He was transformed from the flesh into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , and this Spirit who gives life is the breath of life breathed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can realize, enjoy, and experience all the riches of Christ by contacting the life-giving Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Word is the definition and revelation of Christ's riches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By the Word we can know and understand them, but we still cannot realize them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can realize the riches of Christ in the Word through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Word reveals these riches to us, and by the Word we can know them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Spirit we can realize and experience them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, we first have to learn how to read and understand the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we have to learn how to realize the riches of Christ by contacting the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have merely the Word, we can have only the knowledge of the riches of Christ in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to have the realization and experience of them in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today Christ is not only the Word but also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is the Word for us to understand and the Spirit for us to realize, enjoy, and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, whatever is in the Word must be realized in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to learn how to read the Word and contact the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By the Word we can know all the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By the Spirit we can realize and experience all the riches of Christ which are revealed in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>HOW TO EXPERIENCE AND ENJOY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Gospel of John shows us that God is expressed and embodied in Christ and that Christ becomes the reality as the Spirit for us to partake of and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we need to consider the way to enjoy Christ revealed in John.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John 3:6 speaks of our regenerated spirit: "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are going to partake of and enjoy this wonderful One, our spirit has to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the initiation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>John not only shows us how God in Christ as the Spirit becomes our enjoyment but also tells us the organ we need to enjoy this One.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This organ is our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 4:23-24 says clearly that God is Spirit and that we must worship Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever He is, is in the Spirit because He is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although God is many items, He is one substance.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is light, but the substance of this light is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is life, but the substance of this life is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are going to contact Him, worship Him, enjoy Him, and experience Him, we must do this in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, our spirit must be regenerated; then we must have our spirit exercised that we may contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John 4:14 goes on to tell us that when we drink of Christ as the living water, He becomes within us a spring of water gushing up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In us, that is, in our spirit, there is Christ as the spring of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>John 7:38 says that out from the innermost being of the one who drinks of Christ will flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our innermost being is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, in the Gospel of John, the human spirit is revealed as the very organ by which we can enjoy this rich Christ.</S>
