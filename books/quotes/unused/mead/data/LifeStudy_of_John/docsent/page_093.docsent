   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Outwardly Poor and Afflicted</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Bethany means house of the poor or house of affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Outwardly, the church may be poor and afflicted.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church on earth may not be rich in material things; it should be rich with the enjoyment of the Lord in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The outward people will always look down on the church, saying that it is poor and full of affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They do not have a spirit to realize how rich we are in the enjoyment of all that the Lord is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Inwardly Feasting in and with</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>the Presence of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Inwardly, the church life is a life of feasting in and with the presence of the Lord 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord came to that house and His presence was there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the church life, the first thing we need is the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must be a people in such a position and with such a condition that the Lord can come and be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His presence means very much to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church life is a life that absolutely depends upon the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without the Lord s presence, the church life is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Inwardly, the church life is a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the church life there should always be a feast that the Lord Himself can enjoy and that His people can enjoy with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is in the church that the Lord has rest, enjoyment, and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here there is always a feast prepared for the Lord and His people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only the Lord Himself enjoys it, but all the people who are with Him enjoy it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church is a place where the Lord Himself can enjoy being with His people and where His people can enjoy being with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church is a place where the Lord and His people come together to feast with one another and to enjoy one another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No outsiders can understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No outsiders know what we are doing in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>More than twenty years ago, when I was still in Taipei, a Danish lady missionary came to have a long talk with me, asking about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She was attracted to the church but still had some problems due to the rumors.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I said to her, Sister, even if I would talk to you for days, you still could not understand what we are doing here.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The best way and the only way for you to understand what we are doing is to come here and stay for two and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Within this period of time, do not visit any other place and do not do any work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Simply stay with the sisters day and night and attend every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You must attend all the meetings big meetings, small meetings, home meetings, and hall meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Don t miss one meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In addition, you must read all the books that we have put out, more than two hundred of them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you stay two and a half years, attend all the meetings, read through all the books, I can assure you that you will be more than clear.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Dear sister, will you pay the price?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Immediately she replied, At your word I will do it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She closed her home and moved into the sisters house.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She truly kept my word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She did not go anywhere else.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She just stayed with the sisters, attended all the meetings, and read most of the books in Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In a period of time that was much shorter than two and a half years it might have been only a few months she came to me and said, Brother Lee, praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now I am clear what we are doing here.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She did not say, What you are doing here ; she said, I am now clear what we are doing here.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She also said, From today on, nothing can take me out of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She remained there a good length of time and then returned to Denmark.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She has passed through many hardships there, but nothing has taken her out of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When people look at the church outwardly, they see one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It may appear black in their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, when you get into the church inwardly, it is absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is golden yellow.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Having More Sisters Than Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As it was there in Bethany, it is better for a church to have more sisters than brothers 12:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whenever the number of sisters in a church is smaller than the number of brothers, that church may not be so living.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A living church needs to have more sisters, the more the better.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you look into a situation where the number of sisters is greater than the number of brothers, you will find that that church is living.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But when the sisters are fewer in number than the brothers, that church will not be so living.</S>
