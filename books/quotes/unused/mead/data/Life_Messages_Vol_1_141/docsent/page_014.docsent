   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO APPROACH BIBLE READING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Come to the Bible not with the purpose of understanding it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Come not even with the purpose of receiving light or the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Just come to the Bible to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, the Lord knows when, light will come, life support will come, secretly, wonderfully, even mysteriously, but not at your time and not in your way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I was young, I read a biography that said whenever So-and-so read the Bible, the letters would jump out and the light would shine brightly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I decided to practice that.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I opened the Bible, knelt down, and prayed, "Lord, enlighten Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Make some letters jump out.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Make some words stand out to me."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Day after day I prayed this way, but not one letter jumped out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They just seemed to sink deeper into the page!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In time, though, the light came and the life supply came.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In some instances it was thirty-five years later.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since coming to the United States, I have had a great deal of light that came through my reading of forty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Just come to the Bible for the sake of reading it and contacting the Lord, not for any other purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the right time comes, the Lord will give you the light or the life supply or the understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>ANSWERED PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As with reading the Bible, so with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may expect that if you pray, the Lord will surely answer immediately in your way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Well, after years and years of being a Christian, I can testify that not a single prayer has gone unanswered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every one has been answered, but not according to my way nor in my time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes I did not hear of the answers till after three, or five, or even more years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As I look back over the years, I worship the Lord that whatever I have prayed He has answered in His way and at His time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Prayer is not in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The answers will come.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the answers are secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When you pray, you touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This breathing in of the Lord is primary.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE LONG-TERM EFFECT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By taking the time, at least ten minutes a day, to read the Bible and pray, you are contacting the Lord in your spirit through the Word day by day, week after week, month after month, and year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You will be growing all the time and will be built up with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually you will know that the Christian life is just living by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In thinking, you will think by Him; in speaking, you will speak by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You will express your attitude by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He will be your life and your person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we practice this, our coming together will not be with a way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We shall come with Christ, in Christ, and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our meetings will not be something theatrical, but a living testimony of Jesus, not a performance but an actual testimony of our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is what God desires to have.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christianity has been disappointing Him in this for many centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let us receive grace and rise up to say: "Lord, here we are.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We want to satisfy You by living You out as a testimony and by coming together in You, with You, and into You."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the church life.</S>
