Regarding Alms</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Not Sounding a Trumpet</h2><p>Verse 2 says, &ldquo;When therefore you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may be glorified by men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.&rdquo; Surely the heaven-ruled spirit of the kingdom people restricts them from such fleshly boasting.</p><p>When I was in a certain denomination, the offering plate was passed during every Sunday morning service. At that time, copper coins or silver dollars were used instead of paper currency. Some people used to place their donations in the offering plate in such a way as to draw attention to themselves. That was a display of the self. Of course, they did not say anything. Rather, they dropped the coins in the plate in a noisy way. By doing this, they were sounding a trumpet before them. When the time came for public notice regarding contributions to be posted in the lobby, the one who gave the most was listed first, and the one who gave the least was listed last. If the one who had given the most had been listed last, he probably would not have given as much in the future.</p><p>For this reason, we in the churches do not keep records of the giving of the saints. The cash is put in the offering box, and there is no opportunity for the self or the flesh to be glorified. The use of checks, however, poses somewhat of a problem. In our practice of the church life in China many years ago, we did not use checks very often. But the use of checks is not a legal matter. Everything depends on our motive and our attitude. I am not saying that the saints should not use checks. The principle is that we do not give with the intention of making a show or receiving glory from man. Instead, we do everything in secret in the presence of our heavenly Father. In this matter, you know what your motive and attitude are.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Not Letting the Left Hand Know<br />the Doing of the Right</h2><p>Verse 3 says, &ldquo;But you, when you give alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing.&rdquo; This word indicates that the kingdom people&rsquo;s righteous deeds should be kept secret as much as possible. What they do in their spirit under the heavenly rule to please their Father alone must not be interfered with by their flesh lusting for man&rsquo;s glory.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Giving Alms in Secret</h2><p>In verse 4 the King said, &ldquo;So that your alms may be in secret; and your Father Who sees in secret shall repay you.&rdquo; The kingdom people&rsquo;s living is by the Father&rsquo;s divine life according to their spirit. Thus they are required to do good things in secret, not in public. Any public exhibition does not correspond to the mysterious hidden nature of the divine life.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Regarding Prayer</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Not to Make a Public Show</h2><p>In praying, as in giving alms, the kingdom people are not to make a public show. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners that they may appear to men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.&rdquo; Prayer to seek man&rsquo;s praise may gain a reward from men, but it does not receive an answer from the Father. Thus, it is vain prayer.</p><h2 class="head3">2. To Pray in Secret</h2><p>Our prayer should be in secret. In verse 6 the King decreed, &ldquo;But you, when you pray, enter into your private room, and having shut your door, pray to your Father Who is in secret, and your Father Who sees in secret shall repay you.&rdquo; The kingdom people must have some experience of prayer in their private room, contacting their heavenly Father in secret, experiencing some secret enjoyment of the Father, and receiving some secret answer from Him.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_081.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_083.html">Next</a> </body></html>
