   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE WAY FOR GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE MINGLED WITH MAN 2 THE LAW OF LIFE 1 GOD S ETERNAL PLAN, CENTRAL THOUGHT,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND ULTIMATE INTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The way for God to be mingled with us is the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is through His being life to us that God is able to mingle Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we wish to take something into us and be mingled with it, we must take that thing as our intrinsic constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may illustrate this by considering the way food becomes our constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order for our food to mingle with us, we must take it as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It must become a constituent of our physical life before it can be mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This portrays the way that God mingles Himself with us, and this mingling is the central thought of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s eternal plan, which God made in eternity past for eternity future Eph 3:9-11 , is that He might be life to us in order that He might be mingled with us as one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s thought and ultimate intention are not for us to worship Him and serve Him in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, He desires to enter into us to be life to us and to be mingled with us as one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A model and pattern of the mingling of God with man was accomplished in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jesus Christ is not only God, nor is He merely man; He is both God and man, a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus is a wonderful model of the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All genuine and true believers in Christ must be exactly the same as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is a mingling of God with man, and every Christian also must be such a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the reason that God must be life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God must live within us as our life in order that He might be mingled with us, making every one of us God-men, men who are filled with God, permeated with God, and saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may think that you should be a good man; however, God s thought is not that you should be a good man but that you should be a God-man, a man who is mingled with God as one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order for God to accomplish this, we must take God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should all realize that God has put Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Most Christians know that when we believe in the Lord Jesus, we have the eternal life John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, few realize that the divine life, the eternal life, that we received at the moment we believed in the Lord Jesus is God Himself in Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Triune God God the Father in God the Son as God the Spirit comes into us to be life to us when we believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must be clear that the life that we receive through faith in Jesus Christ is the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As believers in Christ, we now have the Triune God living within us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now that we have been regenerated and possess the life of the Triune God, we should not consider this life to be something separate from the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, we need to realize that this life is the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the Triune God is now within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although it may be difficult for you to believe that the great Triune God is in a small person such as you, you certainly have some experience of God being in you, because you have been troubled by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we have seen, the life within us, which is Christ Himself and the Triune God, is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we have this life, we have something within us shining all the time, because the life is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John 1:4 says, In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we know that we have Christ within us as life because there is something within us shining all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are not in darkness but in the light because the life which is Christ Himself is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we have Christ as life, we have the light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE LIGHT OF LIFE AND THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this chapter we will consider the matter of law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ is life, the life is the light, and the light is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Light is something that rules, controls, and regulates.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Under the light, everyone is regulated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, if the light goes out in a certain place and that place becomes full of darkness, the result will be lawlessness and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose an entire city such as San Francisco had no light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The whole city would be in darkness, and there would be much confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Where there is no light, there is no government, no rule, and no regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By this illustration we can realize how the light is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nothing is mentioned in the Scriptures concerning going to movies, nor is there any regulation in the church forbidding this; nevertheless, when young people go to the movies, they are bothered inwardly by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is because the light within them rules, and this ruling is a matter of law.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Romans 8:2 says, The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The law of the Spirit of life is simply the law of life, and the law of life is the law of Christ Gal 6:2 , which is nothing less than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The law of life is also the law of love, which is the issue and expression of the divine life 1 Cor 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The life is the Lord Jesus, the light is the Lord Jesus, the law is the Lord Jesus, and love is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, the Lord Jesus is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nevertheless, among these items there are certain differences, because Christ is one Lord with many functions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ as life has the function of shining within us to enlighten us; thus, He is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ as life has another function, that is, to regulate, rule, and control us; thus, He is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When He enlightens, He is the light, and when He rules, He is the law.</S>
