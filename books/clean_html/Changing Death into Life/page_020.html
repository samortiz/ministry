<h2 class="head1">NO JOY ON A JOYFUL DAY</h2>
<p>It was during a feast that the Lord met the man who had been sick for thirty-eight years (v. 1). A feast is a day when everyone is joyful. However, let us consider this man who was sick for thirty-eight years. On the day of a joyful feast was he joyful? His condition can be described as having no joy on a joyful day. Others might have been joyful, but he could not be joyful, because he was a sick, weak, and lonely man with a serious illness. Furthermore, his desire to be healed had not been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Many people are like the impotent man. Outwardly it is a joyful day, but inwardly they have no joy. The time is joyful, but their heart is not joyful. Their environment is joyful, but their mood is not joyful. As soon as they think of their habits or problems, they lose their joy. Their longing and desire to be freed from their habits and to be delivered from their problems have taken away their joy. Others may be joyful, but they are not joyful, because their desire has not yet been fulfilled. Some cannot be joyful at their college graduation. Some cannot be joyful at their own wedding because of their problems. People are not joyful when they are bothered by certain habits or problems.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NO REST ON THE DAY OF REST</h2>
<p>Not only was it during a feast that the Lord Jesus met this man who had been sick for thirty-eight years; it was also on the Sabbath (v. 9). This man was lying on a mat (vv. 6, 8). We should consider whether this man had peace in his heart. He was lying on his mat on the Sabbath, but he had no peace or rest in his heart. His outward environment was peaceful, but his heart was not at peace, because he had not been healed of his sickness, and his need had not been met.</p>
<p>Is this not the condition of many who are in a peaceful situation? They are lying on a spring mattress or sitting on a top quality sofa; they are supposed to be very comfortable. However, they have sins and habits that they cannot overcome; they have been sick for a long time but have not been healed. They feel comfortable outwardly, but they are miserable inwardly. Whether they are sitting or lying down, they have no peace. Regardless of the time and place, those who have sins and bad habits do not have peace. They cannot have peace, because their conscience condemns them of their sins and the habits that have entangled them. They have no peace in their conscience and no joy in their emotions. Some seem to be joyful when they sin, but they subsequently suffer great misery. A person who is involved with immoral and shameful things indulges his lust and seems to have a kind of joy. However, he is afraid that others will know what he does, so he goes against his conscience and lies. When his wife asks, &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; he dares not to tell the truth. He also does not want his children or parents to know. His outward environment may be comfortable, but he has no comfort or peace inwardly. He is a sick man. How can he have peace in his heart? Many people have this condition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN EMPTY HOPE</h2>
<p>This man, who had been sick for thirty-eight years, hoped that he could be healed in the pool (v. 7). He hoped that he would have the strength to take the way of healing in the pool. His hopes, however, were empty and not realistic, because he did not have the strength to carry out the way of healing in the pool.</p>
<p>Throughout the ages, people with bad habits or with problems have always had empty hopes; they hope to be healed by a method, and they also hope that they can carry out that method. However, every method is useless.</p>
<p>It is not easy to set aside even one cigarette. It is not easy to throw away a few drops of alcohol. It is also not easy to stop gambling or dancing. A person may succeed temporarily, but the evil demons are always, permanently, waiting for him. The cigarettes are waiting for him. Mah-jongg is waiting for him. The theaters and dance halls are also waiting for him. Often a person gets sick because he has contracted a bacterial infection. Similarly, people commit sins because they are infected with &ldquo;bacteria.&rdquo; We should not think that our sickness is solely an outward problem. Our sickness is mainly an inward problem. Sin is not only an outward problem but also an inward problem. The bacteria of lust is in us. The dance halls are waiting for us outwardly, and the dancing bacteria is seducing us inwardly. Sometimes we do not need to go to a dance hall, because we are already dancing inwardly. Those who are obsessed with playing cards sometimes talk about playing cards even in their sleep. They play cards even while they sleep. The bacteria of sin is in our being. We do not have the ability to do good, but we have the bacteria of sin. This bacteria is in us; hence, when it finds a suitable outward environment, it becomes active, and our problems resurface. Initially, a young man may be very good, but in a certain environment he may be corrupt. He becomes corrupt because all the corrupt bacteria within him have found a corrupt outward environment. The combination of the bacteria and the environment brings out his corruption. Once his corrupt nature is manifested, his problem will weaken him, and he will not have the strength to get rid of his problem. Nevertheless, the young man will continue to hope that there is a way for him to be healed and that he can carry out that way. His hopes, however, are empty and futile.</p>
