<h2 class="head1">THE FARM AND THE BUILDING</h2><p>At this point, I would like to say a further word concerning the church as God&rsquo;s farm and God&rsquo;s building. The expression &ldquo;God&rsquo;s farm&rdquo; refers mainly to the growth in life. The building, the temple, refers to the goal of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Thus, the church is the farm to produce materials so that God may fulfill His goal to have the building. First we have the farm for the growth in life, then the building for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. To be able to grasp these crucial matters is an indication that we have taken in the solid food in 3:9. Praise the Lord that the farm is for the growth in life and that the building is for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s goal!</p><p>In 3:17 Paul says that the temple of God is holy. According to the context, to be holy here is not simply to be separated to God; to be holy means not to be Greek. If we think that the word holy merely means to be separated, our understanding of this verse is too superficial and doctrinal. For the Corinthians to be separated unto God means that they are no longer Greek. In the same principle, for us to be holy, separated unto God, means that we are no longer American, Chinese, Japanese, or German. If we see this matter, it is a sign that we have received solid food from verse 17. It proves that we have grasped something experiential, practical, and deep.</p><p>To be God&rsquo;s building means that we are no longer divided or scattered. According to the context of these chapters, the building is versus division. Paul knew that the Greek believers at Corinth had been divided by their preferences. In 1:12 he says, &ldquo;Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.&rdquo; This indicates that the believers had been scattered; they were not even piled up, much less built up together to be God&rsquo;s temple. To repeat, God desires a building. God&rsquo;s goal is the building. First, He wants a farm to grow Christ, and then He wants a building.</p><p>The Corinthians did not have a building which was holy, a building which was outside Greek culture. This means that they did not have a building which was holy and indwelt by the Spirit of God, a building which contained nothing of their wisdom, philosophy, and culture. Nevertheless, God&rsquo;s goal is to have a building filled with the Spirit of God, a building of materials grown on His farm. As believers, we all must be for God&rsquo;s building.</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING MERCY TO SEE THE VISION</h2><p>When we realize our shortage concerning the growth in life and the building, we may react in a way which causes us to become even more veiled. Some may become excited, others may weep, and still others may pray or try to repent. But it is possible even for excitement, weeping, praying, and repenting to become veils. These activities may hinder us from seeing the vision of God&rsquo;s economy.</p><p>To see this vision we need God&rsquo;s mercy. In Romans 9 we have a word about God&rsquo;s mercy and, in Acts 9 an illustration of God&rsquo;s mercy. Romans 9:16 says, &ldquo;So then, it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One Who shows mercy.&rdquo; According to Acts 9, God showed mercy to Saul of Tarsus. No doubt, Saul prayed a great deal before he was saved. It is doubtful, however, that God ever answered his prayers. But one day, to Saul&rsquo;s great surprise, the Lord appeared to him. This is mercy.</p><p>We do not need to weep, pray, or repent in a religious way, but we do need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to see the vision shown to Paul. We need to see how much we are still living in our culture, tradition, and religion. We need to see that we are living in many things other than Christ and that we are not actually living Christ day by day. Yes, we have heard messages, but still we may not see the vision. Oh, we need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to see a heavenly vision! Neither our weeping nor our excitement means anything. Again I say, we need God&rsquo;s mercy. Although we should not pray in an excited way or in a religious way, we should pray earnestly for the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. Let us all pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me. I need to see the vision seen by Paul. Lord, grant me a clear sky that I may see the revelation of Your economy.&rdquo;</p>
