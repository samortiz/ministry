   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>APPRAISING HIS FORERUNNER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The questions John s disciples asked the Lord might have given the Lord s apostles a negative impression of John.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, in verses 7 through 15 the Lord publicly appraised His forerunner.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Concealed within the Lord s reply to John was an indication of John s weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, His words to the crowds concerning John testified publicly for John.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Remember that the first four disciples were brought in through John s ministry of recommendation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John had declared, Behold the Lamb of God, and John and Andrew followed the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually they brought James and Peter to the Lord as well.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, the first four disciples were brought to Christ through the ministry of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A. Not a Reed in the Wilderness</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Shaken by the Wind</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>or a Man Dressed in Soft Clothing</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His public appraisal of John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus vindicated him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 7 the Lord said, What did you go out into the wilderness to see?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A reed shaken by the wind?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A reed signifies a weak and fragile person 12:20; 1 Kings 14:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When John the Baptist was testifying for Christ in the wilderness, he was not like a reed, a weak person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, now in prison he was somewhat like a reed shaken by the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus is wise, kind, and merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we had been the Lord, we would have been offended by John.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because the Lord knew that John was somewhat weakened, He encouraged him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He seemed to be saying, John, be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It seems that you are at least somewhat weakened concerning Me. This was the meaning of the Lord s word to John.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when He spoke to the crowds and to the other disciples, He vindicated John, indicating that he was not a weak, timid person, but a strong witness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 8 the Lord asked, But what did you go out to see?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A man dressed in soft clothing?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After testifying boldly for Christ in the wilderness, John the Baptist became weak when he had been imprisoned for a time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some might think that he would desire to wear soft clothing in the houses of kings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the Lord testified that he was neither a reed shaken by the wind nor a man dressed in soft clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. Much More Than a Prophet</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 9 says, But why did you go out?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To see a prophet?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord testified that John was much more than a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was a great prophet, greater than all the prophets who had gone before him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>C. Being a Messenger</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>before the Heavenly King s Face,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Preparing the Way for Him</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John was sent by God as a messenger before Christ to prepare the way for Him 11:10 that the people might be turned to God and receive the heavenly King and the heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His ministry was to pave the way for the kingdom.</S>
