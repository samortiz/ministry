<h2 class="head1">A MEETING NEEDING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD<br />
IN ORDER TO BE STRONG, LIVING, HIGH, AND RICH</h2>
<p>We have all been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for quite some time, but we do not know how to lead the small groups. A person who receives a complete education spends a couple of years in preschool, six years in primary school, three years in junior high, another three years in high school, and then four years in college. They spend eighteen years getting an education. Many of us, however, have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery longer than eighteen years. If three of us are in a small group, we should be able to lead the meeting. After years of experience we know that in order for a meeting to be rich, strong, living, and high, there must be the Lord&rsquo;s word. Once we have the Lord&rsquo;s word, a meeting will be uplifted, living, and rich. It will not be boring.</p>
<p>In order to have the Lord&rsquo;s living word, we can use the Life-studies. Every one of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament has been opened and edited into messages. We can use one Life-study message per week in three ways. The saints can read a message in the meeting hall or at home during morning revival time. They can also read a message in the small group meeting. In addition, the main points and an outline of the same message can be released in the big meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. It may seem that we are covering only one message a week at a slow pace, but we are actually covering fifty-two messages in one year.</p>
<p>In the long run, in one year all the saints who attend the meetings, whether the big meeting or the small group meeting, will enter into fifty-two messages that are based on the Bible. In two years they will have read more than a hundred messages and in four years more than two hundred messages. Two hundred messages will produce an effect on the saints. A small group entering into the content of the Life-studies can be compared to the members of the group preparing a meal to eat, or to their speaking and listening to a message by themselves. Many points will be worked into their being through week after week of this way of accumulation. Not only will the members receive the supply, but it will also be an example for others. When the children in our homes see us get into the Life-study messages, they will do the same. The small groups are the most effective way to uphold the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SMALL GROUP<br />
HAVING THE BEST ABILITY TO INCREASE</h2>
<p>Suppose there are eight members in a small group, and they read a Life-study when they come together. Every week they can read half a message in the small group meeting and read the other half after the table meeting. After two or three months, if the number in the group increases, they can split to form a new group. In this way there will be two small groups. In the small group everyone can read, speak, and pray. If we practice this for months and years, the multiplying ability of the small group will be very high, and everyone will be strong and will know how to deal with the enemy. We all need a clear view of this goal. Practicing the small groups will bring in a great result.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with only eight persons in a small group the absence of a brother or a sister is easily noticed by others. Then some saints will go and visit the saint who was absent, and he will be strengthened. A brother who has encountered a difficult situation will be supplied when the brothers visit him. If this brother needs financial help, the brothers can put something in the offering box to render support and supply to him. The church will be built up with such mutual care and support. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day when everyone comes together, the taste of the meeting will be different. Since everyone has been built up through the fellowship in the small group and there is one accord among them, no one will be lost. Even if a person is lost, he will be recovered quickly and brought back through the timely supply. The practice of the small groups causes all the saints to have a mutual concern for others. The benefits of the small group are numerous.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;COOKING AND EATING&rdquo; IN THE SMALL GROUP</h2>
<p>We need to pay attention to several points concerning how to use the Life-studies. We should not read through a message without stopping. When we come to a crucial point, we should repeat it, and someone in the group can point out the importance. After reading the message, a brother can pray or give a testimony. Then the saints can sing a hymn. The small group should not be led by one person; everyone should function. Everyone in the small group should learn to cook, that is, to prepare food. Furthermore, we do not wait until we have finished cooking before we eat. We eat while we are cooking. The small group is a dining room as well as a kitchen. We can &ldquo;cook&rdquo; and &ldquo;eat&rdquo; there. This makes the small group full of enjoyment.</p>
<p>We need to read the important sections with emphasis. We also need to give testimonies and pray. We hope that in the small groups no one will speak too much. A person who speaks too much will become &ldquo;Mr. Do-it-all.&rdquo; The crucial points in the Life-studies need to be pointed out; the sisters can also do this. The Life-study reading, the testimonies, the singing, and the prayer make the meeting living and rich.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HEAVEN AND EARTH PASSING AWAY,<br />
BUT NOT SKIPPING THE SMALL GROUP MEETING</h2>
<p>Heaven and earth can pass away, but the small group meeting must not be skipped. We can forget about eating and sleeping, but we cannot forget about the small group meeting. If there is a meeting, none of us should miss it. If we are in a meeting, we must read something, and if we read something, we will also speak it. If we speak in the meeting, we will also pray, and if we pray, we will also give a testimony. We must consider the small group meeting to be more important than anything else. Each one of us should attend a small group meeting every week. There is no exception even if we are not feeling well. There are fifty-two weeks in a year, and the small group should meet every week. If we practice this, I guarantee that we will grow in life, and we will shine. Furthermore, we will have the rich truths to supply others at any time. In this way, the Lord will have an outlet.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYER</h2>
<p>Lord, our heart is full of joy and happiness. We praise You that You have gained us. We call heaven and earth to be our witnesses that from today onward we will praise You and pray every day. We will also attend the small group meeting every week. Lord, we pray that You will bless the small group meetings, bless everyone who attends them, and bless everyone who makes a vow in Your presence. We look forward to seeing the results of these vows in eternity. Bless all the brothers and sisters, bless their homes and their children, and bless all the young brothers and sisters with their studies and their jobs. Make us prosper materially, spiritually, and mentally so that others may see that we are Your living witnesses.</p>
<p>Lord, we want You to be expressed through us. We pray that You can have a way among us. Glorify Your name. Lord, evangelize Taiwan in five years so that every village may have the gospel and the church. May all the glory be to the One who is seated on the throne forever and ever. Amen.</p>
