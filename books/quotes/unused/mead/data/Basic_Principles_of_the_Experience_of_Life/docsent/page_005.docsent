   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE EXPERIENCES OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Gal 1:15-16a; 2:20; 4:19; Phil 1:20; Eph 4:13; Rom 8:9-11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the first chapter we saw clearly that life is the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the whole universe all the different kinds of lives are not the real lives.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are simply the types, figures, and shadows of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The real life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have also seen how God comes to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He comes firstly in Christ and secondly through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, Christ is called the life 1 John 5:12; John 11:25; 14:6 , and the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This very Spirit of life is the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, this Spirit is the Spirit of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moreover, the very Spirit of the Triune God comes into our spirit to make our spirit His residence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He dwells there, lives there, and works there, taking our human spirit as His home, His house, His residence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First John 4:13 says, "In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all know that the Holy Spirit is within us, but within what part of us does He dwell?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to locate the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 8:16 proves that the Holy Spirit today is within our spirit, taking our spirit as His abode, His residence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This verse says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be the children of God is a matter of life, which is testified by the Holy Spirit as life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This proves that the Spirit of God as the Spirit of life resides and dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our human spirit is the abode, the residence, the house, of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A rule, or principle, is that in order to have a strong ground in the Scriptures, we always need at least two verses to prove a matter, so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses we can establish it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we may also use 1 Corinthians 6:17, which says, "But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord is the Spirit, and when we join with the Lord, we become one with the Lord in spirit; we are one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This proves that the Holy Spirit is mingled together with our human spirit, and our spirit is the place where the Holy Spirit dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we can locate the Holy Spirit not only within us but also, in a very definite way, in our spirit, because He witnesses with our spirit, and we are joined to the Lord in our spirit as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In addition, Philippians 2:13 shows us that God is working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This verse says, "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Triune God who is now dwelling within us through His Spirit is working within us both to will and to do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same principle, Hebrews 13:20-21 says that the God of peace does in us that which is well pleasing in His sight.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, by these two passages alone we cannot prove that it is the Holy Spirit who is working.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this, we must use 1 John 2:27, which speaks of the anointing as the indwelling and working Spirit who abides in us and teaches us concerning all things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life dwelling in us and working within us.</S>
