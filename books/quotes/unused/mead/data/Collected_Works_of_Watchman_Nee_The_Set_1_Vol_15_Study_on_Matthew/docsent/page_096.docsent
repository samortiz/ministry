   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 39:"And they did not know that judgment was coming until the flood came and took all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Just as the situation was in the days of Noah, so it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As the flood came suddenly, so the coming of the Lord will also be sudden.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 40-41:"At that time two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"One is taken and one is left."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the reason for this verse?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to typology, all those who belonged to Noah entered into the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Will not all the saints then be raptured?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord feared that we might have this misunderstanding, so this verse was especially added.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just as it was in the days of Noah, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But there is an exception; thus, the Lord made it known here.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are three possible explanations concerning verse 40.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1 Both people refer to the Jews during that time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2 The raptured one is regenerated, whereas the one left is not regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>3 The one taken and the one left are both Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us first carefully examine the first and third explanations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If both are Jews, then the one taken would be punished, and the one left would enjoy the blessing of the kingdom on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If both are saved ones, then the one taken would enjoy glory and blessing, and the one left would go through the suffering of the great tribulation on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, we must know the meaning of being taken and being left behind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the meaning of being taken is positive, then it must be for Christians, because the rapture of Christians is a blessed matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the meaning of being taken is negative, then it must refer to the Jews, because in that case they cannot stay on this earth to enjoy the blessing of the kingdom on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word "taken" in the original language is paralambano, which means "to bring and set aside."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This word is used fifty-two times in the New Testament with a positive meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, in John 14:3 it is rendered "receive" paralambano .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord spoke of rapture in a direct way only once.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Three times the Lord "took" Peter, John, and James Mark 5:37; Matt 17:1; 26:37 , and each time was positive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Mark 5:40, "took paralambano the father of the child" is also positive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In John 1:11, "His own did not receive paralambano Him" also is positive in meaning, because if "His own" had received Him, everything would have been well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Received" in Colossians 2:6; 1 Thessalonians 4:1 and 2:13; "receiving" in Hebrews 12:28; "take" and "took" in Matthew 2:13-14; "taking" in Acts 15:39; and "took" in Acts 16:33; 23:31, etc., are all paralambano, and all have a positive meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Old Testament also this word has a positive meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"Took" in Genesis 5:24, referring to the rapture of Enoch, and "fetched" in 1 Samuel 10:23 also have positive meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we can know that those in Matthew 24:40 must be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word "left" in the Bible may also have a positive meaning Gen 32:8; Num 26:65; Isa 24:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, the word "left" has dual meanings, both good and bad.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The question is, who left them?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you are left by the devil, that is a blessing; if you are left by the Lord, that is a woe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is woe also if you are taken by the devil, but a blessing if you are taken by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In spite of this, in the Bible the word "left" has mostly a negative meaning: in 1 Samuel 17:20, "left" means "leaving," and in John 4:28 "left" means "left behind."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although there is evidence from the meaning of the word, this is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We cannot focus only on the meaning of the word; we should also take care of the context.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Matthew 24:19 indicates woe to those who are left behind and cannot escape.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The "thief" in verses 41-43 is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The things stolen are the best things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In chapter twenty-five, the virgins who are taken are the good ones; those left behind are the five foolish ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This eliminates the first explanation and limits the choice to the second and third explanations.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is not sufficient reason to say that the ones left behind are unsaved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We assert that whether they are taken or left, they all are saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The reasons are as follows: 1 "Therefore" in the phrase "watch therefore" in verse 42 shows a continuation of the preceding verses 40 and 41.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The "you" in verse 42 are the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only those who have life can be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The lifeless ones can never be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The condition for the rapture does not depend on whether or not one believes; it depends on the work after one is regenerated, not merely on the life of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Brethren say that whoever is regenerated will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is erroneous.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>2 "Your Lord" v. 42 . The unsaved one has absolutely no master/servant relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Others can use this word mistakenly, but the Lord never uses it by mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some are not yet saved, yet they consider themselves the Lord's servants; but the Bible cannot misuse the term "your Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the Old Testament, one first serves and then is rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the New Testament, first we become His children; then we serve.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>3 Verse 43 mentions the thief.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Suppose a thief comes to steal apples.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He would surely pick the ripe ones and leave the unripe ones.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is not a difference in substance but a difference in the degree of ripeness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>4 The example of the virgins in chapter twenty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The five foolish ones are not false virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They are merely not as wise as the prudent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The prudent ones were not afraid and brought oil with them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The foolish ones were lazy and did not bring oil in their vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Nevertheless, they are all virgins, and all went out to greet the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>5 As far as typology is concerned, the ones left behind also are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Enoch and Noah were both saved.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Abraham interceding before God and Lot passing through tribulation were both saved.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Elijah and Elisha were both saved.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When the Lord ascended, the disciples who were left were all saved.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Philip and the eunuch were both saved.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hence, we conclude that the "taken" ones and the "left" ones in verses 40 and 41 are all saved.</S>
