<P>In another two years, I believe the Lord will raise up a strong model in Taipei. Among the new ones recently baptized in Taipei, close to one hundred will be full-timers. Some of them told the trainees right after their baptism: "You are a full-timer saving me. I'd like to be a full-timer saving others." Do you believe that saving a person is that hard? Do we need to call a big gospel meeting and beg people to come? Do we need to have so-called feasts to invite people? Where are the people? Why would we not go to their homes and bring them "food to go"? If they come to our meeting, we owe them something, but when we go to them, they owe us something (Luke 10:7).</P><P>The Lord Jesus was not sitting in the heavens sending out invitations, inviting people to come to Him. He came down out of heaven (John 6:41) to visit Zaccheus's home (Luke 19:5). Then He said, "Salvation has come to this house" (v. 9). He went to Jacob's well, and waited for a Samaritan woman (John 4:6-7). Why would we not follow Him? Why would we just follow Christianity, set up a church building, and be one of the hierarchies, inviting people and learning to speak eloquent things to attract people? Then once they are attracted by you and come to your meetings, they become dead Christians without any function. They may only pull out their checkbook and write some checks to support you in your hierarchy. I am not only talking about Christianity but about us. I believe that after two or three years of our taking the new way, the elders who remain in the old way will be jobless. A brother who wants to be a good speaker with a congregation will not have one since the church life will be in the homes. All the elders and co-workers must learn to knock on doors! The elders must take the lead in this matter.</P><P>Due to the urgent need, we are changing the subject of our summer training of 1987 from the Life-study on Leviticus to have a training on the new way of the Lord's new move. I cannot go out to visit many places in many countries, and many saints all over the world have been stirred up to take the Lord's new way. Thus, we will have a training in the United States for ten days, and this will be recorded on video tape which will go out to all the local churches.</P><P>Eventually in the recovery, the way of Christianity with a big congregation and one gifted speaker will be completely annulled. For one to minister the Word depends upon whether he has the real burden of some of the truths from the Lord. Such a person is like Paul, who went to Troas and on the Lord's Day, after the breaking of the bread, spoke the word to build up the saints there (Acts 20:6-7). This is not like today's pastors giving sermons week by week. Some of us have been giving people messages week by week for years, but what has been the result? I would not say there is no result, but the rate of the result is too low.</P><P>We have tasted the old way, we have experienced the old way, and we have suffered from the old way Now many of us have tasted the Lord's new way, which is so sweet and so workable. What would you choose? We have been drugged without bearing fruit in the old way for years, yet we did not have any feeling about it. We came to the big meetings year after year with hardly any new ones brought to the Lord. How could we be satisfied? Let us forget about the old way. When a house gets too old, it should be condemned. You need to get a new house to replace it. I was unhappy with our low rate of increase for the last ten years, but I could not do anything. At that time I was so busy in the Life-study of the New Testament until October of 1984 when I was finally able to return to Taiwan for the sake of the Lord's new way.</P>
