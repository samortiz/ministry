   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EBBING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This means that God's life and power can ebb away in the believers' spirit like the ebbing away of the tide.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When believers are soulish, they consider it as a spiritual peak when they feel God's presence in their feelings making them feel happy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If they feel dry and restless, they think that their spiritual life is at its worst.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, this is only what they feel in their feelings; it does not reflect the real condition of their spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of course, there are times when the spiritual life is indeed low.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is different from the times when a person is in the feeling of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After a believer is filled with the Holy Spirit, he will continue to advance for a time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But soon, he will gradually have setbacks.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It will not happen suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the difference between the ebbing away in feeling and a setback in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the former case it happens suddenly; in the latter case it happens gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the latter case, a person feels that the life and power within his spirit, which he once received, have suffered a gradual setback.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At such times he loses the joy, peace, and power in the spirit that he once had.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Day by day, he becomes weaker and weaker.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Soon he feels that he has lost all taste for fellowship with God; he finds it meaningless to read the Bible, and no message or any special Scripture moves his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even if he is touched by something, it is not as intense as before.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Prayer becomes dry, tasteless, and meaningless, and he seems to have nothing to pray about.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He finds no joy in testifying, and there is no more outflow as before.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The life is not as strong as before, nor as exciting, soaring, and joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everything seems to have subsided.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is indeed ebbing and rising with the tide.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But is there an ebbing and rising in our spirit as well when it only has God's life and power?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's life does not ebb; it is forever flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His life is not like the tide of the sea which rises and falls; it is like a river which flows forever with living water John 7:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's life within us is not like the tide which must ebb after a certain time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The source of life within us is God; He never changes, and with Him there is no shadow of turning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the life in our spirit should flow unceasingly and should continue to overflow and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a believer feels that his life has ebbed away, he should realize that his life is not ebbing away; it has merely stopped flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He should realize that this ebbing is absolutely unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should never be deceived by Satan to think that as long as a man lives in his flesh, he can never again be filled with God's life continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's life is a river of living water within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If there is no hindrance, it flows on forever.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is possible for believers to have a lasting, flowing experience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Any kind of ebbing is unnecessary and abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, the question is not one of the ebbing away of the spiritual life but of doing something to make it rise again.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The present need is not a question of filling the river but one of facilitating the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The river of life remains in the believers, but it is blocked.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The inlet is still open, but the outlet is stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because there is no flow, the water of life cannot go out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As soon as the outlet is cleared, the water of life will flow out unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, a believer does not need more life but more outflow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once a believer feels that his spiritual life appears to be ebbing away, he should find out where it is blocked.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Satan will make you feel that your spiritual life has regressed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Others may feel that you have lost your spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You yourself may even think that you have committed some great sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This may be true, but it may not necessarily be true.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Actually, the real reason is that many believers do not know how to cooperate with God and fulfill God's condition for having an unceasing flow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Ignorance is the greatest cause of such a phenomenon.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, a believer should immediately pray, meditate, test, and search.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You should wait on God and ask the Spirit to reveal the reason for the "ebbing away."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You should be living and find out if you have failed to fulfill some conditions for a continual flow of the spiritual life which lead to such an "ebbing away."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not only should you acknowledge that you have setbacks an important step in itself but you should actively seek the reason for such setbacks.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although the propositions of Satan, other men, and yourself are all unreliable, they are worth some consideration because sometimes they can be true.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once you find the reason, you should immediately repudiate it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not imagine that spiritual life flows out spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you do not remove the reason for the blockage, the flow will not resume.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, every time there is a spiritual "ebbing away," we should immediately find the reason through prayer and meditation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should understand the law for God's life to flow and repudiate all the works of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do this, life will flow again, and we will be invigorated once more.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The spirit will become more powerful than before and strengthened to storm the strongholds of the enemy.</S>
