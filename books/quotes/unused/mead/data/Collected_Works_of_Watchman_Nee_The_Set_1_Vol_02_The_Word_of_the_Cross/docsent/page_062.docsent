   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LESSON TWELVE THE TWO NATURES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every Christian feels that he has two natures, but not every Christian knows the reason why.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because he does not know how to deal with this kind of experience, much sorrow and discouragement may fill his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The nature that is born of the flesh has no goodness at all; but the nature that is born of God does not commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The source and nature of the new man and the old man are opposites.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But both natures are within the Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the first man, we inherited sin, rebellion, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From the second man, we inherited righteousness, obedience, and life Rom 5:17-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The old man: "The flesh" John 3:6 "Your father the devil" John 8:44 "The heart is deceitful" Jer 17:9 "Cannot please God" Rom 8:7-8</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The best moralists, the most devoted religionists, and the most compassionate, charitable people are far away from God and from eternal life unless they are born again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are the same as the tax collectors and harlots.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without being born again, one cannot please God, because his heart is deceitful and his father is the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The new man: "Born of the Spirit" John 3:5-6 "New man" Eph 4:24 "A new creation" 2 Cor 5:17 "Begotten...of God" John 1:11-13 The new man is Christ living within you: "Christ in you" Col 1:27 "Christ our life" Col 3:3-4 "Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20 The battle:</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The new nature and the old nature are archenemies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Both of them want to dominate completely.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The old nature has its power and its will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The battle between these two natures is very severe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, many young believers doubt their regeneration to the point that they are completely disappointed Rom 7:14-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How should we deal with our old nature?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"Cast out" Gal 4:22-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The victory three ways: On the negative side: "Crucified with Christ" Gal 2:20; 5:24 "Reckon...to be dead" Rom 6:11 On the positive side: "Walk by the Spirit" Gal 5:16 "Walk by the Spirit" Gal 5:25 On the negative and positive side: "Put to death...you will live" Rom 8:13 The way to overcome is not by self-discipline or self-imposition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The way to overcome the old nature is 1 by the cross of the Lord, acknowledging that the self is dead already, 2 by following the leading of the Holy Spirit in all our endeavors, and 3 by allowing the Holy Spirit and the cross to work together to put the old man to death.</S>
