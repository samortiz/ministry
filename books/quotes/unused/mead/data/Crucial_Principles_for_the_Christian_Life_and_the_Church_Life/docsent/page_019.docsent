   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENJOYING CHRIST AS THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is crucial to see the way to enjoy our wonderful Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Corinthians 15:45b says that He became a life-giving Spirit, and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, The Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word for spirit in these verses is pneuma, which can be translated breath, air, or spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today the wonderful, mysterious, all-inclusive Christ has become the life-giving pneuma, that is, the life-giving air, the life-giving breath.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Air does not need to be purchased, cooked, or prepared in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Air is always available and easy to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The wonderful, mysterious, profound, and all-inclusive Christ is impossible to fully comprehend but easy to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do not need knowledge to enjoy Christ as the life-giving air.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the life-giving Spirit, Christ is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second Timothy 4:22 says, The Lord be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is available and near; He is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to contact Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 8:4 says that we need to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To walk means to have our being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather than arguing about whether we should attend movies or athletic activities, we should simply walk according to the spirit moment by moment and day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am confident that the spirit will never direct us to a worldly activity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should have our being according to the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit becomes the anointing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to walk according to this anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While we are speaking, the anointing may restrict us from saying something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should speak only from the spirit and according to the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This should be the principle of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we talk to our spouse, we should do so according to the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we try to argue according to the anointing, we will have nothing to say because the anointing will not lead us that way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>TO EXHIBIT CHRIST IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To daily and hourly walk and have our being according to the inner anointing is to walk and have our being by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is in this way that we live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Christ thus becomes our practical daily living, living Christ will not be a doctrine to us but will be our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, if we walk and have our being according to the spirit until Christ becomes our daily living, we will come to the meetings with something of Christ to share and release to all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The meetings will be rich and genuine, an exhibition of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes our meetings are a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we quarrel with someone before the meeting, we are performing when we come to the meeting and say, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The angels will know that we are acting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This makes the meeting hall a theater.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes our activities in the meetings are theatrical performances; they are not real.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To simply shout is not real.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The meetings should be a genuine exhibition of our daily life, a window to allow others to see what kind of life we live.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the way to have proper meetings of the church and the way to have a genuine practice of the church that is altogether Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is the church; therefore, Christ should be our daily living and our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should meet not only in Christ and for Christ but also with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our meetings should exhibit Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ should be the unique constituent of the church, our daily life, and the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the first basic truth in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This truth should be a vision to all of us that controls our concept concerning the church, our daily living, and the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church, our daily living, and the meetings should all be Christ in a practical way.</S>
