   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BE HUMBLED UNDER THE MIGHTY HAND OF GOD THAT HE MAY EXALT YOU IN DUE TIME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 6 says, Be humbled under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in due time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 5 and 6 both concern humility.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to humble ourselves because pride frustrates God s grace from coming to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are humbled, God will exalt us in due time, in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 1 and 4 also allude to the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The present age is not the time to be exalted but the time to be humbled.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>CASTING ALL YOUR ANXIETY ON HIM</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>BECAUSE IT MATTERS TO HIM CONCERNING YOU</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 7 says, Casting all your anxiety on Him because it matters to Him concerning you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because this verse is often quoted out of context, we need to see that it continues the thought in the foregoing verses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, the anxiety mentioned in this verse is the anxiety that should come from our concern for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As elders, we should not be anxious for our possessions or family, but we must be concerned for the church and the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not be indifferent to the condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There should be times when we are so burdened and anxious for the church that we cannot sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At such times, we need to learn to cast all our anxiety for the church on the Lord because He cares for the church and the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 2 Corinthians 11:28 Paul writes, There is this: the crowd of cares pressing upon me daily, the anxious concern for all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul probably had no anxiety other than his concern for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The elders should follow this pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Question: When the saints come to the elders for advice concerning a practical situation, how should we help them without lording it over them?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Answer: For an elder to rule or lord it over others is easy, spontaneous, and natural; for an elder not to rule is quite difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I recently noticed that even my young granddaughter likes to rule over others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everyone s natural man likes to rule as a king.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, when a brother becomes an elder, his natural tendency is to try to rule over the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is true even for those who are not ambitious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to fight the battle to resist this tendency.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter uses strong words and expressions concerning the elders not lording it over their allotments and girding themselves with humility.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who are natural may be offended by these words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a shame if elders behave like kings and treat the saints as their servants.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As an elder, we must consider ourselves as the servant of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The elders should serve the church as martyrs who are ready to give their life for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not be judges.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must love and care for the saints as fathers love their children and as shepherds care for their flocks.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must drop all the natural concepts, practices, and tendencies and see the light that there is no rank in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The elders serve the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They love and care for the church with an anxious concern for the church s condition and the saints growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, they also need to cast this anxiety on the Lord, trusting in Him because He cares for the church and the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Question: How should we apply this word in our localities?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Answer: The leading ones in each locality should fellowship and pray together.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The advance of the Lord s recovery can be greatly frustrated or greatly helped by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The apostles are important, but the Lord s move depends more on the elders because the elders are the ones directly responsible for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The proper eldership is necessary for the Lord to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Practically speaking, God s economy depends on the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even when God spoke to Israel in the Old Testament time, He often spoke directly to the elders cf.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Jer 29:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The apostle Paul called for and spoke to the elders of the church in Ephesus because the condition of the church in Ephesus depended largely on the elders Acts 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, the elders in the churches today should spend time to fellowship and pray together concerning their view of the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our concept is the basic factor.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If our concept is proper, everything will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The New Testament mentions the elders and deacons but does not give detailed instructions concerning the administration of such ones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>An overly strong church administration may eliminate the serving ones seeking the spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First Timothy 3:1-13 and 1 Peter 5:1-7 concern the life of the serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, to be an elder or deacon is not mainly a matter of administration but a matter of having a proper life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although my practice is not to propose anything to the churches, when the church in Anaheim moved into a new building in 1976, I asked the brothers to do away with the service groups, because I saw that a hierarchy was being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The service of the church should not depend on the organization of such service groups.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When I visited the church in Taipei in the past and saw many different forms in the service office, I asked the elders to destroy those forms.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When I went to Taipei in 1975, I saw that many of the elders, deacons, deaconesses, and leaders of the home meetings were not active in their service but merely occupying administrative positions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I showed them that over a period of twenty-five years an organizational administration had gradually accumulated and pushed out the spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I suggested that many should drop their administrative positions and spend more time to seek the Lord in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hundreds resigned, and many were happy to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some felt awkward at first because their position had become a crutch.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, when I visited again in 1977, the situation was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Nevertheless, I am concerned that an unnecessarily large administration may gradually return.</S>
