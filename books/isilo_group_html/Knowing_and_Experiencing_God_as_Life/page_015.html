<h1 class="title">LIVING BY THE INNER OPERATION<br />
OF THE RESURRECTION LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:7, 20; Phil. 3:10; Col. 1:28-29</h1>
<p>The basic matter in God&rsquo;s work is His intention to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life. Christianity, however, has lost this basic matter. Without knowing God as life, Christianity is only a religion. When Christianity lost the truth of God as life, it transmuted into a religion.</p>
<p>God does not intend for us to be adherents of a religion. He desires that we receive Christ into us as life so that we may become people who receive Christ as life and let Christ live out of us. Hence, we do not proclaim a religion; we proclaim Christ. According to the Bible, Christ is not only the Redeemer; He is also life. Christ is our Redeemer so that He may be our life. His being our Redeemer is but a procedure; His purpose is to be our life. He accomplished redemption for us, as fallen sinners, so that we would be His vessels and that He would be our life and live in us. This is God&rsquo;s intention. When God achieves this, His heart&rsquo;s desire will be fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD AS LIFE BEING A GREAT MYSTERY</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s children have never regarded the matter of God as life in a serious way. This is a problem. For more than ten years after I was saved, I did not understand that God is my life. Many good things have distracted God&rsquo;s children from this matter. The Triune God is great and infinite, but He desires to dwell in our human spirit. He also wants all that He is to be in us as our life. The divine life is beyond our comprehension; it is a mysterious matter.</p>
<p>A seed is small and insignificant. When it is cut open, it looks so ordinary that it is hard to believe that there could be anything mysterious in it. However, when the seed is planted in the soil, all that is contained in the seed will gradually grow forth. A small seed can eventually grow into a tall tree. A seed can at least grow to be a sizable plant with green leaves, flowers, and even abundant fruit. Without these various outward expressions, no one would believe that so much is contained in a small seed.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is difficult to gain a thorough knowledge of the mysterious divine life. We can sense that we are sinful; hence, we understand that the Lord Jesus bore our sins on the cross. We have repented, believed in the Lord, and are now saved; hence, we have peace and joy. We are clear concerning these things. However, we do not have much feeling concerning the Triune God entering into our spirit to be our life. This seems to be a light and ordinary matter.</p>
<p>All the riches of God, His fullness, dwell in Christ the Son bodily, and Christ the Lord is now the Spirit (Col. 2:9; 2 Cor. 3:17). This Spirit entered into us when we believed in the Lord Jesus. We did not receive a part of the Spirit. Rather, He entered into us as the complete Triune God. Hence, just as the Triune God is rich in Himself, He is rich in us. We do not have only a portion of His riches. If we could see the riches of this treasure in us, we would experience joy unspeakable.</p>
<p>When I was in Tientsin in 1936, the Lord pointed out to me that He is the same in me as He is in Himself; there is no difference. The God in me is the complete God; He is not lacking anything. When I saw this fact, I was beside myself. I wanted to tell everyone, &ldquo;Come and see! Here is a man who has God in him. The complete God dwells in me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to see the treasure that we received when we were saved. This treasure is God with all His riches. This treasure is God with His experiences of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, death, resurrection, ascension, becoming the life-giving Spirit, entering into man, and bringing man into God. The fullness of the Godhead with all these experiences entered into us as the Holy Spirit to be our life. When we see this, we will be overjoyed.</p>
<p>One evening in the summer of 1932, before the first church in northern China was raised up, a Christian visited me, and we talked about many matters. As we walked and talked, we came to the seashore and talked about baptism. I quoted several verses to show him what the Bible says concerning baptism. When it became late and I suggested that we go home, he held my hand and said, &ldquo;You cannot go home now. You must baptize me in the sea.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am neither a pastor nor a preacher. I am just a young man in my twenties. How can I baptize you?&rdquo; He held on to me and said, &ldquo;You are all words with no action. You just told me the kind of people who are qualified to be baptized and the kind of people who can baptize others. Please consider whether you are qualified. I will let you go home, if you say that you are not qualified. Otherwise, you must baptize me tonight.&rdquo; Hence, we knelt down there at the beach and prayed. After we prayed, we went into the water, and I baptized him. When he came out of the water, his joy was beyond description. The next day when he saw me, he said that he was so happy he could not sleep.</p>
<p>If every believer saw what he received at the time of his salvation, he would be beside himself with joy. We received the rich and glorious Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Very few believers experience this kind of joy when they are saved. Usually believers know that their sins have been forgiven and that God loves them. They might say, &ldquo;I was a prodigal son, but He found me and brought me home. I deserved death; I was going to hell, but He rescued me.&rdquo; We have heard such testimonies from many brothers and sisters after their salvation. However, they did not see the treasure that they have received when they were saved. What they saw was merely a shell, the covering of the treasure.</p>
<p>Precious jewelry is sold in a beautifully decorated box. A child would rather have the beautiful box than the treasure in the box, because he is confused and does not know what is precious. Many believers are just as confused as a child with a box. They do not have much feeling related to the treasure within them. They sense only that their sins have been forgiven and that they will not perish in the future. Little do they realize that this is merely the shell of their salvation. In God&rsquo;s salvation He Himself is the center. God, with all that He is, is salvation. When we receive His salvation, we receive God. Salvation is precious, but God is even more precious. As believers, we all must see this.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Knowing and Experiencing God as Life &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
