   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Lord's Recovery CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE ONENESS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 4:1-6, 13; Acts 8:1a, 13a; Rev 1:11; John 17:6-24; Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; 5:12; 15:25; Rom 15:6; Gal 5:20b-21a; 1 Cor 1:10-13a; 3:3-4; 11:17-20; 1 John 2:22; 4:2-4; 2 John 7, 9-11; 2 Pet 2:1; Rom 16:17; Titus 3:10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this series of messages, we want to see the crucial points in the practice of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many of us have been brought into the Lord's recovery, but we may not have an adequate realization of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why I am burdened to cover all the crucial points in the practical working out of the Lord's recovery, which I call the practice in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first basic item we need to know is the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I hope that we can spend some time to dive into all the basic points covered in this message with the accompanying outline and Scripture references.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do this, we will have a thorough realization of the crucial need of the oneness of the Body of Christ in the practice of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I. THE UNIQUENESS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST A. One Body in the Universe</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Body of Christ is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the whole universe there is just one Body of Christ Eph 4:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church as the Body of Christ is also God's family, God's house Eph 2:19; 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As God's family, as the house of God, the church is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, the church as the Body of Christ is the wife of Christ Eph 5:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For a man to have two wives or two families is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our Lord has only one Body, one family, one household which is His home, and one wife.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is one Body in the universe, and this Body is the new man Eph 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This truth abolishes all the differences among us, making us one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Christ and in the Body life, there are no racial differences.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, Christ is all the members and in all the members Col 3:11; 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>B. One Church in One City</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The oneness of the Body of Christ is kept and expressed by each local church in its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the practice of the church life, there is only one church in one city Acts 8:1a; 13:1a; Rev 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The local churches are the local expressions of the one Body of Christ in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There should not be more than one local expression of the one Body of Christ in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE BASE OF THE ONENESS OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we need to see the base of the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This base is of four items: the seven factors of our Christian faith, the oneness of the Spirit, the oneness of the divine Trinity, and the oneness for which the Lord prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A. The Seven Factors of Our Christian Faith</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The base of the oneness of the church is firstly the seven factors of our Christian faith Eph 4:4-6, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Ephesians 4:4-6 Paul presents these seven factors, which are seven "ones."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then in verse 13 he says that we believers need to be perfected until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This shows that the seven "ones" listed in verses 4 through 6 are the seven factors of our Christian faith.</S>
