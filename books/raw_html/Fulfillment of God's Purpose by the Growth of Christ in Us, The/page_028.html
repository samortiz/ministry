<P>The brothers should be the same. Some brothers testify in the meetings in a dying way. They are not living and exercised in the spirit. Other brothers are so naturally bold. When they shout, "Hallelujah," this is in the flesh, not in the spirit. We need the growth in life to make us solid and precious material for God's building. Life grows, life transforms, and life produces the precious material. We should not excuse ourselves by saying that we are timid by nature. There is no excuse, because the church is God's farm and we are under the planting and watering. We are now growing so that we might be transformed into precious material.</P><P>Through all of our experience, we have learned that no human being is trustworthy. This is because every human being was made of clay and is a piece of clay. When the clay is dry, it seems solid. But when water is poured upon it, it dissolves. Not one human being is a piece of solid stone. Therefore, we are not trustworthy. We cannot trust in a piece of clay, so we need the transformation.</P><P>When Simon came to the Lord, the Lord immediately changed his name to Peter, which means "a stone" (John 1:42). He would no longer be Simon, but Peter, a stone for the building up of the church. Have you ever seen a building with two columns of clay to support the building? Of course not. Any piece of clay is not trustworthy. In my early years, I had complete trust in every brother. Eventually, I learned the lesson that no human being is trustworthy. This is why we need transformation by the growth in life. The church as the house of God is built not with the pieces of clay but with pieces of stone. How strong a local church is depends upon how much transformation has been produced.</P><P>It is not just a matter of saying we love one another and of embracing one another. We need the transformation. Without transformation, we may embrace one another today, but later we may criticize and condemn one another. I am happy to see the young people seeking the Lord, but I am waiting to see something more. I want to see how much transformation can be carried out. This is the need. The church needs the solid building, not anything of mere emotional affection, but something solid in God's transformation with all the fullness of the Godhead. The nature of the Father has to be built into us, the redeeming work of the Son has to be wrought into our nature, and the transforming work of the Holy Spirit has to be accomplished within our whole being. Then we become solid and trustworthy. Then God can put His trust in us because through His transformation we have become the material for the building up of the church.</P><P>This is why I have always said that you can never build up a local church by your teaching, by your doctrine. The local church can be built up only by the transforming life. What we need is to minister life to people, and this life will carry out the transforming work. Then this transforming work will produce the real, solid, precious material for the building up of the church.</P><P>I am happy and thankful to the Lord that within these past years, I have seen the growth of many saints. In this growth I have also seen the transforming work of the Holy Spirit. When the saints in a local church have experienced a good measure of transformation, that church becomes very solid and can stand against any kind of storm. Nothing of our human nature, nothing natural, is good for the building up of the church. The building material must be of the Father's nature, of the Son's redeeming work, and of the Spirit's transforming work. We all need to be renewed and transformed. The Lord is moving on to do the building work among us.</P><P>In 1 Corinthians 3 there are the planting and the watering for the growth, and the growth is for the producing of precious material for the building. So on the one hand, we are the farm, and on the other hand, we are the building. The farm is for the growth, and the growth is for the building. Thus, the farm is for the building. The church is a farm to grow Christ so that precious material might be produced for God's building. For this building, we need the growth of life.</P>
