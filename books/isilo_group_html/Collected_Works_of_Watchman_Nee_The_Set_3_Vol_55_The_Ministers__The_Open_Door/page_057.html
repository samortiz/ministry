After man fell, God's ordination was that man would eat bread in the sweat of his face. Later Abel was a herdsmen, and Cain was a farmer. As the human race multiplied, different skilled tradesmen developed. Later, men like Abraham, Jacob, and the Israelites were either farmers or herdsmen. This shows us that God's desire is for man to be in a farming or ranching profession. We should produce things by our hand.</p><p>In the New Testament the Lord often gave parables about sowers and shepherds. Most of the twelve apostles were fishermen. Paul was a maker of tents, and Luke was a doctor. These all show us the following basic principle: Production through labor increases the quantity or value of the commodity. It takes things from nature and adds labor and strength to give them value. Farming and ranching increase the quantity of a commodity. Tent making increases the value of a commodity. Laboring and practicing medicine require effort and time for wages. A proper occupation for a Christian must be one which requires labor and is productive.</p><p>Everyone knows that commerce comes from Satan&mdash;it begins in Tyre and culminates in Babylon (Ezek. 28; Rev. 18). Its end is judgment and condemnation. Therefore, Christians should not be engaged in pure commerce. Buying and selling which does not increase the quantity or value of the commodity but only makes a profit through the trade is pure commerce. Pure commerce has only one thought in mind&mdash;making money off of people. Thus, it is easy to become evil in heart and in practice. It is not easy to be delivered from money, either. If we want to serve God, we cannot engage in such professions.</p><p>We must see that a producer takes something from nature, not from man. A laborer does not take anything from nature, nor does he take anything from man. A person engaged in commerce, however, does not take anything from nature, but takes from man. Our principle is that we must expend energy to earn money. We must increase in physical riches, not in money. Therefore, we hope that the brothers and sisters would do their best to avoid engaging in pure commerce and to find occupations that require labor in production.&mdash;Selected</p><ol class="bullet"><li><a class="text" target="_blank" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/cw-55/map7.pdf">A Map of the Churches in Hopeh and Honan</a></li></ol><h2 class="head1">THE MINISTERS</h2><p>NATURE:To show the way to serve, to help the serving ones and the churches in the different localities go on, and to solve problems related to the ministry.</p><p>FREQUENCY:We publish irregularly.
