<p class="bold">WEEK 14 — DAY 3</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 18:21-27</h2><p class="bold">21 &nbsp;Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?</p><p class="bold">22 &nbsp;Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven.</p> <p>23 &nbsp;For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who desired to <sup>1</sup>settle accounts with his slaves.</p><p>24 &nbsp;And when he began to settle them, one who owed him <sup>1</sup>ten thousand talents was brought to him.</p> <p>25 But since he did not have the means to repay, the master commanded him to be sold, as well as his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made.</p><p class="bold">26 &nbsp;Then the slave fell down and worshipped him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you all.</p> <p class="bold">27 &nbsp;And the master of that slave was moved with compassion and released him and <sup>1</sup>forgave him the loan.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>When most Christians read Matthew, they do not realize that this book deals not only with the doctrine of the kingdom, but with the practical kingdom life.</p><p>In order to remain in the kingdom life, we must have humility. If we have humility, we shall neither offend others nor be offended by others. We shall neither stumble others nor be stumbled by them.…We need to hate pride and treat it as a “gopher” that must be killed. Otherwise, the “gopher” of pride will ruin the kingdom life.</p><p>In chapter eighteen we see how to deal with someone who offends others.…It is also a word indicating that it is a serious matter to offend others. The seriousness of this is shown by the danger of being cut off from the fellowship of the church. To be cut off from the fellowship of the church means to be put out of the kingdom life. This is serious.</p><p>In the Lord’s word about dealing with an offending brother, the authority of the kingdom is involved. Verse 18 says, “Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven.”…If you consider verse 18 in its context, you will realize that it is not an insignificant matter to rebel against the church. The church simply follows the heavens to bind what the heavens have already bound. The church’s binding is the execution of the heavens’ binding.…The same is true regarding repentance.…If you repent to the church, the heavens will immediately loose you, and then the church will loose what has been loosed in the heavens.</p><p>After listening to the Lord’s word about the kingdom life, Peter asked Him a question: “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?” (v. 21).…“Jesus said to him,…Up to seventy times seven” [v. 22]. Seventy times seven means that we must forgive others an unlimited number of times. There is no need to count or keep a record of the number of times you forgive others. Over and over and over, you need to forgive them. In verses 23 through 35 the Lord gives a parable as an illustration.…According to the context of this parable, the settling of accounts here refers to the Lord’s dealing with us in this age through such things as severe illness or certain extreme hardships which cause us to realize how much we owe the Lord and to beg Him to forgive us.

This refers to the heavy debt of our sins against the Lord accumulated after we are saved.</p><p>27<sup>1</sup> This refers to the forgiveness of our debts incurred after we are saved and become slaves of the Lord.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 613-616; Hymns: #942</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
