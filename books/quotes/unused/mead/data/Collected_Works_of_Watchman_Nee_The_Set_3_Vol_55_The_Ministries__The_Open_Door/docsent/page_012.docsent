   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lessons Learned in Siying</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In observing the children of God in Siying, I became conscious of the need to submit to the divine life and the importance of position and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If this matter is not upheld, the church will be in confusion, and nothing will be proper or orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I was in Shanghai, often I was unwilling to submit to the older saints, and I was full of my own opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This greatly damaged the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>May God and you forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I first came here, I was too "democratic"; I allowed the brothers to touch the affairs of the church too loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thank God that my error has been exposed through practical lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because some brothers knew too much about the matters in God's house, they became proud and had a bad attitude about receiving teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This confirms the word in 1 Timothy 3:6.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You did not tell me much about church affairs when I was about to leave Shanghai; I realize now that this was really wise.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some brothers and sisters do not have a heart for God because they have received too little grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I meet this kind of person, my heart aches to the extent that I cannot say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I dare not speak, and my attitude appears cold and hard.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When others see me, they think that I am proud or that I do not want to speak with them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am really in a dilemma and do not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The senior Brother Chao once said to me that when Brother Witness gives a message, his words are strong and severe, but once he steps down from the platform, he is very open to receive the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I also remember that Brother Witness once told me that when one stands on the platform, he must be faithful to speak God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He should not be indecisive just because his brothers are sitting in the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in his daily life, he must treat the brothers in a way they can bear.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sister Peace Wang also said in her letter that we should not be hasty in dealing with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The warm sun can cause dead branches to fall away.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I stood on the platform, I spoke a heavy word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many brothers could not take it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some were even repulsed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I fear that they did not have enough grace, even though they understood what was spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Consequently, they could not stand it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the platform I rebuked the brothers for loving the world, and they felt that my standard was too high.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They were unwilling to receive the word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet I did not have the peace unless I released this word, and I had nothing else to speak other than this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This past Lord's Day, we had a baptism at the beach.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Six people were baptized three brothers, two wives, and an elementary school student.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A month before Brother Yen came, two brothers were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That evening we had the first Lord's table meeting with ten people in attendance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All were brothers and sisters who had been baptized among us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who had asked to be baptized spoke with us, the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They were accepted only after we consented.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There were a few friends we felt that we could not accept, and we refused to baptize them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We prefer to be very strict in order to preserve the holiness of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do not baptize or accept people into the Lord's table meeting loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The following week, we had four days of gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because there were a limited number of brothers, we could only do what our strength permitted.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I dared not be too hopeful that many brothers would come into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I only hoped to make one payment on my debt of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a result of this gospel preaching, I hoped our living before our colleagues would be dealt with more and that we would not be so loose.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I always feel that our immediate colleagues are the best candidates for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If this barrier is not broken down, we cannot hope to save friends outside of our office.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Oh, this is difficult because we must fight with all our strength and give up our rights.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are a few brothers here who are willing to be in one accord with me and to die to mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are willing to give up all the money that passes into their hands for the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Apart from their individual need for food, they give their entire salaries to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church has all kinds of needs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some of my colleagues have seen this and think that I am drawing two salaries!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One from the church!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can all live in the dormitories provided by the company, but for the sake of having a place to meet, we would rather rent a house and cook for ourselves after work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One brother is physically weak and is temporarily convalescing in this house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He cooks meals so that a meal is ready when we come home.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Brother Yen also lived in this house of God while he was in Zhan-Jiang, and he ate with us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He was very touched to see the brothers giving their all to maintain this house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Presently, the coordination is still not perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Several of the brothers are still single, and some of the wives who believe in the Lord still have unbelieving husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If an entire family of believers in the Lord could migrate here, the church of God could increase more quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the beginning we met in the home of a married sister, and her eighth-grade daughter's heart was for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>She often brought many of her female classmates to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As a result, several of these classmates believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because we are too young, we are wary of being stumbled on account of the opposite sex, and we stopped our work among the girls after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I hope that a married sister can migrate to Siying in the future to continue this work.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I have gradually come to feel that the hardest kind of people to work with are those who have been in Christianity for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This work invites many false accusations.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is better and easier to speak to friends who have never heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I have not yet purchased the concordance written by Cruden, but I am still reading the Bible according to Brother Witness's "rote memorization" method.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I hope to memorize every chapter in the New Testament and read the Old Testament through one or two times first.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is very difficult to memorize the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I often read a chapter more than ten times without being able to find its central thought.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is also difficult to find the connection between chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The order of events recorded in the four Gospels is mixed up.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I really do not know what is the best way to study.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I will be finished with my internship at the end of this month.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I hope to be able to spend more time studying the Bible and only a small amount of time reviewing homework connected with the Railway Department.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I have noted the things in a letter sent to me by Sister Peace Wang.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>She said that we should strike a balance between work and study.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the past I worked too much and did not study enough.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A young brother should spend more time on studying.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Therefore, we would rather curtail our work and spend more time on studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I do not know if I am right in doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The customs officers here Leichow Customs Office are transferred often.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Would the brothers who are customs officers in the Shanghai Office be willing to apply for a transfer to the south?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The brothers and sisters in the churches in Hong Kong and Canton are too busy taking care of their own affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I do not expect any of them to migrate to Siying and can only wait for the brothers and sisters from Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Pao-sheng</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>April 9, 1948</S>
