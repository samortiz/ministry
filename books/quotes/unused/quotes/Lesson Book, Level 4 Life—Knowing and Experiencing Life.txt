We may live a Christian life according to all God demands and fulfill God's purpose, because this life is capable
It also bears fruit according to John 15, that is, to dispense this life into others through the preaching of the gospel
Since this life is so wonderful and crucial to us Christians, we must endeavor to maintain and preserve this life at all cost
We also must apply all the life practices such as calling on the Lord, reading the word, praying, pray-reading, singing, fellowshipping, etc
We must see that life is not something that is merely of God or that is given by God, but that it is God Himself
It is not sufficient merely to know that we have life; we must know further that this life we have is God Himself
It is not sufficient only to know that we should live out life; we must also know that the life we should live out is God Himself
We would not walk in darkness and do the hidden things of shame ; rather we would walk in the light as He is in the light
In verses 16 and 17 the Lord referred to the Holy Spirit as 'He,' but in verse 18, He changed the pronoun from 'He'' to 'I'
These two passages therefore show us that it is by God being in Him and Him being the Holy Spirit that He is life
In His resurrection, He became a life-giving Spirit; therefore, all that Christ has received from the Father is now in the Spirit
On that day, Adam, deceived as he was by Satan, ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Through Adam's sinful act in the garden of Eden, we all were injected with the evil life of Satan into our flesh
We are more complicated than the unbelievers, because they only have two lives, but we have three-man's, Satan's and God's
Although the law of God is good, it has no power to help us to be good, because it was weakened by the flesh of sin
The law of good wills to practice according to the law of God , agrees with the law of God and delights in the law of God
After we have believed in the Lord and received His life into our spirit, we have the strongest life with the strongest law in the universe
Every day, from morning to evening, we may be filled with the Spirit and live by the Spirit to overcome the evil life of Satan in our flesh
There is no need for a farmer to teach a peach tree, saying, 'Little peach tree, you must know my desire is that you produce peaches
In like manner, a cat catches mice because in its life is the mouse-catching law, and a dog barks because in its life is the barking law
On the positive side, the law of life shapes us, that is, conforms us to the image of Christ, who is the image of the invisible God
There is only the divine life with the divine nature and the divine law which shapes us and conforms us to the image of Christ
As life grows, its law works, not mainly to regulate or correct us, but to shape us, to conform us to the image of the Firstborn Son of God
And in John 8:12 Jesus said, 'I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but have the light of life'
The Word of God we speak of here does not refer to the written word in the Bible, but to the word the Holy Spirit speaks to us from within
Such a Word, composed of mere fixed letters, does not have the power of shining light and cannot be light to us
In the old creation God commanded the light to shine outwardly, but in the new creation, God Himself has shined into our hearts
When we talk about light, we are not talking about the light outside of us, but we are speaking of God as light shining inside of us
If we do not want the shining, we ignore it or argue with it, but as we accept and receive the shining, we are enlightened
If our heart is distracted by other things, we enter into darkness and we may do things against the Lord and not express Him
If we learn to experience life by the light, that we will grow up into Christ in all things, and God will be expressed through us
Nearly all religions, ethical teachings, as well as psychiatrists try to help people to improve their behavior
After seeing that growth of life is the increase of God and the decrease of ourselves in us, we must find out how to grow in life
An experience which results from God passing through man and man passing through Him is considered an experience of life
It is not that we detect our own fault, but rather, when we draw near to God, we are inwardly met by God, and thereby we see our own fault
All experiences of life are from God and are His working within us; therefore they can cause us to touch God and experience Him
To experience Christ is to let Christ live both within us and out from us; to take Christ as life and thus to live by Christ
To experience Christ means that all our living and actions are Christ Himself living out and acting out from us
As the experience of life is the experience of God and Christ, so also is it the experience of the Holy Spirit
It is this Holy Spirit of life who leads us to put to death the evil deeds of the body, and it is this Holy Spirit of life who prays in us
God's purpose for us human beings is that we may obtain His uncreated life and be transformed into His image to be like Him, as He is
If God desired man to be only a good man, and man had not fallen and been corrupted, he would not need to be regenerated
God's desire is not that man should be only a good man, but, much more, a GOD-man, one who is the same as He is
In brief, to be regenerated is to be born once again, to be born of God , or, apart from our original human life to obtain God's life
Originally we were born of our parents; but now we are born once more, this time of God; hence, this experience is called being born again
Being born of our parents caused us to obtain human life, whereas being born of God causes us to have God's life
Once he receives the Lord as his Savior, God's Spirit enters into his spirit and puts God's life in it, causing him to be regenerated
Although his senses may not be strong, nevertheless, he begins to have and is developing these senses such as feeling, hearing, seeing, etc
The experience of life has much to do with knowing the sense, developing the sense and living by the sense of life
The sense of death is due to our minding the flesh, while the sense of life and peace is due to our minding the spirit
When a man sins and does wickedness, we cannot say that he has no feeling, but at least we can say that he has laid aside his feelings
Almost all the Epistles of the apostles have words of blessing and greeting in which grace and peace are mentioned
It is produced from the things we have gained through regeneration-the life of God, the law of life, the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God
The life of God is the strongest life therefore when this life is in us it causes us not merely to have feelings but to have strong feelings
The Holy Spirit as ointment is anointing and moving in us; Christ is living in us with activity; and God is working in us
If we follow the sense of life, we follow the guidance God gives us, and at the same time, we receive a verification of where we are living
In 1 John 1:6 John says, 'If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth'
The more we allow the flowing of life to flow in us, the more we are inwardly supplied with the fullness of God
In order to experience the Lord, we also must be a consecrated person, because the time it takes to grow is long
Between the time we are regenerated till the time we are matured, we will face many situations that we may not be happy about
If we are not clear about consecration and are not consecrated, then we may not be able to finish the course like the apostle Paul
He cannot obtain something in the universe without paying a price, and He also cannot demand something from us without a basis
If God, therefore, wanted to release us from under His righteous law, He must pay the full price to satisfy the demand of His law
If we are clear about the right of ownership, we would consecrate ourselves to God immediately and continuously
If the things which God purchased were inanimate objects, such as a chair or a garment, He could proceed directly to use them as He pleases
Since the meaning of consecration is to become a sacrifice, the thing offered is something which is entirely for God
If the sacrifices were not consumed by fire, they would be raw and foul-smelling and could never be acceptable or pleasing to God
Whenever we find that our heart loves many things other than God Himself we know that we need to be reconsecrated to be ashes for God again
We see that we have been purchased by and for God, and we have consecrated ourselves for God's satisfaction because of His love
We may have everything already, but now is the time to experience these things item by item, to grow in life and to mature in life
In this lesson, we will learn how to preserve our whole being, spirit and soul and body, so that we may be a person of life
The apostle Paul said, 'Always rejoice; unceasingly pray; in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you
Praise the Lord, call upon His name, declare His doings among the people, make mention that His name is exalted''
In order to restore the fellowship to enjoy life again, we must deal with our conscience until it is void of offense
The way to deal with the conscience is to repent and confess , until the fellowship of life with the issue of peace is restored
When one's conscience has this feeling of offense, his fellowship with God is hindered and thus his entire spiritual condition is lowered
Revelation 12:10-11 tells us that Satan accuses us day and night before God, but that we can overcome him by the blood of the Lamb
John 17 9 tells us that if we confess our sins God will forgive our sins and the blood of the Lord will cleanse us from all unrighteousness
If the condemnation lingers on, we simply declare to Satan that he must leave us, because God has already forgiven us according to His word
The growth of life affects the feeling of our conscience, and the feeling of our conscience aids the growth of life
If we would preserve our body, we should live a life that never follows the old man, that never follows our soul
Paul illustrates the importance of preserving our body in this way by giving in chapter four the charge to abstain from fornication
Many people misunderstand the Holy Spirit as a power or a thing given by God to do supernatural or sometimes spooky things
He went to the cross to remove all the negative things in the universe and to release His life to all His chosen and redeemed people
Calamus is a reed which grows out of muddy places high into the air, therefore, it must signify the Lord's resurrection
Since the compound ointment in the Old Testament typifies the Holy Spirit, we may call the Spirit, the compound Spirit
Throughout the entire lifetime of a Christian, all the work of the Holy Spirit upon him is to fulfill the work of mingling God with man
The purpose of the flowing of life is to flow God into us, while the purpose of the anointing is to anoint God into us
When speaking of maintaining the fellowship, the New Testament brings up the matters of sprinkling the blood and applying the ointment
By the continual cleansing and anointing of the blood and the ointment, we maintain our union with the Lord always
When the anointing is moving within us, on the one hand, it anoints God into us, and on the other hand, it reveals God's mind to us
The feeling of the conscience and the teaching of the anointing are both derived from the feeling of the anointing
The feeling of the conscience which is derived from the anointing is also limited to right and wrong, good and evil
The teaching of the anointing, which comes by way of the anointing and is sensed directly in our spirit, is related in scope to God Himself
We must go beyond this to live in the teaching of the anointing; then we can touch the mind of God and live in God
As life is in the Holy Spirit, so the fellowship of life is through the moving or anointing of the Holy Spirit
If our fellowship with the Lord is limited only to our time of private prayer or morning watch, it is still very shallow
If we obey the teaching of the anointing constantly, we can constantly experience the anointing and live in fellowship
Without the anointing, the presence of God cannot be made real within us, and we cannot feel the light from His face
Since the anointing is vital to God's presence, we need to obey the teaching so we can experience more of the anointing
We can live at all times and in all places in the presence of God living in the light of His face and touching His presence moment by moment
The teaching of the anointing is truly the center of all spiritual experience and is also a very wonderful part of God's salvation
Without the Spirit, we do not have the law of life in us; thus, we cannot be freed from the law of sin and death
Being filled with the Spirit affords us the power, the strength, and the authority to overcome every hindrance to life
Essential means pertaining to the essence, necessary to the constitution and existence, hence, of life and being
The essential aspect is that the Spirit would come into us, bringing us the divine essence to be our life and life supply
Economical means pertaining to the economy, necessary to the out-working of God's household administration, hence, of power and work
Man was redeemed and regenerated to become partners of Christ in building up His church according to God's economy
Before the Lord's death, He promised the troubled disciples that He needed to go to the cross in order for the Spirit of reality to be sent
The Spirit of reality was to be in the disciples to bring to them all the divine realities of the Father and the Son
In Luke 24:49 the Lord Jesus said, 'I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you until you are clothed with power from on high'
In Acts 1:4-8 He also said, 'Wait for the promise of the Father you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you'
According to the incorrect concepts of many Christians today, to be filled by the Spirit is very special and hard to obtain
After we are regenerated, we do not need to ask the Father to give us the Spirit that we have already received
You will find that the more you speak this way, the more you will be filled with the Spirit, and the more you will have faith and boldness
According to Acts 431 we have boldness power and authority to speak the word of God in preaching the gospel and to prophesy in the meetings
All the dealings will result in more filling of the Spirit and experiences of life resulting in the growth of life
Dear brothers and sisters, it is easy to be filled, and we must practice to be filled every day, all the day, until we are raptured by Him
Whether we become aware of them by the inward sense or the outward word, our dealing with them is the experience of life
He said therefore to the Lord that if he had taken anything from any man by false accusation, he would willingly restore him fourfold
Since each piece of silver approximated a day's wage, we can see that these books were worth a great deal of money
Although we have previously pointed out four matters which must necessarily be ended, yet these only enable us to recognize principles
When we are practicing the clearing of the past, what needs to be ended really depends on the sense of life within
Since we have such a new life, we can now live and behave in the presence of God through the sense of this new life
Their 'ending'' proves that this matter is not based on external regulations and teachings, but on the sense of life within
We need first to cause others to know that the life of God is within them and lead them to know the sense of this life
Once this feeling has begun and has been deepened within them, we can lead them to clear up their past according to their own feeling
Here, 'reconciled'' and 'be well disposed quickly with'' refer to dealings concerning our relationships with others
John 1:9: 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
Proverbs 28:13: 'He that covers his transgressions shall not prosper; but whoso confesses and forsakes them shall obtain mercy'
Once our fellowship with God is hindered due to unconfessed sins, then our experience and growth of life become abnormal
If our act of sinning against man involves only a moral matter, we have only to confess this and apologize before man
Every sinful act of ours, when become known to others, whether it causes damage to them or not, results in a discordant condition between us
When we restore what we have taken, we should pay according to the original value and add a little more to compensate for the loss
Knowing and dealing with the world is very important in the initial experience of our Christian life; therefore, we shall study it carefully
When Adam was in the garden of Eden, various kinds of fruit and vegetables, water, air, sunshine, and a place for shelter were provided
Today, man needs self-protection and self-defense, but in the beginning God Himself was his defense and protection
All the trees in the garden of Eden not only bore fruit for food, but were also pleasing and enjoyable to the eye, making one happy
When man lost God's care for his livelihood, he first experienced fear; he feared the lack of supply, defense, and happiness
In order to meet the necessities of life and survive, man used his own strength and devised means of supply, defense, and amusement
After the fall of Cain, out of his descendants were produced the founders of man's own supply for these three great needs of life
We can say that anything that goes beyond our daily necessities is taking the place of God and possessing us thus it needs to be dealt with
We all need to see that our spirit is mingled with the divine life and is the organ that can overcome the world
Usually when we mention the flesh, we think that the flesh is corrupt and wicked, just as mentioned in Galatians 5:19-21
Paul in Philippians 3:3-6 indicated that there were some who worshipped God in the flesh and boasted in their flesh
The flesh there undoubtedly refers to flesh in its good aspect, for by it man worships God and through it man boasts
Because although we are the people who fell deeply, we still have some good element which was originally created by God
Galatians 5:24 says, 'But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts'
Although objectively, we have been crucified, like all spiritual realities, we must experience it in the spirit
After seeing the matter of dealing with the flesh, we must go on to see that our self also needs to be dealt with
To the Lord, the self is just the soul-life, the expression of the self is opinion, which is an expression of Satan
Throughout history, the church has not been as damaged by persecution or other things as it has been damaged by the self
Martin Luther once said that although he was afraid of the pope, he was more afraid of the stronger pope, the self, within his own heart
We should not insist on our own view, but should always speak in the fear of the Lord and be willing to be adjusted
Though God does want to deal with our natural abilities, we still need to be educated and be well trained in every area of our human life
We need to endeavor to learn all that is useful, yet knowing that God will deal with our natural abilities and then use us
Young people should aspire to get the best grades and the highest degree, yet not hold on to nor depend on such things
Individually, we may grow in life and express the Lord in our daily living, yet that is not the fullness of Christ
Again, individually we cannot apprehend the dimensions of Christ nor are we able to be all the fullness of God, but corporately we can
The reason most Christians do not deal with it is because they do not see the Body of Christ and do not see the evil of individualism
We need to pray that the Lord will reveal to us the Body and expose our individualistic thoughts, speech, and actions
As soon as we become aware of any trait of individualism, we must pray, 'O Lord Jesus, forgive my independent ways
We, as the members of the Body of Christ, should endeavor to maintain the fellowship in oneness and not be divided
The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 16:18, 'I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it'
Have you ever heard someone speaking against an elder or against the ministry that brought you the New Testament economy?
If we have done it ourselves, we need to repent to the Lord and to the ones to whom we have spoken in such a way
If you have seen the points from the previous lessons and practice accordingly, you will have much experience of life and growth in life
According to the entire book of Revelation, the paradise of God in 2:7 is the New Jerusalem , of which the church is a foretaste today
Even today we have the privilege of eating the tree of life and of 'drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry''
The issue of faith as the seed of life growing within us to its full development is that God and we become one entity
Otherwise people will not be able to see faith virtue knowledge selfcontrol endurance godliness brotherly love or the divine love in us
The divine attributes expressed in our human virtues are the Christian virtues, which are the fruit in our character
Paul did not mention anything about the power of the divine life in Galatians 5, but he referred us to the very Holy Spirit
On the one hand, the divine life as power gives us the energy to carry out all the beauties of the divine life, the virtues
When we eat a good breakfast, this breakfast becomes the energy within us to energize us during the day, giving us the strength to do things
If we are such fruit-bearing believers in the Christian virtues, the second category of fruit will be borne by us
The fruit borne by the branches in John 15 denotes the saved persons regenerated with the divine life through the dispensing of the branches
To bear the fruit of persons regenerated through our dispensing of the divine life requires us to go forth to contact and reach people
We need to bear not only the fruit of virtues as the beauties of the divine life but also the fruit of solid persons
You must be a person that lives by the divine power within you, walking by and with a Holy Person, the Holy Spirit
You must be a person living by Christ as your life and walking with the Holy Spirit as your companion to bear much fruit of virtues
When you speak Christ in the preaching of the gospel, the second category of fruit will be there, the fruit of persons
If you are a Christian that lives by Christ and walks with the Spirit, you will be full of virtues, full of beauties
We have to be persons bearing the fruit of the Christian virtues, which are the very expression of the divine attributes
As the sons of God individually, we need to grow up in life and bear the two categories of fruit in our daily living
Many say that they enjoy the Lord, or that they have grown in the Lord, yet what outward proof do we have to substantiate their claim?
Is there a building up with the saints through fellowship and prayer, or is there murmuring, reasoning, complaining, and even divisive talk?
The Body of Christ, the church, is not an organization but an organism, an issue of the dispensing of the Triune God into us as life
All the local churches, all the saints, all the elders, and all the workers should never be independent of one another
Any independence and division represents a lack of life, is not of life, and is not a part of the organic Body of Christ
One of the definitions of life is: God the Father in the Son as the Spirit flowing into us, through us, and out of us
We must preach the gospel to our friends, our relatives, and our neighbors so that they may be brought into the Lord and into His Body
We must first preach the gospel to bring sinners to repentance, resulting in more members for the Body of Christ
We must have more members enjoying life, experiencing life, growing in life, filled up with life, and constituted with life
Without oneness, there is no way to build up the Body of Christ; therefore, we all must be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit
The oneness of the Spirit is not something we have to pray for, rather, we must exercise our spirit to keep it
When a baby is born, it may have all the innate capabilities to play the piano, yet without training, it will never play well
It needs training to preach the gospel, nourish others, teach the truth, speak forth God and build up the Body of Christ
The perfected saints must function according to the extent they have been perfected to build up the Body of Christ
If you were trained in pray-reading, you may train a new one to pray-read; then you become a small shepherding teacher
If you perfect others as well as function to build up the Body, then you are a small apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd and teacher
When you grow up in life both spiritually and physically, you will become a full-grown apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd and teacher
In summary, the issues of life are the fruit of virtues, the fruit of saved persons, and the building up of the Body of Christ in oneness
He is the one who is destroying so many young people through drugs alcohol violence boygirl relationships rebellion laziness and worldliness
All those that have fully matured in life and served Him faithfully in building and reigning will receive a reward
It is the ultimate consummation of the divine, eternal, indestructible life growing in all God's chosen, redeemed, and regenerated people
And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it for the glory of God illumined it and its lamp is the Lamb
Although there are twelve gates, there is only one street, one river, one tree, one throne, and one nature-gold
People of different nations, tribes, and tongues from all four corners of the earth come into the city, and find only oneness there
Originally man was opaque; here man is clear as crystal, due to the transformation of the Spirit through His fellowship
They, together in oneness, express all that He is in life and reign with Him and for Him over the whole universe for eternity
In these remaining five lessons we will address the matters concerning the maintenance of life in our daily life and the church life
It is not enough just to know about life and know about how to experience life, we also need to know how to maintain the life that is in us
We began our Christian life by calling, 'And it shall be that everyone, whoever calls on the name of the Lord, shall be saved''
Calling on the name of the Lord was practiced by the New Testament believers beginning on the day of Pentecost
He said, 'For there is no difference between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him
By all of these verses we can see that in the first century the Christians practiced calling on the name of the Lord very much
Throughout the Old Testament as well as in the early days of the Christian age, the saints called on the Lord's name
We believe that today the Lord wants to recover calling on His name and to have us practice it so that we may enjoy the riches of His life
Praying will make our spirit strong because through prayer we contact God, we enjoy God, and we have fellowship with God
Most of the time we prefer to talk or do something else rather than pray; therefore, our spirit is usually not so strong
Because He is living and He is the life-giving Spirit, whenever we pray we receive life and our spirit is strengthened from within
We must pray all the time to live the proper Christian life, to experience the divine, eternal, and indestructible life in our spirit
Our prayer to contact God, to enjoy God, and to fellowship with God will issue in prayers for God's eternal purpose
You also may pray that the Lord will bind the enemy so that your friend may be freed to receive God's salvation
For two thousand years Christians have acknowledged one thing, that no one can know the Lord well without knowing the Bible
If we only have the Scripture without, but do not have the Holy Spirit within, we will become dead, without vitality or livingness
Having these two aspects-the inward and the outward-coordinating together, the train can move, even move very well
If you would pray like this, you will be energized by the Spirit and life, and you will be burning in your spirit by the divine fire
If you read one chapter from the New Testament every day, it will take you about nine months to finish the New Testament
As you are reading through, pray with the verses that touch you, write down what you see, then tell people around you what you wrote down
What you keep in your heart will help to keep you from sin and will help to form you according to God's desire
In conclusion, we must use our spirit and our mind to contact the Word of God daily to receive the Spirit and life that we may be enriched
In previous lessons we have seen that life is God the Father in Christ Jesus the Son as the Spirit flowing into, through, and out of us
We should not use our God-created organs to speak nonsensical speech such as foolish talking, coarse jesting, and foul abusive language
We should use our speaking ability to speak the words of Christ to minister life to people that they may be built up into the Body of Christ
We may speak many other things, but we do not have the habit of speaking the word of Christ in the Holy Spirit
We need to repent to the Lord, exercise our spirit, and boldly speak forth the word of Christ we have received
Because He is living and speaking, whenever we speak His word, His Spirit fills us within , and we are in the Holy Spirit
Being in the Holy Spirit implies that we are clothed economically with the Holy Spirit of power for God's economy
Romans chapter ten tells us that this kind of speaking puts the word of faith into your friends' mouths and hearts
Their response to our speaking in the spirit of faith is their faith Their salvation does not depend on them, but it depends on our speaking
We can speak in the meetings as well as on the way to and from the meetings at home in school on the way to and from school in the parks etc
All the speaking will minister Christ as life to the hearers, will cause you to enjoy Him as life, and to grow in life
In this lesson we want to fellowship about having a normal daily Christian life that is in spirit and expresses Christ
They did many good works, but losing their first love could cause them to lose the church status if they would not repent
Due to the loss of their first love, the churches became lukewarm, and the Lord wanted to vomit them out of His mouth
We must live Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and this bountiful supply is right within us
After they have believed and are baptized, they are saved , and have been born of God to be members of the Body of Christ
From now on, they must strengthen their mingled, regenerated spirit by calling on the name of the Lord and by praying
Chapter nineteen of The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ will render you further help
You must cause them to be just like you: loving the Lord, having morning revival, living a victorious life, etc
Whenever we call on the Lord and pray-read the word, we must have some enjoyment of Christ and some experiences of life
On the Lord's day, when the whole church comes together, you and your new ones will have a revelation or a testimony
You will tear down the degraded system of clergy-laity, which the Lord hates , to build up the church directly
We all have to praise the Lord that He is the eternal, divine, and indestructible life in us to produce such wonderful results
