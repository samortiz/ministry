   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having an Average of One Out of Every Four Saints Go Out Door-knocking</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second principle is that out of every four saints there should be one who goes out door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This does not refer to the door-knocking which is to be carried out by the full-timers; rather, this means that in the seven days of one week, one out of every four saints should set aside two hours to go out door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This does not require you to do a lot; you need to go only once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, you must be persistent in this and do it every week.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Unless you or a family member is ill and needs to rest or be cared for, you all should keep this principle and practice going out door-knocking for two hours every week.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Luke 9 says that when the Lord was calling people to follow Him, someone said to Him, "Lord, permit me to go first and bury my father."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord said, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and announce the kingdom of God everywhere."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Another one said, "I will follow you, Lord; but first permit me to say farewell to those in my house."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord said, "No one who puts his hand on the plow and looks behind is fit for the kingdom of God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>59-62 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to this portion of the Word, we can also say that no matter what happens in our homes, we should always adhere to the principle of spending two hours a week to go out door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are no excuses; nothing is so important that it can keep us from going out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No matter how busy we are, we must go out for two hours a week.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are fifty-two weeks a year, and as long as we are able to go, then we should practice this principle every week without fail.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am speaking this word not to the full-timers but to all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all have a desire to serve the Lord because we love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now the Lord wants us to set apart two hours a week for Him, so how can we say that He is asking too much?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are one hundred sixty-eight hours in a week, and two hours is only about one percent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we really love Him, how can we refuse?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we cannot do even this much, how can we be excused?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regardless of who you are or how busy you are, you should give the Lord two hours every week to do nothing else but go out door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A WAY OF RECEIVING THE BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now I have no desire to speak any doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I just want to promote the new way for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first point of the new way is that of the saints who regularly meet, one in twenty should be a full-timer, and the second point is that one in four should go out door-knocking for two hours every week.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a local church would be willing to practice these two principles, it will certainly be greatly blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The full-timers should also go out door-knocking from Monday through Saturday for at least two or three hours a day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a full-time serving one would be willing to do this, I believe that every week he would gain and baptize at least one person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way he would gain about fifty people in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At this rate the church in Taipei with its two hundred full-timers would gain ten thousand people in one year.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I hope that we all would be able to hear and receive this word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The two hundred full-timers supported by four thousand people should spend every day studying the truth, serving the church, and caring for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In addition, they should set aside two or three hours every day to go out door-knocking, and each of these two hundred should be able to gain about fifty people a year.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that these two hundred would bring in ten thousand people through door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This truly is a profitable matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the conclusion we drew from our practical research.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the Lord allows it, the Chinese Recovery Version of the New Testament will be finished next year, and then I will go to every continent to speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the one hand, I hate that I am so old now that I am not qualified to be a soldier, and on the other hand, I am certainly bearing too many burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Otherwise, I would definitely go out door-knocking every day.</S>
