<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will continue from the previous lesson to see Christ in His first coming as prophesied by the Old Testament prophets. He is the child, the Son (Emmanuel); the King; the One coming forth from Bethlehem; the Desire of all the nations; and the Messenger of God and the Angel of the covenant. We will also see that at the birth of Jesus the aged Simeon prophesied that Christ would be the glory and consolation of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE CHILD BORN OF A VIRGIN,<br />
THE SON (EMMANUEL)<br />
GIVEN BY THE ETERNAL FATHER</h2>
<p>Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6 are two of the greatest prophecies in the Bible concerning Christ. These prophecies speak of a child being born and a Son being given. The word <em>child</em> in these verses implies God, man, God becoming a man, and God and man mingled as one. Such a child was a God-man. This child born of the human nature by a human virgin was also the Son given in the divine nature by the Eternal Father.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. A Child Born of a Human Virgin</h2>
<p>This divine-human child was begotten in the virgin Mary of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:20). The divine essence of the Holy Spirit was generated in Mary&rsquo;s womb before the child Jesus was delivered out of her womb. God was born into Mary and remained in Mary&rsquo;s womb for nine months. Then the One who was of the Holy Spirit in Mary was delivered out of her womb as a God-man with both divinity and humanity (v. 23). This God-man was named Jesus&mdash;Jehovah the Savior&mdash;by God (v. 21). Jesus is not only a man but also Jehovah. Furthermore, He is not only Jehovah; He is Jehovah becoming our salvation. Hence, He is our Savior. He was called Emmanuel&mdash;God with us&mdash;by the ones who experienced Him (v. 23b). The child born of Mary was a God-man child. Before His birth, there had never been such a human being, a man mingled with God. This God-man is Emmanuel. He is God coming from divinity and with divinity into humanity to be Jehovah the Savior. On the negative side, He saves us from sin, and on the positive side, He saves us to God. He brings us unto God from a fallen situation, a situation of having our back turned to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Son Given by the Eternal Father</h2>
<p>The child born of a human virgin is the Son given by the Eternal Father (Isa. 9:6a; John 3:16). The prophecy in Isaiah 7:14 concerning Emmanuel sees its fulfillment in Matthew 1:20-23. The prophecy in Isaiah 9:6 concerning Christ as the Wonderful One sees its fulfillment in John 3:16. Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us.&rdquo; John 3:16 says, &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.&rdquo; Therefore, John 3:16 is based upon Isaiah 9:6. The Son was given by a child being born. In the birth of this child there was a gift given by God&mdash;His Son, the One who became the God-man. His Son, the gift given to us, is also the Mighty God and the Eternal Father. This clearly reveals that the child born of a virgin is also the Son given by the Eternal Father; and this Son is the Mighty God and the Eternal Father. The Gospel of John also contains the same revelation. John 1:1 and 14 say that He was the Word, the very God, who became flesh. He was the Word, and then He became flesh. His becoming flesh was His coming with the fullness of grace and reality. His becoming flesh was God&rsquo;s incarnation. Thus, the Son became God&rsquo;s embodiment (Col. 2:9). By bringing us grace and reality, He becomes our portion and our reality so that we can receive and gain Him.</p>
<p>The child born of the virgin is Jesus, whom man called Emmanuel, and this child is also the Son, as the gift to us from God. This Son, this gift, is the Mighty God and the Eternal Father. When we received Christ, we received Him as so many marvelous items. He is Jehovah our Savior to save us from sin into Himself, and He is Emmanuel, God with us. We enjoy this One as grace, which is God Himself as our portion for our enjoyment. The issue of our enjoyment of Him as our portion is that He becomes our reality. What a blessing this is!</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE KING</h2>
<p>Isaiah 32:1-2 says, &ldquo;Indeed a King will reign according to righteousness, / And the rulers will rule according to justice. / And a man will be like a refuge from the wind / And a covering from the tempest, / Like streams of water in a dry place, / Like the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land.&rdquo; Here Isaiah prophesies that Christ in His first coming would be a King as well as a man for supplying, caring, and covering His people. The Gospel of Matthew reveals that Christ is the King, as prophesied in the Old Testament, who brings the kingdom of God to earth. He is not only God but also a man. He is very human and even lowly in order to take care of all the needs of His people.</p>
<p>This man who is the King, Christ, is a refuge to us from the wind. When we face a storm, we can hide in Him to receive His protection. He is also a covering from the tempest. A tempest is much stronger, more troublesome, and much harder to face than wind. When we are facing a tempest, Christ covers us so that the tempest cannot bother or damage us. This God-man is also streams of water in a dry place to supply, comfort, and satisfy us so that we can be watered in a dry place. Christ is also the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land. <em>A wasted land</em> signifies a place damaged and wasted by man. This wonderful Christ is the shadow of a massive rock that becomes a sheltering shade as our covering. These items are various aspects of the care and supply rendered to us, the kingdom people, by Christ as the King in His kingship. The prophecy of Isaiah concerning Christ as the King has been fulfilled in Christ&rsquo;s first coming. Ultimately, at Christ&rsquo;s second coming, this prophecy will be consummately fulfilled. At that time, in the millennial kingdom, Christ will be the King to bring in the restoration of Israel.</p>
