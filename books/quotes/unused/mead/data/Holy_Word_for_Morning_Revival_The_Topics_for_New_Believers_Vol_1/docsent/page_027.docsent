   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 4 DAY 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rom 6:13 Present yourselves to God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lev 1:9 Then the priest shall burn the whole offering on the altar, as a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Result of Consecration</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to consider this matter in the light of the offerings of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a bullock was taken for sacrifice and offered upon the altar, he was immediately cut off from all his previous relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was severed from his master, his companions, and his corral.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After he was consumed by fire, he even lost his original form and stature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All his choicest parts were changed to a sweet-smelling savor to God, and all that was left was a heap of ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything was cut off, and everything was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was the result of the bullock being offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since our consecration is also an offering to God, the result must also be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There must be the giving up of everything to be burned to ashes by God to the point where all is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some brothers and sisters still have hopes after their consecration of becoming such and such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This proves that their future has not been given up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The future we are speaking about includes not only our future in this world, but also our future in the so-called Christian world.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all know how the world naturally attracts us and offers the hope of a future in it, but even the so-called Christian world holds an attraction to us and offers a hope of a future in it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All these hopes, however, never exist in a consecrated person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A truly consecrated man is a man who has given up his future.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He abandons not only his future in the world, but also his so-called spiritual future.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He no longer has hopes for himself in anything; all his hope is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He lives purely and simply in the hand of God; he is what God wants him to be and does what God wants him to do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whatever the outcome may be, he does not know and does not care.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He only knows that he is a sacrifice, wholly belonging to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The altar is forever the place where he stands, and a heap of ashes is forever the result.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His future has been utterly abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This giving up of the future is not a reluctant act after something has already occurred to wreck your future hopes; it is a willing surrender before such an event.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If our consecration is not sound, sooner or later problems will arise in our service and in our spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brothers and sisters, this result of abandoning all our future prospects always needs to be kept fresh within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Never let our consecration become old.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If it grows old, it is the same as if we had never consecrated ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should always be as ashes on the altar, always entirely for God to enjoy, always without any future.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>100</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A Concluding Word</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must realize that it is not possible to hit the climax of any experience of life by experiencing it just once.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to pursue continuously, so that our experience will increase gradually and become fuller, until it reaches the stage of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we first consecrate ourselves, our experience is similar to an embryo in the mother's womb one cannot distinguish the ear, the eye, the mouth, and the nose.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As we grow in life, however, these five points related to the experience of consecration gradually become formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we really have a feeling that we have been bought by God and that all our rights are in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We become a prisoner of His love because His love has pierced our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We become a sacrifice indeed, laid on the altar for God's enjoyment and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We will be those who have been thoroughly worked over by God and are then able to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our future will truly be as a handful of ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All our ways of escape outside of God's will shall have been cut off; God only will be our future and our way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At that time the experience of our consecration will indeed have become matured.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May we all, by the grace of the Lord, pursue and go on together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>101</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
