   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Door to Leave the Fold</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For the believers Christ is also the door to leave the fold John 10:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The fold in John 10 signifies the law and also Judaism, the religion of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before Christ came, God put His chosen people under the custody of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The law was the fold where God's people as the sheep were kept and protected temporarily until the pasture, the permanent place for the sheep, was ready.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is the pasture, the permanent place for God's people to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before Christ came, God prepared the law as the sheepfold to keep and confine His chosen people temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the Jewish religion utilized the law to form Judaism, which then became the sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John 10 reveals that Christ is the door through which God's people leave the fold and come to the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God no longer intends to keep His chosen people in the fold of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He wants them to come out of the law into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now, during the New Testament age, God intends to bring His people out of the law through Christ as the door.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ has come, and the pasture is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no need for the sheep to be confined any longer in the custody of the Judaic law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They must be released from the fold of the law to enjoy the riches of the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is the door through which His believers may come out of any kind of fold and come into Him as the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today, in the sight of God, the various denominations, sects, and independent groups are folds.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, a fold is anything formed into a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Anything that is first used by God and then becomes a legality is a fold.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, baptism by immersion is correct, but if we make this a legality, we shall form another fold.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be kept from legality concerning anything used by God, we should care only for Christ and focus on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the door to leave the fold, Christ is our freedom from legality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Christ we have the freedom to go in and go out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that we do not have any legality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The freedom we enjoy is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because Christ is our freedom, our door, we are not bound by any legality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This does not mean, of course, that we are free to indulge the flesh Gal 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Christ we are not in bondage to legality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because Christ is our door, we have true freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>15.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Pasture</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>John 10:9 says, "I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Outside the fold is the green pasture, which signifies Christ as the feeding place for the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the pasture is not available, the sheep must be kept in the fold temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the pasture is ready, the sheep should come out of the fold and remain in the pasture permanently.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As believers in Christ, we should now enjoy Him as our pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus said, "I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly" John 10:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that, because He is their pasture, Christ came to impart Himself as life to His sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As long as the sheep stay in the pasture, they will have the supply of life abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By feeding on the pasture the sheep will enjoy the pasture as their abundant life supply, for the Lord Jesus is their abundant life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They will enjoy Him and experience Him as their life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to be the pasture of life to the sheep Christ had to die for them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All the living grass eaten by the sheep must pass through the process of death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, the Lord laid down His life for His sheep John 10:11, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ had to die for the sheep in order to minister Himself as life to them and thereby be the pasture to them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is a hymn that speaks of the Lord Jesus as the One who brought us out of the fold and into Himself as the pasture:</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Jesus, our wonderful Shepherd,</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brought us right out of the fold</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Into His pasture so plenteous,</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Into His riches untold.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Glorious church life,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Feasting from such a rich store!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Here where we're dwelling in oneness</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God commands life evermore.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the divisions He sought us,</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Weary and famished for food;</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Into the good land He brought us,</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Oh, to our spirit how good!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Jesus Himself is our pasture,</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is the food that we eat;</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We as His sheep are fed richly</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Each time, whenever we meet.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hymns, #1221</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The pasture is a place of tender grass; that is, a pasture is a place full of the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When sheep are in the pasture, they do not lack food.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today our pasture is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In our daily Christian life we should have the definite realization that we are in the pasture enjoying Christ as the rich supply of life.</S>
