   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4 Leavened Bread</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Leviticus 7:13 says, "With the thanksgiving sacrifice of his peace offering, he shall offer his offering with cakes of leavened bread."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The other items are for appreciation and enjoyment, whereas the leaven reminds us that we, the offerers and enjoyers of such a holy Christ, are still unholy; we are still leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whatever God does is absolutely pure and holy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But whatever we initiate still has some leaven in it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The leavened bread reminds the offerer that he is still sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we offer Christ at the Lord's table, we need to be reminded that we are still unclean, still leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To Others a. The Flesh of the Cattle</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are five parties participating in the five portions of the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One portion is to God, one portion is to the conducting priest, one portion is to all the priests, one portion is to the offerer, and the last portion is to others, that is, to the rest of the congregation who are worshipping God 7:19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The last portion to others is the flesh of the cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of course, no offerer by himself can eat all the offerings, so some "eating helpers" are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why we all come together at the Lord's table to enjoy the unsearchably rich Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today we ourselves must be the conducting priests, the serving priests.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Old Testament worship, there were the serving priests and the ones who came to them to offer something.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in the New Testament there are no clergy and laity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today we must be all four parties: the offerers, the conducting priests, the general priests, and the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only certain portions of the peace offering, mostly the inward parts, are for God, but the rest are for us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some among us, however, may come to the meeting merely as a part of the congregation and not as offerers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Others may be offerers, but they are not that strong and there is not the real serving priesthood with them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Doctrinally speaking, there are no clergy and laity among us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But actually some may offer a "layman's" prayer, whereas others may offer a serving one's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can discern the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are all priests, but some may be lazy and will not serve.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These ones can enjoy only the wave breast, not the heave thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This typology in Leviticus presents a full picture of today's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Cleanness Being Required</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Anyone who wants to eat the peace offering must be clean, without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is fully dealt with in 1 Corinthians 11, which points out that it is possible for us to partake of the Lord's table in an unworthy manner v. 27 . First Corinthians 5 tells us what kinds of persons are unclean and should be excluded from the fellowship of the Lord's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The focus of this lesson is as follows: Christ as the peace offering offered by us to the Father is for the enjoyment of God and all the parties participating in the worship in the dispensing of God.</S>
