<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>PRACTICING THE NEW WAY TO BUILD UP<br>THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14</H1><P>In this chapter we want to fellowship concerning our need to pick up the new way to practice the Lord's present recovery. In order to meet the Lord's present need, we must enter into two portions of His Word: 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4:11-16.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CRUCIAL REVELATION IN 1 CORINTHIANS 14</H2><P>We want to begin our fellowship by studying 1 Corinthians 14. The subject of this chapter of forty verses is not only prophesying but also the encouragement to prophesy. In verse 1 Paul says, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy." This verse shows that we need to have an earnest desire to prophesy. In verse 5 he says, "I desire...that you may prophesy." Then in verse 12 he says, "Seek that you may excel to the building up of the church." To prophesy is to excel because "he who prophesies builds up the church" (v. 4). The gift of prophesying is an excelling gift. All the other gifts are not as high or excelling. In verse 39 Paul says, "Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy." From these verses we can see that the Apostle Paul is encouraging, charging, and urging us to prophesy. After covering many items in the first thirteen chapters of 1 Corinthians, Paul encourages us in chapter fourteen to seek this excelling gift for the building up of the church.</P><P>To prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 is not in the sense of foretelling or predicting. To prophesy is to speak for the Lord, and in our speaking for the Lord, we have to speak forth the Lord and speak the Lord into others. To prophesy is to dispense the very Christ whom we have experienced into others. The subject of 1 Corinthians 14 is prophesying, which is speaking Christ forth into others, dispensing Christ into others by our speaking. This is not human or ordinary speaking but divine and extraordinary speaking.</P><P>According to verse 2 of chapter one, 1 Corinthians was written not only to the church in Corinth but also to "all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours." This Epistle is to us. It is an Epistle to all the local churches. First Corinthians is a book on Christ as our portion, so verse 2 refers to Christ as being "theirs and ours." Christ is their portion and our portion. He is the portion of all His believers. A believer in Christ should be an enjoyer of Christ, a caller on Christ. Our calling on Him is to receive Him, to breathe Him in, to enjoy Him, and to take Him as our portion for our daily practical needs. Every day and every minute, we need this Christ as our support, as our supply, so we have to call on Him all the time. To exercise our spirit to call "O Lord Jesus" is our spiritual breathing. By this kind of breathing, we receive the life supply and the enjoyment of Christ to live Christ. We live Christ by calling on Him as our portion.</P>
