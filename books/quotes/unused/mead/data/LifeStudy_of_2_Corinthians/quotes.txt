[1]  The book of 2 Corinthians is unique in that it has a very long introduction.
[2]  This Epistle contains thirteen chapters, and the first one and a half chapters are the introduction.
[3]  Paul s greeting is found in verse 2: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[4]  In verses 3 and 4 Paul says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all encouragement; Who encourages us in all our affliction, that we may be able to encourage those who are in every affliction through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God.
[5]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWO INTRODUCTION 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:12-14
[6]  In these verses there is something very deep, not in doctrine but in experience.
[7]  If we have not had the experience described here, we shall not be able to understand what Paul is talking about in these verses.
[8]  Apparently Paul s word here is simple and easy to understand; actually Paul is referring to something deep and profound.
[9]  In verse 12 Paul says, For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
[10]  In verse 12 Paul refers to the testimony of the conscience.
[11]  We must have a pure conscience 2 Tim 1:3 , a conscience without offense Acts 24:16 , to bear a testimony to what we are and do.
[12]  Paul s conscience testified that he was sincere, faithful, and honest.
[13]  Second Corinthians 1:15-22 is part of the long introduction to this book.
[14]  We have pointed out that Paul wrote such a long introduction in order to calm down the Corinthian believers and to soothe them.
[15]  By this confidence Paul is referring to what he has just said in verses 12 through 14: the testimony of his conscience that he and his co-workers conducted themselves in the singleness and sincerity of God, not in human wisdom, but in the grace of God.
[16]  God is faithful, never changing, especially in His promises concerning Christ, so that the word the apostles preached concerning Christ is likewise never changing, because the very Christ whom God promised in His faithful word and whom they preached in their gospel did not become yes and no, but in Him is yes.
[17]  Since the Christ whom they preached according to God s promises did not become yes and no, the word they preached concerning Him was not yes and no. Not only their preaching but also their living was according to what Christ is.
[18]  In these verses Paul seems to be saying, You Corinthians are mistaken.
[19]  When I resolved to come to Corinth, I did not resolve by myself or in myself; I resolved with the unchanging Christ of the faithful God.
[20]  In his vindication Paul speaks of God and of Christ, indicating to the complicated Corinthians that he was absolutely one with God and with Christ.
[21]  In these verses we have a strong indication that Paul was living absolutely in Christ and in God.
[22]  It is revealed in brief in 1 Corinthians, where Paul was urging the believers to forget Judaism, Greek philosophy, and human wisdom and culture and realize that what God desires is a people who live Christ and who are one with God.
[23]  The apostles, who preached Christ according to God s promises and lived Christ according to their preaching, and the believers, who received Christ according to the apostles preaching, are joined to Christ, becoming one with Him, through whom they say Amen before God to the great Yes of God s promises, which is Christ Himself.
[24]  Christ is actually the anglicized form of the Greek word.
[25]  Paul realized that he could be one with the faithful God and live Christ because he had been attached to Christ and anointed by God.
[26]  Because God anointed him by attaching him to Christ, he could be one with Christ and one with the faithful God.
[27]  God s attaching us to Christ issues in three things: first, an anointing that imparts God s element into us; second, a sealing that forms the divine element into an impression to express God s image; and third, a pledging that gives us a foretaste as a sample and guarantee of the full taste of God.
[28]  In these verses Paul gives the reasons for his delay in coming to Corinth.
[29]  In 1:23 Paul says, But I call on God as a witness against my soul, that to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth.
[30]  In verse 24 Paul goes on to say, Not that we lord it over your faith, but are fellow-workers of your joy; for in faith you stand.
[31]  In it we see a person who lives Christ, according to what he wrote concerning Him in his first Epistle, in the closest and most intimate contact with Him, acting according to the index of His eyes; a person who is one with Christ, full of Christ, and is saturated with Christ; one who is broken and even terminated in his natural life, softened and flexible in his will, affectionate yet restricted in his emotion, considerate and sober in his mind, and pure and genuine in his spirit toward the believers for their benefit, that they may experience and enjoy Christ as he does for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose in the building up of Christ s Body.
[32]  The ministry is absolutely different from the outward, miraculous gifts.
[33]  The all-inclusive Spirit is the embodiment of what Christ is, of what Christ has done, of what Christ has obtained, and of what Christ has attained.
[34]  I. ITS TRIUMPH AND EFFECT A. Caring for the Church
[35]  Paul introduces the ministry in a very personal, intimate way, in a way that is not at all doctrinal.
[36]  In 2:12 Paul does not say, I have finished my introduction.
[37]  On the contrary, Paul says, Furthermore, when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, a door also being opened to me in the Lord, I had no relief in my spirit when I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia 2:12-13 .
[38]  Concerning this verse, Conybeare has this to say: The verb here used means to lead a man as a captive in a triumphal procession; the full phrase means, to lead captive in a triumph over the enemies of Christ....God is celebrating His triumph over His enemies; Paul who had been so great an opponent of the gospel is a captive following in the train of the triumphal procession, yet at the same time, by a characteristic change of metaphor an incense-bearer, scattering incense which was always done on these occasions as the procession moves on.
[39]  In verse 17 Paul says, For we are not as the many, peddling the word of God; but as out of sincerity, but as out of God, before God we speak in Christ.
[40]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SIX THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW COVENANT 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:1-6
[41]  In the foregoing message we covered the triumph and effect of the ministry of the new covenant.
[42]  Wherever this ministry goes, it shows forth the triumph of Christ becoming the victory of the ministry.
[43]  Wherever Paul and his co-workers went, that was the triumphal procession celebrating Christ s victory.
[44]  In 2:12-17 Paul speaks of the triumph and effect of the apostolic ministry; in 3:1-6, of its function and competency; and in 3:7-11, of its glory and superiority.
[45]  As we shall see, verses 7 through 11 show the inferiority of the glory of the Mosaic ministry, the ministry of law, a ministry of condemnation and death, and the superiority of the apostolic ministry, the ministry of grace, a ministry of righteousness and the Spirit.
[46]  After speaking of the triumph and effect of the ministry of the new covenant, Paul goes on to speak of the function and competency of that ministry.
[47]  The function is to inscribe living letters of Christ, and the competency, the qualification, is God Himself.
[48]  The writer of these living letters is actually not Paul; the writer is the very God who has been constituted into Paul s being.
[49]  In verse 10 Paul continues, For that which has also been glorified has not been glorified in this respect, on account of the surpassing glory.
[50]  Because of the glory of the new covenant ministry which is the glory of God, even God Himself, manifested in the face of Christ forever, surpassing the temporary glory of the old covenant ministry shining on Moses face , the temporary glory of the ministry of law disappears and no longer exists.
[51]  In the same principle, when we compare the glory of the New Testament ministry with that of the Old Testament ministry, the glory of the old seems to be no glory at all.
[52]  In 2 Corinthians Paul first speaks concerning the ministry and then concerning the ministers.
[53]  In 2:14 he likens the ministry to a triumphal procession celebrating the victory of Christ.
[54]  Then he goes on to speak of the function and competence of the ministry and also of its glory and superiority.
[55]  The Lord of verse 16 is the Spirit,...which giveth life, verse 6, meaning, the Lord , as here spoken of, Christ , is the Spirit , is identical with the Holy Spirit:...Christ, here, is the Spirit of Christ Alford .
[56]  In verse 18 Paul goes on to say, And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
[57]  First, the heart turns to the Lord that the veil may be taken away v. 16 ; second, the Lord as the Spirit frees us from the bondage of the law v. 17 ; and last, with unveiled face we, as a mirror, behold and reflect the glory of the Lord and thus are transformed into His image from glory to glory.
[58]  In this chapter, this Spirit is revealed as the inscribing Spirit v. 3 , the life-giving Spirit v. 6 , the ministering Spirit v. 8 , the freeing Spirit v. 17 , and the transforming Spirit v. 18 . Such an all-inclusive Spirit is crucial to the ministers of Christ and to their ministry for God s new covenant economy.
[59]  Hence, their person is a constitution of Christ and with Christ, and their ministry is to minister Christ to others, infusing them with the all-inclusive Christ as the indwelling, life-giving Spirit.
[60]  In 3:12-18 we have the first aspect of the description of the ministers of the New Testament.
[61]  The ministers of the new covenant are constituted by and with the Lord as the life-giving and transforming Spirit.
[62]  In verse 2 Paul says, But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man s conscience before God.
[63]  The apostles behave themselves not in the way of adulterating the word of God, but of manifesting the truth for the shining of the gospel of the glory of Christ, by the excellent power of the priceless treasure, the very Christ who entered into them and became their content 2 Cor 4:7 through the enlightenment of God s shining v. 6 .
[64]  In verse 3 Paul goes on to say, And if also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those who are perishing.
[65]  Verse 5 says, For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus sake.
[66]  For explains why the apostles gospel, which is the gospel of the glory of Christ, should not be veiled, for they do not preach, exalt, themselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord of all, and they conduct themselves as the believers slaves for Jesus sake, as Jesus did, who was the Master, yet came to serve as a slave Matt 20:26-28 .
[67]  Christ Jesus as Lord comprises Christ as God over all blessed forever Rom 9:5 , the eternal Word incarnated to be a Man John 1:14 , Jesus crucified as a Man to be our Savior Acts 4:10-12 and resurrected to be the Son of God Acts 13:33 , and Christ exalted to be the Lord Acts 2:36 , even the Lord of all men Rom 10:12; John 20:28; 1 Cor 12:3 and the Lord of all things Acts 10:36 , who is the image of God, the effulgence of God s glory Heb 1:3 .
[68]  God s shining in our hearts results in the illumination of knowing the glory of God in the face of Christ, that is, in the enlightenment that causes us to know the glory of the gospel of Christ.
[69]  These metaphors are: captives in a triumphant procession for the celebration of Christ s victory 2:14a ; incense-bearers to scatter the fragrance of Christ 2:14b-16 ; letters written with Christ as the content 3:1-3 ; mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of Christ in order to be transformed into His glorious image 3:18 ; earthen vessels to contain the Christ of glory as the excellent treasure 4:7 .
[70]  Chapters three and four of 2 Corinthians are the most crucial chapters of both 1 and 2 Corinthians.
[71]  No other chapters in these Epistles are so related to the constitution of Christ for the deeper experience of life.
[72]  How could such a rebel against God become a minister of the new covenant, a minister of Christ for the carrying out of God s economy?
[73]  In verse 6 Paul says, Because the God Who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One Who shined in our hearts for the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
[74]  In verse 8 Paul says, We are afflicted in every way, but not straitened; perplexed, but not despairing.
[75]  This description of the apostles life from this verse through verse 18 shows that they lived a crucified life in resurrection, or the resurrection life under the killing of the cross, for the carrying out of their ministry.
[76]  In verse 13 Paul says, And having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke; we also believe, therefore also we speak.
[77]  Concerning the spirit in verse 13, Alford says, Not distinctly the Holy Spirit, but still not merely a human disposition: the indwelling Holy Spirit penetrates and characterizes the whole renewed man.
[78]  Grace, according to the context, is the very Christ who lives in the apostles as their life and life supply for them to live a crucified life for the manifestation of the resurrection life, that they may carry out their ministry for God s new covenant.
[79]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE ELEVEN THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT 4 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:16-18
[80]  In this message we come to the last three verses of chapter four, verses 16 through 18.
[81]  These verses are still related to the living of a crucified life for the manifestation of the resurrection life by the excellent power of the treasure in the earthen vessels.
[82]  In chapters three and four we see that first the apostles were constituted of God Himself.
[83]  Second Corinthians 5 continues the description of the New Testament ministers.
[84]  This description began in 3:12 with the word concerning their constitution.
[85]  In chapter four we see the way these ministers conduct themselves 4:1-6 , and we have a record regarding their living 4:7-18 .
[86]  They were constituted of the Triune God, they conducted themselves in such a way as to shine out the gospel of the glory of Christ, and they lived a crucified life for the manifestation of resurrection life.
[87]  Verse 3 continues, If indeed, being clothed, we shall not be found naked.
[88]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT 6 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 5:9-15
[89]  In chapters three and four Paul speaks concerning the qualifications of the New Testament ministers.
[90]  The first qualification is that of being constituted of the Triune God.
[91]  We become competent, sufficient, equipped, and qualified to be ministers of the new covenant by being thoroughly constituted of the Triune God, who is now the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.
[92]  As these ministers are constituted of such a One, the effectiveness of Christ s all-inclusive death operates within their being, terminating the old creation and killing the flesh and the natural life.
[93]  In addition to the desire to be raptured, we need an ambition to please the Lord.
[94]  Paul speaks of this in verse 9: Wherefore also we are ambitious, whether at home or away from home, to be well-pleasing to Him.
[95]  After describing the longing to be clothed upon with the transfigured body in 5:1-8, Paul goes on to speak concerning an ambition to please the Lord by living to Him 5:9-15 .
[96]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT 7 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 5:16-21 VI.
[97]  After speaking concerning the qualifications of the ministers of the new covenant in chapters three and four, Paul tells us of his longing to be raptured and of his ambition to please the Lord, not by working for Him but simply by living to Him.
[98]  Second Corinthians 5:16 says, So that we, from now on, know no one according to flesh; even if we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer.
[99]  Since the apostles judge that Christ s death makes us all, through His resurrection, a new man, a man not according to flesh, they from now on would know no one according to flesh.
[100]  They did know Christ in this way, but now they know Him so no longer.
[101]  In verse 20 Paul goes on to say, On behalf of Christ, then, we are ambassadors, as God entreating you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God.
[102]  Paul s use of the word ambassadors indicates that the apostles are commissioned with a definite ministry; they represent Christ to accomplish God s purpose.
[103]  In verse 19 it is the world that is reconciled to God; in verse 20 it is the believers, who have already been reconciled to God, who need to be reconciled to God further.
[104]  Hence, when Christ became a man in flesh John 1:14 , He was made sin not sinful on our behalf to be judged by God Rom 8:3 that we might become God s righteousness in Him.
[105]  In order to understand what it means to say that God made Christ sin on our behalf, we need to read John 1:14 and Romans 8:3.
[106]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTEEN A PATTERN OF LIVING CHRIST FOR THE CHURCH 1 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:8-9, 12, 17-22
[107]  For this reason, we should not remain in yesterday or try to live in tomorrow.
[108]  These chapters reveal how to enjoy Christ, how to take Christ as our life, how to live Christ so that we may have the church and that He may have the Body to fulfill God s eternal purpose.
[109]  In 1 Corinthians 1:30 we see certain aspects of this portion: But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, Who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.
[110]  As wisdom to us from God, Christ becomes our daily righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.
[111]  If we enjoy Him in this way, we can declare, Angels and demons, and all human beings, I am right with God and man.
[112]  In chapter six we see that Christ is the Spirit and that we are one spirit with Him 1 Cor 6:17 .
[113]  Eventually the Spirit will saturate us and cause even our physical bodies to become the members of Christ.
[114]  This means that not only is our spirit organically united with Him, but even our bodies become Christ s members.
[115]  But according to Christ s full salvation, which includes metabolic transformation, our body is grafted into Christ and becomes a member of Christ.
[116]  The divine administration is carried out by means of the church under the headship of Christ and of God.
[117]  Under this headship, the members of the body function with their gifts.
[118]  This is the operation which carries out God s administration.
[119]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SIXTEEN A PATTERN OF LIVING CHRIST FOR THE CHURCH 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:8-9, 12, 17-22
[120]  First Corinthians reveals the matter of living Christ for the church.
[121]  If we read this Epistle in a thoughtful way, we may wonder if there is a pattern of living Christ for the church.
[122]  We may say as we read this book, Paul, show us a pattern.
[123]  We have seen many things in our parents, relatives, neighbors, friends, and colleagues, but we have never seen a person living Christ for the church.
[124]  In 1:12 Paul also says that he conducted himself not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God.
[125]  First Corinthians reveals that the Triune God has been processed to become the life-giving Spirit for us to enjoy.
[126]  In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul says, But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.
[127]  This was the reason he could say, But God is faithful, that our word toward you is not yes and no; for the Son of God, Christ Jesus, Who was preached among you through us, through me and Sylvanus and Timothy, did not become yes and no, but in Him is yes vv.
[128]  My burden in this message is to point out that in the introductory word to 2 Corinthians Paul presents himself to the believers at Corinth as a pattern of a person who lives Christ for the church.
[129]  Paul seems to be saying, Corinthians, in my first Epistle I gave you a revelation of what it means to live Christ for the church.
[130]  Then we shall conduct ourselves in the grace of God, and we shall be one with the unchanging Christ of the faithful God, the Christ who is the unique yes.
[131]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN ATTACHED, ANOINTED, SEALED, CAPTURED,
[132]  In the previous message we saw a pattern of living Christ for the church.
[133]  Paul is not a pattern of living a certain culture; he is a pattern of living Christ for the church.
[134]  When we speak of living Christ for the church, we need to know who Christ is and also what the church is.
[135]  Therefore, if we would know what the church is, we must see that the church is the called assembly, the organic Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ and of God, the new man, the habitation of God, the lampstand, and the bride.
[136]  Let us take some examples from 1 Corinthians to illustrate what we mean by the feathers, skin, and meat in the Word.
[137]  First Corinthians 1:12 says, Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.
[138]  Regarding division, some of the Brethren teachers said something like this: In 1 Corinthians 1:12 Paul rebukes those who say that they are of Cephas, of Apollos, of Paul, and of Christ.
[139]  In the book of 1 Corinthians there are many feathers, and there is a great deal of skin.
[140]  But in our spiritual cooking we need to pay more attention to the meat.
[141]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN ATTACHED, ANOINTED, SEALED, CAPTURED,
[142]  TO SCATTER THE INCENSE OF CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:21-22; 2:14-16
[143]  According to his word in 2 Corinthians, if we would live Christ for the church, we need to be attached, anointed, sealed, captured, subdued, and led to scatter the incense of Christ.
[144]  In 2:14 Paul says, But thanks be to God, Who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and manifests through us the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place.
[145]  In 1:21 Paul says, But He Who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.
[146]  Paul was not attached to Christ in an individualistic way.
[147]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE NINETEEN COMPETENT OF CHRIST AS THE ALPHABET
[148]  In the book of 2 Corinthians, a very deep book, Paul presents himself as a pattern of living Christ for the church.
[149]  When you read chapter six of 1 Corinthians, what will attract your attention, the feathers or the meat?
[150]  Paul s word condemning fornication is a feather truth.
[151]  Anyone who is ethical or moral will appreciate Paul s word regarding this matter.
[152]  In reading this chapter, some Christians pay attention to verse 19, where Paul says that our body is the temple of God and that we should glorify God in our body because we have been purchased with a price.
[153]  Paul also knew how to use the divine typewriter to write Christ on others.
[154]  Whenever he was with the saints, he would write Christ upon them.
[155]  If Paul were to speak with you for a period of time, a certain amount of Christ, perhaps a paragraph, would be written on your heart.
[156]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY COMPETENT OF CHRIST AS THE ALPHABET
[157]  In 3:3 Paul says, Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.
[158]  To have this ink in our experience, we must enjoy Christ, possess Christ, be filled with Christ, be saturated with Christ, and be covered with Christ.
[159]  The title of this message is Competent of Christ as the Alphabet to Write Living Letters with the Life-giving Spirit of the Living God.
[160]  This title refers to the Triune God: Christ, the life-giving Spirit, and the living God.
[161]  Because we are competent of Christ, we may write living letters with the life-giving Spirit.
[162]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE SHINING THE GLORY OF THE NEW COVENANT 1 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:7-11, 18; John 17:1; Luke 24:26; Acts 3:15; Rom 6:4 TOUCHING THE INWARD REALITY OF THE WORD
[163]  In foregoing messages I have pointed out that if we would touch the meat in the Bible, we must go beyond the feathers and the skin.
[164]  Along with many other things, the Bible has both an outward appearance and an inward reality.
[165]  The first use of a divine title in the Bible is in Genesis 1:1: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth lit.
[166]  Those who regard it as heretical to speak of God having a wife know the Bible only in a superficial way.
[167]  They have not touched the depths of the Word.
[168]  The shining of the glory of the new covenant is actually the living of Christ.
[169]  This means that to live Christ is to shine forth the new covenant glory.
[170]  In 3:7 and 8 Paul says, Now if the ministry of death, in letters engraved in stone, came in glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to gaze at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, which was being done away, how shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit be in glory?
[171]  With this understanding, now we are able to answer the question concerning what the glory of the new covenant is.
[172]  Furthermore, this Christ in resurrection, or the resurrected Christ, is the life-giving Spirit.
[173]  Therefore, the glory of the new covenant as the resurrected Christ, or the resurrection of Christ, is the Spirit.
[174]  As the life-giving Spirit, the resurrected Christ dwells in us to make Himself and all He has accomplished, obtained, and attained real to us so that we may be one with Him and may be transformed into His image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
[175]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE BEING TRANSFORMED
[176]  Paul refers to this aspect in 1:9: But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have confidence in ourselves, but in God, Who raises the dead.
[177]  Related to this aspect are the matters of conducting ourselves not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God and of being one with the unchanging Christ of the faithful God.
[178]  Daily and even hourly, they were also in the process of being transformed into the same image, the image of the glorified Christ.
[179]  For many years I have been trying to understand the phrase from glory to glory used in 3:18.
[180]  I consulted a number of books, but I failed to find a satisfactory explanation.
[181]  What should we do when we realize that our behavior is copper and not gold?
[182]  In addition to the religious concepts that veil people, every person is veiled by certain natural concepts or ideas.
[183]  Often these veils are related to the kind of people we are by our natural constitution.
[184]  If you are a quiet person, you may prefer to worship God in a cathedral that has a high ceiling and stained glass windows and is dimly lit.
[185]  The title of this message is The Essence of the New Covenant Ministry.
[186]  The word essence is related to what Paul says concerning the glory and superiority of the ministry of the new covenant in 3:7-11.
[187]  The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not an instrument, such as a pen, but an element, the heavenly ink used in writing, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content for the writing of living letters that convey Christ.
[188]  Now we must go on to see certain terminology related to the ministry of the new covenant.
[189]  Let us consider the matters of the Spirit and righteousness in the light of our experience with the Lord.
[190]  When, as one who loves the Lord and seeks Him, you live Christ, do you not have the sense that within you there is something substantial, living, and active?
[191]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THE ESSENCE
[192]  Today many Christians talk about different ministries and speak of receiving all kinds of ministries.
[193]  In 4:1 Paul says, Therefore, having this ministry, as we have received mercy we do not lose heart.
[194]  As we pointed out in the foregoing message, the Spirit and righteousness are the two aspects of the essence which is inscribed into us by the ministry of the new covenant.
[195]  The living Spirit is the inward aspect, and the perfect righteousness is the outward aspect.
[196]  They expect that when they speak in the power of the Spirit, a large number of people will be gained for the Lord.
[197]  My ground for saying this is found in verse 6, where Paul says that God made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, not of letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
[198]  This understanding of the Spirit as the life supply is confirmed by Paul s word in Philippians 1:19: For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[199]  In 1 Corinthians 15:34 Paul says, Become sober righteously and do not sin, for some are ignorant of God.
[200]  In this verse, to become sober is to awake to soberness from a drunken stupor.
[201]  Anyone who is spiritually asleep is not right with God, with others, with himself, or with the church.
[202]  In 3:18 Paul uses a word which is a synonym of righteousness in 3:9.
[203]  When the righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled in us because we walk according to the Spirit, then we have righteousness.
[204]  Righteousness, as we pointed out in the previous message, signifies the expression of God, His image.
[205]  Because we have this expression as the spontaneous righteousness we live out by the Spirit of life, others can be convinced and subdued.
[206]  In Romans 8:4 Paul speaks of the righteous requirement of the law, and in verse 29 he speaks of the image of God s Son: Because whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers.
[207]  Revelation 19:7 and 8 say, Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready.
[208]  And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.
[209]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY THE MINISTERS AND THE MINISTRY
[210]  BECOMING ONE Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:8-9, 16-18; 4:6-7
[211]  Before we consider the matter of the ministers and the ministry becoming one, we need to consider the words of the Lord Jesus concerning righteousness.
[212]  This righteousness is Christ lived out from within us to be the expression of God and the kingdom of God.
[213]  In this chapter Paul gives us a strong indication that the ministry is just what the new covenant ministers are.
[214]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE THE MANIFESTATION OF LIFE
[215]  THROUGH THE KILLING OF THE CROSS 1 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:1-18 DOCTRINE AND EXPERIENCE
[216]  What kind of experience do we find in chapter four?
[217]  It is not the experience of salvation, justification, or forgiveness.
[218]  THROUGH THE KILLING OF THE CROSS 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:1-18
[219]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that 2 Corinthians 3 is a chapter on doctrine and that 2 Corinthians 4 is a chapter on experience.
[220]  Furthermore, we saw that what Paul speaks of in chapter four is a confirmation from his experience of what he says concerning the ministry in chapter three.
[221]  Whenever the Spirit is expressed as life, there will be righteousness.
[222]  When there is righteousness, everything will be calm, peaceful, and orderly.
[223]  If you experience this in your family life, your children will be calmed down, and your husband or wife will be subdued.
[224]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE THE PUTTING TO DEATH OF JESUS
[225]  We have seen that, as the continuation of 2 Corinthians 3, chapter four presents a picture of a life that enables the ministers of the new covenant to be one with their ministry.
[226]  The One who went to the cross to accomplish redemption for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose was not a great worker.
[227]  In 2 Corinthians 4 Paul does not boast of his work.
[228]  He does not say, Corinthians, you must realize that I am the foremost apostle.
[229]  AND THE RENEWING OF THE INWARD MAN 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:10-18
[230]  In this verse Paul speaks of the putting to death of Jesus.
[231]  The apostles were appointed by the Lord to be His followers.
[232]  They were appointed by Him not to do a great work, but to live a certain kind of life.
[233]  Therefore, they were not to accomplish a work by following a Christ who was great outwardly.
[234]  In 4:10 Paul says, Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body.
[235]  In verse 16 Paul goes on to say, Wherefore we do not lose heart, but if indeed our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day.
[236]  Let us now apply this matter to our daily living, especially to our family life and church life.
[237]  Suppose a young brother and sister in the church life get married.
[238]  The second kind of suffering Christians experience is suffering that comes from sins and mistakes.
[239]  If we are careless or foolish in the exercise of our responsibilities, we may suffer a certain kind of loss.
[240]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX A NEW CREATION IN CHRIST
[241]  In 5:1 Paul speaks of our earthly tabernacle house being taken down.
[242]  For our body as our earthly tabernacle house to be taken down is for our outward man to be consumed, wasted away.
[243]  Toward the end of 2 Corinthians 4, Paul says that our outward man is decaying, that our inward man is being renewed, and that we are not considering the things which are seen, but the things which are not seen.
[244]  What should we do while we are waiting to be clothed upon with a transfigured body?
[245]  In the foregoing message we covered a number of important points in 2 Corinthians 5: the aspiration to have a transfigured body, the ambition to please the Lord, living to the Lord, and being a new creation.
[246]  In verse 17 Paul speaks of the new creation: So that if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.
[247]  The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, the believers born again of God, does have the divine life and nature John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet 1:4 .
[248]  In verses 18 through 20 Paul goes on to speak of the ministry of reconciliation: But all things are of God, Who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation; how that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not accounting their offenses to them, and putting in us the word of reconciliation.
[249]  Although the Corinthians had been saved and reconciled to God halfway, they still lived in the flesh; that is, they lived in the soul, the outward man, the natural being.
[250]  The veil of the flesh, of the natural man, still separated them from God.
[251]  When the kingdom comes, there will be righteousness on earth.
[252]  Although the age of the kingdom has not yet come, we can have a foretaste of the righteousness of the kingdom today in the church life and in our family life.

[254]  As God s creatures, we were created by Him to fulfill His purpose.
[255]  When we were regenerated, the divine tea was added to us.
[256]  Prior to that time, whether our behavior was good or bad, we had only the element of humanity.
[257]  We praise the Lord that at the time of our regeneration God came into our being.
[258]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT 8 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 6:1-13 WHAT WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO
[259]  The section in this Epistle on the ministers of the new covenant is much longer than the section on the ministry of the new covenant.
[260]  The reason for this is that God cares much more for the ministers than He does for the ministry.
[261]  If we would have a proper understanding of what it means to work together with God, we need to recall what Paul said at the end of chapter five.
[262]  Paul has already said that he has been commissioned by God with the ministry of reconciliation, that is, with the work of reconciling others to God.
[263]  My understanding was that before we were saved, we were enemies of God, and there was no peace between us and God.
[264]  But when we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus, His blood washed away our sins, and we received God s forgiveness.
[265]  I have read a number of books which refer to this subject, but none of them pointed out that the ministry of reconciliation is not merely to bring sinners back to God, but, even the more, to bring believers absolutely into God.
[266]  The last verse of chapter five, verse 21, says, Him Who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God s righteousness in Him.
[267]  Until we are wholly one with the Lord, being in Him and allowing Him to be in us absolutely, we shall continue to need the ministry of reconciliation, the ministry with which Paul was commissioned.
[268]  Paul was commissioned with the work of bringing the believers into God in a way that was absolute and practical.
[269]  Once we see this, we are qualified to understand the last part of chapter five and the first part of chapter six.
[270]  In 6:1 and 2 we see the work of the reconciling ministry and in 6:3-13, the adequate life for the ministry.
[271]  From 6:3 to the end of chapter seven, the apostle depicts a life that is all-fitting for carrying out the new covenant ministry.
[272]  In verse 3 Paul says, We are giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that the ministry may not be blamed.
[273]  It is difficult to grasp the real meaning of the word rendered necessities.
[274]  Darby in his translation also uses the word necessities.
[275]  Watchings refer to sleeplessness, such as those experienced by the apostles in Acts 16:25; 20:7-11, 31; and 2 Thessalonians 3:8.
[276]  Paul refers to this in 2 Corinthians 11:27, speaking of in watchings often.
[277]  In 6:4-7a Paul lists eighteen qualifications of ministers of the new covenant: in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings, in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in a holy spirit, in unfeigned love, in the word of truth, and in the power of God.
[278]  From the middle of verse 7 through 10 Paul speaks of three groups of things and seven kinds of persons.
[279]  This indicates that the apostles life for their ministry is a life in the battle, fighting for God s kingdom.
[280]  In verse 9 Paul says, As unknown and well known.
[281]  The apostles were as unknown in that they did not display themselves.
[282]  But they were well known in the way of bearing witness to the truth of God.
[283]  In verse 11 Paul goes on to say, Our mouth is opened to you, Corinthians, our heart has been enlarged.
[284]  Many teachers of the Bible treat 2 Corinthians 6 as if it were separate from chapter five.
[285]  They do not point out how chapters five and six are connected.
[286]  We have seen that in chapter five the apostles have received the ministry of reconciliation to bring God s people, not only sinners, back into God Himself so that they may become the righteousness of God in Christ.
[287]  The apostles had been commissioned with this ministry to bring God s people into Him and to make them one with Him organically.
[288]  In 6:1 Paul says to the Corinthians, And working together with Him, we also entreat you that you do not receive the grace of God in vain.
[289]  Here Paul seems to be saying, Believers at Corinth, don t receive God s grace in vain.
[290]  Since you have received so much of God s grace, I beg you not to receive it in vain.
[291]  In verse 1, however, Paul does not speak about receiving God s grace; he warns about receiving God s grace in vain.
[292]  We have also seen that to be fully reconciled and saved is to have our hearts enlarged.
[293]  In 6:14-16 the apostle uses five illustrations to depict the difference between believers and unbelievers: no partnership, no share, between righteousness and lawlessness; no fellowship, no communion, between light and darkness; no harmony, no concord, between Christ and Belial; no part, no portion, held by a believer with an unbeliever; and no agreement, no consent, between the temple of God and idols.
[294]  These illustrations also unveil the fact that the believers are righteousness, light, Christ, and the temple of God, and the unbelievers are lawlessness, darkness, Belial Satan the Devil , and idols.
[295]  In verse 14 Paul says, What partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?
[296]  Verse 18 continues, And I will be a Father to you, and you shall be sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty.
[297]  Literally the Greek word rendered by the indefinite article before Father means into, unto, for.
[298]  I believe that in verse 18 Paul wants us to see that we are not only precious to God as sons, but we are also dear to Him as daughters.
[299]  Chapter seven is also part of the section in 2 Corinthians concerning the ministers of the new covenant.
[300]  In this section Paul portrays the kind of life lived by the ministers of the new covenant.
[301]  In this message we shall seek to touch the feeling in Paul s spirit as expressed in 7:2-7.
[302]  Now we see that we should be not merely gospel preachers, but ministers of the new covenant, those who minister Christ as life so that the church may be built up as the Body of Christ.
[303]  It is possible to become knowledgeable in spiritual matters and powerful in preaching and yet still be unfruitful.
[304]  In fact, instead of being fruitful and ministering life, such a person may cause others to suffer death.
[305]  In verse 13 he says that he rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus.
[306]  In 7:2 and 3 Paul says, Make room for us; we wronged no one, we corrupted no one, we took advantage of no one.
[307]  I do not say this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together.
[308]  Paul s word here reveals his deep, intimate concern for the Corinthians.
[309]  Verse 10 says, For the sorrow according to God works repentance unto salvation, a repentance without regret; but the sorrow of the world works death.
[310]  Salvation here refers to being reconciled to God 5:20 .
[311]  In verse 11 Paul continues, For behold this very thing, your being made sorrowful according to God, what earnestness it wrought in you, moreover, what defense, moreover, what indignation, moreover, what fear, moreover, what longing, moreover, what zeal, moreover, what avenging!
[312]  In verse 12 Paul goes on to say, So then, even if I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of him who did the wrong, nor for the sake of him who was wronged, but for the sake of manifesting to you your earnestness on our behalf before God.
[313]  Here Paul says that he wrote to the Corinthians not for the sake of the brother who had committed incest 1 Cor 5:1 , the one who did the wrong, nor for the sake of that brother s father, the one who was wronged.
[314]  Paul wrote the Epistles of 1 and 2 Corinthians as a loving father.
[315]  Today it is common for Christians to engage in fund raising to meet the need for material supply.
[316]  Often, fund-raising letters are sent out to encourage Christians to give.
[317]  If you compare these fund-raising letters with what Paul has written in 2 Corinthians 8 and 9, those letters will be exposed as being worthless.
[318]  Paul does not merely talk about money; he speaks concerning the grace of God in a way that is full of life and the Spirit.
[319]  In verse 2 Paul links the abundance of their joy and the depth of their poverty.
[320]  In verse 6 Paul continues, So that we entreated Titus that, even as he began before, so also he would complete in you this grace also.
[321]  The word also indicates that besides this grace, the grace of giving, there were other graces completed by Titus among the Macedonian believers.
[322]  In verse 7 Paul says, But just as you abound in everything, in faith, and in word, and in knowledge, and in all earnestness, and in the love which is in you from us, see that you may abound in this grace also.
[323]  In the fellowship concerning the ministry to the saints, the apostle refers to the grace of God given to the Macedonian believers to motivate and enable them to give with liberality, the grace of the apostles allowing the believers to participate in the ministry to the needy saints, and the grace of the believers to minister the material things to the needy ones.
[324]  In verses 8 and 9 Paul goes on to say, I am not speaking by way of command, but proving through the earnestness of others the genuineness also of your love; for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, being rich, for your sakes He became poor, in order that you by His poverty might become rich.
[325]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FORTY-SEVEN THE APOSTLE S FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING
[326]  THE MINISTRY TO THE NEEDY SAINTS 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 8:16-24
[327]  In 8:16-24 we have a section of this Epistle showing us what kind of persons the apostles were.
[328]  As we read this chapter, it may seem to us that this fellowship is finished by verse 15, that it is perfect and complete.
[329]  Paul not only had fellowship with the saints in Corinth concerning this matter, but he also presented to them the description of a situation that assured them that what he was doing was being carried out in a very proper way.
[330]  In this section of 2 Corinthians there is no doctrine or theology, no mention of spiritual gift or power.
[331]  What, then, do we have here that is worthy of an entire message?
[332]  We have a picture of the kind of life Paul lived.
[333]  In chapter nine of 2 Corinthians Paul gives an additional word concerning the ministry to the needy saints.
[334]  It may seem to us that this chapter is not necessary, for we may think that what Paul says in chapter eight is sufficient.
[335]  If you read these two chapters again, you may consider that regarding the ministry to the needy saints, the first part alone of chapter eight is adequate and that the last part of chapter eight and all of chapter nine are not actually necessary.
[336]  In the wilderness the children of Israel did not do any farming, sowing, or reaping.
[337]  According to chapter nine, our giving equals not only our gathering, as in chapter eight, but also equals sowing.
[338]  In chapter nine Paul goes on to liken our giving to the sowing of seed.
[339]  Because his deep thought was not fully expressed in chapter eight, Paul went on to write another chapter related to giving.
[340]  Paul s thought here is that we must sow and then we shall reap.
[341]  In 9:6 Paul says, But this: he who sows sparingly, sparingly also shall reap; and he who sows with blessings, with blessings also shall reap.
[342]  It is a natural law ordained by God that if we sow sparingly, we shall also reap sparingly, but if we sow with blessings, we shall also reap with blessings.
[343]  In verse 7 Paul continues, Each one as he has purposed in his heart, not out of sorrow or of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver.
[344]  From his study of the Old Testament, Paul realized that God takes care of His people s needs.
[345]  God is able to feed His people in a miraculous way.
[346]  God cares for us and feeds us in two ways: the way of miracle and the way of natural law.
[347]  Do you not realize that God has miraculously taken care of you and that you live by His miracles?
[348]  As we read the book of 2 Corinthians, we may think that by the end of chapter nine Paul has covered all the necessary points and that there is no need for him to write further.
[349]  However, in the last four chapters of this Epistle Paul covers another crucial matter which is in his heart.
[350]  In 10:1 Paul says that he entreats through the meekness and forbearance of Christ.
[351]  This indicates that the apostle, being firmly attached to Christ 1:21 and one with Him, lives by Him, behaving in His virtues.
[352]  All the virtues of Christ were becoming Paul s virtues.
[353]  Christ s meekness is not a simple matter, for it is in His humanity and by the divine life.
[354]  In verse 3 Paul goes on to speak of spiritual warfare: For walking in flesh, we do not war according to flesh.
[355]  Being human, the apostles are still in the flesh.
[356]  In verses 4 and 5 Paul continues, For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful to God to the overthrow of strongholds, overthrowing reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and taking captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ.
[357]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE PAUL S VINDICATION
[358]  OF HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 10:7-18
[359]  In 10:7-18 Paul speaks concerning the measure of God s rule.
[360]  If anyone has confidence in himself to be of Christ, let him account this again as to himself, that even as he is of Christ, so also are we.
[361]  Verse 13 says, But we will not boast without measure, but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach even as far as you.
[362]  The apostle is bold, but he is not bold without limit.
[363]  Some young people have been brought down by their married life.
[364]  As the book of 1 Corinthians indicates, there were many problems among the Corinthians.
[365]  But through Paul s first Epistle to the Corinthians, many of them were brought back to the Lord.
[366]  Although Paul is strong in chapter ten, he is even stronger in chapter eleven.
[367]  In 11:13-15 he says concerning the Judaizers, For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ.
[368]  In chapter eleven of 2 Corinthians, Paul had to deal with the situation in a church that had been directly raised up by him.
[369]  Certain false apostles, deceitful workers, ministers of Satan, visited the church in Corinth and stirred up rebellion against Paul and his teaching.
[370]  Even though Paul had come to Corinth first and had brought many Corinthians to the Lord through his preaching, the Corinthian believers still accepted the false apostles.
[371]  Because Paul was wise, he did not argue with the Judaizers concerning doctrine.
[372]  Instead, he told the Corinthians that he was jealous over them with a jealousy of God.
[373]  He went on to say that he had betrothed them to one husband in order to present a pure virgin to Christ.
[374]  In 11:3 Paul says, But I fear lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your thoughts should be corrupted from the singleness and the purity which is toward Christ.
[375]  Here the Apostle Paul indicates that the teachings of the Judaizers can be compared to the deceitful word spoken by the serpent to Eve in Genesis 3.
[376]  I would like to point out something important related to the genuine gospel, the sincere spirit, and the real Jesus.
[377]  Whenever there is the preaching of the genuine gospel and the real Jesus with a sincere spirit, the Lord Jesus will be ministered to others so that they may appreciate Him, love Him, follow Him, and take Him as everything.
[378]  Throughout the centuries, many have preached from the Bible and taught the Bible, but their preaching and teaching nevertheless distracted the believers from the precious Person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[379]  This life, signified by the tree of life, is God Himself in Christ as the Spirit.
[380]  The best way to discern a matter is to discern according to life or death.
[381]  We need to ask questions like this: Does this teaching help me to enjoy the Lord more and bring me into life, or does it cause the poison of death to be injected into me?
[382]  You may find that if you accept a certain kind of teaching or preaching, taking it into you, immediately your inward enjoyment of the Lord is cut off.
[383]  Thus far we have covered three aspects of Paul s vindication of his apostolic authority: his warring according to the Spirit, the measure of God s rule, and his jealousy for Christ over the believers against the false apostles.
[384]  In this message we shall consider a fourth aspect, Paul s compelled boasting.
[385]  In verse 21 Paul says, also ironically, I speak by way of dishonor, as though we have been weak; but in whatever anyone is daring, I speak in foolishness, I also am daring.
[386]  Here Paul seems to be saying, I forget about my standing, my honor, and my glory.
[387]  We need to understand why Paul wrote these verses in the way he did.
[388]  By writing this chapter in the way he did, Paul made it clear not only to the believers at Corinth, but to all believers in Christ throughout the centuries, what God s way is.
[389]  Second Corinthians 12:1-10 is an excellent portion of the Word.
[390]  According to verses 2 through 5, Paul regards himself as two persons.
[391]  In verse 2 he says, I know a man in Christ.
[392]  Referring to this man in Christ, he says in verse 5, On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.
[393]  The man in Christ in verse 2 is the apostle v. 7 , not as the old creation but as the new creation 5:17 . In this section the apostle desires to boast of the new creation in Christ by boasting of his weaknesses in the flesh, the old creation vv.
[394]  Paul, the new man in Christ, was on the one hand caught away to the third heaven.
[395]  On the other hand, he was caught away to Paradise, the comfortable section of Hades.
[396]  Because Paul came to know the things in heaven and the things under the earth as well as the things on earth, he had a complete view of the universe.
[397]  Verses 8 and 9 say, Concerning this I entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from me.
[398]  And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.
[399]  Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.
[400]  Sufferings and trials are often the Lord s ordination for us, that we may experience Christ as grace and power.
[401]  OF HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY 7 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 12:11-18 A WORD FOR ALL BELIEVERS
[402]  What Paul covers in 12:11-18 is neglected by many Christian workers today.
[403]  All the saints in the Lord s recovery need to understand what these verses reveal, for they apply to all of us, not only to those who are elders or co-workers.
[404]  The New Testament reveals that all believers in Christ should, like Paul, live a life for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[405]  In verse 12 Paul goes on to say, Indeed, the signs of the apostle were wrought among you in all endurance, by signs and wonders and works of power.
[406]  The signs are attesting miracles that furnish credentials of apostleship, the wonders are startling and awakening miracles, and the works of power are miracles that demonstrate God s power.
[407]  I believe that the expression the signs of the apostle was used first by the Corinthians, not by Paul.
[408]  Verse 14 says, Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be an encumbrance; for I do not seek what is yours, but you; for the children ought not to store up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
[409]  In this verse we have a very important word: I do not seek what is yours, but you.
[410]  Whenever we work for the Lord, we should not seek what belongs to others we should seek them.
[411]  Verse 16 says, But let it be so, I did not burden you, but being crafty I took you with guile.
[412]  As we have pointed out, this is what some Corinthians charged against the apostle.
[413]  OF HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY 8 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 12:19 13:10 SPEAKING BEFORE GOD IN CHRIST
[414]  In 12:19 Paul says, All this time you are thinking that we are defending ourselves to you.
[415]  Before God, in Christ we speak; but all things, beloved, are for your building up.
[416]  In 13:1 Paul goes on to say, This third time I am coming to you.
[417]  At the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.
[418]  In verse 2 Paul says, I have previously said as present the second time, and I say beforehand, being absent now, to those who have sinned before and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare.
[419]  In verse 5 Paul says to the Corinthians, Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves; or do you not recognize yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?
[420]  To test is to determine our condition; to prove is to qualify our status.
[421]  If anyone is in the objective faith, he surely has the subjective faith, and believes in Christ and the entire content of God s New Testament economy.
[422]  Verse 9 says, For we rejoice whenever we are weak and you are powerful; this also we pray for, your perfecting.
[423]  But I would surely agree if you would say that I am an apostle in the sense of being sent by God to minister Christ to others and impart Christ into them, so that they may become sons of God and members of Christ and be caused to grow in life and built up as the Body of Christ.
[424]  In this message we shall consider the last four verses of 2 Corinthians, 13:11-14.
[425]  In verse 11 Paul also tells the Corinthians to be encouraged.
[426]  The apostles are encouraged by the God of all encouragement 1:3-6 .
[427]  In his first Epistle 1 Cor 1:10 , Paul had already exhorted them to think the same thing: But I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.
[428]  According to Paul s word in verse 11, if we rejoice, are perfected, are encouraged, think the same thing, and are at peace, then the God of love and peace will be with us.
[429]  The Corinthians were lacking in love 1 Cor 8:1; 13:1-3, 13; 14:1 and short of peace through being disturbed by the distracting teachings and confusing concepts.
[430]  Hence, the apostle wishes that the God of love and peace shall be with them for their adjusting and perfecting.
[431]  They need the love and peace of God to fill them that they may walk according to love Rom 14:15; Eph 5:2 and have peace with one another Rom 14:19; Heb 12:14 .
[432]  LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-NINE FINAL EXHORTATIONS, GREETING, AND BLESSING 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 13:11-14 A THREEFOLD BLESSING
[433]  In 13:14 we have a threefold blessing: The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
[434]  In the preceding paragraph we twice used the word hypostases.
[435]  Just before He was crucified in the flesh and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 , He unveiled His mysterious trinity to His disciples in plain words John 14 17 stating that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son 14:9-11 , that the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son 14:16-20 , that the Three, coexisting and coinhering simultaneously, are abiding with the believers for their enjoyment 14:23; 16:7-10; 17:21-23 , and that all the Father has is the Son s, and all the Son possesses is received by the Spirit to be revealed to the believers 16:13-15 .
[436]  After His resurrection, Christ charged His disciples to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit Matt 28:19 , that is, to bring the believing ones into the Triune God, into an organic union with the processed God, who has passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion and has entered into resurrection.
[437]  It is based upon such an organic union that at the conclusion of his second Epistle to the Corinthians the apostle blesses the believers with the blessed Trinity in the participation of the Son s grace with the Father s love through the Spirit s fellowship.
[438]  In this Trinity, God the Father operates all things in all the members in the church, which is the Body of Christ, through the ministries of the Lord, God the Son, by the gifts of God the Spirit 1 Cor 12:4-6 .
[439]  The entire divine revelation in the book of Ephesians concerning the producing, existing, growing, building up, and fighting of the church as the Body of Christ is composed of this divine economy, the dispensing of the Triune God into the members of the Body of Christ.
[440]  Chapter two shows us that in the divine Trinity all the believers, both Jewish and Gentile, have access unto God the Father, through God the Son, in God the Spirit v. 18 . This also indicates that the Three coexist and coinhere simultaneously, even after all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.
[441]  In the book of Revelation he blesses the churches in different localities with grace and peace from God the Father, Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from God the Spirit, the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from God the Son, Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth 1:4-5 .
[442]  Thus, it is evident that the divine revelation of the trinity of the Godhead in the Holy Word, from Genesis through Revelation, is not for the study of theology, but for the apprehension of how God in His mysterious and marvelous trinity dispenses Himself into His chosen people, that we as His chosen and redeemed people may, as indicated in the apostle s blessing to the Corinthian believers, participate in, experience, enjoy, and possess the processed Triune God now and for eternity.
