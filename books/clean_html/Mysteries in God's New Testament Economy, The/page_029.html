<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The True Vine, as a Portrait of Christ,<br>Being an Organism by which the Triune God<br>Accomplishes His Eternal Economy</H2><P>The true vine in John 15, as a portrait of Christ, is the organism of the Triune God by which He accomplishes His eternal economy. This true vine is the organism in the eternal economy of the Triune God. The Lord Jesus is the tree. We are the branches. When we are joined to and mingled with Him, we become the organism of the Triune God. The Triune God is operating and working in this true vine today. Hence, we should not despise ourselves, for we are the Body of Christ. We have a part in the true vine that the Triune God is cultivating. This is a tremendous thing. Today amidst the fallen and desolate Christianity, we are the center of the organism of the Triune God. This is our source. We should never forget or neglect this. The Lord's recovery is carrying out the mingling of the Triune God with this organism so that He can live, operate, and work here for the wheel of His economy to be turned.</P><P>Hence, from the true vine in John 15, we can see that the organism of the Triune God is a tree with life. It is organic and can produce fruit. It is not like the wooden table which has no life, which is organizational, and which cannot produce fruit. Since we are the branches of this vine tree, we are organic. We are not placed on a wooden table. Rather, we grow on a tree. For the branches to be on a tree is something organic rather than organizational. Only a fabricated tree is organizational. A real tree is not organizational. That is why a real tree will grow, and its growth will eventually bear fruit. Since we are the branches of the tree, we are organic and can grow and bear fruit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>This Organism Being the Structure<br>of the Union and Mingling<br>of All the Believers with the Triune God</H2><P>Furthermore, this organism is the structure of the union and mingling of all the believers with the Triune God (Eph. 4:4-6). This is truly a tremendous thing. We who have believed in Him are now able to be joined to and mingled with Him. In this structure of union and mingling, God the Father is the person. He is over all, managing and caring for all, and is through all, penetrating and joining all, and is even in us all, dwelling and living in all. In addition, God the Son is here as the element and factor of life. Through baptism, we the believers have been cut off from the element of the old Adamic life, and through believing, we have been joined to the element of Christ's new life. Moreover, we have God the Spirit as the essence of life. The Spirit of the life of Christ is the essence of the Body of Christ. The hope is the saturation of the Body of Christ with the splendor of this essence that the Body of Christ may enter into the glory of the life of Christ (Col. 1:27). Now we are all in the organism of the Triune God. This Christ who is the Spirit of life is saturating us continually with His essence until we express the splendor of this essence, which is the redemption of our bodies into glory.</P>
