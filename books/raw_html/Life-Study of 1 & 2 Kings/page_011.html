<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE REIGN OF SOLOMON</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Kings 2:12&#151;3:28</H1><P>My burden in these messages on 1 and 2 Kings is concerned not with the historical facts but with the intrinsic revelation in these books. We can know the historical facts simply by our reading. However, to know the intrinsic revelation conveyed and hidden in the holy Word, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation (Eph. 1:17). We need a spirit of revelation to see the intrinsic content of the holy Word and a spirit of wisdom to understand it, to interpret it, and even to present it to others.</P><P>In this message we will begin to consider the reign of Solomon. Those who know something about the Bible and even the worldly people appraise Solomon very highly. On the one hand, I also appreciate Solomon. On the other hand, because I have seen the intrinsic revelation in the Scriptures, I feel sorry for Solomon, who eventually had a great failure. He was a wise king, and the nations came to listen to his word of wisdom. The reign of Solomon was, therefore, a time of glory and splendor. But Solomon loved many foreign women; he had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, and he built worship places for them (1 Kings 11:1-8). Such a thing, which is beyond our understanding, led to the loss of the good land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. FORTY YEARS IN JERUSALEM</H2><P>Solomon reigned forty years in Jerusalem, from 1015-975 B.C. (2:12&#151;11:42).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE ORIGIN OF SOLOMON</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Begotten of David the King</H2><P>Solomon was begotten of David the king (2 Sam. 12:24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Born of Bath-sheba</H2><P>Solomon was born of Bath-sheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite, and, hence, most probably a Hittite herself (Matt. 1:6b), a Gentile woman.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. A Very Sinful Source, Pardoned by God</H2><P>The origin of Solomon was thus from a very sinful source, pardoned by God (2 Sam. 11:1&#151;12:15a).</P>
