[1]  THE KEY TO PRAYER Scripture Reading: Matt 7:8; Isa 62:6-7
[2]  "Then a voice came out of heaven: I have both glorified it and will glorify it again" v. 28 . If this is the way the Son of God, as the Son of Man, prayed to God on the earth, how dare we on the impulse of the moment open our lips and utter rash prayers! It is essential that we learn the key to prayer.
[3]  So He prayed a second time, "My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done" v. 42 . He prayed a third time, "saying the same word again" v. 44 . When He was utterly clear concerning the Father's will, He said to His disciples, "The hour has drawn near....Arise, let us be going" v. 45-46 . If our Lord as a man on the earth mastered the key to prayer and set Himself aside in order to seek after God's will, how dare we randomly utter a few words in prayer and conclude we have discerned God's will!
[4]  But it is amazing that the Lord "did not answer her a word" v. 23 . The disciples seemed to be in sympathy with her because they said on her behalf, "Send her away, for she is crying out after us" v. 23 . But what did the Lord reply to them? He said, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel" v. 24 . The Lord's reply gave the woman the key to approach Him.
[5]  Having looked at these illustrations related to prayer, bear in mind that as we pray we should heed the inner voice and not be governed by our circumstances, thoughts, or affections.
[6]  When that still small voice within tells us to pray, when in the depths of our being we have a sense that we should pray, then we should pray at once.
[7]  Circumstances should only be a means of driving us into the presence of God to wait on Him; they should not be our master, and we should not be hindered by them from praying.
