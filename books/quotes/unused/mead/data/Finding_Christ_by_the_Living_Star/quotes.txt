[1]  The second matter, or we may say the second case, is that of finding Christ the wise men were guided by the heavenly star to find the living Christ.
[2]  Now we come to the case in Matthew chapter 2, the matter of finding Christ.
[3]  You may study the Scriptures and obtain a degree in that, and you may learn all that the Bible has to say about Christ, but you simply cannot determine when the star will come.
[4]  Now consider what the wise men did: they saw the heavenly star and they followed it, but they made a great mistake.
[5]  I do believe that if they had not turned to their natural concept, but continually looked away to the star in the sky, the star would have gone before them all the time, leading them directly to the place where Jesus was.
[6]  When you get into religion, you miss the star, but when you leave religion, the star appears to you.
[7]  They saw Christ and they worshipped Him; then we read in the Bible some significant words they were warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, so they departed into their own country "another way."
[8]  After you have seen the living Christ, you will always take another way; you will never go the same way as you came.
[9]  And when you come and see, do not see Him after the flesh.
[10]  They did not say, "We have seen a star," or "We have seen the star," but, "We have seen His star."
[11]  The star in Matthew 2 is just the beginning of this matter in the New Testament.
[12]  If we go to the last book, the Book of Revelation, we see two things: the first is that the Lord Jesus is the star, not the evening star but the morning star; secondly, we see that all the angels of the churches are stars.
[13]  In this book we have Christ as the morning star and those faithful followers of Christ in the churches as the stars.
[14]  If you would see the star today, there is no need for you to look to the sky, there is no need for you to do as those wise men.
[15]  So many of us have proved this by our experience: when we were in religion we simply had the sense of being in darkness, but when the Lord brought us into the local churches, Hallelujah, we saw the star, the brightness of the star.
[16]  In the Bible we not only see how we may follow the star, but even become one of the stars.
[17]  We not only have the star shining within us, but by looking to the star and following in the Spirit we become the stars.
[18]  I believe that many of you have become acquainted with Brother Watchman Nee.
[19]  His word may not be clear, but he himself is transparent, and when you are in his presence, you have the sense not only that he is transparent, but that you are made clear.
[20]  If we take heed to the sure Word, we will have the star rising within us; then if we are faithful simply to follow the inner, rising star, we will be fully in the Spirit and eventually we will be the stars in the local church, not in an objective way, but in a very subjective way.
[21]  There is also a negative aspect to the stars the wandering stars.
[22]  Jude 12 and 13 tell us, "These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots...wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever."
