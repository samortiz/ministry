   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>25 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD THE MARRIAGE OF ISAAC A TYPE OF CHRIST MARRYING THE CHURCH And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis 24:63-64 Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Revelation 19:7</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible is a divine book composed with the divine concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because of this, it contains many wonderful records, of which Genesis 24 is one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This chapter not only unfolds a living in oneness with God; it also implies something deeper than human living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the reason that it is difficult for the human mind to fathom the depths of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the surface of Genesis 24, we have a record of human living, but in its depths there lies something divine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although it is easy to view the surface, it is difficult to probe into the depths.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Genesis 24 we see a marriage which is a type of Christ marrying the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the New Testament we cannot find a verse which says that this marriage is a type of Christ marrying the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the New Testament clearly reveals that Isaac, the son of Abraham, was a type of Christ being Abraham's unique seed Gal 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Based upon the fact that Isaac was a type of Christ, we may infer that Isaac's marriage was a type of the marriage of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because the Bible is a divine book composed with the divine concepts, we can see these concepts in the various biblical records.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, we are all familiar with the story of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although there is no word in the New Testament saying that Joseph was a type of Christ, any reader of the Bible can recognize that Joseph's story closely resembles that of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some Bible teachers say that we should not allegorize anything in the Scriptures unless the New Testament indicates that it is an allegory or a type of certain spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But we should not insist on this, for although the New Testament does not say that Joseph was a type of Christ, every Bible teacher recognizes that Joseph was an excellent type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we read the story of Joseph, we see that it depicts the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many incidents in Joseph's life, such as his betrayal, are similar to those in the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the same principle, because Isaac is a type of Christ and because the marriage of Isaac resembles the marriage of Christ, we may say that the marriage recorded in Genesis 24 is a type of the marriage of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Genesis 24 we have four main persons: the father, the son, the servant, and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we come to the New Testament, we see that the Triune God is working together to obtain a bride for the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is the subject of the New Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you say that the subject of the New Testament is just Jesus as our Savior, I would say that this is good, but that it is not all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The subject of the New Testament is the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, working together to obtain the bride for the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Father made the plan, the Spirit carries out the Father's plan, and the Son enjoys what the Father has planned and what the Spirit carries out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Who is the bride?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The bride is a part of the human race which will marry the Son and become His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Matthew 28:19 speaks of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Acts and Epistles we see how the Spirit works according to the Father's plan to obtain the bride for the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the end of the New Testament, in the book of Revelation, we see the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Revelation 19:7 says, "The marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ultimately, the whole New Jerusalem, a city-lady, will be the bride Rev 21:2, 9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although such a term as city-lady may sound strange, there is nothing wrong with using it, because the New Jerusalem will be a female, the wife of the Lamb, the counterpart of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The entire New Testament is simply a record of the Triune God working together to gain a part of the human race to be the bride, the counterpart, of the Son.</S>
