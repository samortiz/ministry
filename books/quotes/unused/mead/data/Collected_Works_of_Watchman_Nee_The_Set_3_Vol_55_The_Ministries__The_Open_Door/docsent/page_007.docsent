   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WAITING FOR CONFIRMATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The brothers and sisters here are very burning.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There have been three baptism meetings since January with a total of forty-eight people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They all miss you since you left, even though they do not know you because they are new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They have heard so much about you that they feel they know you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>May you not forget the seeds you sowed with tears for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I came from Tai-Yuan to Tien-Shui, the call I received was for six months.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now there are just a few more days left.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>My time will be fulfilled on the twenty-third.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am still not clear if the Lord will lead me to leave Tien-Shui or to stay here.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although I have called you an old prophet and insulted you before, my original going from Tien-Shui to Tai-Yuan and then from Tai-Yuan to Tien-Shui was through your confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You have always been the one who gave me confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This time cannot be any exception.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please confirm again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I will not be useful at all if I continue staying here.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, I am immature in life; second, I do not have light; and third, I stutter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The brothers and sisters all need feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are starving, and I cannot serve anything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I beg you to tell me briefly the important points of the messages released by the senior ones especially concerning the practical matter of life and the foundational lessons .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am really like someone walking in a black cave.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I cannot see or feel my way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Liu Shao-wu</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>April 15, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Mailing Address: 1 Cheng-Yuan Alley, Tien-Shui, Kansu</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THINGS LEARNED IN THE PAST TWO YEARS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the past few years, I have felt the need to step back because of the things that happened in the churches in Manchuria.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have not dared to touch the things which the Lord commissioned to me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result, I have not had much fellowship with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He tears down, and He builds up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He skins and wounds, but He also nourishes and bandages.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He led me into the valley of death, and He also caused me to begin again in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I know God and the sweetness of living in His presence in the spirit of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I used to suffer by having His presence and then losing it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have recently gained some experience in continuous fellowship and in continuously turning inward.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sometimes I am not faithful, but I immediately confess my sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through the blood I can still peacefully lift my heart back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The work, the environment, and my position cannot really affect me inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I do not allow them to entangle me or rob me of my central service.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For the past two years I have struggled to keep myself out of any kind of entangled condition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Presently, I can rest a little.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, I do not want to lose my zeal for the work and my impetus for resisting the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes when I am pulled away from the center, I return to the Lord as soon as I feel empty inside.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I really feel that that day is drawing near, yet my experience of life is still so shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I really am short of His glory!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I recently learned that you had returned to Shanghai and had had some fellowship with the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I desperately want to join you and receive teaching and correction from all the leading brothers, but the time and environment do not allow me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is really impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord's way is higher than my way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Perhaps the Lord is removing my spiritual laziness through this, that I might draw closer to Him and learn to be led into the hidden places of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I can only yield to Him obediently.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The only problem is that I am foolish and shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am afraid to miss the teaching from the leading brothers and fall into darkness and be shut out of the Lord's central work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a small thing for me to lose the blessing, but I must pay attention to the Lord's heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have recently written a letter to the brothers and sisters in Shen-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am enclosing a copy of that letter.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am begging for your comment and corrections.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I bear much of the blame for all that has happened in the churches in Manchuria.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Before God and before the church, I feel that there is only one reason for this: I do not have enough growth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If I prostrate myself humbly before the Lord and give myself to be thoroughly dealt with by Him, nothing is beyond hope of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are immature in Manchuria and lack spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is a great possibility we will be cheated and fall into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, I want to lay my condition and the content of that letter before you, brother.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I hope you can give me some advice and tell me which way I should go from now on.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you feel to show the letter to some other mature brothers and sisters, I am very willing to receive their teaching and care in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord's children in Ch'ang-ch'un have been blessed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He has kept us and watched over us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At the same time, He has built us up.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I hope you will remember us in your prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are lambs between Satan's teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I greet you with peace in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Greet the brothers and sisters in the Lord in Shanghai for me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hwa Tien-min</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>April 5, 1949</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Mailing Address: 101 West 4th Street, Ch'ang-ch'un</S>
