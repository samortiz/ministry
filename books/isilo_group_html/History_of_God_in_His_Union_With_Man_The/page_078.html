THE TRIUNE GOD'S PREPARATION FOR<br>THE CARRYING OUT OF HIS ETERNAL ECONOMY</H2><P>The entire Old Testament was the Triune God's preparation for the carrying out of His eternal economy. We may wonder why there are so many stories and events recorded in the Old Testament. The events in the life of Jacob are very peculiar. He and his twin brother Esau were struggling with each other even within their mother's womb (Gen. 25:22-23). Then Jacob struggled with his brother to come out of the womb as the first, and he was holding his brother's heel at birth (vv. 24-26). Later, he bought the birthright from his brother for a bowl of soup (vv. 27-34). Then he cheated his father to obtain the blessing of the firstborn son (ch. 27). Because of the threatening of Esau, he was forced to leave his father, his loving mother, his home, and his country. Then as he traveled to his uncle Laban's house, he was forced to sleep in the open air.</P><P>When he arrived at his uncle Laban's home, his cousin Rachel met him and he wept due to his long, lonely journey (29:1-14). He had to serve under an uncle who was always trying to deceive him. Laban promised Jacob that if he would serve him for seven years, he would give him his daughter Rachel. But when his seven years were completed, he gave Jacob his daughter Leah. He made Jacob agree to serve another seven years so that he could marry Rachel. Eventually, Jacob took the handmaids of Leah and Rachel as his wives. He married four wives and begot eleven sons by fourteen years of hard labor and much grinding under his wives (29:15&#151;30:24). Laban was subtle, but Jacob was even more subtle. Jacob eventually became rich by deceiving his uncle Laban with his subtle skill (30:25-43). Later, Jacob wrestled with God (32:24-32).</P><P>Many things related to the life of Jacob are very strange. When we read the strange occurrences in the life of Jacob, we may wonder why they are recorded in the holy Word. We need to realize that the life of Jacob was part of the Triune God's preparation for the carrying out of His eternal economy. Without all these things that happened in the Old Testament, Christ could never have been born; God could never have become flesh to be a man through His incarnation. The history in the entire Old Testament is God's preparation for the carrying out of His eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Initiating It in a Man</H2><P>This preparation for the carrying out of God's eternal economy was initiated in a man (Adam&#151;Gen. 1:1&#151;11:26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Issuing in Three Persons</H2><P>This initiation eventually issued in three persons&#151;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Gen. 11:27&#151;50:26).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_077.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_079.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The History of God in His Union With Man &nbsp; pg 78</div><br></body></html>
