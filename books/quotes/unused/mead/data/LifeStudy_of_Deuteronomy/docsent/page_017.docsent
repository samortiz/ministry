   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Having Been Formed into an Army</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Journey and Fight with God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The children of Israel were also formed, or constituted, into an army to journey with God and to fight with God Num 1 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Their journey was a fighting journey, for on their journey they had to fight again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before God's people could fight for Him, they had to be built up as His dwelling place, built up as a serving unit, and formed into a priestly army.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The children of Israel, therefore, had a threefold status: they were the dwelling place, the priesthood, and the army.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>F. Under the Leading of God in the Cloud</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The children of Israel journeyed under the leading of God in the cloud Num 10:11-28, 33-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although they were journeying on earth, they were under the heavenly leading.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They were led not by something on earth but by the very God who is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He took the lead in their journey.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>G. From the Mount of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The children of Israel began their journey from the mount of Jehovah Num 10:33; Exo 3:1; 24:13, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today, our mount of God is the place where we are equipped, built up, and formed into an army.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is from this place that we begin our journey.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before the children of Israel began their journey from the mount of God to the entry of the holy land, they were equipped, built up, and formed into an army.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that if we have not also been equipped, built up, and formed into a priestly army, we cannot journey with God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are millions of Christians today who have not received the proper equipping, that is, who have not been trained and perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, these Christians have not been built up as the dwelling place and as the priesthood and have not been formed into an army to fight for God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, they cannot journey with God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to journey with God under His heavenly leading, we must first be equipped, built up, and formed into an army.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>H. To Kadesh-barnea the Entry to the Holy Land</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The people journeyed to Kadesh-barnea, the place which is considered the entry to the holy land Num 12:16; 13:3, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I. A Distance of Eleven Days' Journey</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The distance from the mount of God to Kadesh-barnea was a distance of eleven days' journey Deut 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>J. Almost Forty Years Wasted</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>in the Wandering in the Wilderness</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The children of Israel offended God by their unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of their unbelief, they wasted almost forty years in the wandering in the wilderness 1:3 .</S>
