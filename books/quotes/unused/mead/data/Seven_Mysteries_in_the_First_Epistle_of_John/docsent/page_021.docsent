   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE MYSTERY OF THE DIVINE SEED Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:13, 24, 25; 3:15b; 4:4; 5:11, 12, 20, 16; Rom 8:2, 6, 10, 11 THE SEED OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have still another mystery in this short book of 1 John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Previously we have covered the mysteries of life, fellowship, abiding, the anointing, and the divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By the divine birth a seed was implanted within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the mystery we would like to consider now.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"His seed remaineth in him" 1 John 3:9 tells us, meaning that whoever is born of God has the seed of God abiding in him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A seed of any kind is a seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the parables of the sower in Matthew 13, the Lord Jesus likened Himself both to a sower and to the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When He was on this earth, He sowed Himself as the seed into the soil of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Human beings to Him are the soil in which He as the seed of life grows.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet as that seed grows, many negative things arise to frustrate its growth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From this portion of the Word we can see that the seed mentioned in 1 John must be the Lord Jesus Himself as the seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First Peter 1:23 says that we have been "born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's word, then, is also a seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, to say this is the same as saying that the Lord Jesus is the seed of life, because He Himself is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The living Word of God is the living Person of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The seed of life is the Word and the Person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The seed in 1 John, however, in a direct sense is simply the divine life with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our being is comprised of our life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is God's life and nature which are imparted into us at the moment of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may pray a long, penitent prayer, thanking the Lord for dying on the cross and shedding His blood for our sins; taking Him as our Savior and confessing Him as the Son of God; and receiving Him as our Lord and our life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Long before we have finished praying, however, if we have truly prayed to Him from the depths of our being, we shall be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In a moment, the divine life and nature are imparted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may have no sensation that any such experience has happened to you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not depend on your feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many things have happened to you, including your physical birth, of which you have had no sensation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You were born, but it did not depend on you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You have been born again, but that birth also is up to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as you had no say in whether you would be born in Massachusetts or in California, so in your second birth the decision is also out of your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE SEED IN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man, as we have often pointed out, can be represented by three concentric circles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The outer ring corresponds to our physical body, the part of us that has substance and can be seen and touched.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Besides this part, we have a soul, represented by the middle ring.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the psychological part of us, enabling us to think, to love or hate, and to make decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The soul, then, consists of the mind, the emotion, and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The innermost ring, the deepest part of man, is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may not be clear about the human spirit, but one part of it, the conscience, you are familiar with.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The conscience is deeper than the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such is the way man is made.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Animals may have a part that corresponds to the soul, but they lack this inner part, man's worshipping organ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There has never been a case in the whole of history where a donkey, or a monkey, or a goat built a little sanctuary and set up an image to worship!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The record of mankind, in contrast, is replete with religions, idols, temples, and forms of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Cultured or barbarian, ancient or modern all peoples have a desire to worship a higher Being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What accounts for this difference between man and the animals?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What constrains man to worship?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is because man was made by God with a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is the distinction between an unregenerated human being and a believer?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Both have these three parts of body, soul, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The believer, however, has a divine seed in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The seed of God abides in him!</S>
