REQUIRING ABSOLUTE DEDICATION</h2>
<p>For this reason, those who administrate the church and minister the word cannot be simple persons. We should dedicate our whole being to what we are doing. This can be compared to an experienced engineer who is continually considering the design of a building. Even when he is sleeping, he is considering the design. Thus, it is not simple for him to design a project. However, it seems as if we consider our service to be simple.</p>
<p>For example, the responsible brothers usually arrive at the bread-breaking meeting when it is time to start. They do not consider how to lead the meeting until the meeting has already begun. It is at this moment that they begin to think about choosing a hymn, and one of them looks for a hymn, flipping through the hymnal from page to page. After the hymn is sung, it is followed with a prayer, then the singing of another hymn. This situation gives the saints the feeling that the leading ones are killing time. After the bread and the cup are passed, a brother may then stand up and say that he has something to fellowship, but because he did not spend the time to prepare, no one understands what he is saying.</p>
<p>Those who are responsible for the meetings should not feel at peace if there is no supply in the bread-breaking meeting. They should not be able to eat or sleep. All the time they should be considering how to improve the meeting. They should not be able to sleep peacefully. This is the proper attitude of those who are responsible for the meeting.</p>
<p>Some complain that there is not enough material to compose a message. When I began serving the Lord, there was no material, and there was no one to help me. When we first held the bread-breaking meeting, we simply broke the bread. But as I considered this matter, I felt that we should abandon the routines of the denominations. After much consideration I received light, and we found the way to go on. I spent a long time searching, because I did not have peace. For example, I considered, &ldquo;Should the prayer meeting be done in this way? When Christians come together to pray, is this the way to do it?&rdquo; If we think in this way, I believe that the Lord will let us know what we should do.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters need to know the meaning of prayer, what to pray for, and how to pray in a meeting. This should be according to the Bible. Then we need to find something to minister to them. If we do this, the prayer meeting will change, and the number of those attending the meetings will increase. The saints will enjoy coming to the prayer meeting because they receive the supply. This matter requires much thought. The more we endeavor, the more living the prayer meeting will become.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A SPECIAL COMMISSION TO THOSE<br />
SERVING IN THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>Those who serve in the ministry of the word should study how to minister the word in the bread-breaking meeting and in the prayer meeting. We should minister the word in the prayer meeting without being long or killing the spirit of prayer and disrupting the mood for prayer. On the contrary, our speaking should strengthen and open the spirit of prayer and stir others up to pray. It is positive if those who do not normally pray would pray after we release the word.</p>
<p>When I first went to Manila, the brothers and sisters feared the prayer meeting and the bread-breaking meeting even though these two meetings are the most important in the Christian life. For this reason, I requested the responsible brothers to set up a bread-breaking meeting that would be held in the evening. The responsible brothers felt that no one would come if the meeting was in the evening. I endeavored to adjust them, and eventually the bread-breaking meeting had the best attendance. Presently, the number of saints attending the bread-breaking meeting in Manila is more than those who attend the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting. The saints say that it is because there is a supply in the bread-breaking meeting.</p>
<p>Regrettably, I was not able to labor for a long period there. Hence, the effect of my labor did not match what we did in northern China. We were successful in northern China because we labored for many years, and we concentrated on only one local church. In Manila, however, there were many matters to attend to, and it was not appropriate for me to take over a local church and do the work by myself. I could serve only as an adviser. In spite of these reasons, there was still improvement.</p>
<p>We should all practice the matters that we have fellowshipped. We should not pay attention only to the speaking on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. We should endeavor to uplift the bread-breaking meeting. We should also raise the level of the prayer meeting. There must be the supply of the word in these meetings. We should study how to supply a specific word. We need to dig out the gold and find the treasures.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Administration of the Church and the Ministry of the Word &nbsp; pg 55</div><br></body></html>
