   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SAVED BY THE LAMB THE REDEEMING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we need to see how God could reach such a point in His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First of all the people of Israel got saved by the Lamb of God who typified the redeeming Christ Exo 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Don t forget that the Lord Jesus Christ is the very embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lamb of God is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John 1 says that in the beginning was the Word and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This Word became flesh and tabernacled among us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This very One is the Lamb of God John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have the Word, God, the flesh, the tabernacle, and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lamb is the totality of the eternal Word of God in the beginning, of the flesh, and of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all have been saved by such a Lamb who is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>PARTAKING OF THE LAMB THE CRUCIFIED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have not only been saved, but we are also partaking of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not a matter of just being saved by Christ, but also a matter of partaking of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To partake of Christ means to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A number of times in John 6 the Lord indicated that we should eat Him. vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>35, 50, 51, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58 .</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Following that they ate the meat of the lamb Exo 12:7b-8a .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through their eating the redeeming Lamb got into them, and eventually the redeeming Lamb became them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why they were so strong and vigorous and bold to walk out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They were full of energy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be full of energy means to be full of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today many Christians have been saved by Christ, but they have remained so weak and not vigorous.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because they have not partaken of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They have not eaten Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How about you?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must be vigorous!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can you be vigorous?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By partaking of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By partaking of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You have to eat the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lamb whom we can eat is the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through His crucifixion Christ was cooked so that we may eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>PARTAKING OF THE UNLEAVENED BREAD</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At the Passover the Israelites also ate unleavened bread made of barley or wheat Exo 12:8b; 13:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Barley or wheat bread is produced from grains which have passed through death and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The unleavened bread typifies the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ was not only crucified, but also resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was crucified to be our Lamb, and He was resurrected to be the unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to enjoy the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why, since they had eaten the Lamb, did they still need to eat unleavened bread?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let me illustrate in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After you were saved you partook of the crucified Christ, and He became your inner energy to give you the strength and boldness to walk out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But you were not so strong to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You were very vigorous to walk out of this world, but you could not overcome your temper or your besetting sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You had the strength to get out of the world, but you did not have the power to overcome the sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have seen many dear Christians who got out of the world, yet who were still beset by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They couldn t overcome their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They couldn t overcome their lust.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They were beset by certain sins.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They needed the unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is bread that has nothing to do with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is the bread that overcomes sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the resurrected Christ becomes your food in your experience, this resurrection life overcomes sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He that is born of God does not sin 1 John 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What is it to be born of God?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That is to have the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only the resurrected Christ is the life that overcomes sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When you live on this unleavened bread, you will live a life without leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Eating the Lamb enables you to walk out of Egypt, but it is unleavened bread that enables you to live a life without leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To get out of the world you need the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is why Paul could say that to him the world was crucified, and to the world he was crucified Gal 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the experience of the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But for us to live in newness of life without any leaven, we need the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We need the unleavened bread.</S>
