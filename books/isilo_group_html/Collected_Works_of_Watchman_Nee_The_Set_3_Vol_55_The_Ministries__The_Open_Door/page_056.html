Brother Ruo-tien is mostly responsible for edification. Brother Dao-sheng and I are responsible for preaching the gospel on the Lord's Day afternoon. We are very busy in the gospel work in K'un-ming. The brothers and sisters are very burning for the gospel. In addition to the large weekly gospel meeting on the Lord's Day, there are two or three home gospel meetings or outdoor gospel meetings. We are doing our best to sow the seeds of the gospel, leaving it to the Lord to do the work of bringing in the harvest.</p><p>We went to Mongtze County recently and stayed there for two months. We preached the gospel for twenty days. Some were saved, and they have begun meeting and having the table.</p><p>We feel really ashamed that we have not met the people's needs enough! May God have mercy on us. We hope you could instruct us more.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Shao-zu<br />February 19, 1950</p><h2 class="head1">FEELING ALONE (PINGYUAN, HONAN PROVINCE)</h2><p>When I returned from Shanghai, I went home quickly because my father was ill. After several days my father recovered. Then it snowed, and I was trapped in the house. At the time of the Chinese New Year, I touched something of the world which bothered my spirit. Therefore, I left home on the second day of the Chinese New Year and went more than two hundred li to Handao to visit the brothers. At Chingfeng I saw that the brothers were blessed through tribulations, and I rejoiced very much. I personally felt, however, that I was set aside by the Lord.</p><p>While I was at the North China Seminary in Teng Shian in 1940, I read The Normal Christian Church Life. Since then I returned to this region to preach the gospel.</p><p>In the past two years, I have felt a deep need&mdash;I am lonesome and without a partner. I have read the messages in The Ministers concerning the coordination between the co-workers. This is my need. If the work is regional, there must be a local church like Antioch as the center of the work. I feel that it is very difficult for me to be alone here. The churches in this region all need edification for new beginners. The distance between churches is over one hundred li. How can I do the work? How should I choose the way ahead of me? I am praying to see how the Lord would lead. I hope the leading brothers could give me some direction. Oh, I am really not worthy to preach the word!</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Wu Tong-tang<br />March 23, 1950</p><p>(Please refer to the map of the churches in Honan on page 142.&mdash;Editors)</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministries & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 56</div><br></body></html>
