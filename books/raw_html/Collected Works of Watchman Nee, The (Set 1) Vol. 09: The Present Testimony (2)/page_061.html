<P>Today Christians everywhere are very ignorant of this gospel. However, the gospel of the forgiveness of sins can be found everywhere. Everyone knows about the death of the Lord and the blood He shed to save us and forgive us of our sins. Many people have faith in this and can lay hold of this. They believe in this part of the new covenant and preach it. They know that God is propitious to unrighteousness and sins. But it is amazing that only one third of the new covenant has been believed by men. The other two thirds are set aside. An ignorant sinner thinks that he has to try his best to do good before he can be saved. He thinks this way because he has never heard the gospel. But we will not think this way anymore. We know that we are children by promise and not by works. We know that God has promised to forgive and forget all our sins through Jesus Christ. We know that when we believe in Him according to His Word, we will receive forgiveness. It is amazing that we know that we are saved by the Word of God and not by ourselves, but in the matter of overcoming, we think that we have to strive, struggle, and wrestle.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, both salvation and overcoming are in the same covenant. This covenant gives us the power to go on in the way ahead of us. Overcoming sin, obeying God, and the filling of the Holy Spirit are all included in this covenant. The way we receive the grace of forgiveness is the same way we receive the grace to overcome sin. The way our sins are forgiven before God is the same way we overcome our sins before God. Just as we felt that we could not have forgiveness in ourselves, we should feel that we are weak and are unable to do good and overcome sin in ourselves. The old covenant was God holding the Israelites' hands and bringing them out of Egypt. Today God is holding our heart and leading us out of Egypt. Formerly God put the law in their hands. Now God is putting the law in our hearts. Today there is something mysterious that tells us what is and what is not of God.</P><P>First, let us consider how God puts the power within us, and how He strengthens us to overcome. Ezekiel 36 and Jeremiah 31 are similar passages. Ezekiel 36 refers to the salvation of the Jews during the millennium. Jeremiah 31 refers to the same thing. However, in some areas, Jeremiah's words are clearer, while in other areas, Ezekiel's words are clearer. Hebrews 8 is a quotation of Jeremiah 31. Therefore, the last two are similar.</P><P>Ezekiel 36:25 says, "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you." This means the same thing as in Hebrews 8 when it says that He will be propitious to our unrighteousness and cleanse us from our iniquities.</P><P>Verses 26 through 27 say, "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them." Please pay attention to the word cause in verse 27. This is a strong word. It is a verb. Can you see the glory in verses 26 and 27? This explains Jeremiah 31. Verse 26 mentions our spirit, while verse 27 mentions God's Spirit. The second Spirit is not our spirit, but is something that God gives to us. Therefore, we have a new spirit, a new heart, and the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit enables us to do God's will and keep God's laws. The law written on the tablets of stone is outward. There is nothing within ourselves that is compatible with the law on the stone tablets. This is why we cannot keep God's commandments. Today God has written the law within us. Not only has He written it within us, He has given us a new spirit, a new heart, and the Holy Spirit which cause us to obey Him. This is regeneration. Not only do we have a new spirit which enables us to fellowship with God, but we have a new heart which enables us to love God and everything spiritual. This new heart causes us to develop a love for God; it is contrary to the heart of stone. Not only do we have a new spirit and a new heart, but the Holy Spirit. This Holy Spirit causes our new heart to have the strength to love God and our new spirit to have the power to fellowship with Him.</P><P>Some have asked, "Why does God have to give us the Holy Spirit in addition to the new spirit and the new heart?" If we know the function of our body, we will know. With our body, there are the voluntary actions and involuntary actions. For example, moving our hands and feet requires the exercise of the will; these are voluntary actions. In addition to these actions, there is digestion by the stomach and metabolism by the cells which are not under man's control; these are involuntary actions. Voluntary actions are controlled by the will, and involuntary actions are spontaneous and controlled by a natural law. When we were saved, we received a new spirit and a new heart; these are "involuntary"; they spontaneously operate according to their new functions and new desires. However, God has not only given us these things. He has also given us the Holy Spirit so that we can be led by Him wholeheartedly, receive revelation from Him wholeheartedly, and trust in His power wholeheartedly. These must all be done through the exercise of the will and through conscious effort. God desires that, spiritually, we have an involuntary living as well as a voluntary living. If we do not understand God's will and do not follow the leading of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit will be grieved, and we will be hindered from receiving guidance and revelation from the Holy Spirit. This will cause the voluntary action of the spiritual life to cease. Of course, the spontaneous and involuntary actions of the spiritual life will not cease. However, without the power of the Holy Spirit, the new spirit and the new heart would be very much weakened.</P><P>God has not only given us a new heart and new spirit, He has also given us the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, He has put the law within us and inscribed it in our hearts so that our life will spontaneously crave God. At the same time, the Holy Spirit of God within us enables us to carry out what the spirit understands and what the heart desires.</P>
