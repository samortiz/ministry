   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PURITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CHILDREN OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THEIR GOOD DEEDS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Matthew 6 the Lord Jesus told us what our attitude should be toward giving, praying, and fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should give in a secret way so that we will not receive the glory of men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to pray in a private way so that our Father who sees in secret may repay us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, when we fast we should anoint our head and wash our face so that we may not appear to men to be fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These seeds are developed in several verses.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Galatians 5:26 says, "Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not be desirous of vainglory, that is, of making a show.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Philippians 2:3a says, "Doing nothing by way of rivalry nor by way of vainglory."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning prayer, 1 Thessalonians 5:17 says, "Pray without ceasing."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then Romans 12:12 says, "Rejoicing in hope, enduring in tribulation, persevering in prayer."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Concerning fasting, Acts 13:3 says, "And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These verses may be considered as the growth and development of the words spoken by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 6.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE ATTITUDE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OF THE CHILDREN OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>TOWARD RICHES</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning riches the Lord Jesus told us in Matthew 6 that we should not lay up for ourselves treasures on the earth, but that we should lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, He said that we cannot serve two masters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Either we will hate one and love the other, or we will hold to one and despise the other.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We cannot serve God and riches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord also said that we should not be anxious about our life, what we should eat and what we should drink, and what clothes we should put on.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our Heavenly Father knows that we need all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no need for us to be anxious about them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, all these things will be added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can see a development of this seed in Acts 4:32: "And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It continues in verses 34 and 35: "Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From these verses, it is clear that the believers in the early church were not anxious concerning material things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Their attitude toward their riches was so liberated, so free.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the contrary, people in the world anxiously grasp everything they possess.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We Christians should not be like that.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to be liberated from the possession of material things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul then quoted the Lord Jesus when he said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive" Acts 20:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our attitude should be that we love to give rather than receive.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First Timothy 6:8-10 says, "And having food and raiment, let us be therewith content.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not love money, but be content when we have something to eat and something to wear.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verses 17-19 continue by saying, "Charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Finally, let us read Romans 12:13a: "Communicating to the needs of the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that whenever there is a need among the saints and we have the ability to give something, we should do so.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all must keep such a proper attitude toward riches.</S>
