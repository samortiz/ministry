   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HIGH PEAK OF THE DIVINE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am glad that during the last ten months the Lord has released the matter of the high peak of the divine revelation in the Holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Recently, I wrote in Chinese a hymn on God becoming a man that man may become God in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many saints are beside themselves with joy when they sing this hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is very difficult to translate this hymn into English.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The following is a literal translation:</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How great a miracle!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How deep a mystery!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God and man are joined and blended as one!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God becomes man and man becomes God,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>An economy incomprehensible to angels and</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>mankind;</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Out of God s pleasure, in His love,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Attaining the highest purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God incarnated to be a God-man,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order that I may become God,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In life and nature the same kind as He,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Having no share in His Godhead;</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His attributes become my virtues,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His glorious image livingly expressed through me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is no longer I living alone,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But God and I living together;</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Coordinated with the saints in God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be built up as the universal house</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>of the Divine Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And to become the organic Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a great corporate vessel for Him to</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ultimately, the holy city, Jerusalem,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The aggregate of visions and revelations,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Triune God and the tripartite man</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be the couple in love in eternity</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>as man yet God;</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The mutual habitation of divinity and humanity</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With God s glory shining forth radiantly in man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The following is a translation of this hymn in poetry to the tune of #499 in Hymns:</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What miracle!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What mystery!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That God and man should blended be!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God became man to make man God,</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Untraceable economy!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From His good pleasure, heart s desire,</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His highest goal attained will be.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Flesh He became, the first God-man,</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His pleasure that I God may be:</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In life and nature I m God s kind,</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Though Godhead s His exclusively.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His attributes my virtues are;</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His glorious image shines through me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No longer I alone that live,</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But God together lives with me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Built with the saints in the Triune God,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His universal house we ll be,</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And His organic Body we</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For His expression corp rately.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Jerusalem, the ultimate,</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Of visions the totality;</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Triune God, tripartite man</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A loving pair eternally</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As man yet God they coinhere,</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A mutual dwelling place to be;</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God s glory in humanity</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Shines forth in splendor radiantly!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>According to this hymn, it is a great miracle and a deep mystery that God has a way to be joined to man and mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God became man that man may become God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Such an economy is incomprehensible to both angels and man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This economy is of God s desire, and it will reach, attain, the high peak of God s goal.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Ultimately the holy city, Jerusalem, will be the aggregate of all the visions and revelations throughout the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Triune God and the tripartite man will become a loving couple in eternity as man yet still God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Divinity and humanity will become a mutual abode, and the glory of God will be expressed in humanity radiantly in splendor to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I hope that the saints in all the churches throughout the earth, especially the co-workers and the elders, will see this revelation and then rise up to pray that God would give us a new revival a revival which has never been recorded in history.</S>
