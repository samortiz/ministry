   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Salvation manifests that Christ Jesus is the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The following verses compare the wisdom of men to the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since the world comes short of God's wisdom concerning salvation 1 Cor 1:21 , salvation must be preached through God's wisdom, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Salvation has three stages:</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Righteousness" 1 Cor 1:30</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first stage of salvation is to save people from the punishment of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was done in the past: Freed from the punishment of sins: "Save...from their sins" Matt 1:21 "Forgiveness of their sins" Luke 1:77 "Forgiveness of offenses" Eph 1:7 "Gave Himself for our sins" Gal 1:4 "Being justified freely" Rom 3:24 "Was accounted to him as righteousness" Rom 4:22-25 This righteousness is gained by the sinner by believing in Christ: "Through faith in Christ" Phil 3:9 "Through His name" Acts 10:43 "Through Him" Rom 5:9 "Through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus" Rom 3:24-25 "Accounted to him as righteousness" Rom 4:22-25 Such faith renders three results: Forgiveness of sins Imputation of righteousness Freedom from the punishment of sins forever.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A sinner is reconciled to God through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Have peace toward God" Rom 5:1 "Sanctification" 1 Cor 1:30</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second stage of salvation is to be freed from the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is for the present.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sanctification is a definite experience for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is gained through three things: New birth, the beginning of victory over sin: "Were begotten...of God" John 1:12-13 "Born anew" John 3:3 "Begotten of God" 1 John 5:1 "Having been regenerated...through the living and abiding word of God" 1 Pet 1:23 "Through the washing of regeneration" Titus 3:5 Through this same Spirit, we can resist unrighteousness and all the fleshly lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Dying with Him, the accomplishment of victory over the power of sins: "Into His death" Rom 6:3 "Grown together with Him in...His death" Rom 6:5 "Has been crucified with Him" Rom 6:6-7 "Have crucified" Gal 5:24 "Reckon" Rom 6:11 "Put to death" Rom 8:13 Sin has its power.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This power often operates within man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It cannot be washed, repaired, improved or cultured.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The only way is to put it to death, for if it dies, there will be no more power.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who are willing to apply faith to "reckon" themselves crucified with the Lord Rom 6:11 will have the experience of victory over sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Holy Spirit, the practice of overcoming sins: "The Spirit of God dwells in you" Rom 8:9-10, 13 "The Holy Spirit, whom He poured out upon us" Titus 3:5-6 "Led by the Spirit" Gal 5:16-18 "God who operates in you" Phil 2:12-13 "I in him" John 15:5 "He who is in you" 1 John 4:4 On the negative side, the believers have died with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the positive side, they should submit to the indwelling Spirit in order to be saved from the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sin has various temptations and traps.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Holy Spirit will apply to the believers what the cross has accomplished and will make them overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Redemption 1 Cor 1:30</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the third stage of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The redemption, which frees us from the presence of sin, will be the future experience of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are three elements in redemption: The complete sanctification of the Spirit: "Spirit" 1 Thes 5:23 "For now is our salvation nearer" Rom 13:11 The glorification of the body: "The day of redemption" Eph 4:30 "Will transfigure" Phil 3:20-21 "We will be like Him" 1 John 3:1-3 Partaking of the glory of Christ: "Obtaining of the glory" 2 Thes 2:14 "Glory...I have given to them" John 17:22 The "glory" obtained through sufferings Rom 8:17-18 In brief, by the blood of Christ, we are saved from the punishment of sins; by the Spirit of Christ we are freed from the power of sin; and by the glory of Christ we are delivered from the presence of sin: Righteousness, by His first coming.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sanctification, by His present interceding.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Redemption, by His coming again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Faith is related to the cross and the things in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Love is granted by the Holy Spirit in the present.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The hope of glory will be obtained in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please notice that the word "appear" occurs three times in Heb 9:24-28, KJV.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only the Word of God can give us wisdom to know the three stages of salvation 2 Tim 3:14-17 .</S>
