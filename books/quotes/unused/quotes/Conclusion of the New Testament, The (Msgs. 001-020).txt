Because the New Testament contains twenty-seven books, it is difficult to speak on the conclusion of the New Testament
Augustine once said that the New Testament is contained in the Old and that the Old Testament is explained in the New
We may put the matter this way: The New Testament is in the Old contained, and the Old Testament is in the New explained
Some might say that in the Old Testament we have many promises, prophecies, types, and shadows concerning Christ
We must go further to ask this question: What kind of Christ has been promised, prophesied, typified, and shadowed in the Old Testament?
These seven major points are the central line regarding Christ as promised, prophesied, typified, and shadowed in the Old Testament
The bread of life is the life supply in the form of food, like the tree of life , which is also the life supply 'good for food'
As we have pointed out, this Christ is the eternal God who was incarnated, lived on earth, died, resurrected, ascended, and descended
As we shall see, God's New Testament economy is the dispensing of God into His chosen people for the producing of the church
After the fall of man, after the serpent had worked himself into man, God promised that the seed of the woman would crush the serpent
Christ came not only to fulfill the law, but also to fulfill the promise that the seed of the woman would crush the head of the serpent
Verses 25 through 27 say, 'He said to them, O foolish and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!
Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself'
The Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms are the three sections of the entire Old Testament, that is, 'all the Scriptures'
The Savior's word here unveils that the entire Old Testament is a revelation of Him and that He is its center and content
Numerous times in the holy Scriptures, from Genesis through Malachi, God spoke in promise through the prophets regarding the gospel of God
Romans 1:2 is a further demonstration of the fact that the New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old Testament
Bible students often say that the prophecies concerning Christ in the Old Testament are fulfilled in the New Testament
After a grain of wheat is sown into the ground, it grows and develops until it eventually brings forth many grains
In Genesis 3:15 God promised fallen mankind that as the seed of woman Christ would come to crush the head of the serpent
The Bible goes on to reveal that this seed is developed into the seed of Abraham, the seed of Isaac, and the seed of Jacob
Although the word of God preached by the early disciples grew and multiplied , it was not yet completed according to God's economy
Romans 14:17 says, 'The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
In 1 Corinthians 69 Galatians 521 and Ephesians 55 Paul according to the context considers the kingdom of God equivalent to the church
He and his co-workers were working for the church, yet in Colossians 4:11 he says that they were laboring for the kingdom of God
Since the church is a corporate person and the church is the kingdom, it would not be logical to say that the kingdom is not a person
Since the New Jerusalem is the wife of the Lamb and the wife is a person, then the New Jerusalem is a person, a corporate person
God Christ and the Spirit are individual persons whereas the believers the church the kingdom and the New Jerusalem are corporate persons
God's New Testament economy is God's household management, God's household administrative arrangement, the divine dispensation
The Greek word rendered 'dispensation' in Ephesians 1:10 can also be translated 'stewardship' or 'household arrangement'
In 39 Paul says To bring to light what is the dispensation of the mystery which from the ages has been hidden in God who created all things
If we, as fallen sinners, require pleasure, then how much more does God, the living One, have a deep need for it?
Of caring for this matter, they may pay attention to teachings concerning how to be holy, spiritual, and victorious
Regarding this, Ephesians 3:11 says, 'According to the purpose of the ages which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord'
The purpose of the ages is the purpose of eternity, the eternal purpose, the eternal plan of God made in eternity past
Through these steps of God the Father, through God the Son, and in God the Spirit God dispenses Himself into His chosen people
Revelation 21:2 says, 'I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband'
The New Jerusalem is prepared as a bride for her husband by participating in the riches of the life and nature of Christ
As the holy city of God, she is wholly sanctified unto God and fully saturated with God's holy nature to be His habitation
Eventually we shall be glorified with Christ to bear the glory of God for God's expression in the New Jerusalem
According to my observation, most of the saints who have received these messages still need a clear vision of God's economy
When we use the word dispensation, we do not mean dispensing, which is the act of God's dispensing Himself into us
Many more particulars concerning God's person are revealed in the New Testament than are unveiled in the Old Testament
As we consider the various aspects of God's person, we shall see what kind of God intends to dispense Himself into us
In Matthew, John, and all the other books of the New Testament we find the many points concerning God's person
These points may be compared to the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that need to be put together in order to form a complete picture
Matthew discloses the reality of the divine Trinity in the one name for all Three, for the constitution of the kingdom
In chapter twelve the Son, in the person of man, cast out demons by the Spirit to bring in the kingdom of God the Father
According to Matthew, such a baptism into the reality of the Father, Son, and Spirit is for the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens
The first divine title used in God's divine revelation concerning His creation, Elohim in Hebrew, is plural in number
At the beginning of the Lord's ministry on earth, the Father anointed the Son with the Spirit for reaching men and bringing them back to Him
John the apostle also strengthens the revelation of the divine Trinity for the believers' participation in the processed Triune God
The seven Spirits in Revelation 1:4 are undoubtedly the Spirit of God because they are ranked among the Triune God in verses 4 and 5
As seven is the number for completion in God's operation, in God's move, so the seven Spirits must be for God's move on earth
In substance and existence God's Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God's operation God's Spirit is sevenfold
It is like the lampstand in Zechariah 4:2: in existence it is one lampstand standing, but in function it is seven lamps shining
At the opening of most of the Epistles, only the Father and the Son are mentioned, from whom grace and peace are given to the receivers
The pure revelation of the Triune God in the Bible occupies a central position between the extremes of modalism and tritheism
Because modalism goes beyond the confines of the Scriptures concerning the aspect of the one, it is a heresy on the extreme of the one
The Bible is not at either of these extremes; it stands in the center, testifying the twofoldness of the truth of the Trinity
The Bible, true to the principle of balance in God's creation, is balanced and in the center; it does not go to an extreme
Regarding the truth of the Triune God, we also should be balanced and avoid the heretical extremes of both modalism and tritheism
Because he taught that the Father, Son, and the Spirit are one God, not three separate Gods, he was accused of teaching modalism
Because he strongly emphasized that God is three-the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit-he was also accused of teaching tritheism
Modalism teaches that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not all eternal and do not all exist at the same time
Rather, modalism claims that the Father ended with the Son's coming and that the Son ceased with the Spirit's coming
Even in Their economical works and manifestations the Three still remain essentially in Their coexistence and coinherence
Isaiah 96 says that the Father is eternal Hebrews 112 and 73 indicate that the Son is eternal and Hebrews 914 speaks of the eternal Spirit
Some Christians have believed that the Father is one Person and that the Son is another Person, but the Spirit is merely a power
These teachers say not only that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinct but also that They are separate
We cannot separate the Son from the Father, or the Father and the Son from the Spirit, because all three coexist and coinhere
Although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us, in our experience we sense that there is just One in us
We should live in this simplicity and not venture forth on this deep and tremendously vast sea of dispute about such questions
It is, therefore, complete folly and a most perilous undertaking to wish to search into these things more subtly
Rather, exercise your spirit to experience and enjoy the marvelous dispensing of the Triune God as the Father, Son, and Spirit
God is the God of our Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of Man, and God is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God
We have not only creation, indicated by the title 'God,' but also incarnation, indicated by the title 'the God of our Lord Jesus Christ'
The first revelation of God in the Bible is in creation, for the Bible opens with the words, 'In the beginning God created
On the day of His resurrection His word to Mary in John 20:17 indicates that God is not only His Father, but also His believers' Father
In John 20:17 the Lord told Mary to say to His brothers, 'I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God'
In making His Father and His God theirs He has brought them into His position-the Son's position-before the Father and God
During the day God was seen as the cloud, and during the night He was seen as the pillar of fire-that was glory
In the Gospel of John we read that the Word was God, that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and that we all beheld His glory
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
In Acts 7:2, as Stephen was testifying before the Sanhedrin, he said, 'The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham
The glory here might have been visible glory, as when the cloud and the fire appeared to Israel and filled the tabernacle and temple
It separated, sanctified, him from the world unto God , and it was a great encouragement and strength which enabled him to follow God
One day the God of glory came to us through the preaching of the gospel, and we were attracted and convinced and began to appreciate Him
During that time, the God of glory transfused some element of His being into us, and we believed in Him spontaneously
Based upon this, he was supposed to be the son of God, even as the heathen poets considered all mankind to be the offspring of God
In Acts 17:28 Paul says, 'For in Him we live and move and are, as even some poets among you have said, For we also are His offspring'
The words 'in Him we live and move and are' denote that man's life and existence and even his actions are of God
In Matthew 11:27c the Lord Jesus says that no one knows 'the Father except the Son and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him'
Concerning the Son, only the Father has such knowledge; and concerning the Father, only the Son has such knowledge
In John 17:6 the Lord Jesus said to the Father, 'I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world'
In the past, all things were out of Him; in the present, all things are through Him; and in the future, all things will be to Him
All things came into being out of God in the past, all things exist through Him in the present, and all things will be to Him in the future
The Father refers not to God as the Father of the regenerated believers but to Him as the source of all things
Hebrews 2:10 tells us that God, who is leading many sons into glory, is the One 'for whom are all things and through whom are all things'
All things which God created for the accomplishment of His purpose exist through Him in the present, and will be for Him in the future
In 1 Timothy 1:1 Paul says, 'Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, according to the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope'
In 1 Timothy 4:10 Paul goes on to speak of 'the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe'
Glory is the expression and splendor; majesty, the greatness in honor; might, the strength in power; and authority, the power in ruling
Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father
As the father of a family is the very source and origin of life, so the name Father reveals the Father as the source of life
Of the Father, who is the source of life, and who is for the propagation and multiplication of life, many sons are born for His expression
In the book of Matthew the Lord taught His disciples to call God Father, saying, 'Our Father who is in the heavens'
When the two terms 'Abba' and 'Father' are put together, the result is a deep, sweet sense, a sense that is exquisitely intimate
How sweet it is when little children, enjoying a relationship in life with their fathers, tenderly say, 'daddy'
Timothy 117 says Now to the King of the ages incorruptible invisible the only God be honor and glory unto the ages of the ages Amen!
In 1 Corinthians 8:4 and 6 Paul says that 'there is no God but one' and that 'to us there is one God, the Father'
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
The Word is God expressed, life is God imparted, light is God shining, grace is God enjoyed, and reality is God realized
If we would have contact with this living God, we need to exercise our spirit and have a blood-purified conscience
Hebrews 10 charges the Hebrew believers to come forward according to God's New Testament economy and not to drift back to the old Judaism
It warns them that if they would fall away from God's New Testament way, they will be dealt with by God who is living
Since God is living in every way, the Hebrew believers should remain only in the things which fit in with the living God
Although the Father dwells in unapproachable light, we not only can approach Him in Christ, but we also can have fellowship with Him
To meet the demands of His holiness we need to be sanctified, to be made holy, by the heavenly, present, and living Christ
Otherwise, they would defile themselves with their old profane religion and suffer the holy God as a consuming fire
All that this true God is to us is eternal life to us so that we may partake of and enjoy Him as everything to our regenerated being
Romans 16:25 to 26 tells us that God, who has given the command to make the hidden mystery known to all the nations, is eternal
The Gospel of John reveals that He is all we need: life, light, food, drink, the pasture, the way, and everything
Do not believe either in your weakness or in your strength, for both your weakness and your strength will pass away
If we know God as the One who is, who was, and who will be, we shall be greatly encouraged, especially during difficult times
Governmentally He continues His universal operation, which He originated from eternity and will bring to completion
The fact that God is the Alpha and the Omega indicates that He is the entire 'alphabet' needed for composing the story of the universe
In the list of the eight positive items, the item next to God the Judge of all is the spirits of just men who had been made perfect
For this, God will judge them , to rectify their error that eventually they might be made perfect by God as the Judge of all
The Greek word rendered 'Architect' in Hebrews 11:10 is technites, an artificer, one who does a thing by rules of art; hence, an architect
The former speaks of God as the Architect, the Designer of the New Jerusalem; the latter, as the actual Maker or Framer of the city
Some translations of Hebrews 11:10 obscure the fact that God is an Architect, the Architect of the New Jerusalem
The householder is God, the vineyard is the city of Jerusalem , and the husbandmen are the leaders of the Israelites
The 'other husbandmen' in this parable were the apostles, who took care of the church, the kingdom of God in the New Testament
Concerning this, Matthew 22:2 says, 'The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man, a king, who made a marriage feast for his son'
The passages in Luke 11:29-32 and 42-52, unveiling the Jewish people as an evil generation, confirm this interpretation
Because the Jews did not repent, even after the Lord Jesus died and resurrected and the Spirit came, the 'fig tree' was 'cut down'
God as the certain man has prepared His full salvation as a great dinner and He sent the first apostles as His slaves to invite the Jews
In a sense, the believers in Christ are a widow in the present age because their husband Christ is absent from them
While our opposer is persecuting us, it seems that our God is not righteous, for He allows His children to be unrighteously persecuted
Throughout the centuries thousands upon thousands of faithful followers of the Lord Jesus have suffered unrighteous persecution
When our Husband is apparently absent and we are left on earth as a widow, temporarily our God seems to be an unrighteous judge
Although He appears to be unrighteous, we still must appeal to Him, pray persistently, and bother Him again and again
In the book of Revelation God makes His revelation known to us 'by signs' , that is, by symbols with spiritual significance
John received a revelation so divine, mysterious, and profound in many respects that no human words can explain them adequately
Whereas jasper indicates God as the God of glory in His rich life, sardius signifies God as the God of redemption
The Lamb as the lamp shines with God as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, the expression of the divine light
Because this divine light will illumine the holy city, there will not be the need of natural light or man-made light
Certain sufferings and hardships we cannot bear by ourselves; however, we are able to bear them by the divine nature
Although we received the divine life at the time we believed, the divine nature must be continually enjoyed by us
In order that we may enjoy all that He is, God will do many things for us according to His precious and exceedingly great promises
Having received the divine life at the time of our regeneration, we must go on to enjoy what God is in His nature
Just as we are constituted physically of the food we eat, so we, believers in Christ, should be constituted of the God of which we partake
The more we partake of the divine nature, the more we shall escape the corruption that is in the world by lust
The more we stay away from the corruption of the world, the more we shall enjoy the riches of the divine nature
During the course of our Christian life on earth, and even in eternity, we shall still be partaking of the divine nature
For eternity, as portrayed by the tree of life and the river of water of life in Revelation 22, we shall be partaking of the divine nature
We, the regenerated ones, are the same as God in life and nature, but we are not the same as God in position in the Godhead
Praise the Lord that we have the position, the ability, and the provision to become partakers of the divine nature!
Day by day we should partake of God's nature and enjoy what He is, that is, enjoy the constituents of God's rich being
The expressions, 'God is Spirit,' 'God is love,' and 'God is light,' are not used in a metaphoric sense, but in a predicative sense
Spirit denotes the nature of God's person; love, the nature of God's essence; and light, the nature of God's expression
When this divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when this divine light shines upon us, it becomes truth
Now we go back to the Father and contact Him as the source of grace and truth, and this source is love and light
We have God, the Spirit as the nature of God's person, love as the nature of God's essence, and light as the nature of God's expression
Since God is dispensing Himself in His nature into us the more we are under Gods dispensing the more we have of His Spirit love and light
Apart from God's dispensing, human beings have only the flesh, the soulish mind, emotion, and will, and a dormant spirit
If you are under His dispensing and are receiving the Spirit into you more and more, you will not react in your flesh or in your emotion
The New Testament reveals the dispensing of a God whose person is of many aspects and whose nature is Spirit, love, and light
We shall become those who are living in Spirit, love, and light in the sense that we have been constituted of these elements of God's nature
Although the word 'life' is used many times in the New Testament, the phrase 'the life of God' is found only once
After being created, man with the created human life was placed before the tree of life to receive the uncreated divine life
The word 'eternal' means being uncreated, without beginning or ending, existing by itself, and ever, unchangeably existing
All other kinds of life in the universe-angelic life, human life, animal life, and plant life-are mortal and changeable
When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He fulfilled all the requirements of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness
Through the redemption of the Lord Jesus, the way has been opened for us to contact God as the tree of life once more
John 410 goes on to say In this is love not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son a propitiation concerning our sins
The word this refers to the following fact not that we loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son a propitiation concerning our sins
Because of His great love, God is rich in mercy to save us from our wretched position to a condition that is suitable for His love
The nobler love of God as His essential attribute needs His attribute of mercy to reach us in the deep pit of our fallen life
Because such a divine light will illumine the holy city, it will have no need of any other light, whether created by God or made by man
Kindness, forbearance, and longsuffering are God's attributes mainly toward the sinners, in which there are the divine riches
The book of Ephesians speaks of God's riches in mercy , God's surpassing riches of grace , and God's riches of glory
These are the riches of God Himself for our enjoyment today, which will be publicly displayed, exhibited, to the whole universe for eternity
The riches of Gods glory are for Gods expression in the believers as Gods vessels being indwelt and fully occupied by Christ to express God
The divine riches in all God's attributes are deep, with an untraceable depth just as God's wisdom and knowledge are untraceable
Although this is correct, here Paul does not modify the word 'fullness' by a phrase such as 'of the Godhead' or 'of God'
It is significant that in Colossians 1:19 Paul speaks of the fullness as the fullness, using no word to modify it
Verses 19 and 20 say that in Christ the fullness was pleased to dwell, and 'through Him to reconcile all things to Him'
It is the fullness that dwells in Christ, it is the fullness that reconciles us, and it is to the fullness that we shall be presented
Before His incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word, but it did not dwell in Him bodily
After He became incarnate, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in a bodily way, and it dwells in His glorified body now and forever
Paul is saying that we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God, that is, we shall be filled to be the expression of God
When we are filled unto all the fullness of God, we become the expression of God, which is what the church should be
According to the New Testament, the fullness of God is the expression through the completion of the riches of God
In these verses in chapter three of Ephesians concerning the economy of God resulting in the fullness of God, we see the Triune God
The Father answers and fulfills the apostle's prayer through the Spirit so that Christ the Son may make His home in our hearts
The emphasis here is that the Triune God is holy and is triply holy, referring to the quality of God's nature-God's being
He begot us with His life inwardly so that we might have His holy nature; He disciplines us outwardly so that we may partake of His holiness
Holy not only means sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything that is common
For us, God's chosen ones, to be holy is to partake of His nature and to have our whole being permeated with God Himself
Whereas holiness is related to God's inward nature, righteousness is related to God's outward acts, ways, actions, and activities
Revelation 15:3 says, 'Great and wonderful are Your works, Lord God the Almighty; righteous and true are Your ways, O King of the nations'
Although His works have not yet come, you will know they will come because you know the governing principles by which God does things
In Romans 116b and 17a Paul says that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes both to Jew first and to Greek
According to John 3:16, salvation is out of God's love, and according to Ephesians 2:5 and 8, salvation is by God's grace
If you say, 'Lord Jesus, You are my Savior,' you can turn to God and say, 'God, You must forgive me, whether You like it or not
John 19 says If we confess our sins He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
Because His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, was put to death by Him on the cross on our behalf, God is legally obligated to forgive us
God knows that whenever a person points to the resurrected and ascended Christ as a 'receipt' for sin, God must forgive that one
Whenever our conscience condemns us because of our failures, we need to remember to stand upon the foundation of God's righteousness
In the future you may fail Him and become very disappointed with yourself, unable to believe that God could ever forgive you
Tell Him that no matter how much you have failed, Christ is still at His right hand as the receipt for payment for all your debts
Whenever we confess our sins, claim the blood of Jesus, and appeal to God's righteousness, God has no choice except to forgive us
The foundation is not our fervency or victory; it is God's righteousness, the unshakable foundation of God's throne
He put Christ to death on our behalf, and He has recognized the death of Christ as the full payment of our debt
Christ has died for my sins, and He is now at Your right hand as proof that You have received His payment for all my debts
Our God is righteous, and the gospel of Christ is the power of God because the righteousness of God is revealed in it
At the very end of the book of Romans Paul says, 'To the only wise God through Jesus Christ be the glory forever and ever!
Ephesians 3:10 speaks of the multifarious wisdom of God being made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies through the church
If you are a person full of wisdom, the more troubles and difficulties you have, the more wisdom you will express
If everything related to you is peaceful and without problems, you will have no opportunity to express your wisdom
Many aspects of God's wisdom are manifested in His making Christ our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
In the same principle, our failures, mistakes, defeats, and wrongdoings have also given God opportunities to display His wisdom
Wisdom is what is within God to plan and purpose a will concerning us; prudence is the application of God's wisdom
God planned and purposed in His wisdom, and then He applied what He had planned and purposed for us with prudence
We may say that prudence is a 'stairway' connecting cleverness, which is on a lower level, to wisdom, which is on a higher level
If a certain person chooses not to remain in his cleverness but to advance to wisdom, he must ascend up the stairway of prudence
Corinthians 1:9 says, 'God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
In His faithfulness He will confirm the believers till the end, making them unreprovable in the day of the Lord's return
God is faithful in His word , the word of the truth of His gospel , which tells us that He will forgive us our sins because of Christ
We see that the faithful God who has called us will also sanctify us wholly and preserve our entire being complete
Although truthfulness is very close to faithfulness, there is a difference between these two attributes of God
Because Paul conducted himself in the simplicity of God, he was truly sincere, living in the divine attribute of sincerity
In Greek it is agathos, describing 'that which, being good in its character or constitution, is beneficial in its effect'
Romans 9:16 says, 'So then, it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy'
In Romans 9:16 Paul says that 'it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy'
Our concept is that the one who wills will gain what he wills to obtain and that the one who runs will gain what he runs after
When we are in a pitiful condition, His mercy reaches us and brings us into a state where He is able to favor us with His grace
We come to the throne of grace like beggars, in somewhat the same condition as was the prodigal son when he came to his father
If we would serve God in His New Testament economy, we need to know that it is wholly a matter of God's sovereign mercy
We are not in the Lord's recovery because we are more intelligent than others or because we seek the Lord more than others do
If you consider how the Lord brought you into the church life in the Lord's recovery, you will worship Him for His mercy
Because of His great love, God is rich in mercy to save us from our wretched position to a condition that is suitable for His love
2 Corinthians 1:3 says, 'Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all encouragement'
The Greek word for mercy, eleos, refers to the kind of response that is motivated by the wretched condition of the poor party
The basic root of this word refers to the inward organs of man which were believed to be the center of tender affections in man
If we would understand what the grace of God is as revealed in the New Testament, we need a clear view of the New Testament as a whole
Grace is mainly not the work God does for us; grace is the Triune God Himself dispensed into our being and experienced as our enjoyment
The New Testament reveals that grace is nothing less than God in Christ dispensed into our being for our enjoyment
Grace is God not in doctrine, but in our experience, for grace is God in Christ with all He is for our enjoyment
It was by this grace that Saul of Tarsus the foremost of sinners became the foremost apostle laboring more abundantly than all the apostles
As good stewards, by the gift we have received we should minister to the church and to the saints such grace, not mere doctrine
In our experience peace is a condition that results from grace, that issues from the enjoyment of God our Father
The substance of grace is God Himself, and the condition of peace is that which issues out of our enjoyment of God as grace
Romans 15:13 says, 'The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace,' indicating that joy is one of God's attributes
The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit'
2 Corinthians 1:3 says, 'Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all encouragement'
If God did not show forbearance to man, there would be no way for God to fulfill His purpose of accomplishing His economy
For the accomplishment of His eternal purpose, for the carrying out of His economy, God has always exercised forbearance
With His forbearance, it is full of understanding, wisdom, patience, consideration, sympathy, mercy, kindness, love, and grace
Longsuffering is patience toward the troubling persons, whereas endurance is patience toward the afflicting things
Both longsuffering and endurance are His attributes, which we, as His children should participate in toward people and environment
Literally, the Greek word for 'immortality' is athanasia, which means deathlessness, denoting freedom from death
In the Gospel of John we read that the Word, who was God, became flesh and tabernacled among us, and that we beheld His glory
John 1:18 goes on to say, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
Eventually we shall be glorified with Christ to bear the glory of God for God's expression in the New Jerusalem
Romans 9:23 says, 'What if He should make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory'
We were predestinated by His sovereignty to be His containers, vessels of honor, to express what He is in glory
The entire city of New Jerusalem will bear the glory of God, which is God Himself shining out through the city
The glory of God will be the content of the New Jerusalem, for this city will be completely filled with His glory
The church life today should also have God's glory, manifesting and expressing Him in this marvelous divine attribute
Or has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor'?
These verses from Romans 9 indicate that God has sovereignly created us to be His vessels, His containers, according to His predestination
Whereas the divine wisdom is for God's planning and purposing, the divine power is for carrying out what is planned and purposed by God
Ephesians 1:19 says, 'The surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength'
God's great power which God wrought in Christ has seated Him at God's right hand in the heavenlies far above all
The Apostle Paul prayed that we may have a spirit of wisdom and revelation to know the surpassing greatness of this divine power
Vincent, the Greek word ischuos for strength in Ephesians 1:19 and Revelation 5:12 denotes indwelling strength
Strength is greater than might, power is greater than strength, authority is greater than power, and sovereignty is greater than authority
Ephesians 1:5 says, 'Having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will'
Ephesians 1:9 goes on to say, 'Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself'
God has predestinated us, marked us out beforehand, that is, before the foundation of the world , unto a certain destiny
Through the dispensing of the Triune God, we have truly become God's sons in life; hence, we can call Him, 'Abba, Father'
The designation of the Firstborn of God is the work on the prototype the conformation of the many sons of God is the work of mass production
Having gained the prototype, God is now seeking to have the mass production in order to produce many sons in the image of the Firstborn
The New Jerusalem will be a composition of all the regenerated sons of God to fulfill the desire of God's heart
Concerning the expression of the Son of God, Ephesians 1:23 indicates that His Body is the fullness of the One who fills all in all
Christ, who is the embodiment of the infinite God without any limitation, is so great that He fills all things in all things
As the expression of the unsearchably rich Christ, the church is the unlimited expression of the unlimited Christ
God desires to have many sons for the expression of His Son so that He may be expressed in the Son through the Spirit
Through the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, the firstborn Son of God, God has produced millions of sons
Paul refers to the expression of God in Ephesians 3:19 when he speaks of our being 'filled unto all the fullness of God'
To be filled unto all the fullness of God is to be filled with the result that we, as the church, become the corporate expression of God
God's many sons are the expression of His Son so that God Himself may be expressed in the Son through the Spirit
In Ephesians 3 the Father answers and fulfills the apostle's prayer through the Spirit that Christ the Son may make His home in our hearts
God desires to dispense Himself into His chosen people for the producing of the church so that He may be expressed in a corporate way
All the aspects of God's person and all the items of His attributes are the ingredients of God as our food to be dispensed into our being
At the time of the Passover the children of Israel ate the meat of the lamb in order to receive the life supply
Eventually, the children of Israel entered into the good land, and there they enjoyed the rich produce of the land
During the past centuries there have been those who received God's dispensing, the saints who contacted God all the time
Even though they may not have known the word dispensing or had the adequate knowledge about eating God they took God into them as their food
In the past, the godly ones who spent much time contacting God spontaneously and even unconsciously were under God's dispensing
The aspects of God's person and the items of His attributes are infused into us as the ingredients of God as our food by His dispensing
Ultimately, God will be manifested in the New Jerusalem as the consummated corporate expression in the new heaven and new earth
We need to see that the fullness of the Godhead is the expression of the Godhead and that this expression is in Christ individually
The fact that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily means that it dwells in Him in a way that is both real and practical
Before His incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word, but it did not dwell in Him bodily
The expression the fullness of the Godhead refers to the entire Godhead to the complete God including the Father the Son and the Spirit
John 1 further says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
The Word in John 1:1 refers to the defined God, the explained and expressed God, the God revealed and made known to human beings
John 1:14 continues to say that the Word, after becoming flesh 'tabernacled among us , full of grace and reality'
When we enjoy God in Christ as grace and realize Him in Christ as reality, we find the unsearchable riches of Christ
The Word is God expressed, life is God imparted, light is God shining, grace is God enjoyed, and reality is God realized
Because the fullness of God is embodied in the church, the church is the corporate expression of the Triune God
The transition from 'the mystery ' to 'who' implies that Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh is the mystery of godliness
These verses imply that not only Christ Himself as the Head but also the church as the Body is the manifestation of God in the flesh
According to the context, godliness refers to the living of God in the church, that is, God as life lived out in the church to be expressed
The final stage of God's manifestation will be in the New Jerusalem as the consummated corporate expression in the new creation
Revelation 21:1-3 says, 'I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more
In eternity past God purposed to have a corporate expression so that He might be fully expressed and glorified
The New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the holy city, 'the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem'
The designation 'holy city' signifies that the New Jerusalem is a city sanctified and separated unto God for fulfilling His purpose
It is both sanctified and separated unto God positionally and sanctified and saturated with God dispositionally
It is an entity, entirely and thoroughly holy, that fits in with God's holy nature for God's expression to fulfill His heart's desire
The garden and the city at the two ends of the Scripture reflect each other, with the tree of life which is in both of them as the link
Out of His old creation through all the dispensations, God has been doing His building work in the way of regeneration and resurrection
In both the Old and the New Testaments God likens His chosen people to a spouse and a dwelling place for Himself
Jasper, with its dark green color, a sign of being rich in life, signifies the appearance of the very God who is rich in life
It has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumines it, and its lamp is the Lamb
The glory of God, with God as its substance, essence, and elements, is the light of the New Jerusalem, which shines in the Lamb as its lamp
The appearance of God rich in life goes with the shining for God's expression in His final and consummated manifestation
The street signifies the way, and the street being pure gold indicates that the nature of God is the way in the New Jerusalem
Everything in the New Jerusalem which is constituted of God in His nature, is according to the divine nature and corresponds to it
On this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruits each month'
In the flow of the river is the water of life with the tree of life as a vine going on the two sides of the river
Apart from God's authority and God's nature there is no possibility for God to have an expression in His manifestation
The Greek word translated 'dispensation' in Ephesians 1:10; 3:9; and 1 Timothy 1:4 is oikonomia, the anglicized form of which is 'economy'
The fact that we were chosen in eternity past means that our salvation began before the foundation of the world and before time
God's work in eternity past also included His predestinating-marking out-the believers before the foundation of the world
God first selected us and then marked us out beforehand, that is, before the foundation of the world, unto a certain destiny
Ephesians 1:5 says that God predestinated us unto sonship according to the good pleasure of His will, which is His purpose
Ephesians 1:4 says that God has chosen us to be holy, and verse 5 says that He has predestinated us unto sonship
A bracketed insertion in translation of Acts 2:23 says that 'the determined counsel of God' was decided 'in the council held by the Trinity'
Probably among the Trinity of the Godhead there was a conference concerning the coming creation and redemption
In the eternal view of God, from the foundation of the world, that is, since the fall of man as a part of the world, Christ was slain
In his preaching in Acts 1415 Paul also spoke of the living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them
Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man
The New Testament clearly tells us that God created the universe through Christ as the Son of God and the Word of God
After creating the universe, God created man and determined mankind's appointed seasons and the boundaries of dwelling
God determined the seasons and boundaries of the United States for the sake of His purpose concerning the working out of His recovery
According to typology, Abel's more excellent sacrifice was a type of Christ, who is the real 'better sacrifices'
God's way of redemption was that of a sacrifice in which blood was shed, for without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins
Although Cain should have realized that what God wanted was a sacrifice with the shedding of blood, he did not offer such a sacrifice
In contrast to Cain, Abel did not present his sacrifice according to his concept, but according to God's way of salvation
Hebrews 11:5 says, 'By faith Enoch was translated so that he should not see death, and was not found, because God had translated him
When the flood came upon the ungodly generation, Noah and his family were in the ark, protected, preserved, and saved
In this message we shall consider further God's work in the old dispensation, in His old administrative arrangement
As recorded in Genesis, the history of the created race culminated in the building of the tower and city of Babel
Names of idols were written on this tower, indicating that the created race had given up God and had turned to idolatry
Although God's calling of Abraham took place in time, something prior to that-God's selection-took place in eternity past
When we say that God's calling is a new beginning, we need to understand that this new beginning is a transfer of race
The fact that the man created by God was placed in front of the tree of life indicates that man should continually eat of this tree
He does not say, And to the seeds, as concerning many, but as concerning one, And to your seed, who is Christ'
The physical aspect of the blessing God promised to Abraham was the good land , which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ
The Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God's bountiful supply for us to enjoy
Paul's word concerning the Spirit should remind us of John 7:39: 'The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified'
In Galatians 314 the blessing of the promise is the Spirit and in Galatians 316 the promises were made to Abrahams seed which is Christ
In Hebrews and 1 Corinthians he points out clearly that what happened to the children of Israel is a type of us
If you look into the Ten Commandments, you will see that they embody the divine holiness, righteousness, light, and love
When the people declared that they would keep God's commandments, the atmosphere changed and became terrifying
The law was used by God as a custodian to keep His people, just as a fold keeps a flock of sheep during the winter or during a storm
In verse 24 he goes on to say, 'So the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith'
The sprinkling of the blood of the sacrifices was the sealing of the covenant and the completion of the official enactment of the covenant
Without such an official enactment, the contract would exist as a written statement, but it would not be binding on either party
Although the law had been given to the people through Moses, there was still the need for the covenant to be enacted
Once the promises were confirmed by God's oath, having been made unalterable, there was no possibility of change
God promised David, the king of the chosen race, that the fruit of his loins would be the coming Messiah-Christ
The Greek word rendered 'fruit' in verse 30 is karpos, used for Christ only in the sense of offspring here and in Luke 1:42
Christ is the branch of Jehovah and of David , and the fruit of Mary and of David, that we may eat of Him as the tree of life
Of course, such matters as forgiveness and salvation are included in the gospel, but they are not the central point
Numerous times in the Scriptures, from Genesis through Malachi, God spoke in promise through the prophets regarding the gospel
These messages on the conclusion of the New Testament are not concerned with mere doctrine, theology, or teaching
It is not my intention that you simply know all the items of God's person or all the aspects of His attributes
Ephesians 1 and 3 show us the economy of God, but in these chapters we do not see either the means or the way for God's dispensing
Just as Adam's descendants are produced by the dispensing of human life, so God's sons are produced by the dispensing of the divine life
For the carrying out of His dispensing, God in eternity past made a counsel with Himself to make certain decisions
The New Testament opens with the record of John the Baptist who was sent by God to prepare the way so that Christ the Dispenser might come
Luke 3:2 says, 'In the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zachariah, in the wilderness'
Luke 3:3 goes on to say, 'And he came into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins'
To prepare the way of the Lord and to make His paths straight means to change people's minds, turning their minds toward the coming Savior
Flesh in the word all flesh will see the salvation of God refers to fallen men and salvation denotes the Savior as the salvation of God
God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin that He might redeem those under law so that we might receive the sonship
Romans 8:3 speaks of 'God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh'
The brass serpent was in the form, the likeness, of an actual serpent, but it did not have the poison of a serpent
He knew that He could not send His Son to be the flesh of sin, for, if He did that, His Son would have been involved with sin
He sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, as typified by the brass serpent lifted up by Moses in the wilderness
God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin in order to redeem us from under the law so that we might receive the sonship
The fullness of time in verse 4 denotes the completion of the Old Testament time, which occurred at the time appointed of the Father
Christ was born under the law in order to redeem them from its custody so that they might receive the sonship and become sons of God
God's New Testament economy is not to make us keepers of the law, which was given only for a temporary purpose
God's New Testament economy is to make us sons of God, inheriting the blessing of God's promise, which was given for His eternal purpose
The sending of both John the Baptist and of Christ were for the dispensing of the divine life into God's chosen people
Rather the New Testament says that in the beginning was the Word and this Word was the entire Triune God the Father the Son and the Spirit
There are two Greek words used for the English word 'sent,' one of which means to be sent with a special commission
As a rule, if someone sends you to a certain place, that person will remain where he is, and you will go to the designated place
That was for the fulfillment of Isaiah 61:1; 42:1; and Psalm 45:7 to anoint Him to carry out His God-given commission
The Lord Jesus was inaugurated into His ministry by two steps: baptism in water and the anointing of the Holy Spirit
After the Lord Jesus was baptized, God the Father sent the Holy Spirit upon Him economically, anointing Him for His ministry
We see that the Spirit of the Lord was upon the Son because God had anointed Him to bring good news to the poor
In the four Gospels we have the exhibition of a wonderful person, the God-man, who was fully tested, proved, and approved by God
In this message we shall consider further God's work in the new dispensation, in His new administrative arrangement
The blood shed on the cross for our redemption was not only the blood of Jesus, but also the blood of the Son of God
When God was judging Christ as our Substitute made sin for us and bearing our sins, God forsook Christ economically
Regarding this, Matthew 27:45 and 46 say, 'Now from the sixth hour darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour
The Lord Jesus was crucified at the third hour, at our nine o'clock in the morning , and He suffered on the cross for six hours
God forsook Christ on the cross because He took the place of sinners , bearing our sins and being made sin for us
At the sixth hour twelve noon God came in and there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour until three oclock in the afternoon
The coming of darkness was God's doing, and in the midst of it the Lord cried out the words quoted in Matthew 27:46
The Lord was born of the begetting Spirit, who is God reaching man, as the divine essence, who never left Him essentially
When the Lord Jesus, the God-man, died on the cross under God's judgment, He had God within Him essentially as His divine being
As part of His work in His new administrative arrangement or economy God condemned sin in the flesh through the death of Christ in the flesh
We see that God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin and condemned sin in the flesh
The word 'likeness' denotes strongly that Christ's humanity does not have sin, but still that His humanity was in some way related to sin
He knew that He should not send His Son to be the flesh of sin, for if He had done that, His Son would have been involved with sin
Satan is the serpent, and the sin that was injected into man's body, transmuting it into the flesh of sin, is the nature of Satan
Romans 8:3 says not only that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but also that God sent Him 'concerning sin'
God sent His Son not only in the likeness of the flesh of sin but also concerning sin, that is, for sin, for the problem of sin
Because sin had been judged and the flesh of sin had been crucified, the separation between God and man was taken away
Whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies, and here we meet with God who is on the throne of grace
The old creation has been slain, and a new and living way to enter into the Holy of Holies has been opened by God
The veil in Hebrews 10:20 is the second veil within the tabernacle which, as we have seen, typifies the flesh of Christ
The ordinances, or decrees, refer to the ceremonial law with its rituals, the forms or ways of living and worship
Colossians 2:15 says, 'Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it'
While the Lord Jesus was dying on the cross, these rulers and authorities, these fallen angels, were very busy
During the time of Christ's crucifixion; there was an invisible spiritual conflict between God and these evil rulers and authorities
God won the victory, stripped off the rulers and authorities, and made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in the cross
After God created the heavens, the earth, and other items in the universe, an archangel rebelled, and many angels followed him
At that very juncture God stripped them off, triumphed over them, and made a display of them openly, putting them to shame
Now that the law and the evil angels have been set aside, God has a clear ground and a peaceful environment to enliven His chosen ones
He has a proper atmosphere to carry out the pleasant task of dispensing Himself into the very ones He chose in eternity past
Acts 2:24 says, 'Whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it'
In John 14:26 the Lord told the disciples that the Father will send the Holy Spirit as the Comforter in His name
John 14:16-20 proves that the Spirit, who is the Spirit of reality, sent by the Father, is the reality, the realization, of the Son
John 15:26 says that the Son will send the Spirit from with the Father, and the Spirit comes from with the Father
In this message we shall continue to see God's work in His new administrative arrangement, particularly in Christ's ascension
God's right hand, where Christ has been seated by the great power of God, is the most honorable place, the place with supreme authority
The authorities include not only the angelic, heavenly authorities, good or evil, but also the human, earthly ones
It does not mean that God gave Christ to the church as a gift; it means that God gave Christ a gift-the headship over all things
Through the transmission that is to the church, the church shares with Christ in all His attainments and obtainments
God made Him the Lord to possess the whole universe, God's chosen people, and all positive things, matters, and persons
Acts 5:31 says, 'This One God has exalted to His right hand as a Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins'
To give repentance and forgiveness of sins' to God's chosen people requires Christ to be exalted as a ruling Leader and Savior
Repentance and forgiveness are two steps by which we are made ready to receive the dispensing of the Triune God so that we may be the church
When God condemned sin in the flesh through the death of Christ in the flesh , He dealt with this hindrance to His dispensing
He has exalted Jesus to be a Leader and Savior so that He may give His chosen people repentance and forgiveness of sins
For Christ to be our High Priest, He had to partake of our humanity and enter with this humanity into resurrection
The context of the quotation of Hebrews 5:6, from Psalm 110, refers to Christ in His ascension and enthronement
Christ is now a priest according to the order of Melchisedec, and His work is to come to us, today's Abrahams, with bread and wine
The bread and wine contain the elements of Christ in His death and resurrection, that are being dispensed into us
As todays Abrahams we enjoy the supply of our Melchisedec a supply of the riches of Christ that is for Gods dispensing of Himself into us
According to the Bible, there are two orders of the priesthood-the order of Aaron and the order of Melchisedec
Melchisedec did not appear to Abraham with an offering to take away sin; he came with bread and wine to nourish Abraham
As such a High Priest, Christ ministers to us Himself in the bread and wine, as the embodiment of the processed God for our nourishment
At His coming back the resurrected Christ will be the Judge of the living before the millennium on His throne of glory
God has designated Him to execute this judgment because He is a Man , and God's raising Him from among the dead is a strong proof of this
After His resurrection, He ascended to the heavens to be made Lord, Christ, Savior, Leader, High Priest, and Head of all things
After passing through such a process, He became the Spirit, and the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God
The outpouring of the all-inclusive Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God is a great blessing to God's chosen people
It is a great thing to be under this dispensing, which is the issue of God's marvelous work in the New Testament
The reason the divine dispensing could not be experienced then was that the Triune God had not yet been consummated
God has poured out the all-inclusive Spirit as His consummation upon the whole Body of Christ including all of us
May we all see this vision that God has poured out the all-inclusive consummated Spirit and that we all are under this marvelous dispensing
After God poured out the consummated Spirit upon the Body of Christ, He sent the resurrected Christ back to His chosen people
God has sent back the resurrected and ascended Christ to the Jews first by pouring out His Spirit on the day of Pentecost
At the time Peter spoke the word recorded in Acts 3:26, Christ as God's Servant had ascended to the heavens and was still there
Gods work includes His calling forgiving justifying reconciling receiving regenerating washing sanctifying and glorifying the believers
To be called into the fellowship of God's Son is to be called into the partaking of, the participating in, His Son
God has called us into such a fellowship so that we may partake of and participate in Christ and enjoy Him as our God-given portion
The kingdom here is the sphere in which the believers worship and enjoy God under the divine ruling with the view of entering into His glory
Salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and the belief of the truth are the procedures; obtaining the glory of our Lord is the goal
In his second Epistle Peter gives us a word regarding God's calling, saying that God 'has called us to His own glory and virtue'
Ephesians 4:32 tells us that God in Christ forgave us, and Colossians 2:13 says that God has forgiven us all offenses
Although we may be right with everyoneour parents our children our neighbors and friendsour righteousness will never justify us before God
In Romans 3:30 Paul says, 'It is one God who shall justify the circumcision out of faith and uncircumcision through faith'
Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, it is the one God who has justified all of us so that we may be one as the Body of Christ
Through the redeeming death of Christ, God has justified us, the sinners, and has reconciled us, His enemies, to Himself
Regeneration enlivens us with God's life and brings us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with God
Whereas to be forgiven is to be released from the offense of our sins, to be cleansed is to be washed from the stain of unrighteousness
God sanctifies us wholly so that no part of our being, either of our spirit or soul or body, will be left common or profane
God has called us into this glory , and Christ Himself is the hope of this glory which we are expecting and for which we are waiting
For God to glorify us means that the glory that has been sown into us, saturates our whole being, and is expressed through us
When our whole being has been permeated and saturated with the element of glory, that glory will come out of us
We need to see that all these aspects of God's work with respect to the believers are for the goal of His dispensing of Himself into us
Galatians 4:6 says, 'Because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father'!
As sons of God we have the position with the full right to participate in the Spirit of God, who has the bountiful supply of life
In verses 4 through 6 of Galatians 4 the Triune God is producing many sons for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose
He came as the Son under the law to qualify us for sonship and to open the way for us to share in this sonship
After He had finished this work, He became, in resurrection, the life-giving Spirit and comes to us as the Spirit of the Son
To carry out His New Testament economy in and through all the believers God operates all things in the believers according to His desire
Concerning God's caring for the believers, 1 Peter 5:7 says, 'Casting all your anxiety on Him, because it matters to Him concerning you'
Although the verb 'casting' indicates a once-for-all act, because we are weak, we may need to cast our anxieties upon God again and again
In Philippians 47 Paul says The peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus
Jude 24 speaks of God as the One 'who is able to guard you from stumbling, and to set you before His glory without blemish in exultation'
God in His faithfulness will not allow any temptation to befall us beyond what we are able to endure, but will always make a way out for us
It indicates that God not only comforts and consoles us, but also cheers us, making us happy with His goodness
After we have suffered a little while, the God of all grace will personally perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us
After God establishes us, He strengthens us, empowers us, and, eventually, grounds us in Himself as the Triune God
The word strengthened is modified by four phrases According to the riches of His glory with power through His Spirit and into the inner man
It is our spirit regenerated by the Spirit of God , indwelt by the Spirit of God , and mingled with the Spirit of God
In order to experience Christ unto all the fullness of God, we need to be strengthened by God into the inner man
The Father disciplines us for our profit that we might partake of His holiness which is the very characteristic of His holy nature
God's discipline not only makes us to partake of His holiness but also yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness
No doubt growth comes from inward nourishment, but this nourishment needs the coordination of the outward environment
Is the need of God's sovereignty to arrange our environment that all things may work together for our good according to His purpose
The New Jerusalem is a composition of all the perfected saints of the Old Testament and all the matured believers of the New Testament
Revelation 1:1 speaks of the 'revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves what must swiftly take place'
Israel is under God's sovereign care that it may also be consummated in the New Jerusalem for God's eternal manifestation
The world is absolutely under God's judgment that it may be brought to its ultimate destiny- the eternal perdition in the lake of fire
The tabernacle of David is the kingdom of Israel and to rebuild the tabernacle of David is to restore the nation of Israel
Matthew 13:43 refers to this: 'Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father'
Revelation 20:6 indicates that the overcomers 'shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years'
In this part of the millennium Christ and the overcomers will reign for the Father's expression and satisfaction
Eventually, at the end of the millennium, the last age of the old creation, every enemy will have been put under the feet of Christ
When sin is done away with at the end of the old creation and when its source Satan is cast into the lake of fire death will be abolished
It also will be cast into the lake of fire with Hades, its power, after the last and final judgment at the white throne
The lake of fire is the 'trash can' for the entire universe, into which all negative things, including death and Hades , will be cast
If we see what God is doing and the purpose for it, then we shall know where we need to be-continually under His dispensing
Let us remain in God's presence so that He may have the opportunity to infuse into us all He is and all He has
The one throne for both God and the Lamb signifies that God and the Lamb are one-the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, God the Redeemer
In the New Jerusalem, we have God in the Lamb, and out of the redeeming God flows the river of life, the life-giving Spirit
The tree of life grows in the river of life, and the river of life that flows out of the throne reaches every part of the city
Every part of the city receives the life supply because the tree of life grows in the river and the river reaches every part of the city
In these messages we have considered the many aspects of God's work in eternity past, in the old dispensation, and in the new dispensation
To express Himself through the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth will also be God's work in eternity future
