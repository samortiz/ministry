<h2 class=head2>Entering the Tabernacle</h2><p>Because of the problem of sin, there was an altar near the entrance of the tabernacle. There was the need for the problem of sin to be solved in order for fallen people to enter into the tabernacle to meet with God. The tabernacle pointed to the fact that God was among the people. God’s dwelling place was on earth so that His people could enter into Him to enjoy Him and participate in all His riches. However, because sin has been injected into mankind, mankind is fallen, and all people have the problem of sin. This problem can be solved only by the altar, that is, by the cross. At the cross Christ offered Himself as our sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering.<p>With the case of Nicodemus we have regeneration. With the case of the Samaritan woman we see a person satisfied with living water and also obtaining the reality, the truth, with which to worship God. Then in chapters five through eleven we have the case of the enlivening of the impotent man in chapter five; the case of the satisfying of the hungry people in chapter six; the case of the thirsty ones satisfied and overflowing with rivers of living water in chapter seven; the case of someone freed from the bondage of sin in chapter eight; the case of the healing of the blind man in order to pass out of darkness into light in chapter nine; and the case of the resurrection of Lazarus in chapter eleven. When we put all these cases together, we can realize that apart from Christ as the offerings, it would not be possible for us to be regenerated, be satisfied with the living water, have reality for the worship of God, be enlivened, be nourished with living bread, have our thirst quenched and overflow living water, be freed from sin in order to be brought out of blindness, and be resurrected out of the tomb in order to become a living person. All this depends upon Christ as the offerings. This is the reason that in this Gospel we have the fulfillment of the offerings for us to enter into the tabernacle.<p>Perhaps you are wondering where you can find the tabernacle in the Gospel of John. In chapter thirteen there is the laver for our washing, and in chapters fourteen through seventeen we have the tabernacle with the incense altar. In chapter seventeen Christ our High Priest is interceding at the incense altar. In a later message we shall come to the laver in chapter thirteen. In this message we are still at the altar. However, as we come to chapter twelve, we are at the altar enjoying not the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, or the meal offering, but we are enjoying the peace offering in a little house in Bethany.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE HOUSE IN BETHANY</h2><h2 class=head2>Feasting on the Peace Offering</h2><p>The first sign in John 12 is the sign of the house in Bethany (vv. 1-3), a house that is a miniature of the church life. Bethany means the house of affliction. Yet there was a feasting with the Lord.<p>John 12:2 says, “So they made Him a supper there; and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him.” Here we see that Lazarus was reclining at the table with the Lord Jesus and that Martha was serving. In verse 3 Mary did something to express her love for the Lord. But the important point here is that everyone in the house was feasting.<p>When Jesus was in that house in Bethany, God was there, for He is God incarnate. While that feasting was taking place in Bethany, the high priest and the other priests were serving God in the temple in Jerusalem. This means that two kinds of services were going on at the same time, one in Bethany and the other in Jerusalem. In the service in Bethany, Martha was serving, Lazarus was reclining at the table with the Lord Jesus, and Mary was anointing the feet of Jesus and wiping them with her hair. But in the service in Jerusalem the priests, clothed in long robes, were offering sacrifices and burning incense. Where was God at that time—in the temple or in the house in Bethany? The priests no doubt had the full assurance that they were worshipping God. But actually God was not there, for He was in Bethany. He was enjoying a service that had altogether no form or ritual. Instead of kneeling down before the Lord, Lazarus was reclining at the table with Him. According to 12:10-11, the chief priests took counsel that they might kill Lazarus as well as the Lord Jesus, because on account of Lazarus many were believing in the Lord.<p>The enjoyment in the house in Bethany was the outcome, the issue, of all the foregoing cases. The last case, that of Lazarus in chapter eleven, was a case of resurrection. Through His resurrection life the Lord gained a house in Bethany where He could feast and have rest and satisfaction. In that house in Bethany the Lord, God incarnate, and His disciples could feast together on the peace offering. This feasting in Bethany was the outcome of the foregoing nine cases.
