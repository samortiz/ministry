<P>According to typology, Isaac indeed typified the Son. But what kind of experiences did Isaac have? We can say that Isaac's experiences were all very common. Unlike Abraham, who did many things which had never been done before, Isaac only did what others had already accomplished. Abraham was truly the father, while Isaac was truly the son. In Genesis 21 Ishmael was mocking on the day Isaac was weaned, but we do not see any record of what Isaac did when he was young. When Abraham put the wood for the burnt offering on him, he did not say a word. When Abraham bound him and laid him on the altar upon the wood, he did not say anything either. He went wherever his father told him to go and did not say anything. At such a critical moment, he only said, "Where is the lamb for a burnt offering?" (22:7). In Genesis 23 his mother died, and in chapter twenty-four his father found a wife for him. He did not make any decisions, and he did not do anything for himself. He had nothing of his own. When he was sixty years old, he had two sons, which was not unusual, because Abraham also had two sons. God commanded Abraham to cast out the first son and put the second son on the altar, but He did not command Isaac to do this. Although God loved Jacob and hated Esau (Mal. 1:2-3), He did not ask Isaac to do anything. Abraham experienced a famine in Canaan, and Isaac also experienced a famine in Canaan (Gen. 12:10; 26:1). When the famine came, Abraham went down to Egypt. While he was there he told others that his wife was his sister. In the end he was rebuked by Pharaoh (12:18-19). Although Isaac did not go down to Egypt when the famine came, he went down to Gerar. He also said that his wife was his sister. In the end he was rebuked by Abimelech (26:9-10). Later, Isaac dug some wells, but the wells that he dug were those that his father had dug when he was alive. After his father died, the Philistines covered up the wells, and Isaac opened them up again. He called them by the same name that his father had called them (v. 18). After he died, he was buried in his father's grave. Even his grave was prepared by his father (49:30-31). This is the history of Isaac.</P><P>We have to learn the lesson of knowing God as the Son from these experiences. Not only do we have to know God as the Father, but we have to know Christ as the Son. What is the meaning of God as the Son? It means that everything is received and nothing is initiated by Him. In Abraham we see God's purpose. In Isaac we see God's power. In Abraham we see the standard which God requires of His people. In Isaac we see the life which enables God's people to reach that standard. Many Christians have one basic problem: They only see God's purpose but do not see God's provisions. They see God's standard but do not see God's life. They see God's demands, but do not see the power that meets these demands. This is why we have to consider Isaac as well as Abraham.</P>
