   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S RESURRECTION BEING A PROOF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THAT OUR SINS ARE FORGIVEN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let me ask, "Which came first Jesus' being delivered or our offenses?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe all of us would say that Jesus was delivered because there were offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If this is the case, we should apply the same principle to the phrase "raised for our justification."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that He was resurrected because we were justified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord's resurrection proves that we are justified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The proof of forgiveness is the Lord's blood; the proof of justification is the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose I owe Mr. Tang a sum of money, and he takes me to court.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The judge sentences me to three months in jail, but neither I nor my good friend Mr. Yang has any way to repay the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So my good friend volunteers to go to jail on my behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As soon as Mr. Yang goes into jail, I am free.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But even though I have the freedom in my body, my heart is still not free, because I do not have the assurance that his substitutional imprisonment will solve the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, my heart has no peace while he is still in jail.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When will my heart be free?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have to wait until Mr. Yang is released from jail and my case is closed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only then will my heart be free.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The release of Mr. Yang is a proof that my case has been concluded.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If it were not concluded, the judge would not have let him go.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The instant the Lord died, the problem of our sins was resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if the Lord had only died and remained in death without resurrecting, we would be worried because we would not know whether or not His blood had satisfied God's righteous requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible says that the Lord's death is for God and that the Lord's resurrection is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is concerned that if man only believed in the Lord's death, his heart would not be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, God not only caused the Lord to die, He also resurrected the Lord from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we see His resurrection, we are assured that our sinful case has been concluded.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Otherwise, why would God release Him?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God resurrected Christ from the dead as a proof that He is satisfied with His judgment on sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This proves that the Lord's blood has satisfied God's demands.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God accepts the death of Christ, and we accept the resur- rection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God does not ask man to believe in Christ's death but in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The resurrection of Christ is a proof that His death is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With His resurrection, we are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans 4:25 shows us that Jesus died because we have sinned and that He resurrected because we have been justified.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to prove that we are justified, Jesus was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jesus went as a man to God and paid the debts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He has already presented the blood to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Suppose I owe Brother Tang some money and cannot repay him at the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I can save some money here and there several hundred dollars in Shanghai currency and some currency from Canton, Swatow, Amoy, Foochow, England, the United States, Vietnam, the Philippines, and other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After awhile, I may think that there is enough money for the payment and take the money to him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, I have no idea whether or not the money can be used and whether it is enough to cover my debt.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I can give him the money and say, "I think this is roughly what I owe you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here, the money is yours."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Who do you think will do the detailed calculations?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Will it be the one who returns the money or the one who receives the money?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Surely it will be the one who receives the money.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He must determine whether the money he has received is valid currency and whether or not the total amount is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I do not need to worry about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I can just wait for him to sign and issue me a receipt, and then I can leave.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whether or not the blood of Jesus is able or sufficient to accomplish redemption is not our concern.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is God's business, and God takes care of it Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord's blood has redeemed us before God and paid our sin-debts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Consequently, God has issued a receipt to man the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Acts 17:31 shows us that resurrection is God's declaration that the Lord's blood is sufficient to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why He gave us resurrection as a receipt.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Resurrection is the proof that our sins have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Friends, what do we believe when we believe in the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We believe that God has resurrected Him from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we have any doubt about our salvation, we should look at the proof of acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even if God tells us that we are not justified, we can show Him resurrection as the proof of our acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We can boldly and confidently say to God, "If I have not been justified, why have You issued the proof?"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We know that the Lord has resurrected, and if we believe in His resurrection, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These are the two substitutionary aspects of the Lord's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These two aspects are objective because no changes are required on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They deal with the sins we have before God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Have we been forgiven?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Are we justified?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These matters are God's business; they are the objective facts.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May God bless us.</S>
