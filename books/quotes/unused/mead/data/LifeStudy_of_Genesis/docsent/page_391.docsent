   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Having Natural Weakness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>as Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have seen, Isaac had the same natural weakness as Abraham cf.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>20:1-2, 11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do you not have a natural weakness?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even the most spiritually conscious person has some natural weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What kind of weakness do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although we all have some natural weakness, none of us can designate it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We know that we have such a weakness, but we do not know what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you are certain that a particular matter is your natural weakness, that is not your weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before Isaac was exposed in chapter twenty-six, he probably never realized that his natural weakness was the same as Abraham's. He might have thought that his weakness was one of many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But one day he went southward and his natural weakness was exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By ourselves we can never know our natural weakness; it must be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>None of us is able to understand his own weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You yourself may not know your own natural weakness, but it is clear to everyone else because it has been exposed to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whoever would stay with you for a time would see your natural weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to your religious concept, if you have some natural weakness, you should be through with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But God's grace is still with you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the early days I also had this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But I have learned that grace does not depend upon what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every object of divine grace has a weak point.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not think that the Apostle Paul had no weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter, John, and Paul all had their weaknesses, but their weak points did not frustrate them from enjoying God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every one of us has his natural weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There has been only one person in history who had no natural weakness Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am not encouraging you to be either spiritual or unspiritual, but I am encouraging you to be bold in the enjoyment of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not be deprived of the enjoyment of grace by your religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Drop your concept and praise the Lord that you are the object of divine grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although we are unable to designate our natural weakness, we do know that we have some.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Others, such as our wife, husband, or roommates, know what our weakness is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While others know, it is difficult for us to know.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some of us may not know our natural weakness until we see the Lord face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Praise the Lord that we are blind to our natural weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we were not blind to our weakness, we would be frustrated from enjoying grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While I am not encouraging you to keep your natural weakness, I am saying that it is good that we are unaware of it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we are conscious of a certain weakness, our religious concepts frustrate us from the enjoyment of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But when we do not know our weakness, we only know to enjoy the grace of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Genesis 26, Isaac's natural weakness was suddenly exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That exposure, however, did not frustrate him from the enjoyment of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, the exposure of Isaac's natural weakness did not hinder him from trusting in God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Isaac, leaving Beer-sheba, journeyed downward, southward, not to Egypt but to a place close to Egypt 26:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's intention was that His chosen people stay in the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever the natural weakness of His people arose, they always went downward.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We cannot find one instance in which God's people went upward, northward, when they were weak.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The worst thing to do was to go downward to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is what Abraham did 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The second time Abraham went southward he only went as far as Philistia, the land of the Philistines 20:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As Isaac, who was repeating Abraham's downward story, was going southward, God intervened and warned him, saying, "Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of" 26:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Isaac's intention might have been to go down into Egypt, but God commanded him to dwell in the land of which He would tell him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although Isaac did not stay in exactly the right place, he still had peace in enjoying God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was absolutely unconscious of being religious.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How good it is to have no sense of being religious!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, once the enemy has injected something into our knowledge, it is very difficult to extract it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>My burden in this message is to tell you that the enjoyment of God's grace does not depend upon our being religious.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Isaac we see a person who was not at all religious; yet he enjoyed the grace of God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Isaac not only did not stay in the right place; he also lied at the sacrifice of his wife 26:6-7 just as Abraham did.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, he and his wife were preserved by God's sovereign care 26:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It was God's grace that kept him from the sacrifice of his wife.</S>
