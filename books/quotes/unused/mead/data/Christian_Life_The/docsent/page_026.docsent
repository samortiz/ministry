   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are regenerated, but we are still full of our natural peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the Spirit functions to sanctify the believers after their regeneration Rom 6:19, 22; 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This sanctification involves a transformation from the natural disposition to a spiritual one by Christ as the life-giving Spirit saturating all the inward parts of our being with God's nature of holiness.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not think, feel, or decide according to our old, natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are Christians, so we should be renewed in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even in the way that we comb our hair, we need to be renewed.</S>
