<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Divine Dispensing of the Divine Trinity<br>in Constituting the Church as the<br>Organic Body of Christ</H2><P>The church is not something organized or composed together. The church is something that is constituted. The church is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23; Col. 1:18). Our body is not a number of bones composed together. It is not organized together as a carpenter would put pieces of wood together to make a table. Our body is not a composition; neither is it an organization. Our body is a constitution. In this body there is life, and there is the circulation of blood. This circulation of blood flows within our entire body. Wherever it flows, it constitutes. All the members of our body are constituted together through the circulation of the blood. This is not a matter of organization or composition, but a matter of organic constitution. This is what the church should be.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God the Father's Choosing and Predestinating<br>the Believers to Participate in His Holy Nature<br>and Sonship through His Dispensing</H2><P>God has chosen us to participate in His holy nature (Eph. 1:4). This means that if we are going to have God's divine nature imparted into us, we must have a union with God. When we are united to God, His nature will be ours organically. Furthermore, we the believers have been predestinated to have the sonship of God (Eph. 1:5). Holiness refers to God's nature, and sonship refers to God's life. Both God's nature and God's life indicate that we the believers should be organically one with God. As God's children, we do have His life, and we do have His nature because we have His life. The nature goes along with the life. When we have the human life, we also have the human nature. In the same way, when we have the divine life, we also have the divine nature. Because we have the divine nature, we can be holy, as He is holy. This is according to the Father's selection and predestination, and it is accomplished through God's dispensing. Through His dispensing, God comes into us to be our life and our nature.</P>
