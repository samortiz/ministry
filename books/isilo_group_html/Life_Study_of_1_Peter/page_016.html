Christ is present with us today, but He is veiled. The time of His coming will also be the time of His unveiling. Some mistakenly think that the Lord Jesus is not here today. But the Lord certainly is here. Matthew 28:20 says, &ldquo;Behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age.&rdquo; Although the Lord is with us, He is with us under the veil. Sometimes, however, in our experience with the Lord, we are not under the veil with Him. But at other times we are with Him under the veil. Are you under the veil with the Lord, or are you outside the veil?</p><p>Do you know what the Lord&rsquo;s coming back will be? The Lord&rsquo;s coming back will be His unveiling. When He is unveiled, we who are under the veil with Him will also be unveiled.</p><p>The Lord Jesus actually is present with us today. Do you not believe that the Lord is with us? I must testify that the Lord is in my spirit. But according to the concept of unbelievers, Christ is not with us. Even certain believers who are fundamental and who emphasize the objective aspect of the truth say that Christ is far away in the third heaven on the throne at the right hand of God. Some of these fundamental Christians may not believe that Christ is in us. But we know that the Lord whom we love not only is in the heavens, but also dwells within us.</p><p>Because the Lord is now veiled, people cannot see Him. But His coming will be His unveiling. In verse 7 Peter emphasizes the particular matter that the Lord&rsquo;s coming back will be the taking away of the veil that now covers Him. At that time, everyone will see Him. Prior to that time, we can see Him in spirit.</p><p>In John 14:19 and 20 the Lord Jesus speaks of being seen by His disciples: &ldquo;Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you shall live also. In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; According to John 14:19, the worldly people cannot see the Lord Jesus, but the believers can see Him. In John 14:20 the Lord Jesus indicates that He and we live together. How can we live together with the Lord without seeing Him? Actually, what we have described for us in John 14:20 is not merely living together with the Lord; this verse actually speaks of a life of co-inherence with Him, that is, a life of the Lord living in us and of our living in Him. Because we live such a life, to us He has already been unveiled.</p><p>When the Lord Jesus is unveiled and we are unveiled with Him, those who oppose us will be amazed. Today some oppose us and speak evil concerning us. In some cases, young people may be opposed by their parents. Nevertheless, although their parents oppose them, sometimes the parents are astonished at the young people. They may say, &ldquo;Sometimes you do things that are marvelous. We don&rsquo;t understand you. How can you do these things?&rdquo; Although the parents of some of the young people may not be able to understand them now, they will understand when the veil is taken away from the Lord Jesus and also from us. Then they will know the Lord and they will also know us. When the Lord Jesus is unveiled, the worldly people will see Him, and they will see us with Him. Then they will know Christ, and they will also know us.</p><p>Unbelievers and people of the world sometimes regard us as peculiar and strange. According to their understanding, we are not normal. They enjoy different kinds of worldly entertainment, but we do not partake of these things. For example, someone at work may encourage you to participate in a certain form of worldly amusement. If you refuse to do so, he may say that you are strange or abnormal. Unbelievers will see things differently when the Lord Jesus is unveiled. When this veil is taken away and our veil is removed as well, the worldly people will say, &ldquo;Now I know that this one is a follower of Jesus. When I knew him at work, he was one who loved the Lord and sought Him. Now I understand why I thought he was so strange, so abnormal.&rdquo; This will be the situation if we love the Lord and follow Him today. However, if we do not love the Lord, follow Him, and seek Him, our situation will be very different when He is unveiled.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 Peter &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
