   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Visitation and Edification of New Believers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The new believers' edification has to be done with proper arrangements as well.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once our gospel visitation is strengthened and the number of new believers increases, there is the need of proper edification and perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Otherwise, the church will be overburdened.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do not have a good new believers' edification program in the first year, it will be harder to make it up in the second year.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a baby does not open his mouth the first year after his birth, it will be hard to open his mouth eight or ten years later.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This same principle applies in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a man does not open his mouth in the first year, he will remain dumb after ten or twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Dumbness is a matter of habit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not edify the new ones properly, we will add more burden to the church; many brothers and sisters will be brought into the church life in a muddled way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This easily will bring in worldly elements and human opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If this is the case, case the more people we save, the less spiritual the church will become, and the more problems we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every worker must be clear that he has a double responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, he has to push people through the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the other hand, he has to lead them on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The goal of the new believers' meeting is to develop the proper habit and character in the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let me use myself as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I was saved in 1919, I sometimes prayed twenty times a day and sometimes did not pray at all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I was very loose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The same could be said about my reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was unstructured.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I was stirred up, I would read fifty or sixty chapters a day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I was cold, I did not want to touch the Bible at all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was only for conscience's sake that I would read one or two verses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I lived this way because I had not received good training and edification during the first year of my Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second year after being saved I went to Shanghai and met Miss Groves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She was a co-worker of Miss Barber.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She asked me, "Do you read the Bible?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I was very clever, and I answered, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But she pressed further by asking, "How much?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I felt ashamed and dropped my head, saying, "Sometimes more, and sometimes less when I do not feel like reading."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She testified, "From the time I was seven years old until now, I have memorized one verse a day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am fifty-seven years old now.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She lived until well over seventy years old.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From the day that I became a Christian, I have never woken up after six o'clock."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Her word pinned me down.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>During those few months, I was trained by her.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was a tremendous help to me in my later walk with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to do the same with the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes we have to walk with them for a while or stand on the street corner and recite a verse with them before letting them go.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to learn to pick up the proper habit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can prepare a prayer list and pray for the new ones every day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to study the Bible and remind each other to do the same thing every day.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we have to help the new ones to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This kind of training helps all of us develop a habit of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Reading the Bible and praying are not the only things that we should do; we have to help the new ones develop the habit of leading others to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>During the above mentioned period of time, I went to see Miss Groves every Saturday.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She would ask me how many people I had saved that week.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If I said that no one had been saved, she would say, "See, you have not saved anyone for a whole week.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How many will you save this month?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How many will you save this year?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The leading brothers have to learn to pin down the young ones step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to tell them that if they do not run a straight course, the ones coming after them will follow their example and will not have a proper walk.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once we relax in the new believers' edification, the church will be full of worldly Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hong Kong has over two million people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can easily gain some people if we work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must not allow the brothers and sisters to have a concept that they can sit back comfortably in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The first year after I was saved, I brought a person to the Lord who was working as a cook for a Western missionary in Kuling.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That was the result of preaching to him continuously for a few days on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I forgot his name and thought that no one would listen to me because I was just a boy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The first time I met Miss Groves, she asked, "You have been a Christian for a year.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How many people have you saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I had been afraid that she would ask, and I lowered my head and said, "One."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>She said, "Do you have the audacity to tell me that you have saved only one?"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>She asked for the name of the person.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I only knew that this one was a cook.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>She said again, "You only brought one to the Lord, and you don't know his name!"</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Later, she taught me how to deal with my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>She taught me to make a prayer list and to persevere in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Thank the Lord, in the second year I brought over sixty to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we do not study the Bible conscientiously, we cannot be a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Throughout church history, it has been commonly recognized that no one can know the Lord properly if he does not study the Word properly.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Not only do the young ones have to study; even the older ones have to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The older ones have to check with the younger ones about their reading, and the younger ones have to check with the older ones about their reading.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I give the younger ones the authority to check with the older ones so that the older ones will not be lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the only way for the church to become strong.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If a person develops the proper Christian habits at the beginning of his Christian life, it will be easy for him to go on as a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Prayer, reading the Word, and leading men to salvation these are things that we have to build up in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we do, there will not be so many easygoing Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once the number of easygoing Christians increases, the proper church service will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Before we can go on in a proper way, we must build up these habits from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The fifty-two lessons for edifying new believers are the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If you did not pick them up last year, you have to do so this year.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We spoke about them in 1950.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We still will speak about them in 1960.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The subjects do not need to change.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There is no need for improvement, because there is no need for advancement with foundational work.</S>
