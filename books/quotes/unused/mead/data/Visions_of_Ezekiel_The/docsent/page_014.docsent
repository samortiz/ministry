   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>For Covering and for Moving</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Each of the four living creatures had four wings, two for covering and two for moving.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Two wings are for moving and joining one to the other.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The joining is for the moving.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In a later chapter we will see that the moving is altogether a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here, two wings are for moving and two are for covering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The grace, the power, and the strength of the Lord to us is not only for moving, but also for covering us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are under the overshadowing of the grace and power of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are under the covering of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whatever we do and whatever we are must be by the grace and power of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the same time, we are under the overshadowing, the covering of the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As Christians, we should have an element that causes people to wonder at us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times, they should be able to realize that something is covering and overshadowing us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, they should realize we are normal people, yet with us there is something empowering, something strengthening, some thing overshadowing, and something covering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The front face of the four living creatures is the face of a man, but the body is that of an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Two of his wings are stretched forth to join to the other living creatures, and two of his wings are wrapped around his body for a cover.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, if you look at his face, he looks like a man, but if you look at his body, he looks like an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He looks like a man, but he moves like an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must express ourselves all the time like a man, like a normal and proper husband, wife, parent, child, student, or teacher; but when people look and consider us, they should realize there is something covering, empowering, strengthening, protecting, and overshadowing us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It should be difficult for people to explain us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should be able to suffer things others cannot suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should bear responsibility that others cannot bear.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should understand things more deeply than others do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With us, there must be something mysterious; though we suffer, we are always happy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Something is always covering us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, we have two wings for moving, and we have another two wings for covering and overshadowing us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those moving and overshadowing wings should give people the impression of the Divine Being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That is the eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have the four wings of an eagle, giving people the impression that we have God with us as our power and our protection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>HAVING THE HANDS OF A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Under the wings are the hands of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that a proper, normal Christian must always do things exactly like a man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He must use man's hands.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul said that his two hands ministered to his own necessities and to the needs of his co-workers Acts 20:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some say they have faith in the almighty God to supply all their needs, hence there is no need for them to use their hands to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But consider the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With Paul there were always the two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Surely there were not only the four wings, but also the hands of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He said it was not by his wisdom, but by the grace of God and that the grace of God with him was not in vain 2 Cor 1:12; 1 Cor 15:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the side of the eagle's wings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But he also said he labored more than all the other apostles 1 Cor 15:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You may think there was no need for Paul to work with his own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But Paul took the way of working with his own hands; he took the human way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes young people imagine that because they are seeking the Lord, there is no need for them to study hard.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They hope that when the test comes they will pass with an A .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No matter how much you seek the Lord, no matter how much you love Him and care for Him, you still must study hard to prepare your lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No matter how much the grace of God is with us empowering us, we must fulfill our human duty.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must daily eat the proper human food in the human way, according to human principles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we do not eat humanly but rather like an angel, we will become sick.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must do things like a human.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Under the four wings are the man's hands.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The hands of a man must always be working.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The worldly people have only the man's hands.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They have no eagle's wings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But many so-called religious people seem to have only the eagle's wings; they do not seem to have the hands of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They seem to be like an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must have both.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must have the wings of the Lord's empowering grace and the hands of a man, cooperating with God in a human way.</S>
