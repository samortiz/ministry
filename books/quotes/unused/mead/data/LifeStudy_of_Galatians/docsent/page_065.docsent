   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE AIM OF THE JUDAIZERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 17 says, They are zealous of you, not rightly, but they desire to shut you out, that you may be zealous of them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Greek word rendered zealous in this verse means to be jealously courting someone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Judaizers were jealously courting the Galatians so that the Galatians might jealously court them in return.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To court a person is to pursue that person in love with the aim of gaining his love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Judaizers pursued the Galatian believers in this way, actually courting them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates how serious, how zealous, the Judaizers were.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, as Paul says, the Judaizers jealously courted them, not rightly, but with the desire to shut them out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They did not pursue them in an honorable, commendable way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their aim was to exclude them from the proper preaching of the gospel of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They wanted to exclude them from God s New Testament economy, from the enjoyment of Christ, and from the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The principle is the same with dissenting ones today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their goal is to shut out the church people from the enjoyment of Christ and to cause the ones they have deceived to zealously follow them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 18 Paul continues, But it is good always to be zealous in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is good to jealously court someone in a good thing, in the proper preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This should be the case not only when Paul is present.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By this word Paul indicates that he is not narrow, keeping other preachers of the gospel away from the Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, he rejoices in the preaching of others Phil 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul was in favor of the proper preaching of others, but he was not in favor of that kind of jealous courting of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>PAUL S TRAVAIL</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 19 says, My children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here Paul considers himself the begetting father, and the Galatian believers his children begotten of him in Christ see 1 Cor 4:15; Philem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This also was an appeal to their affection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul told the Galatian believers that he was again travailing on their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Travail refers to painful labor in childbirth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this metaphor Paul likens himself to a mother who gives birth to a child.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He labored in this way for the regeneration of the Galatians when he first preached the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because they had deviated from the gospel he preached to them, he labors again in travail until Christ is formed in them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this verse Paul likens himself both to a begetting father and a travailing mother.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Was he, then, a father or a mother?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was both, depending on the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On one occasion he was a begetting father; on another, a travailing mother.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul was in travail that Christ might be formed in the Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ, a living Person, is the focus of Paul s gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His preaching is to bring forth Christ, the Son of the living God, in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This differs greatly from the teaching of the law in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, the book of Galatians is emphatically Christ-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ was crucified 3:1 to redeem us out of the curse of the law 3:13 and rescue us out of the evil religious course of the world 1:4 ; and He was resurrected from among the dead 1:1 that He might live in us 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We were baptized into Him, identified with Him, and have put on Him, have clothed ourselves with Him 3:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, we are in Him 3:28 and have become His 3:29; 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the other hand, He has been revealed in us 1:16 , He is now living in us 2:20 , and He will be formed in us 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is to Him the law has conducted us 3:24 , and in Him we are all sons of God 3:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is in Him that we inherit God s promised blessing and enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is also in Him that we are all one 3:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not be deprived of all profit from Him and so be severed from Him 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need Him to supply us with His grace in our spirit 6:18 that we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ was born into the Galatian believers, but not formed in them, when they were regenerated through Paul s preaching the gospel to them the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now the apostle travails again that Christ might be formed in them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ grown in us in full.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First Christ was born into us at our conversion, then He lives in us in our Christian life 2:20 , and He will be formed in us at our maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is needed that we may be sons of full age, heirs to inherit God s promised blessing, and mature in the divine sonship.</S>
