His sins are forgiven, righteousness is imputed to him, and the records of his sins are forever erased.</P><P>God calls sinners to receive salvation and calls saints to receive the reward. Salvation is given through the righteousness of the Lord Jesus. The reward is given through the work of the Christians. A man cannot be saved through good works, neither can he be rewarded through faith. Salvation comes from believing in the Lord Jesus as the Savior, and the reward comes from the good works which one performs after he is saved.</P>	<ol class="upper-roman">	<li>Salvation:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>Salvation is a free gift:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"The gift of God" (John 4:10)</li>			<li>"Take...freely" (Rev. 22:17)</li>			<li>"The gift of God" (Rom. 6:23)</li>			</ol></li>		<li>Salvation is a present inheritance:			<ol class="decimal">			<li>"Gave" (1 John 5:11)</li>			<li>"Has saved us" (2 Tim. 1:9)</li>			<li>"Has eternal life" (John 6:47)<br>			If a saved person works faithfully for the Lord, he will receive a reward.
