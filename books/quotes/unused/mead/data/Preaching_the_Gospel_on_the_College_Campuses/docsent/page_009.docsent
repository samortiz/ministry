   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PREACHING THE GOSPEL BY SPEAKING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The work of preaching the gospel is not a quick, mushrooming work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is based upon our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Based upon our prayer, we need to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many of us in the Lord's recovery need to learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to speak, however, you need the proper material.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1980 the Living Stream Ministry published Gospel Outlines, containing two hundred sixty-six outlines for gospel messages.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These outlines cover God, man, the fall, Satan, redemption, justification, and many other topics.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The outlines are quite detailed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This book will provide you with something to say.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You should fill yourself up with all the materials related to the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are many gospel truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Apostle Paul had a great deal to speak because the Old Testament was a rich source of light and truth to him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have to learn the truth as Paul did.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you are equipped with the truth, you will be like a doctor who has a dispensary full of medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you contact a young person, you will know what medicine he needs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The medicine is the word of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, do not wait until you know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Start speaking right away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is a principle in the Bible that the more you speak, the more light you will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I can testify that the more I speak, the more light and truth come to me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This principle can be illustrated with a water hose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, the hose takes in water from the faucet; on the other hand, it flows out water.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When water is coming out of the hose, this means that a fresh supply of water is flowing into it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more that we flow out the living water by speaking Christ, the more the living water flows into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should speak and speak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times I have spoken things that I only received after I started speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more I spoke, the more I received.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should learn to speak based upon our prayer and to speak by faith in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible clearly says, "The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life" John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must believe that the words we speak are spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should all be speakers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Each one of us should say, "I am a speaker in the church."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Speaking is not the responsibility of just a few brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everyone has to be a speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before we speak, however, we have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must fulfill our priestly service by praying to bring people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should put them on our breast and shoulders Exo 28:29-30 , bearing them in love and in power into the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After we pray in this manner, we will be authorized and filled with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word is our authority to go to the people as kings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are both priests and kings 1 Pet 2:9; Rev 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are priests, so we can pray for the sinners to bring them to God, and we are kings so we can bring God to the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Firstly, we bring sinners to the Lord, and then we bring the Lord to sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we go to the Lord with sinners by praying, we are priests.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we come to sinners with the Lord by preaching, we are the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As kings our speaking has authority.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>People will realize our speaking is not ordinary but weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you do not pray and speak the holy word from the Bible, your speaking will not have any weight.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It will only be a light speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Weighty speaking comes only from prayer and the use of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You must be filled with prayer and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then you will be saturated with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eventually you will be the embodiment of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our being needs to be constituted and composed with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Word should be in every fiber of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I hope the young people will be filled with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Word is the Spirit and the Word is life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only the Spirit and life are powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we speak the words of spirit and life, our speaking will be like a royal edict.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this edict there will be weight, authority, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It would be good if each church could set aside at least one evening a week to come together to pray and learn the truth in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then everyone will be filled with the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When I was young, I read a book by Dr. R. A. Torrey entitled How to Bring Men to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the book, Dr. Torrey gave verses to meet the needs of different types of people.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Eventually we found that this list of verses was inadequate to meet all the needs of the people we contacted in our gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We needed more verses.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sometimes we needed an understanding of chapters and even of whole books of the Bible for our preaching to be effective.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The preaching of many Christians may not be prevailing because they have a poor understanding of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I hope that many of you will pray and gain the full knowledge of the truth to speak the Word.</S>
