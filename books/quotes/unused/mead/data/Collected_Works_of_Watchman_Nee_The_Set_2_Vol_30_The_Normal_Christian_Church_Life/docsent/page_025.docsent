   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT NARROWER THAN A LOCALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We read in 1 Corinthians 1:2 of "the church of God which is in Corinth."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Corinth was a unit-locality, and the church in Corinth, a unit-church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When discord crept in and its members were on the point of splitting the church into four different factions, Paul wrote, rebuking them: "Each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ....Are you not men of flesh?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1 Cor 1:12; 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Had these people formed four different groups, they would have been sects, not churches, for Corinth was a city, and that is the smallest unit which warrants the forming of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church of God in Corinth could not cover a lesser area than the whole city, nor could it comprise a lesser number of Christians than all the Christians who lived there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is Paul's definition of the church in Corinth "to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints" 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To form a church in an area smaller than a unit-locality is to form it on a smaller basis than a scriptural unit, and it follows that it cannot be a scriptural church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Any group of believers less than all the believers in a place is not qualified to be a separate church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The unit of the church must correspond with the unit of the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A church must cover the same area as the locality in which it is found.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a church is smaller than a locality, then it is not a scriptural church; it is a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To say, "I am of Paul," or "I am of Cephas," is obviously sectarian; but to say, "I am of Christ," is sectarian too, though less obviously so.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The confession, "I am of Christ," is good as a confession, but it is not an adequate basis for forming a separate church, since it excludes some of the children of God in a given locality by including only a certain section who say, "I am of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That every believer belongs to Christ is a fact, whether that fact be declared or not; and to differentiate between those who proclaim it and those who do not, is condemned by God as carnal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the fact that matters, not the declaration of it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The sphere of a church in any place does not merely include those in that place who say, "I am of Christ," but all in that place who are of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It extends over the entire area of the locality, and includes the entire number of the Christians in the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To take one's stand as belonging to Christ alone is perfectly right, but to divide between Christians who take that stand and Christians who do not, is altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To brand as sectarian those who say, "I am of Paul," or "I am of Cephas," and feel spiritually superior as we separate ourselves from them and have fellowship only with those who say, "I am of Christ," makes us guilty of the very sin we condemn in others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we make non-sectarianism the basis of our fellowship, then we are dividing the church on a ground other than the one ordained of God, and thereby we form another sect.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The scriptural ground for a church is a locality and not non-sectarianism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Any fellowship that is not as wide as the locality is sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All Christians who live in the same place as I do, are in the same church as I am, and I dare exclude none.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I acknowledge as my brother, and as a fellow member of my church, every child of God who lives in my locality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There were a great number of believers in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We read of a multitude who turned to the Lord; yet they are all referred to as the church in Jerusalem, not the churches in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jerusalem was a single place; therefore, it could only be counted as a single unit for the founding of a single church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You cannot divide the church unless you can divide the place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there is only one locality, there can only be one church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Corinth there was only the church in Corinth; in Hankow there is only the church in Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not read of the churches in Jerusalem, or the churches in Ephesus, or the churches in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Each of these was counted as only one place; therefore, it was permissible to have only one church in each.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as Jerusalem, Ephesus, and Corinth remain unit-localities, just so long do they remain unit-churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a locality is indivisible, then the church formed in that locality is indivisible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>NOT WIDER THAN A LOCALITY</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have just seen that the boundary of a church cannot be narrower than the locality to which it belongs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the other hand, its boundary cannot be wider than the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the Word of God we never read of the church in Macedonia, or the church in Galatia, or the church in Judea, or the church in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because Macedonia and Galilee are provinces, and Judea and Galatia are districts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A province is not a scriptural unit of locality; neither is a district.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Both include a number of units; therefore, they include a number of separate churches and do not constitute one church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A provincial church or a district church is not according to Scripture, since it does not divide on the ground of locality, but combines a number of localities.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is because all scriptural churches are local churches that there is no mention of state churches, provincial churches, or district churches in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"Then had the churches rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria" Acts 9:31, KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Holy Spirit did not speak here of the church, but of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because there were a number of localities, there were also a number of churches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was not God's plan to unite the churches of different places into one church, but to have a separate church in each place.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There were as many churches as there were places.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"He passed through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches" Acts 15:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Again the reference is not to one single church, because Syria and Cilicia were vast districts, each comprising a number of different places.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is permissible in political circles to unite many different places into a district and call it Syria or Cilicia, but God does not unite the believers in a number of different places and call them the church in Syria, or the church in Cilicia.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There may be unions or mergers in the commercial or political world, but God sanctions no combinations among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Each separate place must have a separate church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"All the churches of the Gentiles" Rom 16:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The churches of God were not formed on national lines but on local lines; therefore, there is no mention of the church of the Gentiles, but of the churches of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"The churches of Asia greet you" 1 Cor 16:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"The churches of Macedonia" 2 Cor 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"The churches of Galatia" Gal 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"I was still unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which are in Christ" Gal 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Asia, Macedonia, Galatia, and Judea were all areas comprising more than one locality-unit; therefore, the Word of God refers to the churches in these areas.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A church according to the divine thought is always a church in one locality; any other kind of church is a product of the human mind.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God sanctions no division of the church within any one locality, and He sanctions no denominational combination of the churches in a number of localities.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In Scripture there is always one church in one place, never several churches in one place, nor one church in several places.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God does not recognize any fellowship of His children on a basis narrower, or wider, than that of a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Nanking is a city, and so is Soochow.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because each is a separate unit, each therefore has a separate church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The two places are both in the same country, and even in the same province, but because they are two separate cities, they must form two separate churches.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Politically Glasgow and Nanking do not belong to the same province, or even the same country; yet the relationship between Nanking and Soochow is exactly the same as between Nanking and Glasgow.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Nanking and Soochow are as truly separate units as Nanking and Glasgow are.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the division of churches the question of country or province does not arise; it is all a question of cities.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Two cities of the same country, or the same province, have no closer relationship than two cities of different countries or different provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God's intention is that a church in any one locality should be a unit, and in their relationship one to the other the different churches must preserve their local character.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When God's people throughout the earth really see the local character of the churches, then they will appreciate their oneness in Christ as never before.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The churches of God are local, intensely local.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If any factor enters in to destroy their local character, then they cease to be scriptural churches.</S>
