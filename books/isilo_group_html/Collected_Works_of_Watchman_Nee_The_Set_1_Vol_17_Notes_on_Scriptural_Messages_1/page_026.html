There is one thing among us which I feel is not good. The modernists speak much with their mouths concerning service, but they do not serve. This obviously is not good. But for us, we have neglected too much the matter of doing good and helping others. This is most pitiful. We should seek for opportunities to do good to others. Two years ago there was an unusual article in the news in the United States. A man had gone to work in some place. After he finished his work, he took a train home. When he was not far away from his home, he made a long distance telephone call to his wife, which cost him thirteen dollars and sixty-five cents. When his wife answered the call, she thought that he was in danger. However, he said only, "I still love you." His wife marveled that he would spend so much money to say these few words. When he reached home, his wife asked him concerning this. He replied, "I was afraid that I might die on the way and not reach home. So I called first to tell you those words."</P><P>There was a woman who suffered from tuberculosis and was about to die. Her husband was there and the doctor told him that his wife was dying. The husband then spoke to his wife, "If you die, I do not know what I will do because I really love you." His wife replied, "Everything would have been fine if you had told me this earlier." She said this because his conduct toward her before had caused her to doubt his love and had depressed her to the point that she had fallen sick.</P><P>Mr. Panton said, "Take the opportunity today to speak a little word of kindness, a word of praise, and a word of appreciation."</P><P>There was a very famous literary person in England. His relationship with his wife had been cold for many years. One day, his wife died. When he arrived home he spoke to the dead body, "I wish you had lived for another five minutes so that I could have had the opportunity to tell you that even though our relationship was so distant these many years, my heart has never left you."</P><P>If we do not take the opportunity to love others today and to do good to them, we will regret it one day. May we learn to forgive others today, and may we learn to love others and to speak a kind word to them today.</P><P>Third, we have to help other people with our money. A rich man said, "Whenever there is money it should be given away." Do not think that your money can be saved for some better use in the future, and that you will give more money when there is a better use. Actually, the "good use" of the present time is better than the "better use" of the future. Many people want to save fifty or a hundred dollars and take it out when there is a real need. But I must tell you that you may not be able to take it out on that day. Why not give the ten, twenty, or thirty cents to the beggar today? Perhaps when the real need comes, it will already be too late.</P><P>What does it say in the Gospel of Luke concerning the deeds of the unfaithful steward? He took advantage of his position while he was still the steward to speak to the man that owed his master a hundred measures of oil, "Take your bill and sit down quickly and write fifty" (16:6). And to the one who owed his master one hundred measures of wheat he said, "Take your bill and write eighty" (v. 7). He did not wait until he was out of his stewardship to do all this. To wait until he was no longer the steward would have been too late. Through this incident, the Lord taught the disciples to seize the opportunity to gain friends, that is, friends in eternity. Brothers and sisters, this is what we should learn today. Take the opportunity today to use the three or five dollars you still possess for the work of the Lord, for the poor believers, and for the poor. In the streets we meet poor people; in the meetings we come across poor believers. If we have the ability, we should take the opportunity to do good to them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. NOT LEAVING THE OPPORTUNITY</H2><P>The above speaks of taking the opportunity. There is also another aspect, which is what Romans 13:14 says: "Make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts," and what Ephesians 4:27 says, "Neither give place to the devil." Not only do we have to seize the opportunity, but we have to avoid giving opportunity. Not only do we have to take the opportunity to love God and man, but we should not give any opportunity to the flesh or the devil.</P><P>The cause of the sin of the first man was due to his speaking a word incorrectly. If we do not wish to give any opportunity to the flesh or to the devil, there is only one way, which is to say "no." If we say "no" the right way, everything will be well, but if we say it the wrong way, we will fail. For example, if a young man was invited out to carouse with others, and his first word was "no," everything would be fine. I have a younger brother whose friends often invited him to play. I told him that he did not have to involve himself with whatever was wrong. He only muttered something without saying yes or no. If you can say "no" as the first word, the second word will be easy, and the third will be even easier. If you dare not say "no" on the first hand, your heart is shaken already. Initially, your conscience may not agree; but in the end you may not even care for your conscience anymore. If you do not resist the first time, you will fail the second and third time. Many people overcome because they will say "no" the first time. These people will not be sought after by others because the others know that they will refuse anyway. Many brothers and sisters fail because they will not say "no" at the beginning. Therefore they are wearing what they should not wear, eating what they should not eat, doing what they should not do, and going where they should not go.</P><P>Two weeks ago I read a magazine in which an old man wrote an article which said that if a young man does not know how to say "no," he should go to the wilderness and repeatedly say "no" until his tongue obeys him and is able to say "no." Of course, when we say "no," we should be polite, courteous, and respectful.</P><P>In the Bible there was a man who certainly knew how to say "no." That was John the Baptist. When the Jews sent some to ask him whether or not he was the Christ, he replied, "No." Because of such a clear word, a great deal of trouble was avoided. If he had replied a little ambiguously, he would have been able to gain a little glory. But he preferred to lower his status by saying "no," saving himself a great deal of trouble. Eve failed because she spoke one word after another. I know a number of brothers and sisters who fell because they could not say the first word, "no." In the end, it was too late even when they wanted to say "no."</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 17: Notes on Scriptural Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
