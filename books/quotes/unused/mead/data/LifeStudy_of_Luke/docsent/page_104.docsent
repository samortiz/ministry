   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE THE MINISTRY OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS HUMAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH HIS DIVINE ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FROM GALILEE TO JERUSALEM 13 Scripture Reading: Luke 15:1-32</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that in answering the self-righteous Pharisees and scribes, who condemned the Savior for eating with sinners 15:1-2 , the Lord spoke three parables unveiling how the Divine Trinity works to bring sinners back, through the Son by the Spirit to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 15:4-7 the Son as the Shepherd goes into the wilderness to seek the lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 15:8-10 we have the Spirit as the woman lighting a lamp, sweeping the house, and seeking carefully for a lost silver coin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The house in verse 8 refers to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit comes into us as the house to enlighten us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Finally, in 15:11-32, the Father receives the returned prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE FATHER S HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the parable of the loving father, the father must have been outside the door of his dwelling when he saw his son approaching v. 20 . The father saw his son even while he was still a long way off.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This would not have been possible if the father had been in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the father must have been outside the door looking for the son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, the father with the son came back into the father s dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Luke 15:25 refers to the father s house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is signified by the father s house here?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christians may interpret the father s house as signifying a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to this interpretation, when a sinner repents and comes back to God, one day God will receive him into a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This understanding of the father s house is not logical.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not logical to say that we have come back to the Father and He has received us and yet we are still not in His house.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Where, then, are we?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Luke indicates in this parable that the prodigal son was received into the house immediately after he returned, and in the house there was a place to prepare food and a place to dine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be sure, the father s house in the parable does not refer to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If this house signifies heaven, then where are we who have been saved and who have been received by the Father, since we are not yet in heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, the father s house here should signify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In chapter ten the church is signified by the inn.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now in chapter fifteen the church is the father s house.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This understanding is logical and scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the parable of the loving father there is no time gap between the coming back of the prodigal son and the father s receiving him into his house.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The son s coming back is continued immediately by the father s receiving him into the house.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, in these three parables the Son came into the wilderness, the Spirit came into our being, and the Father receives us into His house.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>HOW THE SHEPHERD CAME TO SEEK US</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the wilderness into which the Son as the Shepherd came seeking the lost sheep?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The wilderness signifies the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the sight of God the world is a wilderness, a wild, desolate place where it is easy to get lost.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Son came in the wilderness to seek us, the lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we need to ask in what way the Son as the Shepherd came to seek us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In contrast to the Spirit signified by the woman with the lamp, the Son does not seek us by enlightening us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His way to seek us out is to die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In John 10:11 the Lord Jesus says that He is the good Shepherd who gives His life for the sheep: I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The work of the Shepherd is to die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If He did not die for us, He would not have a way to seek us out.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His way of seeking us is to die for us.</S>
