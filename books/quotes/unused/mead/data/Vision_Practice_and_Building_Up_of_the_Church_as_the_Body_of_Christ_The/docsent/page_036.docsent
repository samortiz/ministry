   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Gossiping but Speaking in the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Minister Grace and Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have the oneness of the Spirit, and we have the renewing in the spirit of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we must also have our speaking in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must learn to speak, to communicate, with the saints in the spirit, under the control of the spirit, and under the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we have the peace and joy, we should continue to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Otherwise, we should stop.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ephesians 4:29 continues, That it may give grace to those who hear.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our word, our speech, can minister death and damage, or it can minister grace and life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The extent to which we minister grace is the extent to which the church is built up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we minister death by our speaking, the building up of the church will be damaged, but if we minister grace and life through our word, it will be a great help for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Word in Greek here is logos, implying not only a short speech but a longer one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to be careful about our longer speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever the enemy does damage to the building up of the church, he likes to use long speakings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is temptation within us in the self-nature, the flesh, to listen to long speakings on negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sometimes the more negative something is, the more we like to hear it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This kind of logos is not a short word but a lecture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The enemy likes to give a longer word, even for two or three hours, and we may have the inner desire to listen to it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some even do not grow tired or hungry when they listen to this kind of word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are so willing to listen, to hear, and to know more.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever this happens, we must realize that this is the tearing down by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Someone may come and say, Do you know what happened recently between two brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Right away our ears may be attentive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If our wife were to call us to breakfast, we may tell the brother, Forget about breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Tell me what happened.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is a desire within us to know these things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the other hand, someone may read Revelation 21 in the morning and tell us that the New Jerusalem is wonderful, but we may not be impressed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When our wife calls us to breakfast, we may say, Let s go eat, but we may have no appetite to hear about the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have a great appetite for gossip, especially gossip about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we gossip about other things, people may not pay much attention, but whenever we gossip about the church, every ear is attentive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I learned this through many confirming experiences in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This causes much damage and tearing down.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I say again, we are not complaining against any persons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, we hate the enemy, and we hate to see how he utilizes the careless mouths to tear down the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only does this kind of speaking tear down, but it also spoils the materials for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We cannot use pieces of broken glass to make a cup.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once the material is broken, it is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may not realize that some material has already been damaged by us, and it may never be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The building has been damaged, and some material has been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why the apostle Paul spoke such a word in both his Epistles to the Ephesians and to the Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must be careful with our speech, with our logos.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our speech must be good to meet the need of the occasion for the building up of the church by ministering grace to the hearers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This also is a matter in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We find the spirit again in 5:18-21.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These verses say, Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord, giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father, being subject to one another in the fear of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to the grammar of this sentence, being filled in spirit is related to speaking, giving thanks, and being subject to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Being Subject to One Another</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>by Being Filled in Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verses 22 through 24 continue, Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord; for a husband is head of the wife as also Christ is Head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is by being filled in spirit that we can submit one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we are in spirit, we are willing to be subject to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the self no one submits to others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Submission is in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to the context of these verses, if we do not speak, sing, and thank the Lord, we will never be subject to others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to be happy in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Otherwise, we will only be rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This passage mentions four things: being filled in spirit; speaking with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; giving thanks to the Lord; and being subject to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Without being filled in spirit through praising and giving thanks, no one can be subject to others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only when we are happy can we be subject.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When a sister is angry, she will not and cannot submit to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A husband knows not to expect submission when his wife is angry.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If he is wise, he will check to see whether or not she is happy and wait until her mouth is full of thanks and praises.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then she will submit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Submission comes from being filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we are filled in spirit, we are full of praise and thanks to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>At this time we are able and willing to submit to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the church there is the real need of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A building must be vertical, not flat and horizontal.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If I say that I do not want to be under you, and you say that neither do you want to be under me, then we are flat, and there can be no building.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In order to build up something vertically, there must be submission.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I must be under you, you must be under someone else, and he must be under yet another person.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the proper submission.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some may ask, Why must I be under that person?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>To ask this is to produce a question mark, which is the form of a serpent when it rises up.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Question marks in the church life are the sign of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is a real damage; it is poisonous.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the church life there is the practical need of subjection.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When we are subject to one another, we are able to be built up.</S>
