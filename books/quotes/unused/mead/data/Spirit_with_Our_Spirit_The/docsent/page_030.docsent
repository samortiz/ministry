   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. The Essential Spirit and the Economical Spirit of the Processed Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The essential Spirit of God is the Spirit of life breathed into the believers as the divine essence of the divine life Rom 8:2; John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The economical Spirit of God, the Spirit of power, was poured out upon the believers as the divine essence of the divine power Acts 1:8; 2:2, 4, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The consummated Spirit has these two aspects: the inward, essential aspect and the outward, economical aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the day of resurrection, the Lord breathed the essential Spirit as life into His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then after fifty days, on the day of Pentecost, He poured out the economical Spirit of power upon the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The essential Spirit is for our life and living inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The economical Spirit is for our ministry and work outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be economical means to be for God's economy, for God's work, to carry out His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus also experienced the Spirit in these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was born of the Spirit, filled up with the Spirit, and constituted with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when He became thirty years of age to come out to do the work for God to carry out God's economy, the Holy Spirit came upon Him in the form of a dove Matt 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was the economical aspect of the Spirit for Christ to carry out God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>G. The Consummation</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>of the Processed Triune God 1.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit and the Bride</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Speaking Together as the Universal Couple</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ultimately, the Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the consummation of the Triune God after His ascension, that is, after He had been fully processed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a Spirit speaks together with the bride as the universal couple Rev 22:17a .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Processed and Consummated Triune God Married to His Redeemed, Regenerated,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>and Transformed Tripartite People</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The conclusion of the entire sixty-six books of the Bible reveals that the processed and consummated Triune God marries the redeemed, regenerated, and transformed tripartite people for His final manifestation and ultimate expression in glory for eternity Rev 21:1 22:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may wonder what the difference is between manifestation and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Something that is concealed can be manifested, uncovered, or disclosed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God was concealed as a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when Jesus came, He was God's manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then this manifestation has an issue, and the issue is to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Triune God will have the New Jerusalem as His corporate manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then through that manifestation He will be expressed corporately for eternity.</S>
