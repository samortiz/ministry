<p>The truth is that Christ was smitten and cleft on the cross once for all. There is no need for Him to be smitten again. We need to realize the accomplished fact that Christ was smitten on the cross two thousand years ago. Instead of smiting Him again, we just need to speak to Him. When we speak to Him, He will give us the living water. Hymn #248 (see Hymns) is very good in this point:	<ol class="decimal">	<li>Fainting in the desert,<br>	Israel’s thousands stand<br>	At the rock of Kadesh.<br>	Hark! the Lord’s command,<br>	Speak to the Rock,<br>	Bid the waters flow,<br>	Strike not its bosom<br>	Opened long ago,<br>	Speak to the Rock,<br>	Till the waters flow.<br><br>	Chorus:<br>	Speak to the Rock,<br>	Bid the waters flow,<br>	Doubt not the Spirit,<br>	Given long ago;<br>	Take what He waiteth,<br>	Freely to bestow,<br>	Drink till its fulness<br>	All Thy being know.<br><br></li>	<li>Blessed Rock of Ages,<br>	Thou art open still;<br>	Thy blest Holy Spirit<br>	All our being fill;<br>	Still Thou dost say,<br>	Wherefore struggle so?<br>	Call for the Spirit,<br>	Whisper soft and low,<br>	Speak to the Rock<br>	Bid the waters flow.<br><br></li>		<li>Oh, for trust more simple,<br>	Fully to believe;<br>	Oh, for hearts more childlike,<br>	Freely to receive;<br>	E’en as a babe,<br>	On its mother’s breast,<br>	So on Thy bosom<br>	Let my spirit rest,<br>	Filled with Thy life,<br>	With Thy blessing blest.</li>	</ol><p>The more you sing this hymn, the more you will fall in love with it. Christ has already been crucified and riven for us. We do not need to smite Him, but we need to call on Him, to speak to Him, to bid Him to give us the living water.
