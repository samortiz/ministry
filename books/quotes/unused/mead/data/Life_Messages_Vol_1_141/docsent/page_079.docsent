   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY WALK IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving" Col 2:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Have you received Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If so, how did you receive Him?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You opened to Him, repented and confessed your sins, and asked Him to come in. He came into your spirit 2 Tim 4:22 , not into your heart, though you may have sung that well-known chorus, "Into My Heart." From your spirit, the center of your being, Christ is spreading into the surrounding parts mind, emotion, will, and conscience which make up your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this cause Paul prayed "That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith" Eph 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is like a guest invited into your home.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When He first comes, He stays in the living room your spirit .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After some time you may invite Him into the bedroom, the inner chamber your heart , and ask Him to make Himself at home.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Have you invited the Lord Jesus into the inner chamber of your heart yet?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Christ has spread into all the inward parts around our spirit, He will then have made His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We shall consider how to walk in Him after answering some questions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I feel as if I am living two lives, one at work and the other outside of my job.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the moment I walk into the office I am so busy that I seem to miss the Lord every day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How can I lay hold of Him in the midst of all that I have to do?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the Devil's subtlety to take some fact of our living to deceive us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His way is to tell a lie by speaking the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What he says is apparently true, but his intention is to lie to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, you should declare to him and to the whole universe that you will walk by one life, not by two.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second, every day the first thing you should do is to take five, ten, or fifteen minutes to worship the Lord and to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Tell Him, "Lord, here is another day for me to live You.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Be with me; sustain and strengthen me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hold me in Your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even though I neglect You every day, You never forget me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have no trust in my faithfulness; I put my trust solely in You."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even during the day, whenever you have time, pray the same way: "Lord, be with me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I cannot make it to live You out on my own, but You can live Yourself out of me."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Don't wonder how things will work out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We as Christians have too many considerations, stemming from our background and environment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Deny these considerations; they are just frustrations and distractions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Don't believe them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We believe only in the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our trust is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We don't make preparations and schedules as to what we should do to overcome some situation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have no expectations and no plan, only the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All day, starting from first thing in the morning, contact Him, asking Him to sustain you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just see what happens.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Don't worry about tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Don't be preoccupied in the meeting, thinking how wonderful the message is but what will you do when you get to the office tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Just live today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Don't borrow tomorrow; you don't have it!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every day is today; tomorrow never comes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Devil would have us worry about tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As you hear a message, just rejoice and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is so simple, so real, and so living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you ask, What about the next hour?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I say there is no next hour.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every hour to us is the present one.</S>
