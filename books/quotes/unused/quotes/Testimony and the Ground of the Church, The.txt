The church has a content and function in reality, and it also has an outward appearance and ground in practicality
The building up of the church by the Lord, or we may say, the church that is being built up by the Lord, is related to two matters
On the one hand, there are the gates of Hades, and on the other hand, there are the keys of the kingdom of the heavens
These verses show that the church has been brought into existence according to the eternal purpose that God made in Christ
Ephesians 3:21 says, 'To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever
Timothy 3:15-16 says, 'The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth
All these verses show the importance of the church before God, which is the subject we want to cover in this conference
Over the past thirty years, whenever we brought up the matter of the church, we faced some difficulties for several reasons
God's great purpose in establishing and building up the church is to deal with His enemy, Satan, through the church
Those who understand the Bible know that without the church, God cannot eliminate Satan because He will not deal with Satan directly
Whenever we discuss the matter of the church, we also sense Satan's efforts to make trouble, disturb, undermine, and attack
A good number of devout believers think that they need only to be spiritual, holy, and victorious over sin, the world, and the flesh
They think that it is better to avoid talking about the church, because it is too complex, too high, too broad, and too involved
He does not just want millions of living stones; He wants to build the living stones into a spiritual house, which is the church
At the end of the Bible we do not see individuals in the presence of God; we see the New Jerusalem built up and manifested
They see only a little about being spiritual, holy, and victorious; they do not see the crucial matter-the church
We need to see that this substitutes what is good for what is best it substitutes a halfway station for the final destination
Due to Satan's blinding, Christians consider the work and the procedure as the ultimate goal, neglecting the matter of the church
It is not the work, evangelism, spiritual endeavors, or Bible study that matters, but the building up of the church
Spirituality, holiness, and victory are not the goal; they are the procedure for reaching the goal, which is the building up of the church
How good it would be if we could lead sinners to be saved, and how glorious it would be if we could help believers grow
Every Epistle was written either to a certain church or to a certain individual for a certain church or churches
Concerning the church many brothers and sisters also refer to another problem saying It is true that the church is higher than everything
If this is God's desire, then we should pay attention to it and deal with it even though it is extremely difficult
Our eyes must be opened to see this one fact: The work that God is doing in this age is to build up the church
Ephesians 1 shows us that God subjected all things under the feet of the Lord, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church
If it were not for the church and if there were no need for the church, then the Lord would not need to be Head over all things
The Lord is Head over all things in order to gain the church as His Body, His corporate vessel, to express His fullness
We often think that the Lord gave Himself up for us as individuals, because we usually consider only individuals, not the church
It seems that we often care more about perfecting our own spirituality than about caring for and preserving the church
Only the church can accomplish Gods purpose meet Gods need deal with Gods enemy and express God Himself thereby satisfying Gods desire
My question is this Is the result of our work individualistic independent or is it from the Body from coordination
There are very few who really see the church, have the consciousness of the church, and are in the coordination of the church
In this book we will look at the inward reality of the church and its outward match, that is, the inward testimony and the outward ground
Although God is invisible, when we observe the phenomena in the universe, we can see proof of God's existence everywhere
In the beginning of the Bible we see only God's speaking: 'He spoke, and it was; / He commanded, and it stood'
God's expression, however, can be seen at the end of Revelation because He has gained a vessel to express Himself
From eternity to eternity the desire of God is to express Himself so that He as the hidden God may be completely expressed through a vessel
Since Christ is the firstborn Son of God, then there must be more sons than just the Son; there must be other sons
Originally, it was a grain of wheat, which was the only begotten Son, but it becomes many grains, that is, many sons
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
The Chinese refer to a person who does not honor his father as being 'non-alike,' that is, a person who is not like his father
A man honors his father by being like his father; only a man who is like his father can be considered a dutiful son
The Son is the image of the Father ; this is true not only with the only begotten Son but also with the many sons
Originally, His Son was the only begotten Son, but now His Son is identified with many sons, a corporate body composed of sons
Whenever we read the story of Adam, we must remember that his story reveals God's desire to be expressed through him
God also wanted man to be fruitful and multiply to fill all the earth; in this way the image of God, His photograph, would fill the earth
Although man did not have the life and nature of God, he still expressed God and manifested the story of God in part
Symbolically, when God put Adam in front of the tree of life, He wanted Adam to eat Him as food, that is, to receive Him as life
He would not only have been like God outwardly, in outward form; he would also have been like God inwardly, in content, in nature
God wanted Adam to receive Him so that he could be like God both outwardly and inwardly in order to express Him
Their condition and manner enabled others to know God more and understand God more, that is, to see God to a certain extent
The Chinese language uses four words to describe the events in the course of a human life: birth, age, disease, and death
It only says that someone lived for a number of years, begot children, and died, because they all lived a life without God
At this time Enoch who lived by God walked with God and needed God moment by moment did not live a life in this selfmade godless culture
He preached to the people, in effect, saying, 'God is righteous, and He will surely judge wickedness and destroy this world
Everything has been prepared and accomplished by God the Father, everything is inherited, and everything is of grace
Jacob's characteristic reveals that the self-struggling and natural ability of a person who belongs to God are against God
The ultimate goal of God in all those who belong to Him is to make every one of us a person who is filled with God to be His expression
If we look at every article every item of these laws ordinances rituals and regulations according to the letter they are merely the letter
It is not hard to understand that the laws and ordinances that God gave to the Israelites expressed God to them
When the tabernacle was raised up at the end of Exodus, a cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of God filled the tabernacle
In addition to the tabernacle, there also was the Ark, which denotes Christ, and the altar, which denotes the cross
Some of them expressed God to such an extent that even when people saw them, they perceived that they were 'men of God'
All you need to do is look at Christ, because the story of God, that is, everything concerning God, is hidden in Christ
Then Christ came He was so compassionate that even lepers could approach and touch Him and even a sinning woman could avoid His condemnation
The records concerning Christ, the footsteps in His life, including His words, deeds, and manners, are all expressions of God
In order to know the content of God and to touch the fullness of the Godhead, we need to know Christ and gain Christ
As the only begotten Son, the life of God the Father is given to Him alone, and all that God is can be found in Him
When He was transfigured, He entered into God's glory; in other words, God was glorified and shined out of Him
When He was on the Mount of Transfiguration, His appearance was briefly changed, and God was glorified and shined out from within Him
The glory of God, which had been concealed within Him, was released, shined out, and manifested through His death and resurrection
When He was resurrected, He dispensed the life of God within Him into thousands and millions of those who believe into Him
In addition to saying that Christ is the mystery of God, the Bible also says that the church is the mystery of Christ
Whereas Christ is the only begotten Son of God, the church is the many sons of God as the enlargement of Christ
For two thousand years people have talked and preached concerning Christ everywhere but no one has seen Christ for nearly two thousand years
The church is the mystery of Christ and the expression of Christ, just as Christ is the mystery of God and the expression of God
Corinthians 14 says that whenever we meet together and people come among us, they can declare, 'Indeed God is among you'
Sometimes we see someone's shadow or see someone walking at a distance, but by his manner, we know who is coming
On the one hand, the church is the Body to Christ, and on the other hand, the church is the dwelling place to God
Both as the Body of Christ and as the house of God, the church is the place in which Christ and God can rest and find expression
When all of God's sons enter into God's glory and are completely transformed, God will gain a complete and full expression
At that time, God will be completely in Christ, and Christ will be completely in the New Jerusalem, that is, in the church
Revelation 21 says that God will be the light shining in the New Jerusalem while Christ will be the lamp of the light
The church has been produced because the only begotten Son of God, who expressed God, has been enlarged to become the many sons of God
Previously, the Son of God was God's only begotten Son, but now the only begotten Son has become a corporate son
Previously, the expression of God could be seen only in Christ, but now the expression of God has become a corporate expression
The Lord meant that we should outwardly testify of the things that the Spirit has inwardly revealed to us concerning Him
We need to understand that this witnessing is carried out not only by preaching Christ in words but even more by people living out Christ
The saved ones should live out Christ, not as individuals but as a corporate entity-the Body, which is the church
Even if no humans were serving in this manner, there would be some things or some words that would testify of Him
Since these people and things expressed God to a lesser or greater degree, they were part of the testimony of God
God told Moses to put the law into the Ark, but the Hebrew word used in these verses is actually the word for testimony
Since the law is the testimony, the two tablets on which the law was written were called 'the tablets of the testimony'
The law is a testimony of God because the law reveals the attributes of God and explains the kind of God He is
When we read the law, the Ten Commandments, we see that the God who enacted the law is so holy, full of light, loving, and righteous
When we look at a law, we can know the kind of person who enacted it, because a law always shows the character of the law-giver
God is absolutely true and honest; for this reason, He commands man to not testify with false testimony, that is, to not lie
On one hand, these laws declare what kind of God He is, and on the other hand, they require man to conduct himself according to what God is
Since these laws are the explanation of God, they are a testimony of God; since they place requirements on man, they are the law to man
Indeed, man has absolutely no power to keep the law of God; only God Himself can keep the law and fulfill the law
Some may ask why God would give such requirements if it is impossible for man to meet the requirements of the law
He wants to be received into us, and by contacting and touching Him, we allow Him to fulfill His requirements within us and through us
If man could fulfill the requirements of God, man would have no need to trust in God and no need to receive the Lord as Savior
When God comes into man and becomes the power of life within man and which passes through man, He meets the requirements of His law
Romans 8:4 speaks of the Spirit of life fulfilling the righteous requirement of the law in those who walk according to the spirit
If a person touches God Himself, if he touches God's being, then he is able to spontaneously fulfill the requirements of the law of God
If a man wants to keep the ordinances of the law merely because of the requirements of the law, his efforts will be in vain
It was easy for them to keep the law because they touched the reality, the substance, of the law, which is God Himself
Others, however, did not live in God's presence, and, in New Testament terminology, they were not in fellowship with God
When a person comes to read the Bible, he needs to contact God to be able to touch the reality and the substance of the Bible
If we do not read the Bible while touching God and being in God, the Bible will be merely dead letters or vain doctrines
These words tell us that God and man are completely united and have become one; therefore, they reveal the mystery in the universe
When we read the Bible, we need to touch God, meet God, and live in God; only then can we touch the reality and the substance of the Bible
We have often said that some read the Bible and find only dead teachings, such as being humble, patient, meek, and peaceful
As a result, we see that such teachings are simply dead letters and vain doctrines which are completely useless
When we contact God in the Scriptures, the reality of humility will be worked into us and the power of being meek will operate in us
The Scriptures are living and real because God Himself is the reality of the Scriptures; the Scriptures testify of God
If there is sugar in water, we will taste the sweetness of sugar when our tongue touches the sugar in the water
Often when we touch the Holy Spirit within through fellowship or prayer, we spontaneously say, 'Jesus is Lord!
Once we are in the Holy Spirit, we touch Christ, because the Holy Spirit is the transfiguration of Christ and the testimony of Christ
When the Holy Spirit brought Christ into the believers and constituted them as the church, the church became the testimony of Jesus
Corinthians 12:12 and Ephesians 4:12-13 show us that the church is the Body of Christ, the embodiment of Christ
Due to the union of Satan with the first Adam Satan brought in sin death the world idols and the authority of Satan which is Satans kingdom
When the first Adam was cut off from God and united with Satan, he also was united with the items that belong to Satan
In the first Adam there was Satan, sin, death, the world, idols, and the authority of Satan, which is Satan's kingdom
At that time, mankind was filled with Satan and the things of Satan; God and the things of God had no place within fallen human beings
Satan even placed the kingdoms of the world and their glory before Him, trying to entice Him to worship him, but He refused
The early church was a complete and full testimony of Christ, manifesting Christ before the people and completely living out Christ
John 15:26-27 shows us that the church carries out the testimony concerning Christ by and with the Holy Spirit
At the time of Pentecost, even though three thousand and later five thousand were added to the church, they were still one
Through the testimony of the church, His Body, Christ is expressed before men, lives before men, and testifies to men concerning Himself
When we live in the Lord, there will be a situation of oneness among us; this oneness is Christ and it is also God
The production, existence, relationship, and issue of the testimony of the church are shown in Matthew 16:13 through 17:8
Although many persons typify the church in the Old Testament, there was no mention of the church in plain words
It was not until the Lord Jesus came in the flesh and worked on earth for nearly three years that He revealed the church in plain words
They answered that people spoke differently concerning Him, some saying that He was this person and others saying that He was that person
Peter, who was the disciple who usually rushed to speak, answered and said, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God'
From the dawn of history many spiritual forefathers and prophets have spoken for God, yet none of them ever spoke such words
These two statements that Peter uttered are so extraordinary because they reveal the person and the work of the Lord Jesus
Redemption was accomplished by Christ under God's commission; salvation is also carried out by Christ according to God's desire
The statement 'You are the Christ' means that 'You are the One anointed by God to do all the work God intends to do'
No doubt, He was the One commissioned by God to carry out God's work, but who was He as the One commissioned by God?
As the Son of God, He received a commission from God to fulfill His will and carry out His work in the universe
One aspect concerns His work, and the other aspect concerns His person; one aspect shows what He does, and the other aspect shows who He is
The One who is the expression of God is the One who was anointed and commissioned by God to accomplish His work
Before the birth of the Lord Jesus, an angel told Mary, 'The holy thing which is born will be called the Son of God'
When Peter spoke to the Lord in this way, the Lord immediately said to him, 'You are Peter,' because Peter means 'a stone'
In contrast, those who were against God, whether at Babel, Egypt, or elsewhere, always built with bricks, never with stones
According to the spiritual meaning in the Bible, bricks signify anything produced from man's natural being and with man's labor
Stones, however, signify things that have not been produced from human labor with human hands but from God's labor with God's hands
To this day, bricks are man-made, made by human labor; they are produced with natural materials plus human labor
When we received the Lord, knowing Him as the Christ and the Son of God, we were redeemed and received His life
You and I, as small stones transformed from clay, are the materials for Christ to build the church upon Himself as the large rock
Are they in Christ, do they live in Christ, and do they grow up into Christ in everything in their daily life?
Are the brothers and sisters willing to let the cross do a work of terminating the desires of the flesh, their old creation, and their self?
He is not only the foundation of the life of the church; He is also the base of the living, the testimony, of the church
Whenever the heavens are mentioned, we are reminded of God, and whenever Hades is mentioned, we are reminded of the devil, Satan
When a criminal is arrested and brought to the gate of the prison, an iron gate is opened to receive the criminal
Similarly, the gates of Hades are for bringing the church into death and for shutting and holding the church in death
From the day the church came into being, the gates of Hades have been dealing with the church through various stratagems and in many ways
These gates, however, began to actively try to drag the Lord's church into death, to shut it in death, and to hold it in death
When the Lord Jesus was crucified, the sign put on the cross was written in three languages-Hebrew, Latin, and Greek
The presence of these three languages signifies that the Lord Jesus was crucified by the Jews, the Romans, and the Greeks
After the Lord Jesus began to build the church these three groupsthe Jews the Romans and the Greeksjoined together to deal with the church
After the Lord Jesus was put in the tomb, people thought they had accomplished their job, yet He came out of the tomb in three days
Throughout the generations people have tried to put the church in death and hold it there, and seemingly some succeeded
When Satan was not able to defeat the church through the persecution of the Roman Empire, he changed his tactics to welcome the church
Some asked if it would be best to serve the Lord full time, and others asked if it would be preferable to serve the Lord while holding a job
If we serve without holding a job, the gates of Hades are waiting; if we serve while holding a job, the gates are also waiting
We need to be careful as well with this because a number of gates have also been prepared to deal with the married
Dear brothers and sisters, if we do not have the power of resurrection within us, the gates of Hades will press us until we have no way out
While there may be only one gate holding us prior to marriage, there may be three or four gates trying to hold us after we are married
When we served the Lord alone, we felt lonely and hoped that the Lord would give us one or two co-workers for coordination
Oh, dear brothers and sisters, there is no place without a gate of Hades, and there is nothing that is not a gate of Hades
Two centuries ago he not only brought a revival to the churches in England but also a great turn to the English society
Satan tries his best to destroy the testimony of the church, to damage the testimony borne by the church for Christ
It may seem as if the church has fought many losing battles throughout the centuries, but the church is still here
Since the church is built upon the resurrected and victorious Christ, it cannot be defeated by the gates of Hades
For two thousand years, countless sinners who have been held by the gates of Hades have been released by the church
Preaching the gospel frees sinners who have been captured by Hades and liberates the souls who are oppressed by Satan
The testimony of the church is related not only to the gates of Hades but even more to the keys of the kingdom of the heavens
On the one hand, the church affects the gates of Hades, and on the other hand, it is related to the kingdom of the heavens
When the Lord spoke of the building of the church, He immediately revealed the cross, telling us to take up, to receive, the cross
The work of the cross has been accomplished; now we need to acknowledge it, receive it, bear it, and put it upon us
Knowing this is one thing, but experiencing the cross by truly putting ourselves under it and bearing it is another thing
Only the cross can enable the things of the old creation to be terminated so that we can live out the riches of the resurrection of Christ
Verse 27 of chapter 16 and the first section of chapter 17 refer to the Lord Jesus' transfiguration on the mountain
In other words, Christ will be able to reign and to manifest God's glory so that God will have a full expression in Him
Just as Hades is versus the kingdom of the heavens, the gates of Hades are versus the keys of the kingdom of the heavens
These three pairs are revealed along with the building of the church; hence, they are related to the building of the church
The matter of the keys of the kingdom of the heavens dealing with the gates of Hades depends on the building of the church
If the building of the church is successful, the will of men will be nullified, and the will of God will be fulfilled
All of these matters are related to the building of the church; they all hinge on the church being built by the Lord
If our eyes are opened, we will see that the building of the church is an exceedingly great matter in the universe
On one side, the will of men is ruling and reigning; on the other side, the will of God is gaining ground and being fulfilled
As the Son of God, He died, resurrected, ascended to the right hand of God, and was made Lord and Christ by God
Hades, however, actively attacked the church in order to drag the church that was being built by Christ into death
They do not see that on the day of Pentecost there was not only the preaching of the gospel but also the fighting of a spiritual warfare
At the coming of Pentecost, living stones were produced, and they were built on the rock which is in the heavens
The church was full of the authority of the kingdom of the heavens, and it was able to overcome the attacks of Hades
It seems as if there is no opposition from Satan and no spiritual battle in the church in such a pitiful condition
In the entire record of the book of Acts, wherever a church was raised up, Satan was there to oppose, but he was also shaken
It involves Hades and the kingdom of the heavens, Satan and God, Satan and the cross, and the will of men and the will of God
The entire New Testament concerns the church, the building of the church, and matters related to the building of the church
His charge to preach the gospel is for the building, and His instructions to edify the believers are also for the building
It is a pity that today many of those who fervently serve the Lord are not building up the church; instead, they are tearing it down
As saved ones, we all admit that once we were clay but that we have become stones because of the Lord's salvation
If our service is like this, it cannot shake the gates of Hades, and we should not expect such messages to be effective and powerful
We, thus, will have no way to open the gates of the heavenly kingdom and usher people into the kingdom of the heavens to be under its ruling
Consequently, we will have no way to release others from the gates of Hades, much less lead them to be under the ruling of the heavens
If he cannot hold someone back, he will push him forward; if he cannot cause someone to fall short, he will cause him to reach beyond
The degree of our being built determines the measure of the nature, testimony, and element of the church in us
Without building, there is no testimony of the church; without the testimony of the church, there is no ground of the church
Whoever receives grace and mercy will bow his head and say, 'Lord, have mercy on me, and have mercy also on my brothers and sisters
We must see to such an extent that we need others in every step of our actions and in every aspect of our living
They also feel that it is troublesome to have the church life because the brothers are annoying and the sisters are burdensome
A person who has been dealt with, who truly knows the testimony of the church, can no longer be individualistic and secluded
If we really know the church, we will see that the church is a built-up entity, not merely something put together
According to biblical revelation, the nature of the testimony of the church consists of at least six important items
The nature of the testimony of the church is of revelation; it is not natural nor idealistic nor of human thought
God wants the believers to be broken, dealt with, and built up so that they become coordinated as one Body to be one church, one testimony
Whatever comes out of death will be in resurrection, and only what is in resurrection can be built and be in coordination
Ephesians 2:15 shows us that the nature of the testimony of the church is of the new creation, not of the old creation
In the testimony of the church there is nothing of the old creation of Adam; there are only the things of the new creation of Christ
The church is constituted with the Holy Spirit in the spirit of the believers; thus, there is no element of the flesh
Whenever the church becomes earthly and has an earthly condition the nature of the church is changed and the testimony of the church is lost
Since the nature of the church is eternal, whatever is of the church cannot be altered, removed, or wiped out; it remains forever
The testimony of the church is the content of the church, and the ground of the church is the outward appearance of the church
Either we pay too much attention to its inward aspect, its content, or we pay too much attention to its outward aspect, its appearance
If the children of God could properly deal with the ground of the church, there would be almost no problems related to the church
We want to look at the matter of the ground of the church during this conference in the hope that we can help God's children on this point
Since the source of the church is one and the nature of the church is one, the ground of the church must be one
Half a century ago the church which is uniquely one already had more than fifteen hundred grounds; today we believe that there are even more
There is no need to look at another time or another place; simply look at where we are at the present time and the present place
If we carefully read the Bible, we will see that the church is described as being one whenever it is mentioned
Strictly speaking, the oneness of the church does not depend upon the church being united but on the church being one
The Spirit in millions of us who are saved is the one Spirit, not simply the same kind of Spirit but the same one Spirit
There may be some newly saved brothers and sisters who doubt this, saying, 'How could the Spirit in so many of us be only one?
To say that the Spirit is the same may be easy, but to say that the Spirit is one is really hard to understand
Those who understand electricity know that the electricity in all the lamps is only one; it is not only the same kind but the same one
It is the same with the Spirit's entering into the saved ones, whether in ancient times or modern times, in China or elsewhere
In the example we gave earlier, one brother met another brother, and the two had not previously known each other
When the one who asked the question hears this, his face will not only turn cold but also stiff, and he may say, 'Oh, this is too much!
When they met, because the Spirit leaped within them, leaping in this one and in the other as well, they responded to each other
Instead of caring for the leaping and the responding of the Spirit within them, they soon can only argue with one another
When the other hears about being quiet, he feels deadened, thinking that the Spirit is not present in this kind of quietness
Their mind, their thought, has overcome their spirit, and as a result, the two no longer want to see each other
They dislike praying together, because one cannot pray when the other is shaking, and one is impatient when the other is waiting quietly
Even considering all of these things, God has put the Spirit of God, once for all, into the depths of the being of every saved one
Our soullife preferences emotions thoughts opinions views ideas and judgments have overcome the Spirit and suppressed the oneness in us
In actuality, the oneness is still present because this oneness, which is the Spirit Himself, can never be lost
If we disregard our thoughts and care only for our spirit and the response in our spirit, then there will be a situation of oneness among us
In Ephesians 4:3 the apostle not only speaks of the oneness of the Spirit, but he goes on to speak of seven 'ones' in verses 4 through 6
If we carefully study these seven 'ones,' we can see that they are divided into one group of four and another group of three
In the Bible the number seven is sometimes divided into six and one, but mainly it is divided into four and three
Four of the seven ones of the church are mainly on the side of God, and the other three are mainly on the side of man
God put all of Himself into the Son, and the Son came to be our Lord that we may believe in Him and receive Him
At the beginning of Acts this Spirit has entered into thousands of people so that the Triune God is within them
The Triune God and the church, which has been saved by grace, are completely joined together and completely one
As those who have been saved by grace, those who are the church, we may have different opinions, yet we share the same hope
The quiet one, however, may ask the shaking one, 'Brother, even though you shake and shake, where will you be in the end'?
On the other hand, the shaking one may ask the quiet one, 'Brother, you are quiet all the time, but where will you be in the end'?
A brother expressed it really well when he said, 'Our future is the same, so our journey today must also be the same'
Throughout the generations, Christians in various denominations have had many differences in doctrines, yet they have one and the same hope
If someone is different in the matter of the one hope, he must not be saved nor a member of the church nor a brother of ours
The other brother may say, 'I do not believe that it is necessary to be immersed; sprinkling with water is sufficient'
One may say I believe in the rapture before the great tribulation and another may say I believe in the rapture after the great tribulation
The one faith is not related to beliefs that are according to our opinions or views; it is the faith, the belief, that brings in salvation
One is not saved to a greater degree by believing in head covering, nor is one saved to a lesser degree by not believing in head covering
We need to remember that beliefs related to views and opinions concerning the truth are not the same as beliefs related to the faith
Views and opinions concerning the truth are views and opinions and should not be counted as items of the faith
We receive Him when we say, for example, 'Amen, You are the Son of God, the Savior appointed by God, and the Lord of all set up by God
Another may not believe in a pre-tribulation rapture or even in a post-tribulation rapture, but he still has faith
After 1935, sometimes when we would meet, there was a certain kind of atmosphere and everyone would spontaneously pray at the same time'
Concerning outward practices, one may be in favor of praying one by one and another favors everyone praying at the same time
In baptism we confess that all we are and all we have are accursed and that all that we deserve is condemnation and death
The Quakers, who spiritualize things even more, do not want anything outward, so they only receive a spiritual baptism
The children of God have serious disputes concerning the matter of baptism, and as a consequence, we have been divided
In reverse order, they are one God, one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body, and then one faith, one baptism, and one hope
The Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Spirit, and the Spirit comes into us, causing us to believe and to be baptized
Through one faith and one baptism we have received one God, one Lord, and one Spirit so that we are one Body with one hope
If we do, there will be no divisions; instead, we will have the oneness of the church and the ground of the church
In the New Testament there are many portions which emphatically speak of the church being one, which cannot and should not be divided
For two thousand years, Satan has continually used man's flesh in relation to the church to oppose God and to act contrary to God
God says that the church cannot be divided, yet Satan is determined to divide the church through the flesh of men
Not only is there an Eastern Orthodox Greek Church and a Western Roman Catholic Church, there are also Protestant churches
We have already indicated that according to statistics in 1914 there were more than fifteen hundred sects among Protestant churches
In this district there is a Baptist Church there is a Presbyterian Church and not far away there is a Lutheran Church and a Methodist Church
We know that the church is the Body of Christ and the dwelling place of God; it has a particular function before God
If a body is cut up, it is finished; if a dwelling place or a house is taken apart, it is also completely useless
Wherever there is division, there is no blessing of God; wherever there is division, there is no presence of God
Conversely, wherever there is oneness, there is the blessing of God; wherever there is oneness, there is the presence of God
We acknowledge that they are children of God, our brothers in the Lord, members of the Body of Christ, and constituents of the church
The Bible anticipated and spoke of this long ago; it predicted different ways that people would divide the church
Some of the Corinthian believers who were for Paul said, 'We are of Paul; we were saved through Paul's gospel preaching'
Paul truly helped people to be saved, Apollos surely was good in expounding the Scriptures, and Cephas was really the leading apostle
In the church only Christ is the Head, all the glory should go to Him, and all the people should belong to Him
You are an ungrateful person; you are a person who drinks the water but forgets its source; you are a person who forgets his origin'
Neither the instrumentality of salvation nor the instrumentality of edification can be the basis of where or to whom we belong
All those who come to work in Taipei, after saving and edifying some people, should pass them to the church in Taipei
Peter, that is, Cephas, worked in Corinth and gained fruit; afterward, he gave the fruit of his labor to the church in Corinth
Those in Corinth gave their fruit to the church in Corinth, and those in Ephesus gave their fruit to the church in Ephesus
The third way of dividing the church is to consider oneself as being of Christ in order to separate from others
In the church in Corinth there was another group of people who said It is wrong for you to be of Paul to be of Apollos or to be of Cephas
The fact that we belong to Christ is right but if we use this fact to label ourselves and separate ourselves from others we are of the flesh
We must be very clear concerning this one thing: We should not consider mere doctrinal views as the fundamental Christian faith
If we lack this, we do not have the Spirit in us and, therefore, are not a part of the Body but are outside of the Body
After they removed their sandals, John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus went down into the river and stood in the shallow part
Both are sincere believers of the Bible both quote the Bible and both have the common faith but on the matter of baptism there is no oneness
Those who believe in the Sabbath Day fully believe in the Bible, and those who believe in the Lord's Day believe even more in the Bible
Both groups of people believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God and that Jesus Christ is the Son of God
If this commandment can be annulled, then dishonoring our father and mother would be acceptable, and stealing would not be a sin
In the church there are people with all sorts of strange thoughts; furthermore, they all base their thoughts on the Bible
If someone wore leather shoes and had enough hair to be parted in the middle, they would push him out of the door
If a sister was not dressed in this way, she would be accused of loving the world and would be forbidden from coming into their midst
In northern China there once was a group of believers who were very zealous, who loved the Lord very much, and who were very much blessed
Sometimes one of the swaying ones would go to a place that had quiet meetings, and he would leave after sitting for less than five minutes
Because of insignificant matters such as swaying and being quiet these groups of brothers cannot be one even though they have the one faith
People use doctrines or opinions to form sects; that is, they divide from others because of different practices based on a certain doctrine
According to the Bible, even such matters as eating only vegetables and observing days must not be used as a basis for dividing the church
Countless numbers of peculiar people have been saved throughout the ages, and they are all our brothers and sisters
Some of the preachers stand straight-even perfectly straight-when they preach, without moving their body at all
When we see a man with wellmannered preaching we may praise him highly thinking that this kind of behavior is befitting to a servant of God
If we see someone leaping and jumping while preaching, we might say that he is crazy and does not look like a servant of God
Those who prefer action may approve of him, saying that this kind of preaching can stir up people and touch their feelings
Many of the divisions of the church exist only because of different views that the believers have concerning the truth
Corinthians 1:10-13 and Titus 3:10 show that to be sectarian, to be divisive, is absolutely condemned by the Bible
Even if we feel that it is proper to be baptized by immersion and to be quiet, we should bear with those who are for sprinkling and swaying
There is an accurate understanding of the truth regarding baptism, regarding the Lord's Day, and even regarding all other matters
While they were accurate and serious in teaching, they were tolerant and broad in attitude and practice, not requiring uniformity
In 1 Corinthians 12:13 the apostle says, 'For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks
Over twenty years ago in Shanghai there was a 'church of the rickshaw pullers,' a 'church' for those who pulled rickshaws
Those who ride the rickshaws and those who pull the rickshaws are brothers alike; hence, it is wrong to be divided because of social rank
Rather, the Lord called for overcomers in the churches who would supply and help others so that the churches would be revived
God's children have been divided, and while we do not bear the responsibility for this, we must ask, Is there a divisive situation among us?
With the oneness of the church, we should let go of all our differences; we should not let any difference be a reason for division
The fellowship of the church is a great matter in the Bible and something that we hear people speak of frequently
We can temporarily use a term related to electricity to illustrate this matter and make its meaning more understandable
Whenever we allow the Lord to operate in us, we will definitely want to fellowship with the brothers and sisters
It is not that there is no fellowship but only that the fellowship has stopped, since we are not letting the Lord flow
Since the fellowship of the church is based upon the life in the Christians, it is based also upon the reality of the oneness in us
In this one Body there is one Spirit, in this one Spirit there is one Lord, and in this one Lord there is one God
You recently had a united meeting, but now that it is over, everyone is returning to his own church, just as divided as before
The fellowship of the church spoken of in the Bible is a fellowship in oneness with no divisions; it is only one
The Bible says that the church is absolutely one, that it cannot be divided, and that it does not need to be reunited
In addition, the fellowship of the church is not a fellowship of being independent but still having mutual contact
A pastor may be invited to preach in a church service, and in turn, another pastor may be invited to lead a conference
According to the Bible, the church can be compared to a large family system in China that is absolutely not divisible
No matter how many generations are living together, regardless of how they quarrel and contend, they cannot separate
Although there is much contention and much division, outwardly they appear polite and still maintain contact with one another
The fellowship of the church is absolutely in oneness with no division; it is one without having the need of being united
The Lord's Word tells us that the church is one, that it cannot be divided, and that there is no reason for division
We cannot deal with the situation in a perfunctory manner by applying merely a limited amount of mutual contact as an outward gesture
Our fellowship must include all those who belong to Christ and who have the life of Christ throughout the ages and in every place
According to the Bible, every local church in its respective locality is a representative of the entire Body of Christ
In the beginning we said that the fellowship of the church is the flow of the Lord's life in all the Christians
When the saints walk according to the Holy Spirit and live in the Holy Spirit, spontaneously there is fellowship
If we are willing to deal with our flesh and our self, then we will spontaneously live in the fellowship of the church
The Bible tells us that some saints should not remain in the fellowship of the church and must be removed from this fellowship
They sin to such an extent that they are filthy and put the Lord's name to shame, like the case spoken of in 1 Corinthians 5
The sin spoken of in 1 Corinthian 5 is the first condition for a saint to be removed from the fellowship of the church
Another category of people who should be removed from the fellowship of the church includes those who go beyond the teaching of Christ
The two conditions above are the only ones for which a person should be removed from the fellowship of the church
Only these two categories can cause a person to lose the fellowship of the church and be removed by the church
These persons committed very serious mistakes, but the apostle did not say that they should be removed from the church
We must endeavor to forebear to the uttermost, not removing someone quickly for a little mistake or for being a little different
Since we have looked at the oneness of the church and the fellowship of the church, we now need to look at the ground of the church
There is only one church in the universe, but in time and in space it is manifested in locality after locality
Even in places such as Jerusalem and Corinth, where the cities were large and the believers many , the church was still one
In one locality there should be only one church and there should be only one fellowship of the church and one ground of the church
If the fellowship of Christians in a certain locality is independent and of a local nature, it is a local sect
Only in this way is it truly the fellowship of the church, and only this kind of fellowship of the church is the ground of the church
Although this fellowship is expressed in a locality, it is universal in nature; it is one locally and one universally as well
Speaking simply, the ground of the church is the manifestation of the church's universal oneness in a locality
If we want to have a thorough knowledge concerning the ground of the church, we also must have a clear understanding of the matter of sects
In the Son and the Spirit, He entered into these chosen ones and regenerated them to make them His Body for His expression in the universe
God's eternal purpose is to gain a church in the universe, represented by the New Jerusalem, as a corporate vessel to express Himself
Although a local church is small in size, it is exactly the same as the universal church in nature and principle
Every church was like this, whether it was the church in Jerusalem, the church in Antioch, or a church in another place
Every local church was a miniature representing the universal church, expressing Christ and God, in that place and at that time
If any stone still cannot be used, the craftsman will knock off some more here and there so that it can be built to become part of the house
The only church in Jerusalem was 'the church which was in Jerusalem,' which is spoken of in Acts 8:1 in the singular
Every church in a locality is a representation of the Body of Christ in that locality which expresses Christ in that locality
The remaining students, perhaps only a small number, meet at the gymnasium according to the school's regulation
Every proper student, every obedient student, every student who follows the rule, must assemble at the gymnasium
On one hand the elderly ones were happy that a young man was rising up to serve the Lord and they could not say that it was not a good thing
Do not be the Baptist Church do not be the Presbyterian Church do not be the Chinese Christian Church and do not remain in any denomination
Even though you say that we are divided from the others, we must investigate: Who should really bear the responsibility of this division'?
Since you took different groups of people and formed separate, unbreakable organizations, where should the young people go?
In recent years people have often questioned us, asking, 'Why do you say that only you are the church, but others are not'?
We must discern what ground is the ground of division and what ground is the ground of oneness what ground is right and what ground is wrong
If we have a clear discernment, we should forsake any ground that is wrong and return to the one ground, the right ground
If we love the Lord with a pure heart we will be delivered from being on the wrong ground and freed from the responsibility for any division
Originally, there was only one church, the unique church, so that the moment a person was saved, he was in this church
Before our eyes, there is the Catholic Church, and there are also different Protestant sects and denominations
On one hand, it is impossible for us not to be a Christian, and as a Christian, we need to be in the church and cannot be alone
Anyone who fears God and seeks the Lord with a pure heart knows that these attitudes are wrong and these intentions are a mistake
According to the Scriptures, the mistake of dividing the church is identified as being 'sectarian' or 'factious'
There is one Body with one Spirit, one Lord, and one God; furthermore, there is one faith, one baptism, and one hope
According to the truth and the facts six possible conditions constitute a sect any one of these conditions will constitute a group as a sect
Some are named by their system of administration, such as the Presbyterian Church and the Congregational Church
We are also baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus and into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
When Paul asked the Corinthians why they said they were of him, he asked, 'Were you baptized into the name of Paul'?
The words of the Lord show clearly that the oneness of the church is in the Father's name, which was given to the Lord
Having any one of these names constitutes a condition of being a sect, and any group of Christians in such a condition makes itself a sect
We have been saved and become a part of the church because of the 'one faith,' the fundamental faith, spoken of in Ephesians 4:5
Special articles of belief absolutely must not be brought in, because once they are brought in, they will cause believers to be divided
If we make any of these beliefs a condition for the fellowship of the believers, it will become a special belief that divides the believers
Everyone who is saved and has the life of Christ is in the church; therefore, they can take part in the fellowship of the church
Those who are members of their congregation could take part, and those who were not members could not take part
If a person wants to join the Seventh-day Adventists, he must acknowledge the Sabbath day; otherwise, they will say, 'We cannot receive you
Otherwise, they may acknowledge that you are a Christian, but they will not recognize you as a member of the Baptist Church
They are sects even if they have only one of these three conditions; they do not need to have all of these three special things
Based on these three special things, it is very easy to see, beyond any doubt, that the denominations in today's Christianity are sects
They say, 'We have no special name, no special beliefs, and no special fellowship, so you cannot say that we are a sect
We do not care about the believers in other places, nor do we have fellowship with the churches in other places'
Although they have no special name and no special belief, they are isolated and have no fellowship with the churches in other localities
They seem to be nondenominational, but their administration is separate from other nondenominational groups in the same locality
On the surface, a congregation may appear to have no special name, no special belief, and no special fellowship
Even though it may not hang out a signboard, it may belong to a certain denomination far away in a foreign land
Since any one of these items causes the Body of Christ to be divided, any one of them causes believers to become a sect
These numerous sects cause the large circle of the church to have many small circles within it, and they divide the church
Every group that is both in the large circle and a small circle is a sect because this causes the church to be divided
Suppose some missionaries of the Presbyterian Church come and preach the gospel in Taipei, and some people are saved
The Presbyterian missionaries will not only impart salvation to them but also put them into a small circle-'the Presbyterian Church'
These saved ones also belong to the church in Taipei, and it should be sufficient that they are within the circle of the church in Taipei
Let us not add the name of Presbyterian to them; it is sufficient that they are in the circle of the church in Taipei'
These brothers also see that those who are saved in Taipei belong to the church in Taipei and should not belong to the Holiness Church
Originally, it was sufficient simply to have a one-layer association, a one-layer circle; it was enough to belong to the church
In this way, when another layer of 'church' is added, a small circle is formed, division occurs immediately, and a sect is produced
When the other person heard this, because he thought that the brother was joking, he said, 'How could there be such a church?
The other believer however was in the church and also in a denomination and therefore he was in two layers of association this is not right
Dear brothers and sisters, herein lies the difficulty we have encountered among the children of God throughout all these years
It would be best if all the sects and denominations could get rid of their own congregation; this would make the matter much easier
Dear brothers and sisters, we should be clear by looking at this picture of the large circle and the small circles
God's children must clearly see that, as Christians, we can only be in one place-the church; we cannot be in the denominations, in the sects
Christians should be only in one circle, not in two circles; they should have a one-layer association, not a two-layer association
You should thank God and the brothers from the Presbyterian Church for bringing you the gospel, the Savior, and the Bible
They brought something extra, that is, they also brought different denominations and sects, which we cannot accept
We must respectfully say that on the one hand we are grateful to them but on the other hand we should rid ourselves of the improper things
We should never think that we are simply one more group of Christians meeting together among many existing Christian groups
Perhaps because you feel that this place is better, more spiritual, and more edifying, you come here to join us
Once there is division, regardless of the reason-even the best, most spiritual, most honorable reason-it is still a sect
In many portions in the Bible when the church is spoken of it is singular in number referring to the single unique church the one church
If we read the Bible carefully, we would see that in the universe there is only one church, which is the Body of Christ
In its manifestation in the time and space of the universe, there is one church in each locality, and therefore there are many churches
Some examples include the church in Jerusalem , the church in Antioch , the church in Corinth , and the church in Ephesus
We need to see that in the universe the church is uniquely one; there are not two churches, much less many churches
A city is a unit of people's gathering and living together, and the church manifested in such a city should also be a single unit
The church is composed of people who live in communities, who gather and live together in locality after locality in separate units
In Taipei sometimes people point and say, 'That is the church on North Chungshan Road,' or 'That is the church on East Hoping Road'
A street is not qualified to be a unit for establishing a church, just as it is not qualified to be a unit for setting up an administration
Only a locality, whether it is a town or a city, can serve as a unit of administration, as a unit for the church
He first raised up the church in Jerusalem and then He raised up a church in many other cities including Antioch Ephesus Corinth and Rome
In Ephesus, we cannot see two or more lampstands; we can see only one lampstand because there was only one church in Ephesus
Among the seven cities of the province of Asia, for example, each city had a church, so there were seven churches, seven lampstands
In every city, in every locality, there was only one church; in every city, in every locality, there was only one lampstand
The universal aspect is with respect to the church in its entirety, and the local aspect is with respect to the church in its manifestation
Since there is only one church in the universe there should also be only one manifestation and representation of the church in each locality
Now we will look briefly at the mutual relations between these two aspects of the church-the universal church and the local church
If we add up all the local churches of the past and the present, local and abroad, this would equal the universal church
God's desire is that every local church would represent the Body of Christ to testify on behalf of Christ in their respective localities
The church in Jerusalem the church in Antioch the church in Corinth and the church in any other locality are part of the universal church
Just as the nature of the entire universal church is of God, the nature of the local church in every locality is also of God
The situation of the universal church is the situation of the local church because the local church is a miniature of the universal church
The universal church is the Body of Christ for the expression of Christ and the dwelling place of God for the expression of God
If the same house is occupied by some Europeans, it will have certain European features and a distinct European flavor after a few months
It is the same with the church as the Body of Christ and the dwelling place of God in the universe and also in every locality
Every local church is the Body of Christ for expressing Christ, and it is also the dwelling place of God for expressing God
The local church is the universal church in practicality because the local church is the reality of the universal church
The Lord wants to build the church in the universe upon Himself as the rock, but His building is done through the local church
If the Lord did not build the local church, He would have no place to start His building of the universal church
We must consider this: if there is no building of the local church, how can there be the building of the universal church?
We need to believe that since there is a church to which we can go and tell our problems, then it must be the church in a locality
Matters related to administration and government or matters related to edification or leading must all be done locally
If there are only two or three believers in a locality they are qualified to be a local church as long as they are meeting in the Lords name
Even though the Lord said that two or three may be gathered into His name , this does not mean that such a gathering is the church
In the church no one can separate himself from other brothers and sisters simply because of differences in opinion, desire, and views
In any given locality there would be only one church, only one fellowship, instead of many sects and denominations
Look at the apostles in the early church: they all worked in local churches, and their work was all for the local church
As saved ones we all have the same one life and this life requires us to be together to be a corporate body and to not be individualistic
If we do not serve in coordination in the local church, we cannot serve in coordination in the universal church
Suppose the church in Taipei says, 'We have no relationship with the church in Tainan, so we do not fellowship with them'
Suppose the church in Tainan says, 'We do not like the church in Taichung; neither do we like the church in Taipei
The churches all over the earth constitute the one Body of Christ; therefore, their fellowship should be one and the same
The churches in all localities should live directly before the Lord, and each is responsible directly to Christ, the Head
Otherwise, the organization on top becomes the head of the church underneath it, thus usurping the headship of Christ
They were seven independent lampstands, independent churches, each living before the Lord who was walking in their midst
Nor would the elders need to pray or seek the will of the Lord; they could simply seek advice from the head church
Having a head church is presumptuous, overstepping, with regard to Christ, the Head; it is very offensive to the Lord
The local church is the unique church; there is no higher-level church, and there is also no lower-level church
When a lower church must obey a higher church, there is no more room for Christ, and there is no authority of the Holy Spirit
Ephesus was Ephesus, and Smyrna was Smyrna; each one was responsible directly to Him, and He dealt with each one directly
The large church in Taipei and the small church in Panchiao are on exactly equal standing; neither is higher nor lower than the other
The church in Panchiao cannot control the church in Taipei; neither can the church in Taipei control the church in Panchiao
If we feel that something is of the Lord and it is the Lord's leading, we may receive the help from the church in another locality
Although the administration of the church is independent the nature of the church is still one and the fellowship of the church is also one
Although the churches should not form an organizational union, they should be the same in fellowship, in nature, and in principle
Just as he charged the church in one locality to make offerings on the Lord's Day, he charged all the churches in the same way
The churches must not have a federation or a head church, but the churches should be the same in their actions
Because the nature, the principle, and the fellowship of the church are all one, the churches must be the same in their actions
At the same time, each local church is one and in fellowship with the churches in all the localities that maintain such a testimony
Before we look at the degradation and the recovery of the church, we need to consider the original condition of the church
As long as they are saved and spiritual, it is good enough for them, and it seems unnecessary to be concerned regarding the church
There are also some who think that the matter of the church can never be made clear because it is too troublesome and too complicated
Brothers and sisters, if we know the word of God, we can clearly see that the goal of God is to obtain the church
God's desire is to gain a church in each locality in this age so that He may express Himself through the church
Our feeling may be that it is sufficient to be saved and spiritual, but God's feeling is related to the church
After we are saved and become Christians, we are confronted with the matter of the church, and we must deal with it properly
We need a strong desire and a willingness to make an effort; we also need a pure and simple heart and a sober and careful mind
We looked at God's desire concerning the church, specifically how God desires the church to be the Body of Christ as a vessel to express Him
Now we need to look at the original condition of the church and then look at the degradation and recovery of the church
All the believers are brothers on the same level; there are no distinctions involving some who are higher and some who are lower
The term elder emphasizes that the elders are saints who are more mature spiritually; it is not a title of a particular rank in the church
To do so is altogether related to the human concept of class distinctions, and it should never be brought into the church
If a person is saved but has no function in the church, surely he must be a degraded Christian, a brother who is in trouble
Similarly, the smallest brothers and sisters in the church, even those who are newly saved, also have a useful portion
In the Old Testament, among the people of Israel there was a group who served as priests, and the rest of the Israelites were common people
It is abnormal if only a small number of the people of God serve as priests, but the majority are merely common people
The Bible shows that originally everyone could offer to God without a need for others to serve as a priest for him
As a rule, everyone who received God's grace was a priest before Him, and they could all approach God directly and serve God directly
They began to have priests after they failed because of worshipping the golden calf at the foot of Mount Sinai
When the children of Israel wanted to offer sacrifices, they could not do it themselves; they needed to find a priest to do it for them
When they wanted to inquire of God, they could not do it themselves; instead, they needed to ask the priests to do it on their behalf
Among the children of Israel, there were two separate groups of people: a class of priests and a class of common people
They allowed the Holy Scriptures of God to have their position, and they also allowed the Holy Spirit of God to have His position
It was not like the situation today, for example, where in Taipei alone, there are countless groups of Christians
If we are in Jerusalem, we need to be in the church in that city since there is only one church in Jerusalem; we cannot be separated from it
After Paul went to Corinth and many were saved through his gospel preaching, he established the church in Corinth, not 'the church of Paul'
No matter who went to Corinth and regardless of what labor they did, they all gave the fruit of their work to the church in Corinth
There are too many churches there is a church on a street a church in an alley a church in a house and a church in a school dormitory
Today the church is divided, and the 'churches' are so numerous that it is hard to tell which is the real church
Chang Hsiao-chuan was a seller of scissors, and the scissors of Hangchow were very famous, especially scissors made by Chang Hsiao-chuan
There was no need for the early church to designate itself as such-and-such 'church,' much less designate itself as 'the true church'
Originally, the local church was the highest, and it was also the lowest; the local church was the greatest, and it was also the least
The church is the Body of Christ, and Christ is the Head of the church , reigning in the church through the Holy Spirit
They honored Christ as the Head and obeyed the authority of the Holy Spirit; this was the supreme characteristic of the original church
At the same time, they were separated from the world, they forsook idols, and they allowed God to speak in their midst
As a result, they spontaneously allowed Christ to be the Head and allowed the Holy Spirit to exercise His authority
Regrettably this kind of situation did not last long after a short time the church gradually became degraded and lost its original condition
Elder denotes the person, and overseer denotes the service; these two terms are two designations for the same person
From that time on in Christianity, the saints who were designated by these two terms were divided into two classes
In the fourth century when the Church of Rome was formed there were various distinctions in rank such as bishops archbishops and cardinals
Those who belong to such a class are responsible exclusively for the service of God, and the rest of the believers are fully excused from it
Both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Nestorians have an intermediary class with bishops, archbishops, and patriarchs
Believers were no longer brothers on equal standing, nor were they members; even more, they were not serving together as priests of God
The church became degraded, the service in the church was crippled, and the members of the Body of Christ became useless
As a result, the church was brought into a union with the Roman Empire and thereby became completely of the world
The Eastern Orthodox Church also kept its union with the world and did not break away from the power of the world
At the time of the apostles, the church was like a boat on the sea, and the sea water could not get into the boat
In its degradation, the church was filled with all kinds of idols; this can be seen in the Roman Catholic Church
Someone told us that the most beautiful, most attractive, and most expensive idols are in the Roman Catholic Church
At a certain time the people below the pulpit joined the priest in chanting, and they were all bowing down to the image in front
Often they carry the statue of Mary in a procession, and many of those who are in high positions compete to carry the statue
The Eastern Orthodox Church and the Nestorians also took the words of the patriarch of their respective churches as the highest authority
At this point God had no way to express His mind in the church; instead, the church became a place where man's ideas were expressed
In the fifth century the Roman Church because of the power struggle was divided into the western Roman Church and the eastern Greek Church
The use of the name Catholic Church did not start with the Church of Rome; it was used by Cyprian much earlier
Up to the present day, Roman Catholic churches throughout the world continue to be unified under the pope in the Vatican at Rome
At this point, the church was divided, and the ground of the church and the principle of one city with only one church was damaged
At this point, all of the characteristics of the church have become completely degraded; none of its original characteristics are left
At that time the desolation of the church was limited to its inward content; it remained more or less the same in its principle and ground
In the fifteenth century there were some people in the church who rose up to recover and to correct the situation
Before Martin Luther, there were some who were quite enlightened and who rose up to speak for God in protest to degraded Christianity
In the first part of the sixteenth century, Martin Luther, who was still a monk in the Roman Catholic Church, was raised up by God
From that time to the present, a period of almost four hundred years, Christianity has been divided into two great branches on the earth
One great branch is the Roman Catholic Church with the Greek Orthodox Church and a remainder of the sect of Nestorians
Although the Reformation rescued the church out of the Church of Rome, it did not rescue the church out of politics
He was clear concerning this, and he told people that the church's fall into politics was a matter not according to the Scriptures
He also said that he did not have a way to reform this matter at that time and wished that others would rise up to do it at a later time
In many instances the opinions of their leaders and the resolutions of their councils are more authoritative than the teachings of the Bible
Later, Protestants produced the so-called private churches, such as the Baptist Church, the Presbyterian Church, and the Wesleyan Church
The Protestant church is still mixed with the world, similar to a boat being in the water and water also being in the boat
The deformed church brought the priestly system, the intermediary class, of the Old Testament into the church in the New Testament
We are all too familiar with the term pastor; we know that a pastor is one who specifically handles spiritual affairs
The intermediary class as an element of degradation was not removed from the Protestant churches; it only changed in appearance a little
As a result, the Protestant church presently is divided into approximately two thousand denominations and sects
The Protestant church did not have a recovery in this respect; instead, it caused an even worse degradation of the church
The lowest level is the local congregation, the highest level is the general headquarters, and in the middle are regional centers
All of these forms of organization rob the Holy Spirit of His authority and usurp the headship of Christ in the church
In the Protestant state churches, either the head of the nation or the highest bishop is considered as the highest authority
The Bible, Christ, and the Holy Spirit are all neglected; all decisions are made according to the decisions of councils
After another two hundred years, in the early part of the eighteenth century, God had a further recovery with the Moravian brethren
The Moravian brethren originally lived in Moravia, but they suffered persecution because of their love for the Lord with a pure heart
Thank the Lord, when these Moravian brethren were raised up, distinctions in rank in the church were eliminated
They scorned rank and forsook organization; instead, they stressed the fellowship and coordination among themselves as brothers
Zinzendorf a leading one among them once said that if he gave up fellowship with the brethren he would not know where to find the church
At that time, at least four different groups were meeting together: Moravian brethren, Baptists, Presbyterians, and Calvinists
In such a situation, the Moravian brethren allowed Christ to be the Head and allowed the Holy Spirit to rule among them
Although the recovery with the Moravian brethren was quite strong, God did not stop there; instead, He continued to take the way of recovery
Approximately a hundred years after this great recovery, God had another strong recovery with the so-called Brethren
Readers of the Bible who have the light all acknowledge that this recovery was the fulfillment of the Lords prophecy concerning Philadelphia
When the Brethren were raised up, they were truly a 'Philadelphia'; a situation of brotherly love was recovered and manifested among them
Other truths were discovered by the Brethren, including the truths concerning the second coming of the Lord Jesus and the church
At that time, many among them were persons with titles of nobility, and they respectfully returned the titles to the royal family
It was not until the time of the Brethren that the hierarchy in the church was truly and thoroughly eliminated
When people first went into their midst, it seems as if they could not hear anything else; they only heard 'brother'
Based on this particular characteristic, outsiders called them the 'Brethren,' since they did not have a special name
After he finished, a brother from England stood up and corrected him, saying, 'We are not brothers of England but brothers from England'
If we read their history and letters, we must say that Christ was truly their Head and the Holy Spirit was truly their authority
In the first twenty or thirty years after the Brethren began in 1828, they had the original condition of the church
Around 1850, after they had met for approximately twenty years, some problems arose among them which led to their failure
The group that was in favor of receiving such Christians was more lenient and later became known as the open Brethren
At the same time, they also had many differences in their opinions and practices concerning meeting and service
In response, they said that those with different opinions were preaching 'evil doctrines' and should not remain in the group
In actuality, they did fight; it only looked as if they did not fight because they would leave and set up another assembly
They questioned everything in Christianity including the system the organization the various names the articles of faith and the practices
They read through the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, specifically to study the matter of denominations and sects
As a result, they saw that denominations were not found in the Bible and that sects were condemned by the Bible
Being designated by any name or exalting any name other than the name of the Lord is not according to the Bible
Surprisingly, they held their first Lord's table at a cemetery in a desolate place outside of the city of Tsinan
The church in Foochow also started when a group of young students saw that denominations were wrong and would not go back to them
They wanted to have a new beginning, to have a pure meeting not according to Western traditions but simply according to the Bible
They also read from the Bible that it was not acceptable to ask for donations and that the proper way was to rely on God, to believe in God
They kept praying until a young brother took off his jacket and secretly offered it to a responsible brother to be sold to pay for the rent
They took the Bible as the yardstick to carefully measure every matter including matters such as how to serve God and how to live their life
It did not matter to them what anyone said concerning a particular matter; they wanted to know what the Bible said
In order to be scriptural, the brothers began to ask concerning the kind of lights that should be installed in the meeting hall
They also discussed whether baptism should be in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit or in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
Our desire was to find the pattern in the Bible and to see what the church was and what it meant to be Christians
We were young people who loved the Lord's Word; we felt that the Lord's Word was truly as sweet as honey and as precious as gold
At the beginning of the recovery among us, our respect and obedience to the Lord's Word was our strongest point
At that time we also abandoned rank and systems and recovered the position of all the saints being brothers to one another
Previously in the Christian denominations in China, the believers called each other chiaoyu, meaning 'religious friend'
In 1933 and 1934 we clearly saw a crucial matter-the principle of the church taking a locality as its boundary
The church in a large city did not divide into several churches also the churches in several smaller cities did not unite to form one church
There was only one church in a large city such as Jerusalem, and there was also only one church in a small city such as Thessalonica
Based on this principle, from 1934 onward, no matter how large or how small a city is, we have taken the way of having only one church
If one locality were united with another locality, it would cause Christ to lose His position and the Holy Spirit to lose His authority
Because we saw this clear light from the Bible, the churches in various localities absolutely would not form a union
No locality can control another locality; rather, every locality allows Christ to be the Head and the Holy Spirit to exercise His authority
On the other hand, all the churches love one another, fellowship with one another, minister to one another, and help one another in the Lord
From the Word of God we clearly saw that the church in each locality has its own administration and is independent of the other churches
The fellowship of the church should not only be local rather it should also be universal because it is the fellowship of the Body of Christ
Because we have spoken sufficiently regarding this matter in previous chapters, we do not need to speak more regarding it now
All churches should be directly under the ruling of Christ, the Head, and should directly obey the authority of the Holy Spirit
There should be no regional centers or general headquarters acting as higher churches to rule over other churches
From the beginning we kept this matter-the church should not have any organization for unification but should have only spiritual fellowship
In addition, we also emphasized the universal priesthood; that is, we stressed the fact that every believer is a priest
In our midst, there is no intermediary class that monopolizes the spiritual services; instead, we can all serve God directly
The situation among us is completely different from that of traditional Protestant churches and that of the Roman Catholic Church
In this simple chart we can see that the original church was on a straight line; then the Roman Catholic Church deviated from this line
We dare not say that all of them deviated, but some of them definitely deviated; this is difficult to show on the diagram
Today we must humbly acknowledge that the Lord's recovery in the East has brought the church back to the straight line
Christ as the testimony of God is the center of God, but He also needs the outward ground of the church to match and support Him
The church must return to the ground of oneness and not remain on any of the grounds of division of organized Christianity
All of the grounds of denominations, being divisive, are not according to the Bible; therefore, we should leave them
In a given locality there should be only one group of Christians, not several groups; there should be only one church, not several churches
We desire to have fellowship with all the brothers and sisters in the denominations, even those in the Roman Catholic Church
As long as they are saved as long as they are brothers and sisters in the Lord regardless of their denomination we will fellowship with them
These are organizations outside the ground of the locality of the church; they have forsaken the ground of the oneness of the church
In brief, in regard to saved individuals, we will contact them; in regard to the Christian organizations, we will not have any part in them
It also does not matter that we like to practice head covering and others dislike the practice, because this also does not hurt the faith
In the church there can be different opinions, but there absolutely should not be any divisions because of differences in opinions
We receive all believers with different views, except those who meet the conditions for removal from fellowship
Whether or not we receive someone is based upon whether he is saved and whether he has any sin which would cause one to be removed
They have lost the ground and the testimony of the church; they have also lost the principle and nature of the church
We do not want to be people who belong to the Roman Catholic Church or people who belong to the Protestant church
A group might be formed by a professor who leads a group of students to meet together, which then becomes a small 'church'
They all say that they are nondenominational and that they do not belong to any organization of organized Christianity
We acknowledge that the saved ones in any denomination and sect are our brothers in the Lord and members of the Body of Christ
Similarly, within the Protestant churches there are many saved and spiritual ones, but they are not on the ground of the church
Just as we do not recognize the ground of the Roman Catholic Church, we do not recognize the ground of the Protestant church
We deeply and earnestly hope that they would receive the Lord's grace and leading to leave these wrong grounds
