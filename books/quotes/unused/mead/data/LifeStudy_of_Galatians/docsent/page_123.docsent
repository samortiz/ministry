   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A WALK WITH IMPACT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To walk according to the basic principle of the new creation is to walk in a regulated way like soldiers marching in cadence.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is this kind of walk which causes the churches to have impact.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The reason the so-called church is weak is that the believers do not have the second kind of walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They have no real concern for the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if in a locality there are even a small number of saints who have the second walk and march together in cadence, the church there will have impact.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those saints will not simply be sons of God; they will truly become the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do you know who defeated the Canaanite tribes, took possession of the good land for the building up of the temple, and brought God s kingdom to earth?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Israel in the Old Testament is a type of the church in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the church today must be the Israel of God in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Praise the Lord that in God s New Testament economy we have been made both the sons of God and the Israel of God!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>GRACE WITH OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the very end of Galatians Paul says, The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The grace of Christ is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, many Christians know only of the Holy Spirit; they do not know anything of the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this reason, whenever they see the word spirit in the New Testament, they assume that it refers to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are ignorant of the fact that besides the Spirit of God, the Bible speaks of the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Three verses in the New Testament mention these two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 3:6 says, That which is born of the Spirit is spirit ; John 4:24, God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit ; Romans 8:16, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit of God and our spirit are both crucial for God s economy today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit is the very Triune God who has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This life-giving Spirit now dwells in our spirit and witnesses with our spirit that we are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Corinthians 6:17 tells us that he who is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a clear indication that the two spirits have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to Paul s word in 6:18, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Grace here is Christ Himself as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today Christ as the Spirit is in our spirit for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This enjoyment of Christ is the very grace that is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this enjoyment and by this enjoyment we may walk by the Spirit to live Christ and to live the new creation and the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Both kinds of walk by the Spirit are in the enjoyment of the Lord Jesus Christ in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>ENJOYING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BY CALLING ON HIS NAME</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may enjoy the Lord in our spirit simply by calling on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you know why we enjoy the Lord when we call on Him?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We enjoy Him in this way because by calling on the Lord we automatically exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, even though I may not have the intention to exercise my legs and feet, I spontaneously exercise them whenever I walk.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In like manner, whenever we call on the Lord from deep within, we automatically exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Anywhere and at any time we may enjoy the riches of Christ by calling on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By calling on the Lord in this way we walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Calling on the Lord also defeats the negative things within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suppose a young married sister has a problem with her temper.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She earnestly desires to be a good wife and mother, and she loathes her temper.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, she has no way to overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Years ago, I did not know how to advise someone plagued by the problem of temper.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now I know that the best cure for this plague is to call on the name of the Lord with the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By calling on the Lord in this way we breathe in a spiritual element which subdues our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After more than fifty years of experience and after having contacted many different aspects of organized Christianity, I have come to the conclusion that the best way to enjoy the Lord is to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As Christians we should be known by the fact that we call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We know that this was a mark of believers in the first century by the fact that Saul of Tarsus was given authority by the chief priests to bind all those who called on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Calling on the name of the Lord Jesus should also be a mark of believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church people especially should be known as those who call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Like breathing, calling on the name of the Lord is a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But just as we cannot stay alive if we graduate from breathing, so we cannot live spiritually if we stop calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Often the most needful things in life are the most simple.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What is more necessary to maintain life than breathing?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yet, breathing is so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In contrast to cooking, it does not require a great deal of labor.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Likewise, how simple it is to call on the name of the Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, many learned ones do not care for such a simple practice, preferring instead to do things that are much more complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some even criticize us and defame us for calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For them, this practice is a form of chanting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Calling on the Lord has nothing to do with chanting, for calling is a practice altogether according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Oh, how we need to call on the Lord Jesus that we may enjoy Him as our grace and have the two kinds of walk by the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I encourage you to breathe spiritually by calling on the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>By calling on the Lord we enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Let us, then, walk by the Spirit in the enjoyment of Christ in our spirit.</S>
