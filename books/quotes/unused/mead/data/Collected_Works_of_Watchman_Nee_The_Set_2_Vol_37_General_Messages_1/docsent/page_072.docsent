   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DELIVERANCE FROM INDIVIDUALISTIC WORKS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we have Body-consciousness, we immediately will see that the Body is one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once we see this, we will not be individualistic in our spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we want to participate in the Lord's work, we need to deal with this one matter individualistic works.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some people can only do things well when they are doing it alone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If they cannot do it alone, they cannot do it well.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They only regard the things that they are doing as having any spiritual value, and what others do has no spiritual value at all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When they preach and no one is saved, they feel sorry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When others preach and some are saved, they feel strange.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is being individualistic in one's work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever God's children see the oneness of the Body, they will also see the oneness of the work, and they will be delivered out of individualistic work into the work of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This does not mean that we no longer work by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It means that we no longer consider any work to be our own.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It does not matter whether a work is done by us or not, as long as someone is doing it, we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After we become Christians, we should have a desire for spiritual things and seek after them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But this does not mean that we should have a competitive and ambitious spirit, much less a spirit of jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The proper attitude in the work is this: We should hope that whatever we can do, others can do the same as well, and that whatever we cannot do ourselves, others will be raised up to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is hoping that both we and others can do better.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can only be used as a vessel in the work; we cannot take over the work; we cannot claim the work and the result of the work as our own.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we think that something can only be done by us, we have not seen the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we see the Body, we will see that the result is all for the benefit of the Head and the Body, whether we or others are doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the glory goes to the Lord, and all the blessings go to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord has assigned a portion to each one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not consider ourselves greater than what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should be faithful to the portion that the Lord has assigned to us, and we should honor the portion that the Lord has assigned to others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many young people are always comparing themselves with others; they say that they have this and that, and that others do not have this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Or they say that they do not have this and that, and that others have this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, it is impossible to make such comparisons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is like adding a chair to a table and asking whether it is two or one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A table plus a chair is just a table plus a chair.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you ask whether the hands are better or the eyes are better, I can only say that both are good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who see the Body will see that all the members have their functions; they will see that they are only one of the many members.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They will not place themselves in a conspicuous position and make comparisons with others or usurp their places.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once a Christian sees the Body, it will be impossible for him to be proud or jealous anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since the Body is one, it will be the same if the work is done by others or by ourselves; there will be no difference at all.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whether the work is done by you or by others, the glory ultimately goes to the Lord alone, and the blessings go to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you see the Body of Christ, spontaneously you will have this feeling within you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You will sense that the Body is one and that the work is also one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE NEED OF FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who see the Body will spontaneously see the need of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They will spontaneously see that they cannot act independently.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Fellowship is not a formal acquaintance but a spontaneous issue of the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The common notion of fellowship among God's children is to visit a brother or a sister when we are free and chat with them a little.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For most people this is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But fellowship really means a realization that we cannot go on alone, that we need to do everything together, with other members and with the Body as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although we cannot have all the brothers and sisters in the whole church come together, we can have two or three brothers come together and work according to the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to learn the principle of fellowship when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to learn to fellowship when we encounter difficulties, and we have to learn to fellowship when we are seeking God's will, when we are not clear about our future, and when we do not understand God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Fellowship means I cannot pray by myself, that I have to find two or three brothers to deal with a matter together.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It means that I do not understand God's will by myself and that I seek to understand it together with two or three brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It means that I am confused about my own future and that I seek fellowship and I consider my future together with two or three other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It means that I do not understand God's Word by myself and that I find two or three brothers to study God's Word together with me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Fellowship is to acknowledge that we are short, that we are inadequate, and that we need the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Fellowship is the acknowledgment of our own limitations and of the possibility of making mistakes by ourselves; it is receiving help from those who have spiritual discernment before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This does not mean to ask for help only from those who are affectionate towards us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I cannot go on by myself; I need the help of other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Body of Christ is a matter of life, and this life has feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This feeling will tell you that without fellowship, you cannot go on.</S>
