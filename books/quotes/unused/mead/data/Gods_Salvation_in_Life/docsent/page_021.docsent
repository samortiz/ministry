   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Furthermore, to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God is to live a life of denying our natural life under the crucifixion of Christ by being conformed to His death Phil 3:10c .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be conformed to the image of Christ, we need to be conformed first to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are not the same as He is in His death, then we will not be like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, Philippians 3:10 says that we must be in the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He suffers, and we suffer with Him; this is the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this way we are conformed to the mold of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The mold of Christ's death is to live a life of denying our natural life under the crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In our daily life we should not do anything by our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, in everything we must deny our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is to apply death to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have a mold in us, and that mold is death, the denying of our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the image of the firstborn Son of God there is the element of death, that is, the denying of His own life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While He was living on the earth, He denied His own life every moment and lived by the Father's life instead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although His crucifixion was the final stop of His journey on earth, throughout the thirty-three and a half years of His life He lived under the death of the cross by denying Himself and living by the Father's life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This also is a great element in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the matter of love we have to ask, "Lord, is it I who love, or is it You who loves in me, from me, and through me?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we love by ourselves, that is a love by our natural life and is without death or resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we deny our natural life and live by Christ, then we are according to the apostle Paul's word: "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is to be conformed to the death of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God is to live out the reality of the spiritual life of God by the power of Christ's resurrection Phil 3:10a .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The power of Christ's resurrection is the life that raised Him from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to know and experience this power of Christ we need to be joined and conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to live a life of crucifixion as He did.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our being conformed to His death allows His resurrection power to rise up so that His divine, spiritual life may be practically expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To Take the Life-giving Spirit, the Pneumatic Christ, as Our Life and Person</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. To Be Led into Glorification in the Divine Glory by Arriving at Maturity of Life through Transformation in Life</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The goal of God's salvation in life is also that we be led into glorification in the divine glory by arriving at maturity of life through transformation in life Eph 4:13b; Col 1:28; Rom 8:30; Heb 2:10a .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Glorification is a matter that we need to be led into.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Transformation is a pathway of glory, and it increases from one degree of glory to another degree of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we have passed through this kind of transformation, the result is our conformation, which is very close to glorification and leads us into glorification.</S>
