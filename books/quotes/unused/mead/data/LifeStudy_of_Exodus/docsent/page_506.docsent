   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOR ALL GENERATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Exodus 30:31 says, And you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil to Me throughout your generations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that God s principle or policy in His divine economy does not change.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ordinance concerning the anointing will remain forever.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even in eternity God will continually be anointing us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>NOT TO BE POURED UPON THE FLESH OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 32 says that the holy anointing oil was not to be poured upon the flesh of man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible the flesh of man denotes fallen man in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As believers in Christ, we have all been regenerated, and in regeneration we have become a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the one hand, we have a regenerated spirit; on the other hand, we still have the old, fallen flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The command not to pour the anointing oil upon the flesh of man indicates that the anointing is not to be applied to men of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever we live and walk according to the flesh, we are through with the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we would partake of this Spirit and enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit, we must remain in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit of Christ cannot be poured upon our old nature, our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our flesh does not have the position to participate in this compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever you lose your temper, you are in the flesh and cannot enjoy the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But whenever you turn to your spirit, immediately in your spirit you sense the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You realize that you are being painted with the Spirit of Christ, for you are in the new creation, not in your old nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Exodus 30:33 indicates that the ointment was not to be put upon a stranger.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word stranger implies a comparison between those who are priests and those who are not.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The priests serving in the presence of God do not act according to the old nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, they live according to their new nature and thereby enjoy the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, in the sight of God all other people are strangers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may say that the flesh, the old man, is a stranger.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We Christians today are not strangers; we are priests.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But unbelievers are strangers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we act and behave according to our flesh, we are in the old creation and are regarded as strangers in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we are such strangers, we cannot enjoy the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must remain in our spirit, and we must live, act, speak, and contact others in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we shall be in the new creation as priests serving God and participating in the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we would enjoy the Spirit of Christ, we must be priests in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not be in the flesh, lest you be a stranger in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are a stranger, then we shall not have any share in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>NOT TO MAKE ANY LIKE IT</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>IN ITS PROPORTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The middle part of verse 32 says, Neither shall you make any like it in its proportions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, verse 33 goes on to say, Whoever compounds any like it, or who puts any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The command not to make anything like the anointing oil in its proportions means that we should not imitate it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, among Christians today there is a great deal of imitation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we need to discern what is truly of the Spirit and what is an imitation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, a person s humility may not be of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In China I saw some disciples of Confucius who were much more humble than many Christian teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But that humility had nothing to do with the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because of the influence of certain teachings, many Christians try to act humble.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This humility, however, is not of the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, it is an imitation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not imitate any spiritual virtue by your own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To do this is to make something like the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the sight of God this is an abomination.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because Christianity has been in existence for centuries, a great many people, including unbelievers, have been influenced by Bible teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Under the influence of these teachings, many try to be honest, loving, and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All this is an imitation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To try to behave in this way is to make an imitation of the genuine ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our honesty must come out of the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Likewise, our love, humility, patience, and kindness indeed, every virtue must be a product of the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Otherwise, we are imitating the ointment; we are making something false in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, we should not act in our old nature and we should not imitate anything that is of the Spirit of Christ.</S>
