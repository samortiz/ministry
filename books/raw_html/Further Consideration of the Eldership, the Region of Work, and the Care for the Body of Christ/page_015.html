<P>Today in all of Christianity, the reality of the Body is absent because there is no oneness. In the Catholic Church there is a so-called oneness that is humanly manufactured. The word catholic means universally one. This so-called oneness has been maintained by the organizational papal system. This is a man-made, manufactured oneness. This is not the real oneness. After Luther was raised up by the Lord, the state, or national, churches were eventually formed, such as the Church of Germany, the Church of Sweden, the Church of Denmark, the Church of Norway, and the Church of England. Through the formation of these national churches and the Protestant denominations, the oneness was slaughtered. Because the Lord's seeking ones realized that the Catholic Church and the national churches were off, they tried their best to keep the truth which they had seen and to recover this truth. As a result, division after division was continually formed. Based upon this principle, the Presbyterian church came into existence because some desired to keep the truth of the presbytery. This is the truth concerning the churches being managed and administrated under a group of elders. The Baptists saw the truth of baptism by immersion, so they formed the Baptist church. Even the Baptists are divided among themselves. Today there are the Southern Baptists, the American Baptists, and the Conservative Baptists. There are many, many so-called private churches today. There are also many free groups.</P><P>In the eighteenth century, Zinzendorf took the lead in the recovery of the initial stage of the church life in the unity of the Holy Spirit. In the nineteenth century, the British Brethren were raised up by the Lord, and they saw many truths. However, they were too occupied with doctrine according to the letter. Due to this, they were divided. The first division among them took place because of a disagreement between Darby and Newton over the person of Christ and over the rapture and second coming of Christ.</P><P>Another problem among the Brethren was concerning whether or not the recovered church should receive those saints who still remained in the denominations. George MÃ¼ller felt that these saints should be received. He pointed out that some who remained in the denominations, such as Hudson Taylor, were spiritual, seeking after the Lord, and living a high standard of the Christian life. Hudson Taylor tried his best to avoid the formation of another denomination. The China Inland Mission which he formed was a mission established for going into the interior of China to save sinners. Despite what Hudson Taylor endeavored to do, China Inland Mission churches were eventually formed, established, and built up. Thus, according to the view of the Brethren, Hudson Taylor formed another denomination. Darby argued that such people might be spiritual, but because they still remained in the denominations, they had to be called evil companions. This debate concerning the receiving of the saints caused further division among the Brethren.</P>
