<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Man-child Born of the Universal Woman</H2><P>Revelation 12 shows us the sign of the man-child born of the universal woman&#151;the universal church (vv. 1-2, 5). Verse 1 shows a great sign of a woman clothed with the sun, standing on the moon, and having a crown of twelve stars on her head. This woman shows forth all the light sources in the universe: the sun, the moon, and the stars. This is a beautiful, brilliant, shining, marvelous woman, but she is only a part of this picture because she is laboring to bring forth something. She travails in birth to bring forth a man-child. This man-child is the stronger part of the woman.</P><P>That universal woman is composed of the sun, signifying the New Testament believers, the moon, signifying the Old Testament believers, and the twelve stars, signifying the patriarchs before the law was given. This depicts the totality of all God's people throughout all the ages.</P><P>All these people have been struggling and travailing like a woman in pain to bring forth something. Revelation 12:2 says, "And she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth." Verse 2 indicates that this universal woman has a focus and direction to bring forth a man-child. We need to pray, "Lord, we want to be within that focus and direction." It is not enough to be a part of the universal woman. Within her is a stronger part. That stronger part is the part that overcomes to bear the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>Verse 5 says that she brings forth a man-child who is about to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod. This indicates that the man-child consists of the overcomers, as mentioned in 2:26-27. Throughout all the ages, beginning with the patriarchs through the Old Testament age and the New Testament age, there has been a stronger part of God's people bearing the testimony of Jesus and fighting for God's economy. This is the part we must be. We want to be constituted to be the stronger part of this woman for the advancement of God's economy to bear the testimony of Jesus.</P><P>The ones who compose the man-child are those who overcome the great dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the devil, Satan, the accuser of God's children. Immediately after the woman delivered this man-child, he was caught up to God and to His throne. The heavens are waiting for the man-child. The man-child is needed to complete the execution of God's judgment on Satan.</P><P>The ones who compose the man-child have been absolute in fighting for the Lord. Their interest is the Lord's interest. They are the ones who pray, "Lord, You must get through. We are not going to tolerate things the way they are. Lord, if we're dead, we've got to be living. Lord, if we're indifferent, we've got to be desperate." The overcomers do not sit back and wait for something. They take the initiative to carry out the things that God in His economy has appropriated for them. They do not compromise with the devil in any point of their life.</P>
