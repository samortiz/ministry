   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THEIR MOVEMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the apostles were called by the Spirit and were separated for the work by the representative members of the Body, what did they do?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to recall that those who separated them only expressed identification and sympathy by the laying on of hands; they had no authority to control the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those prophets and teachers at the base assumed no official responsibility in regard to their movements, their methods of work, or the supply of their financial needs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Scripture we nowhere find that apostles are under the control of any individual or any organized company.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They had no regulations to adhere to and no superiors to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Holy Spirit called them, and they followed His leading and guidance; He alone was their Director.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Acts 13 and 14 we find the first scriptural record of missionary movements.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Though today the places we visit and the conditions we meet may be vastly different from those of the Scripture record, yet in principle the experience of the first apostles may well serve as our example.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us glance for a moment at these two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"They then, having been sent out by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from there they sailed away to Cyprus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And when they were in Salamis, they announced the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And they also had John as their attendant.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And when they had passed through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain man, a magician" 13:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the very outset constant movement characterized those sent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A true apostle is a traveler, not a settler.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"And putting out to sea from Paphos, Paul and his companions came to Perga of Pamphylia; and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And they passed through from Perga and arrived at Pisidian Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down" 13:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Antioch mentioned here is not the same as the Antioch from which Barnabas and Saul set forth on their first missionary tour.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The apostles were constantly on the move, proclaiming the Word of God wherever they went, but until they reached Antioch in Pisidia we are not told anything of the result of their labors.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From this point there is a definite development in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"And when the synagogue gathering had been dismissed, many of the Jews and the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God" 13:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here is the outcome of a short period of witness in Antioch of Pisidia many of the Jews and religious proselytes believed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A week later almost the whole city gathered together to hear the Word v. 44 , but this enthusiastic response on the part of the people provoked the Jews to jealousy, and they opposed the apostles v. 45 . At this point the apostles turned to the Gentiles v. 46 , and "as many as were appointed to eternal life believed" v. 48 . On the previous Sabbath a number of Jews had received the Word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This Sabbath a number of Gentiles believed on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So not long after the arrival of the apostles in Antioch of Pisidia we find a church there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the apostles did not argue, "Now we have a group of believers here.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must stay awhile and shepherd them."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They founded a local church at Antioch of Pisidia, but they did not stay to build it up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On they went again, publishing the Word of the Lord "through the whole region" v. 49 . Their objective was not one city, but "all the region." The modern custom of settling down in one place to shepherd a particular flock has no precedent in Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Persecution followed v. 50 . The opponents of the gospel message expelled the apostles from their coasts, and they answered by shaking the dust from their feet v. 51 . Many a present-day missionary has no dust to shake from his feet! But those who gather no dust lack the characteristic of an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The early apostles never settled down in comfortable homes, nor did they stop for long to pastor the churches they founded.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They were constantly traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be an apostle means to be a sent one, that is, to be always going out.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A stationary apostle is a contradiction in terms.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A true apostle is one who in times of persecution will always have dust to shake off his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What effect had this early departure of the apostles upon the infant church?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here was a group of new believers, mere babes in Christ, and their fathers in the faith forsook them in their infancy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Did they argue, "Why should the apostles be afraid of persecution and leave us to face the opposition alone?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Did they plead with the apostles to remain awhile and care for their spiritual welfare?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Did they reason, "If you leave us now we shall be as sheep without a shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If both of you cannot stay, surely one at least can remain behind and look after us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The persecution is so intense, we shall never get through without your help."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How amazing the Scripture record is: "And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit" v. 52 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There was no mourning among the disciples when the apostles left, but great gladness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The disciples were glad, for they knew the Lord; and they might well rejoice, because the apostles' departure meant an opportunity for others to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What was loss to them was gain to Iconium.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those believers were not like the believers of today, hoping for a settled pastor to instruct them, solve their problems, and shelter them from trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And those apostles were not like the apostles of today; they were pioneers, not settlers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They did not wait till believers were mature before they left them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They dared to leave them in mere infancy, for they believed in the power of the life of God within them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But those disciples were not only filled with joy; they were filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The apostles might go, but the Spirit remained.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Had the apostles remained to pastor them, it would have mattered little whether they were filled with the Spirit or not.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If they had had a pastor to throw light on all their problems, they would have felt little need of the Spirit's instruction; and they would have felt little need of His power if they had had one in their midst who was bearing all responsibility for the spiritual side of the work while they attended to the secular.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Scripture there is not the slightest hint that apostles should settle down to pastor those they have led to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are pastors in Scripture, but they are simply brethren raised up of God from among the local saints to care for their fellow believers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One of the reasons why so many present-day converts are not filled with the Spirit is that the apostles settle down to shepherd them and take upon themselves the responsibility that belongs to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Praise God that the apostles moved on to Iconium, for "a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed" 14:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before long "the multitude of the city was divided, and some were with the Jews and some with the apostles" v. 4 . The saved were obviously a great multitude, since their coming out from the unsaved so vitally affected the place as to cause a division in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only a short time after the apostles left Antioch in Pisidia, there was a church established in Iconium; and here, as in the previous place, opposition was intense.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The apostles might well have argued that to leave a great multitude of mere babes in Christ exposed to fierce persecution was heartless, and bad policy besides.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But the apostles were true to their apostolic calling, and off they went "to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe" v. 6 . And what did they do when they came to Lystra? As elsewhere, so here, "they announced the gospel" v. 7 , and as elsewhere, so here, there was opposition and persecution v. 19 . It is difficult to estimate the number of believers at Lystra, but judging by the remark that the disciples surrounded Paul v. 20 , there must have been at least half a dozen, and there may have been scores or even hundreds.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>So now there is a church in Lystra!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Does Paul stay to shepherd them awhile, or at least to tend them till the fierceness of the opposition has subsided?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"On the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe" v. 20 . And there again the glad tidings are proclaimed and many disciples are made v. 21 . So another church is formed! And with the founding of a church in Derbe the first missionary tour of the apostles closes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Looking back over these two chapters, we note that a fundamental principle governs the movements of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They travel from place to place, according to the leading of the Spirit, preaching the gospel and founding churches.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Nowhere do we find them settling down to shepherd and instruct the converts, or to bear any local responsibility in the churches they have founded.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In days of peace the apostles were on the move, and in days of persecution likewise.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"Go!" was the word of the Lord, and "Go!" was the watchword of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The outstanding trait of a sent one is that he is always on the move.</S>
