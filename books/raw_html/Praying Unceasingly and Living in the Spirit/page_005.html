        <h2 class="head1">WITHOUT THE SPIRIT,<br />
THE CHURCH LIFE ALSO BEING A WAY</h2>
<p>We have been meeting in the church for many years. After so many years our meetings have unexpectedly molded us into our current condition. Because we love the Lord and the church, we do not touch anything that would displease the Lord. However, our not touching things that would displease the Lord is just a way; it is not life. A picture does not have life.</p>
<p>A Chinese Christian once told me that American women always wear lipstick. The Lord has gained many Americans who love Him with a pure heart. The sisters who entered into the church life were touched by the Lord and do not wear lipstick or makeup. Although this is pleasing to the Lord, it is not the Lord Himself. It is one thing to love the Lord and another to live the Lord out. The Lord is pleased when a person loves Him and therefore does not go to movie theaters, does not wear lipstick, and does not care for fashion; however, these are not the Lord. In principle, this can be compared to Judaism. Those in Judaism fear God; therefore, they do not do certain things. We also do not do certain things because we fear God. Those in Judaism fear God, but they do not have God in their living. It is possible that this is also our condition.</p>
<p>Being scriptural in every aspect of our living does not mean that we are full of God. Being scriptural in our living is but a picture. God is Spirit; hence, our living should not be merely a way. We do not want a picture; we want the reality. We do not want a way; we want the reality. The reality is the Triune God, who has gone through various processes to become the life-giving Spirit so that we may be joined to Him as one spirit, contacting Him every moment and not being separated from Him. The Lord is our life. This speaks of our being inseparable from Him. Our relationship with the Lord is a relationship of life. We cannot be separated from our life; the moment that we are separated, we will die. The Lord is our life, and we are His living. Whenever we do not contact Him, everything becomes religion and rituals.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SELF-CONTROL NOT BEING CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Chinese highly regard self-control. Elderly people experience many hardships and have developed self-control so that they do not lose their temper often. Because we have been meeting in the church for a while, we too have developed self-control. However, self-control is not Christ. The church is the best furnace for refining people, but no matter how much we are refined, refining is not Christ. I am afraid that the lessons of the cross that we have learned were lessons of self-control. Forty years ago I did not have that much self-control, but I now have much self-control. After learning lessons of the cross for many years, my sharp &ldquo;edges&rdquo; have been &ldquo;smoothed out&rdquo;; that is, my habits of losing my temper and of being anxious have been dealt with significantly. However, this may only be asceticism, not Christ. Christ is the Spirit; hence, I do not need self-control if I have Christ, if I am joined to Him as one spirit, and if I live in the Spirit. The word <em>self-control</em> is not in our spiritual dictionary. In other words, we should not have self-cultivation.</p>
<p>Paul wrote the Epistle to the Colossians because the Jewish religion and Greek culture converged in Colossae and had entered into the church life to replace Christ. Therefore, the Epistle to the Colossians deals with culture, because culture is a replacement of Christ. Even the way we have our church life is a culture. We are very cultured people, but culture is not Christ. Culture is an enemy of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR WALK NEEDING TO BE ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Christ is the Spirit (John 14:17-18). The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). The Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). The Lord Spirit is with our spirit (v. 18; 2 Tim. 4:22). We have been crucified, buried, and raised together with Him so that we might walk in newness of life (Rom. 6:4). This is our living. Concerning our service, Romans 7:6 says that we &ldquo;serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.&rdquo; Anything without the spirit is letter. The spirit is of the new man, but the letter is of the old man. The letter imitates and follows the old, but the spirit is new every day. Our living should be in newness of life, and our service should be in newness of spirit. The Bible does not ask us to walk according to teachings rather than the flesh but to walk according to the spirit (8:4). To be according to the spirit is to be in spirit and to be one spirit with the Lord in our speaking, handling of affairs, and interaction with others. In other words, when our union with the Lord as the Spirit of life is uninterrupted, we will be able to live out the life of the Lord. Then our living will not be a way but a living out of the life within us. Such should be our living and our service.</p>
<p>God does not want us to do things, nor does He want us to serve in a particular way. God wants to be lived out of us. A real tiger lives out the tiger life. The Bible is not for us to imitate but for us to see whether we are living the life of God. Whatever we do according to the picture is not real. A real Christian lives out Christ. It is one thing to be scriptural and another to live out Christ. Being scriptural is different from living out Christ.</p>
<p>The saints in the church life have been &ldquo;drawing pictures&rdquo; for a long time; therefore, our pictures resemble the real thing. The young brothers give strong messages, but these messages are pictures, because the brothers do not live out Christ most of the time. The messages are pictures of Christ that resemble Christ, but a picture that resembles Christ is still not Christ. The brothers need to live out Christ. To live out Christ is not doctrine, nor is it messages. To live out Christ is to be one spirit with the Lord. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Our walk needs to be according to the spirit. The Lord is the all-inclusive Spirit who is with our spirit. Hence, we need to live out the Spirit. If we have the spiritual key and know how to set our mind on the spirit, turn our whole being back to the spirit, and speak and walk in the spirit, Christ will come forth from within us in every situation. There is another realm in the spirit. Only what is lived out from our spirit is Christ. If the brothers would live in the spirit, their messages would no longer be pictures of Christ but would rather supply Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD WANTING CHRIST TO BE LIVED OUT OF US</h2>
<p>God does not want ways; He wants to be lived out of us. He is not concerned about whether we lose our temper, nor is He concerned about whether the sisters wear lipstick. He wants nothing but Christ lived out of us. Then what we do will be because Christ lives in us, not because of regulations; thus, for us to live will be Christ. A real tiger will always look like a tiger. Similarly, what Christ lives out of us will always match the picture portrayed by the Bible, for the Bible is the right picture.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find a person who has a living that matches the picture in the Bible, because our transformation is not complete. We may not do certain things, but we often still live by our natural man. We love or hate, we are proud or humble, and we are angry or meek in our natural man. Some saints, who have been broken by the cross, are still very natural; their living is not necessarily Christ.</p>
<p>Many criminals were crucified during the Roman Empire, but Christ was crucified so that the effectiveness of the cross could be applied in our spirit in order for us to live Christ by the divine life. Only that which is lived out of our spirit is Christ. We certainly need to be broken in order for Christ to be lived out of us, but the breaking of the cross is one thing and the living out of Christ is another. It is possible for a person to be broken by the cross but to not live out Christ. Living out Christ is a matter of resurrection and of the spirit; it is not a matter of only the cross.</p>
<p>We should not focus on methods, because only that which comes out of the spirit is Christ. We need the Lord&rsquo;s grace in order to see that without contacting Christ, even reading the whole Bible will not benefit us. For this reason the Lord said that some searched the Scriptures, but they were not willing to come to Him to have life. This means that searching the Scriptures cannot replace our coming to the Lord. I encourage all the saints to search the Scriptures, but we must learn to come to the Lord.</p>
<p>Unlike Peter and John in the four Gospels, we cannot see the Lord face to face. Today we come to the Lord in spirit. We are joined to the Lord as one spirit, one life. He is the vine, and we are the branches (John 15:5). He and we have the same life. Christ is our life, and He abides in us and lets us abide in Him. Now we are one life, one spirit, with Christ.</p>
<p>From our experience we know that only one thing counts before the Lord: to be joined to the Lord as one spirit, to live in the spirit, and to walk according to the spirit. This does not mean that we should not do anything when we live in the spirit, for that would be to be &ldquo;dead&rdquo; in spirit. We still need to live, to move, and to serve, but everything must be in spirit. This requires our practice. It is not enough to shout about releasing the spirit in the meetings. We must live in the spirit and do all things, whether great or small, in the spirit in our daily life. We must abide in the Lord and let Him abide in us. He is our life, and we are His living. To live out Christ is a matter of the spirit and of life.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
