<P>The gifts covered in Ephesians 4 are given by the ascended Head to His Body. The gifts in 1 Corinthians 12 are given to individual churches. The power for the edification of the church must be given by God. The duty and right of the church is to acknowledge and to receive these gifts. If believers are to understand God's ordained order for the church, they should differentiate between the gifts in Ephesians 4 and those in 1 Corinthians 12. The former are for the Body of Christ, that is, for the whole church, which encompasses all times and all places. The latter are for individual churches, which means that they are for single local churches. The shepherds, teachers, and evangelists established by God are for the building up of the Body of Christ, the universal church. Although individual churches can receive the benefit of these gifts, the purpose of God in giving these gifts is for the whole church and not for individual churches. For this reason, we do not see in the Bible the pastor, or shepherd, of a certain locality, or the evangelist or teacher of a certain locality. The gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 are limited to individual places. According to God's arrangement, the gifts given to individual churches, such as those mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12, should be directed by the Holy Spirit and put to use according to the will of the Head, as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14.</P><P>The seven stars belong to the Lord. They should be in the Lord's right hand. The direction of all the gifts in the church should be according to the Lord's command. It is a pity that the church has forgotten this and has set up many organizations and ordinances according to human thought. Whenever a place is found with manmade order, it becomes impossible for God's gifts to function. In the order of the denominational meetings, there is no place reserved for the gifts described in the Bible. In God's eyes, what man considers as order is but confusion. Man's order does not recognize the Lord's supreme authority and does not recognize the Holy Spirit's distribution of gifts "to each one respectively even as He purposes." It does not recognize the order of the church as depicted in the Bible.</P><P>The church in Sardis and the Protestant churches signified by the church in Sardis have forgotten the fact that the seven stars belong to the Lord. This is why there are so many man-made ordinations, nominations, and elections in the Lord's work among the present denominations. The result of this manipulation of the Lord's work is obvious. When such an atmosphere is encouraged, it is inevitable to see an ebbing and dwindling condition. Even that which was of God is gradually weakened until the whole situation is brought to the point of death.</P><P>Of course, as far as the truth and freedom are concerned, Protestantism is better than what went on before. However, God's goal is not that man would depart from the gross sins. Neither is it that man would be free from minor errors. Rather, God wants man's heart to be counted worthy of Him and to allow Him to work as He wills in the church. What He wants to see are His ordinances carried out and His glory manifested. If He gains what He wants, freedom is the sure result. This freedom does not come from self-will; it is the freedom in the Holy Spirit. It is a sin for believers to allow human power to assume an important place in the church. The Lord reveals Himself to the church in Sardis in this way in order to shatter all human freedom and authority. The Lord declares that all spiritual powers and outward authorities are His.</P><P>Among many Protestant churches, such as the Anglican Church in England and the Lutheran Church in Germany, the authority over the stars is given to the rulers of the nations. On the other hand, those who are opposed to the mixing of state and religion, as most common denominations are today, have themselves fallen into similar sins of placing the stars in the hands of the church. Although the churches in China at present do not yet have the government "appoint" their officers, they have fallen into the sin of the churches in selecting, directing, and ordering their preachers. The Bible never teaches us that the world or the church should have such power in their hands. Everything is still in the Lord Jesus' hands. He has not yet given up anything. If the church would recognize this fact, the Lord will begin His work. If faith would look up to Him, He surely will know how to supply the church's needs. If there is no faith, and one does not acknowledge the Lord's position, there will, of course, be the need to replace the work of the Son of God, the Head, with man's method of maintaining orders.</P><P>He is the Head of the church. He is also working as the Head of the church. He exercises His authority to rule over those who are working for Him on earth. In spite of the degradation of the church, the reason that there are still government and gifts in it is that the Lord is still the Head. The Lord knew that one day the organization which called itself the church would rebel against Him and would usurp all the powers. In the end, everything will be in confusion. For this reason, He is unveiling Himself here as the One who is greater than everything. No matter how circumstances turn, authority always belongs to Christ. If we look up to the condition of the church, we will never receive authority. Our only need is to look up to the Lord.</P><P>During the Reformation, in order to escape the yoke of the Pope, men turned the authority of the church over to the worldly rulers. Although those outside the state religions did not commit the same sin, they considered the genuine church the holder of such authority. Actually, it is Christ Himself through the Holy Spirit who is the Lord of the church. This is clearly taught in this letter. For example, some have become teachers and pastors, but based upon what authority are they commissioned? Although the apostles and their representatives did appoint men to administrate the local affairs, from the beginning there was never such a thing as the appointing of a preacher of God's word. Even in selecting a person to replace Judas's lot, the apostles were afraid to make their own decisions and would instead do according to what the Lord had planned (Acts 1:24-25). Later when the Lord chose Paul, although there was Ananias to baptize him, this did not mean that this disciple was endowed with any authority to appoint apostles. Even when others were laying hands on Paul and Barnabas, that merely meant that these two brothers (apostles being no more than brothers!) were going out to preach the word and that other men were sympathizing with them and were committing them to the Lord. There was no ordination or sending out here. As far as their spiritual gifts and abilities were concerned, these men were much inferior to the apostles. The authority of the church is in the hands of the Lord. He has never relinquished a bit of this authority. It is true that when a man sets out to preach the word, he is eager to find out from whose hand he is authorized to do such work. But if he wants to be authorized, he should at least be commissioned by an effective authority! What can a man give to another man? Of course, before the world, if there is human ordination and acknowledgement, everything will look more proper. However, we have to ask if the Lord considers the preaching of the gospel to be something that requires authorization. We do admit that the apostles did "appoint" elders and deacons, but they were not necessarily the pastors and the teachers. Philip was an evangelist, not because he was one of "the seven," but because he received such a gift from the Head. Elders and deacons are only for the managing of local affairs. For these people, the Bible does record the "appointing," but for the teachers, the shepherds, and the evangelists, we do not see one incident of ordination or that any one was ordained. For one to have such a gift of preaching is adequate proof that the Lord has given such a one the authority to do such a work. Because ordination is the most fashionable tradition of the present denominations, men consider this to be the order of the church. Man has now become accustomed to departing from God's principles! How can those who have left the true principles expect to be right? The Lord reveals His own position in this way so that His children would obey Him. Man's conscience should be governed by the Lord's authority. If a man knows that his way is wrong, surely his conscience will not be at peace. Many times, believers do not know which way is proper, but if they would depart from sin, they would find the answer. This is an indispensable step.</P>
