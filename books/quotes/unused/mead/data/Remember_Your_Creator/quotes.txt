[1]  Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come and the years draw near when you will say, "I have no delight in them"...in the day that the watchmen of the house tremble, and the mighty men stoop, the grinding ones stand idle because they are few, and those who look through windows grow dim; and the doors on the street are shut as the sound of the grinding mill is low, and one will arise at the sound of the bird, and all the daughters of song will sing softly.
[2]  The second thing for you to do is to know the Bible in your childhood.
[3]  Paul once wrote these words to Timothy: "And that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
[4]  Here we have two portions of the Bible, and we are charged with two things: first, to remember your Creator in the days of your youth, and, second, to know the Bible in your childhood.
[5]  In these verses, we have two points: concerning your Creator, concerning God, you have to remember Him; and concerning the Bible, you have to know it.
[6]  To remember your Creator means to love the Lord in the days of your youth, while your eyes still have their keen sight, while your teeth are still complete and perfect, while you are still so strong, and while your hair is not gray.
[7]  REMEMBER YOUR CREATOR Tune: #536, "The Church Is the House"
