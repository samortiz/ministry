   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR LIVING AND WORKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING FOR GOD TO WORK HIMSELF INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The problem today is that no one is willing to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our eyes need to be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If there is such a group of people, God will have a way here in this place, and man will receive the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God has no intention for you to love your wife or to hate your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has no intention for the wife to submit to the husband or to rebel against the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has only one intention, and that is to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If Brother Chow keeps walking around, it will be difficult for me to pour water on his head.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if he sits down, it will be easy for me to pour water on him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It may seem that he is doing something for me when he walks around.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, I can do nothing with him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If by hating your wife you can have more of God in you, you can go ahead and hate your wife as much as you like.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In facing an issue, the question is how much of God will pass through you, and how much He will gain in you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why did God give you parents, husbands, wives, and children?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He gave you these things in order that He can work Himself into you through these things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the more I speak, the more God is added into you, this will achieve God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I did not come to Swatow to give teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have come to have God worked into you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why should the sisters manage their homes well?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Is it to make better homes?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No. It is to have more of God added into you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more we manage our homes, the more God should be added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you do this, after three or five years, you will have more of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Your homes may still be the same, but God will have increased within you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some have asked me if they can quit their job to serve the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I told them bluntly that it does not mean anything for them to remain in their jobs, and it does not mean anything for them to quit their jobs and be a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The question is not whether or not one should be a preacher, but whether or not one will allow the Lord to work in him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's work in the old creation is outside of man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His work in the new creation is within man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day, the work of the old creation will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the work of the new creation will remain until the New Jerusalem; it will never pass away but will have eternal value.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every time we do something, we should not ask if that thing is right or wrong, or if it is according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In doing something, the question is this: Is it we who are doing it, or is it God?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What we should ask is not what we do, but who is doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>GOD'S LEADING AND OVERSEEING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>BEING FOR THE PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>OF WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today, many people talk about God's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word leading has been much misused by men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may say that God is leading you to preach the gospel today, or that He is leading you to take care of your home tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The issue is not this or that kind of leading.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The question is this: In such leadings, what do you do?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By whom are you doing these things?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God has not asked you only to be a steward and to manage your household well.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He has not asked you only to preach the gospel and to preach it well.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's goal is to go through you and be constituted in you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some manage their homes well.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But by doing so, God is put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The same is true in one's management of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some are led to manage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the question is this: By what way is this one managing the church?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For him to be led to take up the management of the church is one thing, but the way he manages the church is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>With some sisters, the more they manage their homes, the worse their homes become.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet all the while, God is worked into them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Before they try to manage their homes, they do not have God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But after they start managing them, they are filled with God, even though their homes are still not well-managed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God is managing them through their home management.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In their managing of their homes, God passes through them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some may ask, "If a person has God, will she not manage her home well?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Consider the world; it is true that the world is under God's management.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But is the world good?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Seemingly, the world is not managed very well.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Out of this world, however, God gains a group of people that will allow Him to work Himself into them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even when you save the whole county, if God cannot be worked into you, His plan in man is still defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If God can only be preached to people, without being preached into people, His will is still not accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to remember all the time that the need today is for God to work Himself into us, rather than for us to work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All those who will only work for God without allowing God to work in them will eventually be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only those who allow God to work in them through various circumstances, people, matters, and events will be blessed by Him.</S>
