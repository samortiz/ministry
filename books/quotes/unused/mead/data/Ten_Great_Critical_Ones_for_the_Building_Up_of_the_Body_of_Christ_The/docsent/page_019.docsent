   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that for so many decades Your word has never been rare among us; rather, Your revelation has come to us again and again.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the previous message we saw the one life, one salvation, and one living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These three are one group.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Life saves, and salvation produces and issues in a living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this message we want to see the one testimony, one Body, and one city.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The testimony is the golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are the testimony of the Body, which is the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God, and this Body consummates in the one city.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>ONE TESTIMONY ONE EXPRESSION Christ Being the Faithful Witness</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is the faithful Witness of God, testifying in His human living what God is Rev 1:5; 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, our Head is the witness, bearing the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Believers Being the Witnesses of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The believers are the witnesses of Christ for the spreading of His gospel Acts 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We continue Christ to be witnesses, witnessing the all-inclusive Christ for the spreading of the gospel to produce His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We testify the human living of Christ Acts 10:37-39a and His death, resurrection, and ascension Acts 2:30-36; 3:15; 10:39b-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Acts, this was the apostles testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This testimony is to save sinners to be the members of Christ for the building up of His Body Acts 2:37-42; 4:10-12; 10:42-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not take so-called soul winning as our object of preaching the gospel so that people may go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our object of the preaching of the gospel is to win sinners so that they may become members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Local Churches Being the Golden Lampstands</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The local churches, composed with the believers to be the Body of Christ, are the golden lampstands Rev 1:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The lampstands are a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Golden Lampstands Being Identical</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the golden lampstands are identical in nature, in shape, and in function to be the one expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the seven lampstands were put before us, we would not be able to distinguish them, because they are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without numbering them, no one could discern which lampstand is which.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They all are identical in their golden nature, the divine nature, in their shape, the form of Christ, and in their function, the shining of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Father is the nature, the Son is the shape, the form, and the Spirit is the shining power.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the local churches should be identical in the same nature of God, form of Christ, and function of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The one expression of Christ is in the unique oneness of the Spirit of the unique Body of Christ Eph 4:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without the Spirit, we cannot have the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This one expression is also in the unique fellowship of the unique Spirit, participating in the unique flow of the Triune God 1 John 1:3; 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is only one Triune God and only one fellowship, one flow of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The one expression of Christ is in the unique move of the unique God for the unique accomplishment of His unique economy Eph 1:10; 1 Tim 1:4b and in the unique blending in the unique life of Christ for His unique testimony in the universe 1 Cor 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everything must be unique.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If only the group of churches in your district are blended together, that is not the unique blending.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That is a "sect blending."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>ONE BODY ONE ORGANISM</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God in His move.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Life is a substance, the Triune God, and the organism is the visible expression of this substance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The one Body is the constitution of the divinity of the processed and consummated Triune God with the humanity of all His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people Eph 4:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Body is constituted with the Triune God with the Father as the source, the substance, with the Son as the element, the expression, and with the Spirit as the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This Triune God in His divinity is mingled with the humanity of His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are redeemed for regeneration and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not have and cannot have the Body life in our natural life, in our natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must be redeemed by the blood, regenerated by the Spirit, and transformed through the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The cross of Christ must cross us out.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then we become transformed new men.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All the members of the Body are the new men, and the new men added together are one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to Colossians 3:10-11, all the members of this new man should be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He also said, "To me, to live is Christ for His magnification" Phil 1:19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must be Christ; then we can be His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A person's fingers, toes, and nose are his parts, and all the parts of a person added together equal that person.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to realize the Body in such an intrinsic way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is not just that we are one, that we have no opinion, and that we speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must be out; Christ must be in. We die that He may live.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The one Body, the one organism, is the accomplishment of God's economy according to the good pleasure, the heart's desire, of His will Eph 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This Body is built with Christ's life as its element, the Spirit of reality as its essence, and the person of God as its source Eph 4:4-6 and built up by the perfected saints who are perfected by the gifted members Eph 4:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we are going to build up the Body, we must be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers have the ability to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then the saints are good for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The one Body is also built up with the mature believers as its constituents through their growth in the life of Christ unto maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is also built up by itself in love Eph 4:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Body is joined together through every joint of the rich supply the particular gifted members and knit together through the operation in measure of each one part, all the saints .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The joints are like the steel frame of a building, and the parts are like the material that fills in the gaps.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The built up Body will consummate in the New Jerusalem Rev 21 22 .</S>
