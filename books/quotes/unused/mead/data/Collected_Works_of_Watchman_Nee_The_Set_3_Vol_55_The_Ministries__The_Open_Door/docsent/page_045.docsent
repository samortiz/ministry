   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TO BE WEALTHY WITH RESERVE GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is a great grief to me that I frequently meet brothers and sisters who are so dependent on special grace that between the periodic help these experiences bring, their words and state of mind lapse into that of a non-Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What a poverty-stricken state this reveals!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once this kind of person lacks an incoming supply, he is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I readily acknowledge that we all would be utterly destitute if God's grace were removed from us; but it is also true that something of God's grace can be constituted into our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's reserve deposit in man is also a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some people live from hand to mouth, spending whatever comes in to meet their expenses of the moment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They cannot withstand trials.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What are trials?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Trials are times when it seems that God does not care for us, listen to us, or fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Madame Guyon understood trials best.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Spiritual trials are times when it seems that God has covered His face and shut His mouth, when it seems that He will not answer or make a sound, when it seems He is so quiet that there is no God in heaven at all.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These times of trial immediately separate those with reserves from those with none.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A poor person lives by the joy of prayer and sustains his living through the freshness of the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever he does not have these, he fails for the week because he cannot go on, and he stumbles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many people rely on special grace for their entire life and for all aspects of their living; they do not have reserves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some people, such as Madame Guyon, go through trials for months at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the trials the entire world may appear so confusing that it seems as if there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A person with inward reserves of grace will be manifested by such a time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He will pass the test.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He has something inside that is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This something is called wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the wealth that the Lord spoke of to the church in Laodicea Rev 3:18a .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In summary, poverty is a lack of reserves; wealth is having reserves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We mean, of course, spiritual reserves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>HOW TO HAVE A WEALTH OF RESERVES Time Is an Essential Factor</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How can we be inwardly wealthy with reserves?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a question of fundamental importance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Permit me to say a very straight word to the younger brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No matter who you are, none of you are really wealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps you think you have become rich.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But accumulating wealth requires time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who have spent time before God might have some riches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who have not spent time without a doubt are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is impossible for young people to be wealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Time is an important factor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Formerly we were of the opinion that some of the young people were ahead of the older ones in basic spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we recently touched some deeper matters in Foochow, we discovered that many of the finest young brothers were unable to grasp the most practical matters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I appeal to you young ones to check how much you have accumulated in spiritual reserves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am afraid you only have the tiniest of reserves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Being proud is sheerest folly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You must realize that a long course still lies before you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You must be constituted with and established by the Holy Spirit in this course day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Time is a matter of primary importance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No one can skip over this consideration.</S>
