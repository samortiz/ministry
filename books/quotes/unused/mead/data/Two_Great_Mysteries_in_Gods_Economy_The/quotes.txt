[1]  CONTENTS The Mysteries in the Bible The Economy of God The Human Spirit Four Aspects of Baptism Exercise Yourself Unto Godliness
[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Boston, Massachusetts during a conference on August 19 through 21, 1977.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE MYSTERIES IN THE BIBLE Scripture Reading: Eph 3:4-11; Col 2:2, 9
[4]  Without the heavenly vision in the spirit we may read through, study, and even research the Bible, yet still not see it.
[5]  In dispensing anything, you need a steward to take care of the dispensing.
[6]  This taking care of the dispensing is a stewardship, a kind of service.
[7]  When God is dispensing Himself into His chosen people, He uses the apostles.
[8]  We have covered these two points the mystery and the economy.
[9]  We have seen that this economy is to carry out the mystery.
[10]  It is so strange that on the first page of the Bible God is revealed as the Triune God.
[11]  When we come to the New Testament, the Gospel of John says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" 1:1 .
[12]  After His resurrection, on the mount at Galilee He told His disciples, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" Matt 28:19 .
[13]  After He took the two steps of incarnation and resurrection, He had the full position to tell His disciples to baptize people into this Triune God.
[14]  The very life-giving Spirit is the issue of the Son who is the embodiment of the Father.
[15]  Now we all can see that the Father in the Son becoming the Spirit has come into us, and we all have been put into the very Triune God.
[16]  Who can deny that this very God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is right now within us, and we are right now in Him?
[17]  CHAPTER THREE THE HUMAN SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gen 2:7; Zech 12:1; Job 32:8; Prov 20:27; 1 Thes 5:23; Heb 4:12; John 3:6b; 4:24; Rom 8:16; 1:9a; 2 Tim 4:22a; 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:4; Eph 3:5; 2:22; Rev 1:10; 21:10
[18]  The mystery of the universe is God, the mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church.
[19]  God's mystery is carried out by His economy, and His economy is just to dispense Himself into man.
[20]  In the Bible there are two spirits the divine Spirit and the human spirit.
[21]  John 3:6b says, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
[22]  Then in John 4:24, the Lord says, "God is Spirit the divine Spirit ; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit the human spirit ."
[23]  God is Spirit, and we have a spirit within us as an organ for us to worship God, contact God, commune with God, receive God, and contain God.
[24]  In Ephesians 5 there is a verse telling the wives to submit and a verse telling the husbands to love, but there is another verse v. 18 that says, "Be filled in spirit." Firstly, be filled in spirit with God.
[25]  If the wives are filled with God in their spirit, surely they can submit.
[26]  CHAPTER FOUR FOUR ASPECTS OF BAPTISM Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; Gal 3:27; 1 Cor 12:12-13; Eph 4:4; Rom 12:2-5, 11; Eph 4:23; 3:16-18
[27]  God's mystery is to have the church, and God's economy is to bring forth the church.
[28]  Both God's mystery and God's economy are just to have the church.
[29]  This verse does not say, "baptizing them into the Father, into the Son, and into the Holy Spirit," but rather, "baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[30]  In other words, Christ spoke this word in His resurrection.
[31]  As the resurrected One, the life-giving Spirit, He is the ultimate issue of the Triune God.
[32]  We have seen that God is triune the Father, the Son, and the Spirit not for doctrine but for dispensing.
[33]  To baptize new converts into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Spirit means that we put them into the reality of the Triune God, into the Person of the Triune God.
[34]  To baptize people into Christ is equal to baptizing people into the name of the Triune God because Christ is the reality of the Triune God.
[35]  First Corinthians 12:13 says, "In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body."
[36]  CHAPTER FIVE EXERCISE YOURSELF UNTO GODLINESS Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:3-7; 3:15-16; 4:6-8; 2 Tim 1:7; 4:22 A CLEAR VISION
[37]  The Bible is a book with many items, but within the many items there is a center, the kernel.
[38]  When we look into the whole Bible, it may be very hard to find the kernel if we stay with our mentality and do not exercise our spirit.
[39]  We also have the word economy in 1 Timothy 1:4.
[40]  There it says that some kinds of teachings stir up questions rather than God's economy, which is an economy to dispense God into His chosen people.
[41]  To teach differently does not mean to teach a wrong doctrine, or to teach heresies, but just to teach things different from what we have been taught concerning the economy of God.
[42]  This God is triune, dispensing Himself into our being that we may become members of the Body of Christ, which is the church; and we are tripartite, having a human spirit as a receiver to receive the Triune God.
[43]  The central lane is that the Triune God today is altogether the compound Spirit, that we have a regenerated spirit mingled with the divine Spirit, and that we can enjoy Him in our spirit as our everything to have a practical, present church life.
[44]  Paul goes on to tell us that we have to exercise ourselves unto godliness 1 Tim 4:7 .
[45]  This word exercise is a translation of the Greek word which means all kinds of exercise in the Olympic sphere.
[46]  In order to prove that this exercise is the exercise of our spirit, we have to go to 2 Timothy where Paul says that God has given us a spirit that is strong, loving, and sober; such a spirit is with a strong will, a loving emotion, and a sober mind 2 Tim 1:7 .
[47]  We have to exercise our spirit because the very mystery of godliness is right in our spirit, as 2 Timothy 4:22 tells us that the Lord is with our spirit.
