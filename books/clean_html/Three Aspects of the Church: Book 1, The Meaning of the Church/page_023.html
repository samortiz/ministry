<h2 class="head4">Passing through Resurrection</h2>
<p>If we take a rib out of the human body, the rib will surely die. Thus, when God took a rib from Adam&rsquo;s side, the rib must have passed through resurrection in order to become a living woman. After resurrection the dead bone became a living woman. Eve was produced in resurrection. First Peter 1:3 says, &ldquo;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.&rdquo; On the day Christ was resurrected, we also were resurrected. On the day of His resurrection, He caused the grain of wheat to become many grains and the only begotten Son of God to become the Firstborn among God&rsquo;s many sons. On the morning of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, He told Mary, &ldquo;Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God&rdquo; (John 20:17). On the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, His disciples became His brothers, and all those who believed into Him received His life. The producing of Eve was through the rib that God took from Adam&rsquo;s side, typifying that the church is produced through the three steps that Christ passed through&mdash;incarnation, death, and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Nature of the Church&mdash;Christ</h2>
<p>Just as the nature of Eve is Adam, so also the nature of the church is Christ. Eve was built from a part taken out of Adam&rsquo;s body. As a result, her nature was not only the same as that of Adam; she was Adam. Eve was not only the same as Adam; she was Adam. Before Adam fell into a deep sleep, he was alone, but when he woke up, Eve was there. When he awoke, Eve was alive. Both of them passed through resurrection. The word <em>woman</em> in Hebrew is <em>ishshah,</em> and the word for <em>man</em> is <em>ish.</em> In Hosea 2:16 God&rsquo;s people called Him <em>Ish.</em> In the New Testament, the Lord Jesus is called Christ, and the believers are called Christians. The two, Christ and the Christians, are not only similar; they are one and are out of the same source. Eve was Adam, and the church is Christ. Christ is the nature of the church, and the church is Christ Himself. Anything short of Christ is not the church. Whatever is not Christ is not the church. First Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&rdquo; In this verse the body refers to the church, but the following words, <em>so also is the Christ,</em> show that the church is Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Issue&mdash;<br />
Being Joined to Christ and<br />
Returning to Christ</h2>
<p>The issue of the church being produced is that the church is joined to Christ and will return to Christ. This is typified by Eve and Adam becoming one. Eve came out of Adam and returned to Adam. After Eve came out of Adam, she and Adam did not become two. In Genesis 2:23, regarding Eve, Adam said, &ldquo;This time this is bone of my bones / And flesh of my flesh.&rdquo; In verse 24 the two became one flesh. Eve came out of Adam, and she returned to Adam and became one with him. Ephesians 5:32 says, &ldquo;This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.&rdquo; We are bone of Christ&rsquo;s bone and flesh of His flesh. We came out of Him and are joined to Him. We are not only the same as He; we are one with Him and will return to Him in the future.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Rebekah&mdash;Typifying the Church<br />
Being Chosen from the World</h2>
<p>Rebekah typifies the church being chosen from the world (Gen. 24). After Eve, Rebekah is the second Old Testament type regarding the church. Sarah does not typify the church because Abraham is not a type of Christ. In his person, Abraham typifies God the Father, and in reference to doctrine, Abraham typifies justification by faith. Hence, Sarah typifies grace. In reference to Sarah as a type of grace, Galatians 4:26 says, &ldquo;The Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.&rdquo; The principal reason that Rebekah typifies the church is that her husband, Isaac, typifies Christ. In regard to person, Isaac typifies God the Son (the Son of God), and in regard to doctrine, Isaac typifies the inheritance in Christ.</p>
<p>Rebekah as a type of the church has an altogether different focus than Eve. As a type of the church, Eve depicts the producing of the church and the nature of the church. As a type of the church, Rebekah depicts the church being chosen out of the world. This type includes the choosing of the Father and the calling and leading of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit led Rebekah step by step through a long journey to Isaac. Hence, this picture of Rebekah being a type of the church depicts how the church was chosen out of the world and brought all the way into the heavenly tabernacle to enjoy Christ&rsquo;s love and to satisfy Him.</p>
