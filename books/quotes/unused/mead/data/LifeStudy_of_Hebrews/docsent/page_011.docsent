   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is in resurrection that Christ is declared to be the Son of God who is superior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Resurrection means a new beginning; it denotes germination.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 3 refers to His death by saying, having made purification of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 5 indicates His resurrection by which He was begotten to be the Firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33 as a beginning of a new age, the age of the church which is composed of His many brothers born of God through His resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>IN ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hebrews 1 also speaks of Christ s ascension, which follows His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 13 says, But to which of the angels has He said at any time, Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This clearly refers to the ascension.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is no longer in the tomb or on the earth; He is at the right hand of the Majesty on high 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is His ascension in which He was inaugurated into His office to carry out God s eternal purpose, that is, to build up the church and to bring His many brothers into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IN THE SECOND COMING</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ, after being seated on the throne in His ascension, is waiting for His enemies to be subdued as His footstool.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How do we know that this verse refers to the second coming?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because it speaks of Christ as the Firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In His first coming, He was God s only begotten Son John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through the process of resurrection, the only begotten Son became the firstborn among many brothers Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By this mention of the Firstborn we know that this verse refers to His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In His second coming He will be the Firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When God brought Him to earth the first time, He was the only begotten Son, but when God brings Him to the inhabited earth the second time, He will be the Firstborn.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 8 says, But as to the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here the Son is addressed, O God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a strong proof that the Son is God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Surely God is superior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This verse also indicates that the throne of the Son is the everlasting throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, His kingdom must also be the kingdom of God.</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This refers to His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They shall perish, but You remain; and they all shall become old as a garment v. 11 . This means that the old creation will be terminated and that the new heaven and new earth will be ushered in. But You are the same, and Your years shall not fail v. 12 . This means that He will be the everlasting One in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As the Creator and the everlasting One He is superior to the angels, His creatures.</S>
