<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE REGENERATED SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS BECOMES THE ORGAN FOR THEM TO WORSHIP, SERVE, RECEIVE, POSSESS, EXPERIENCE, AND ENJOY GOD</H2><P>The regenerated spirit of the believers not only becomes the dwelling of God but also becomes the organ for them to worship, serve, receive, possess, experience, and enjoy God (John 4:24; Rom. 1:9; 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22). This is like the receiver within a wireless radio that enables the radio to receive the radio waves. Our regenerated spirit within us is the organ for us to receive God that we may contact Him, worship Him, serve Him, and even possess Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE REGENERATED SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS<br>IS ALSO THE ORGAN FOR THEM TO RECEIVE<br>GOD'S WISDOM, REVELATION, AND VISION</H2><P>The regenerated spirit of the believers is also the organ for the believers to receive God's wisdom, revelation, and vision (Eph. 1:17; 3:5; Rev. 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10). The genuine wisdom comes from God. Our regenerated spirit enables us to receive the wisdom that comes from God. Not only so, this wisdom enables us to understand God's revelation. As soon as God comes into our spirit, we receive revelation. This revelation causes us to see something, and what we see becomes a vision. All these are matters that occur in our regenerated spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE REGENERATED SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS SPREADS INTO THEIR MIND TO BECOME<br>THE RENEWING SPIRIT IN THEIR MIND</H2><P>The regenerated spirit also spreads into the mind of the believers to become the renewing spirit in the believers' mind so that their entire being can be renewed (Eph. 4:23). A person is controlled by his mind. Whatever a person thinks, he will do. Before we were saved, what we had were old thinking and old thoughts. Now, after being saved, we have a regenerated new spirit. However, this is not enough. We still need a new mind. When the regenerated spirit of the believers spreads into their mind, the mind of the believers becomes a renewed mind. Hence, the regenerated spirit of the believers becomes the renewing spirit in their mind that their entire being may be renewed.</P><P>Before we were saved, we had our particular lifestyle. For example, a mother admonishes her daughter from her youth concerning how to dress herself properly. However, as the daughter grows up, she has her own ideas and dresses in a strange way. The mother admonishes her, but she does not listen. One day this daughter hears the gospel and is saved. Eventually, her mind is renewed. She no longer dresses herself in that worldly way. This is what is spoken of in Ephesians 4:23 concerning a believer after he is saved: his regenerated spirit spreads into his mind to become the renewing spirit in his mind. This causes his mind to be transformed and renewed. Thus he will no longer be the same.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE REGENERATED SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS<br>IS BEING FILLED WITH GOD</H2><P>The regenerated spirit of the believers also needs to be filled with God (Eph. 5:18). Paul said that we should not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but should be filled in spirit. To be drunk with wine is to have our body saturated with wine. We, the believers, need to be filled with God and saturated with God in our spirit. All the experienced ones know that every day when we spend some time, eight or ten minutes, remaining before God to contact Him and allow Him to saturate and soak us within, it is as if the spirit within us takes a shower in the Spirit of God. This causes us to be filled with God. Eventually, both within and without, we will be God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. THE REGENERATED SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS<br>AND THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT OF GOD<br>ARE MINGLED AS ONE SPIRIT</H2><P>Finally, the regenerated spirit of the believers and the consummated Spirit of God are mingled as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Thus, the Spirit of God is no longer like a single hand that cannot produce clapping sounds; rather, the two spirits can "clap" together. Today, the Spirit of God and the human spirit are mingled as one within us so that we can live a God-man life, a life that is God yet man and man yet God. Hence, the God-man life is a living of the two spirits, the Spirit of God and the spirit of man joined and mingled together as one.</P>
