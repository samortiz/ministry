   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>JOURNEYING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we speak about the children of Israel, it is easy to have a poor impression of them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we recall how they worshipped the golden calf in the wilderness, we will think of them as pitiful indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, everything in the universe has two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For instance, we have both day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, in every home there is a living room and a place to keep the refuse, the trash.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Bible we can find both positive and negative things, depending on where we look.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, Abraham, who was so good, had a concubine and was not as wonderful as we think he was.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But we should not look upon the negative things so much as on the positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is especially true as we come to the history of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For a period of forty years the children of Israel journeyed in the presence of the Lord Exo 13:21-22; Num 14:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They had the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Israelites did not journey according to their opinion, but simply followed the movement of the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually, there were not two pillars, but just one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the day the pillar was like a cloud and in the night it was like a fire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the day God shaded the people, protecting them from the bright sunlight.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the night he gave them light to illuminate their way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This pillar was God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, during the forty years in the wilderness the children of Israel enjoyed the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They also ate manna, the heavenly food, day after day, meaning they enjoyed God as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, even in the wilderness we see the line of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although we may have a negative concept about the children of Israel in the wilderness, they nevertheless experienced the tree of life, enjoying God day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Would it not be wonderful to experience such a pillar of cloud and pillar of fire and heavenly manna in Orange County today?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, our portion is much better.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have the Holy Spirit as the pillar of cloud and the Bible as the pillar of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We also have the Lord Jesus as our heavenly manna.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we journey through the wilderness of Orange County, the Lord is present with us, and we enjoy Him as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>X. JOSHUA LIVING AND WORKING</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When God called Joshua, He encouraged him, assuring him that He would be with him as He was with Moses Josh 1:5-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord told Joshua to be strong and courageous, for the Lord would be with him wherever he went.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Joshua was a person who enjoyed God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as we enjoy God's presence, we can be a Joshua today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is not far from us; He is with us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, we, like Joshua, can live, walk, and work in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>GIDEON FIGHTING</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Gideon's outstanding characteristic was that he fought the battle in the presence of God Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>6:12, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He not only lived, walked, and worked in the presence of the Lord, but fought with the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all must be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In one sense our daily walk is a walk, in another sense it is a work, and in still another sense it is a warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whether we walk, work, or fight, we must be in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be in the presence of the Lord simply means to have the enjoyment of the Lord as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Gideon enjoyed God as the tree of life.</S>
