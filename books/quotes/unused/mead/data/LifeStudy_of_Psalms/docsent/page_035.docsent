   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE FIVE DAVID'S CONCEPTS CONCERNING A GODLY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN COMPARISON WITH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>HIS INSPIRED PRAISE OF THE EXCELLENCY OF CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: Psa 8</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we come to Psalm 8.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The more we read this psalm, the more we have to admit that it is altogether heavenly language.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No mere human word could express the divine concept in this psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The heavenly language in it must come from the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the previous message, we saw David's concepts concerning a godly life in Psalms 3 7.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this message we want to see his inspired praise of the excellency of Christ in Psalm 8.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we read Psalms 3 7 with much prayer, we can realize that they all are on the same level and in the same category.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They describe many bad things, showing that the earth is a messy earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when we read Psalm 8, we feel that we are not on this messy earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we come to Psalm 8, the tone changes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I would like to read this psalm so that we can consider it verse by verse.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 1 David said, "O Jehovah our Lord,/ How excellent is Your name/In all the earth,/You who have set Your splendor above the heavens!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This one verse covers both the earth and the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Psalms 3 7 the earth is a mess, but in Psalm 8 there is something excellent on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This excellent item is the excellent name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is not here today physically, but His name is here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This earth today is nothing but a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But, thank the Lord, at least on this earth there is something excellent the name of Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His name is the exalted name, the glorified name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 1 mentions both the earth and the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to realize that this psalm tries the best to link the earth to the heavens and to bring down the heavens to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 1 we can see this linking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jehovah's name is excellent in all the earth, and He has set His splendor above the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, the heavens are the source of the excellency.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The excellency does not initiate from the earth, but from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 2 says, "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings/ You have established strength/Because of Your adversaries,/ To stop the enemy and the avenger."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This verse shows us three negative categories of persons: the adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Above the heavens is God's splendor, and on the earth Jesus' name is excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in this universe, there are still many adversaries, enemies, and avengers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Adversaries are those who are within, enemies are those who are without, and the avengers are those who run back and forth cf.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Job 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Satan can be signified by these three categories.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, Satan was within God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then Satan became an enemy without, outside the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is also the avenger, running back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Above the heavens there is splendor, and on the earth there is the excellent name.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in between the heavens and the earth, there are the adversaries within, the enemy without, and the avenger running back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What would God do about this?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God does something in a consummate way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He establishes His praises out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, the youngest, smallest, and weakest ones.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Babes are a little stronger than sucklings, and sucklings are somewhat smaller than the babes, but both of them are in the category of the smallest and weakest.</S>
