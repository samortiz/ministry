   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SALVATION OF CHRIST Man's Indwelling Sin</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many people have asked, "I know that it is a great thing for Christ to die for me, and I know that by accepting His death I receive forgiveness of my past sins; but what shall I do with the power of sin that still entangles me and that is driving me to sin continually?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Throughout history man has struggled with this ancient problem of the inward lust and nature of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, man wants to do good, but on the other hand, he finds a powerful force within him that will not allow him to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Modern psychology and psychiatry have observed this contradiction within man but have been unable to explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The ancient Chinese called this the battle between reason and lust.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Two thousand years ago Paul the apostle had the same problem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He complained that every time he wanted to do good, the evil was present with him, and he acknowledged that it was not he who was committing the sins, but an evil force, power, or urge within him was committing the sins Rom 7:15, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, later he found out that the saving life of Jesus Christ was able to save him from the power of this inward nature of sin Rom 7:25; 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ's Salvation by His Life</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has not left anything undone that we must do.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just as He has accomplished redemption for us through judging Jesus Christ on the cross, in the same way He has prepared a wonderful salvation for us by giving to us the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no need for us to die to redeem ourselves from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the same way, there is no need for us to live by our own life to overcome the sinful nature and the power of sin within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ has died for mankind to redeem man from the judgment of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After He died, He resurrected on the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In resurrection He gives His life to man so that through His life man can be delivered from the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A Christian is not only one who is redeemed from the judgment of sin, but also one who is saved from the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Romans 5:10 says, "For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the cross Christ bore the curse of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In His resurrection He broke the chain of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By His redemption mankind is free from the judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By His life man is free from the bondage of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Peter 2:24 says that Christ "Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Just as redemption is accomplished by Christ's death alone, so salvation from man's inherent nature of sin is accomplished by His life within us alone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is nothing that man needs to do to be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the same way, there is nothing that man needs to do to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everything is done by God, and salvation is free.</S>
