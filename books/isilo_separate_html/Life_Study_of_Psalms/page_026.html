A Warning to the World</H2><P>Psalm 2 also gives a warning to the world (vv. 10-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God and His Christ Being in Wrath to the World</H2><P>First, God and His Christ will be in wrath to the world (v. 12b; Rev. 6:15-17). Men should not think that there is no God in this universe or that Christ is just a name in religion. The Bible tells us clearly that Christ is waiting for the opportunity to come to execute His judgment in His anger, in His wrath.</P><P>The book of Joel speaks of this judgment. The subject of Joel is the day of the Lord (1:15; 2:11, 31; 3:14), but few Christians understand what the day of the Lord is. Paul gave us the definition in 1 Corinthians 4:3-5. In verse 3 he said, "It is a very small thing that I should be examined by you or by man's day." Before the Lord comes, it is man's day, in which man judges. Today is man's day. In man's day, everything is judged by man. But after man's day, there will be a day which will be called the day of the Lord. This day will last about one thousand three and a half years. The day on which the great tribulation begins will be the beginning of the day of the Lord. From that day, the Lord's wrath will be expressed. The day of the Lord is the day of His judgment.</P><P>It may seem today that the Lord does not care for the world situation. If people want to settle their problems, they have to go to the police station. Then the police station will transfer them to the law court, where they will be judged and ruled according to the law of man. When people have disputes and grievances today, they do not go to Christ. But when the great tribulation begins, that will be the beginning of the day of the Lord. Christ will come to interfere with the world situation.</P><P>Joel reveals that after the three and a half years of the great tribulation, the Lord will judge the living Gentiles (3:12). Matthew 25 tells us that He will separate them, the sheep from the goats, in His judgment (vv. 32-46). Afterward, He will set up the thousand-year kingdom. In the thousand-year kingdom, He will judge, rule, and control the entire earth. At the end of that thousand years, there will be a rebellion, which He will also judge (Rev. 20:8-9). Then He will have the final judgment on the great white throne to judge the dead unbelievers (vv. 11-15). That will be the end of the day of the Lord. Thus, the day of the Lord will last one thousand three and a half years. After this day, the heavens and the earth will be burned to become the new heavens and new earth. Then the New Jerusalem will come in, and righteousness will fill the new heavens and new earth (2 Pet. 3:13). Everything will be right. There will be no more need for any kind of judgment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Repent</H2><P>Since God and His Christ will be in wrath to the world, man must repent (Psa. 2:11; Acts 17:30). This is the New Testament gospel.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> </body></html>
