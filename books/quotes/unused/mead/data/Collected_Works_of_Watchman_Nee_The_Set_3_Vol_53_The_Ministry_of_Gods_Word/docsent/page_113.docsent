   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In previous discussions we have seen the responsibility of the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must also see that, in addition to the qualifications of the ministers, there is the condition of the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If a man is in a condition that blocks God's blessing, his presence will bring the speaking down.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It does not matter how strong the minister is; his speaking will be brought down.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even if the minister is very powerful before God, and even if he wants to impart revelation to others, his ministry of the word will be void of revelation in the presence of such wise and intelligent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At best it will contain little revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are not altogether clear how the audience affects the speaking, but it is a fact that the audience does affect the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some people are never subdued by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The intelligent ones are never subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the presence of such ones, the speaking rarely can be high.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In learning to be a minister of the word, we have to remember that sometimes the problem is with us; the word is withheld in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But there are times when the problem is not with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have dealt with all the hindrances, but the revelation, the spirit, and the word are still not released.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During these times, the problem may be with the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a man first learns to be a minister of the word, he does not have much revelation and light, and any hindrance probably is not related to the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when a man has considerable experience in speaking, and he is called upon to release some strong and potent revelations, a mere brush with one or two unworthy or proud persons is enough to block off his delicate feelings; his words will not be released, no matter how hard he tries.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The feeling of the spirit is very tender.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One characteristic of the word is that it must be directed toward men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word has to go out, the spirit has to go out, and the Holy Spirit has to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when there is a person who thinks highly of himself or who is a critical bystander, the speaker cannot release the word in a pure way even if he has the word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes we have to lead a brother into God's light to know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At other times we have to lead another brother to the Lord to acknowledge the glory of the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should remember that in God's light there is pure revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no doctrine or teaching; there is pure revelation, nothing but revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a time of pure shining and pure breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If three or five brothers are just spectators trying to find out what is going on, having closed spirits, and feeling no need to touch or receive God's word or to prostrate themselves before Him, the word will be frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It will be so frustrated that it will be bound completely.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more spiritual the things we try to impart to others are, the easier it is for our speaking to be affected by men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The less spiritual the things we have to give to others are, the less likely our speaking will be affected.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The one thing that threatens the ministry of the word is an air of being wise and intelligent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord will never bless the wise and intelligent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is most foolish to think of oneself as wise and intelligent.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord said in the last part of Matthew 11:25, " You have revealed them to infants."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The gentler the audience is, the stronger the word will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more humble the audience is, the easier it is for the word to bring someone to his knees.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more willing the audience is to receive the word, and the more obedience we find, the more light will shine through the listeners and open them to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The harder it is for a person to receive help, the harder it is to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The easier it is for a person to receive help, the easier it is to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a basic spiritual principle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is difficult for many people to receive help.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They have resistance to the word, to the thoughts presented, and to the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a consequence, it is hard for them to receive God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is hard to penetrate all their criticism to reach their inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the word suffers so much criticism, it is screened out and blocked.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more childlike a person is, the more he is ready to receive help from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The gentler he is, the less prejudice he has before God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more he opens his heart to the Lord, the more his spirit is open to the Lord as well.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God gives such ones a powerful supply of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He gives them great revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God resists the stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the reason we have to be seeking, humble, simple, and gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the meaning of being an infant.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more we become like an infant, the more grace we receive from God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more arrogant and stubborn we are, the less grace we receive from Him, because God destroys the wisdom of the wise and sets aside the understanding of those who understand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord has to bring us to the point of acknowledging the futility of our wisdom and understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If God leads us on for another three or five years and grants us mercy, we will look back and realize how much our own wisdom actually killed us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There will be times when we would have received grace, yet our own wisdom stopped us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many people have not realized how their own wisdom has harmed them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the Lord grants them mercy, they will see how much harm their wisdom has done to them.</S>
