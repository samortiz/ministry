	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
SERVING ONES AND THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>As serving ones, we have a relationship with our community and a relationship with the church. Before we were saved, it was impossible for us to stay away from our community. Now that we are saved and want to serve the Lord, not only is it impossible for us to stay away from our community, but even more we cannot stay away from the church.</p>
<p>Both the community and the church are groups. The community is a group of people, but the church is God&rsquo;s flock. The daily affairs in the community and in the church are related to people. Therefore, a serving one is intimately related to people. Saints who are beginning to serve the Lord should study the books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus (see <em>The Proper Aggressiveness of the Lord&rsquo;s Serving Ones,</em> ch. 1), because these three Epistles speak of the standard of a serving one and the relationships of a serving one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT SPEAKING THINGS THAT ARE CONTRARY<br />
TO GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;I exhorted you...to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things...rather than God&rsquo;s economy.&rdquo; In these verses the apostle&rsquo;s charge is related to not teaching things that are different from God&rsquo;s economy in the environment of the church. To teach different things rather than God&rsquo;s economy is to teach myths, unending genealogies (v. 4), and the law (vv. 7-8). Such teachings involve vain talk and differ from the apostles&rsquo; teaching, which is centered on Christ and the church, that is, on the economy of God. According to Acts 2:41-42, three thousand new believers &ldquo;continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles.&rdquo; At that time the apostles spoke God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Hence, to speak differently from the speaking of the apostles, in contradiction to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, is to teach different things.</p>
<p>If we desire to serve the Lord, we must be in an environment where there is no different teaching, that is, where there is no speaking in contradiction to God&rsquo;s economy. This means that we should not teach different things. An environment where someone is speaking things that are different from God&rsquo;s economy is not healthy. In order to live a long life, we must live in an environment where the air is fresh. We should try our best not to live in a place where the air is polluted. Similarly, a Christian needs to live in a clean environment so that he can grow and have a healthy spiritual life. In 1957 and 1958 the air in the churches in Taiwan was contaminated by different teachings, and as a result, many saints were damaged.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING CONCERNING HOW TO GO OUT AND COME IN BEFORE GOD&rsquo;S PEOPLE</h2>
<p>We must always pray. In particular, the young saints should spend much time in prayer every day. Like Solomon, we should pray, &ldquo;Jehovah God,...give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people&rdquo; (2 Chron. 1:9-10). God&rsquo;s people are numerous; hence, we must always pray and ask the Lord to give us wisdom and knowledge so that we may know how to go out and come in before His people, that is, how to conduct ourselves among them.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;These things I write to you...that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God&rdquo; (1 Tim. 3:14-15). Paul also reminded Timothy how to conduct himself with elderly men and elderly women and how to contact younger women in all purity (5:1-2). In 2 Timothy 2:22 Paul says that we should &ldquo;flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&rdquo; To pursue spiritual virtues with those of a pure heart is also an important matter in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO<br />
WHERE WE LIVE AND HOW WE LIVE</h2>
<p>There are four matters that we need to pay particular attention to. First, we must be careful concerning how we live. With regard to single saints, the way they live greatly affects their service to the Lord. The Chinese say that &ldquo;one who stays near vermillion will be stained red, and one who stays near ink will be stained black.&rdquo; If those who live with you are &ldquo;black,&rdquo; eventually, even if you are &ldquo;white,&rdquo; you will become &ldquo;black&rdquo; because you are in close contact with them. We become the same as those whom we regularly contact. We are influenced by our environment.</p>
<p>Married saints should also be careful concerning where they live. Every aspect of modern society is contaminated; hence, we should never randomly choose a place to live. Rather, we should always pay attention to where we live and how we live. Our negligence in this matter will give rise to many problems, some of which may even affect our married life, our family life, and our service to the Lord.</p>
