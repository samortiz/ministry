   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. MAN BEING CREATED BY GOD IN THREE PARTS A. A Body Made of Dust as Man s Outward Shell,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Framework of Man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man was created by God in three parts Gen 1:26; 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man s body made of dust is his outward shell, his framework Gen 2:7a .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Medical doctors tell us that the study of the human body is endless.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>B. A Spirit Produced of the Breath of the Life</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>of God Breathed into the Nostrils of Man</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, man was created with a spirit, not made but produced of the breath of the life of God breathed into the nostrils of man Gen 2:7b; Prov 20:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not the life of God but only the breath of the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is proven by Proverbs 20:27, which says, The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah lit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>. The word spirit here is the same Hebrew word for breath in Genesis 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the breath of life breathed into man in Genesis 2:7 became man s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>C. A Soul, the Issue of the Combination</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>of the Breath of God with the Body of Dust</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man s body was formed of the dust of the ground; then God breathed into man s nostrils the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Outwardly, man has a body of dust, and inwardly, his spirit was produced of the breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When these two were put together, the soul was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The soul was the issue of the combination of the breath of God with the body of dust Gen 2:7c .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The soul is neither dusty nor spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Greek word for soul is psuche, from which comes the word psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our soul is the psychological part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE FUNCTIONS OF THE THREE PARTS OF MAN A. The Spirit of Man Being the Innermost Part</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>of Man as the Reality of Man</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The spirit of man is the innermost part of man as the reality of man, highly ranked with the heavens and the earth in God s creation Zech 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you do not live by the spirit, but live by the soul or by the body, you are not a real man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man s reality is his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man s spirit is the inner organ of man for him to contact God, to receive God, and to contain God for God s expression in man John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To do anything, we need the proper organ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To see, we need eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To smell, we need a nose.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also have a particular organ to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That organ is our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we deny our mind and turn to our inner being, we can sense God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if we remain in our mind and try to figure out where God is, we will not be able to sense Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is God, but we must use the proper organ to sense Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The spirit of man is not only for contacting and receiving God but also for containing God that God may be expressed through man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The spirit of man is the lamp of God to contact, receive, and contain God as the light for God to shine through man Prov 20:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A lamp needs oil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then it gives light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The lamp itself has no light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The light comes from the oil burning in the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The oil is God the Spirit, and our spirit is a lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God the Spirit is the oil that burns into light to shine within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>B. The Soul of Man Being the Inner Part of Man</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>as the Person of Man</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The soul of man is the inner part of man as the person of man in between man s spirit and man s body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The soul was meant to be under man s spirit as its subordinate to carry out the desires and purposes of the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, the soul was meant to be above man s body as its master to direct the move and activity of the body of man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, according to the order of God s creation, the spirit is the boss, whereas the soul is the body s direct boss.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The body should be the servant.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The soul as a person has two organs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The inner organ is the spirit; the outer organ is the body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet the spirit is the boss of the soul.</S>
