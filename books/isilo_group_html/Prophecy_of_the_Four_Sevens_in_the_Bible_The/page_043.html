The sea is the Mediterranean Sea, out of which Antichrist will come. In Revelation 9:11, 11:7, and 17:8, we are told that Antichrist will come up out of the abyss. This indicates that the sea is the mouth of the abyss, because the abyss is in the heart of the earth (Rom. 10:7; Matt. 12:40), and the sea is above the earth. Antichrist will be a very demonic, devilish, and extraordinary person. His spirit, which has been existing in the abyss before he is born, will come up out of the abyss (see notes 81, 101, and 111 in Revelation 17,  Recovery Version). His body will come from one of the Gentile nations around the Mediterranean Sea. In the biblical figure the land signifies the nation of Israel, and the sea signifies the Gentile nations (Rev. 17:15).</P><P>The false prophet, as another beast coming up out of the earth, will work with Antichrist and seduce the people on the earth to worship Antichrist and his image; and whoever will not worship will be killed (Rev. 13:11-18). This beast will come "up out of the earth." Since the earth, the land, signifies the nation of Israel, this "another beast," the false prophet, will come out of the Jews. He may be Judas Iscariot (John 6:70-71), because after he died he went to "his own place" (Acts 1:25), not to "his people" as others did (Gen. 25:17; 35:29).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Another Angel Flying in Mid-heaven and<br>Announcing to the Peoples on the Earth<br>the Eternal Gospel</H2><P>Another angel will fly in mid-heaven and announce to the peoples on the earth the eternal gospel: that they should fear God, give Him glory, and worship Him as the Creator of the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters. At the judgment of Christ at His throne of glory, the peoples who receive this eternal gospel will be considered as "sheep" and will enter into the millennial kingdom to be the citizens, and those who do not receive this gospel will be considered as "goats" and will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 14:6-7; Matt. 25:31-46.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5.
