In Numbers 11 Moses felt that the responsibility on him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt into Canaan was too heavy
The original text says that they were all prophets , but the Chinese Union Version of the Bible did not dare to translate it this way
Meanwhile, the Spirit also rested upon the two who remained in their own tents, and they prophesied in the camp
Suppose your grandparents live in the countryside where there is no church, and you thus preach the gospel to them and they are saved
Suppose you bring a few brothers with you and go to them and baptize them, and you tell the two of them to begin to meet there
We have already seen that God desires all men to come to the full knowledge of the truth ; this is God's heart's desire
We fail God according to His creation because we continually speak senselessly, criticizing, lying, and spreading rumors
The Bible says that 'every idle word which men shall speak, they shall render account concerning it in the day of judgment'
Brothers and sisters, let us use the time we waste in telephone conversations to call someone we know and preach the gospel to him

Because most people today are somewhat philosophical in their thinking, they do not like to listen to such things
Each one loves the Lord, each one loves the Word of the Lord, and each one is willing to labor in order to study the Word
In your study you may read a book of the Bible such as the Gospel of Matthew, or you may read about a topic such as justification by faith
Someone must decide what material to cover in the six years of elementary school and what to cover in junior high
There is no lack of material among us, but we must still write textbooks, yet we must not write them in a general way
Those among us who had been saved for fifty-eight years and those who had been saved for only eighteen days all ate from the same pot
We even boasted about this, but after eating in this way, the old ones departed and the young ones did not grow
We have all the materials, but we still need to put out instructional materials, that is, to put out textbooks
The Life-studies and the other publications are library books; we may use them as references, and the students may also read them
In my observation, having enough 'students' is not a problem to us, but where and how to educate them constitutes a big problem
In the Bible, there are only a few places which speak of the meetings and of how the saints met in the New Testament
It is right to say that they met in small groups from house to house , but the spiritual revelation did not continue from that point
Whether you were saved long ago or are newly saved, you brothers and sisters must labor on the word of the Lord
In this modern age we all must learn English, for without learning English it is very difficult to do anything
In the same way, we all must learn the word of the Lord, for without learning the word of the Lord the church has no way to go on
Regardless of how we divide into levels or what lessons are used for instruction, we all must learn to speak the word of the Lord
You must first spend six years of study in order to have the elementary school education gradually deposited into you
You may speak like this for a long time, yet you are still only 'introducing the ball'; you have not yet 'played the ball'
We have seriously considered this situation and we have decided to use the materials in our publications to put out textbooks level by level
When you speak to someone you must know what type of person he is, on what level he is, and what kind of word he needs
When you have a clear knowledge of the truths and have stored them within you, at the proper time you can present them
Sometimes you may not know how to present them; at those times you may bring with you the Recovery Version and also one or two Life-studies
If your father is a Christian and does not yet agree to your taking the way of the recovery, do not argue with him
In Acts 6:4 the twelve Apostles said, 'But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word'
Whenever you feel that you have touched the world and have been defiled by the world, you must be cleansed in a good way
Whenever you feel that the Lord has a demand upon you and you have not responded adequately, you must also deal with it
From the incarnation to the ascension and the pouring out of the Holy Spirit, the Lord Jesus accomplished seven great matters
On the day of resurrection He returned to the disciples and breathed the Spirit of resurrection into them to be their life and essence

In the United States there are many sisters who have taken the way of the recovery and have been opposed by their husbands
We still have advanced because the recovery of the Lord is a recovery of life and truth, and no one can stop this
The several thousand from Jerusalem who were scattered abroad through persecution preached the word of God everywhere
We have already mentioned that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, or the filling of the Holy Spirit, is a matter accomplished by the Lord
We have believed in the Lord, and we all have faith; therefore, we need to enjoy these seven great accomplishments of the Lord
You have the Spirit of life, the essential Spirit, within you and the Spirit of power, the economical Spirit, upon you
The good word and the word of righteousness are the fourth pair, and the word of knowledge and the word of wisdom are the final pair
At the same time, when this God is realized by us, He is reality, which is the proper meaning of the word 'truth'
The Greek word translated 'bringing the good news' is a form of the verb euaggelizo, which carries the connotation of preaching the gospel
The word in Acts 5:42 may be rendered 'preaching the gospel,' indicating that the gospel is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself
You must also dig out the word of the gospel, which is the word concerning the Lord Jesus, and also the word of life
No one would say that a house is healthy, for a house does not have life and therefore has nothing to do with health
For the believers to receive the different teachings would be like their eating stones or lumps of coal; these things are not nutritious
To be a good minister, first you yourself must eat nutritious and healthy food, and second, you must supply others with what you have eaten
Sometimes we talk at length with people, and we even quote verses from the Bible, but these things may all be husks
Sometimes we do not need to talk so much; simply to give people an 'egg' or a 'glass of milk' would be good enough
In this book Paul advised the Hebrew believers not to remain in the good word but to go forward to the word of righteousness
The words written by Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter one are somewhat general; thus they are the word of knowledge
They speak in a general way about the Lord Jesus' dying for us, His accomplishing redemption for us, and His relationship with us
God's wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory'
In 1 Corinthians, from chapters three through ten what is spoken are words of wisdom; it is deep and mysterious
In this message we will consider in more detail two categories of the word of God, the good word and the word of righteousness
Hebrews 6:1 says, 'Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us be brought on to maturity'
It says that we are fallen and sinful, but that God loves us, causing Him to send His Son, who became flesh for us, to be our Savior
He lived on earth for more than thirty years and finally went to the cross to die for us, solving the problem of our sins
Remember that Hebrews chapter six clearly states that these works of power are not of this age but of the coming age
He became flesh, passed through the human life on earth, was nailed to the cross, and died for us, accomplishing redemption
Even the resurrection from the dead occurred on the earth; therefore, it is part of the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus
With this background Paul wrote this Epistle in order to tell the Hebrew believers The good word which you have tasted is only the beginning
If you go back to the things of Judaism after you have believed in the Lord and have tasted the good word of God, you are going backward
You have already entered elementary school and have graduated from it; why are you going back to kindergarten?
After we have been saved, we should not stop there; even the more we should not go backward by going back to Judaism
If we are willing to go on in this way, receiving the heavenly ministry of Christ, we will certainly reach maturity
If we do not reach maturity however we need to realize that our God is a consuming fire and that we may be burned by His righteous judgment
After we are saved, we need to go on as 6:1 says: 'Leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us be brought on to maturity'
He ascended to the heavens to be the better Minister to serve us in the better tabernacle in the heavens supplying us with His heavenly life
When He comes back, we will either receive the reward and enter into the kingdom, or we will suffer punishment
He was resurrected from among the dead, becoming the firstborn Son of God, and will return with the status of the firstborn Son
In this new covenant our sins are truly forgiven, and we have also received the divine life and the law of life
In chapter ten, the author of Hebrews encourages us to enter into the Holy of Holies, because a new and living way has been opened for us
Chapter twelve tells us that since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, we should take the way of faith as they did
Today some Christians hope to go to heaven, but Paul tells us that we have come to Mount Zion, to the holy city, New Jerusalem
They generally quote some verses from the book of Hebrews such as 138 which says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever
The first 'becoming' is 'the Word became flesh' , and the second 'becoming' is 'the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'
The Bible does not say that He is the same eternally, but that He is the same 'yesterday, and today, and forever'
After thirty-three and a half years, He was nailed to the cross and suffered death, was buried, and was resurrected on the third day
Since resurrection is yesterday ascension is today and the future is forever it is true that He is the same yesterday today and forever
He has undergone two great changes since eternity past-His incarnation and His resurrection-and both changes have been accomplished
The lights and electrical appliances in a building depend on the supply of the electrical current from the power plant
He prayed to the Lord three times to remove this thorn from him, but the Lord said, 'My grace is sufficient for you'
He told Timothy, 'No longer drink water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent weaknesses'
John 22325 says that many in Jerusalem saw the miracles that Jesus did and believed in His name but the Lord did not entrust Himself to them
Praise the Lord, the word of righteousness will decide whether we will share the glory with Him in His kingdom
Because the book of Hebrews speaks these words of righteousness in every section, it issues serious warnings according to these words
The first two chapters tell us that Christ is the complete God and a perfect man, far superior to the angels, becoming our great salvation
Based on this word, the first warning, in 2:3, says, 'How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation'?
The seventh point under 'Everyone Speaking the Word of God' is 'Approaching People, Helping People, and Knowing People'
Upon seeing people on the street, you should not just shout from afar, 'Come, it is good to believe in Jesus'!
The gospel preaching of Philip in Acts 8 is a very good example of following the leading of the Spirit to approach people
Philip then ran to the eunuch and heard him reading the fiftythird chapter of Isaiah and asked him Do you really know what you are reading
Suppose that when the Holy Spirit was leading him, asking him to approach the eunuch, Philip did not have the understanding of the Bible
He would have heard the eunuch reading the Scriptures, and he would have asked, 'Do you really know what you are reading'?
The word should dwell in us to such an extent that we understand Isaiah 53, John 4, Genesis 1, and every chapter of the Bible
When you talk to a person, after looking at him you should have some understanding of his character and his mood
By looking at him, you will know that he has something that makes him sorrowful, or something that makes him happy
We need to be familiar with the Bible, to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly in all wisdom, so that we can give people a proper word
Whatever we do, our conscience in our innate nature is always weighing our actions, either condemning or justifying them
When we talk to people about the Bible, we also need many 'instruments,' and we need to know what their functions are
You need to approach people, help people, and know people, and to deal with each kind of person with a certain kind of word
Because they lack enlightenment, they have fallen into darkness, thinking that they already know the truth but not actually understanding it
Today the Lord has opened His Word not for us only, but for all the Christians, even for the people of the whole world
Paul asked the believers to pray 'that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ'
Although Peter was put into prison, God released him from that prison, and as a result 'the word of God grew and multiplied'
Although today we have the Life-study Messages, when we speak for the Lord it is difficult for us to give an adequate presentation
On the Lord's Day we will gather together those who have been saved this year and last year, and teach them the lessons in the first level
Those who regularly attend the meetings number less than four thousand, which, roughly speaking, is one third of the total
After having two children they do not have any more so as to not invite more trouble for themselves and their children
They have to prepare much for the child, unlike some poorer families who may crowd the entire family into three rooms
In the same way, if we produce new believers, yet eventually we do not feed or teach them properly, this is not right
All those who are saved want to know the truth but if they cannot understand the truth lessons after a few times they will not want to come
The older ones who have heard the messages for more than thirty years will not want to listen to the beginners' lessons
If there were only the Holy Spirit on the earth today, and if there were no Bible, men would be in total darkness and confusion
We must interpret it according to the literal meaning; then we must pray-read it with our spirit, entering into it to eat it and to drink it
Finally, we need to realize that we are not the first ones to read the Bible, but we are the followers of those who have gone before us
If we read these five warnings superficially, they seem to say that it is possible for a believer to perish again
Hebrews chapter one says that Jesus is God the Creator the Son of God the effulgence of Gods glory and the express image of Gods substance
Judaism rejected Him and finally cast Him outside the city of Jerusalem, to the hill of Golgotha, to be nailed to the cross
He was incarnated, passed through human living, died, resurrected, and released His life, completely accomplishing His redemptive work
One day when He comes again, He will set up His kingdom, and He will bring us into the kingdom to be kings in the kingdom with Him
While they journeyed, many Israelites fell in the wilderness and thus were not able to enter into the rest of Canaan
If all the saints in Taipei and all the saints in Taiwan continue to speak, eventually there will have to be a result
