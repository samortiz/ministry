   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE SCRIPTURAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO MEET AND TO SERVE 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:6b; Eph 5:29; 4:15, 12, 16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This chapter may be considered as a conclusion of the last three chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapters four and five, we presented a clear picture of the old way, the traditional way, to meet and to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is nothing in this traditional way but the annulling of the organic functions of the living members of the Body of Christ and the binding and killing of the living members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The traditional way of practice is full of mixture because this old way fits the natural man s taste.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This way is full of the mixture of the heavenly things with the earthly things and of the fleshly things with the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The result, or the issue, of this kind of old, traditional way is that the members of the Body of Christ have lost their function and have become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The scriptural way, the Lord s way, is altogether the opposite of the traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This new way is really able.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is able to fulfill God s eternal purpose, and it is able to carry out God s eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>ABLE TO ENLIVEN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The ancient but newly found way to meet and to serve is able to enliven man 2 Cor 3:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we all endeavor to get into the practicality of this new way, there will be life and enlivening whenever we come together, either in a home meeting, a group meeting, or a much bigger meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whoever comes into this kind of meeting will be enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1978 I was burdened to bring all the saints back to life and truth, and I told them that to endeavor to gain the increase is to run a risk.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we seek to gain the increase in a worldly, natural way, that will bring in a real mixture which will kill the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After what happened among us in 1978, I spoke strongly that we have to come back from all these natural things to the pure truth and the pure life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Six years later, I checked the result of our coming back to life and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To my observation, the result was not satisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In John 15 the Lord told us that He is the true vine and that we are His branches vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As branches of the true vine, we should have much life, but how do we know that we have an abundance of life?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The evidence of life is fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord said that we have to bear fruit; otherwise, we will be cut off from the vine tree and thrown away to be burned vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, to not bear fruit, to not have the evidence of an abundance of life, is really risky.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord says that we can be cut off from the vine, this does not mean that we will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be cut off from the vine is to lose the enjoyment of the rich Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we say that we are enjoying life, we must have the fruit-bearing evidence of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By 1984, I was bothered about the fruit-bearing evidence in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Generally speaking, the years from 1978 to 1984 were years of barrenness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Within those six or seven years, very few of us bore fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because of our situation, I was compelled to study and restudy to find the best way to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then I discovered the way of preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we knock on people s doors, we visit them in their homes to bring God, Christ, the gospel, grace, and even a meeting with full salvation to their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the biblical way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have experimented and studied the way to carry out this preaching by visiting people and have found that it is more than successful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In less than two years in Taipei, we baptized thirty-eight thousand people, as I have mentioned already.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>During this time, we learned many things concerning how to preach the gospel effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Probably in the next term of training, we will improve our way even more.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even while we were in this transitory period of learning how to spread the gospel effectively, we bore much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have been serving the Lord for over fifty-five years, and I have never seen so many baptisms within such a short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>During one weekend in Taipei in which all the full-time trainees went out to preach the gospel day and night, over three thousand were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some negative ones said that the reports concerning these numbers were false or not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But we have records of all the people s names and addresses that were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then they said that probably many of the baptisms were not real since they were baptized so quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But time does not regenerate people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only the regenerating Spirit regenerates people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Regeneration may be likened to taking a picture with a camera.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the instant the shutter opens, all the scenery enters into the camera and gets on the film.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Likewise, at the instant people opened to the Lord to receive Him, He came into their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is absurd to say that a person cannot be regenerated within fifteen minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am not saying that all of the thirty-eight thousand we baptized in Taipei are real.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only the Lord knows who is real and who is not.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to the parable of the wheat and the tares in Matthew 13, the tares are sown in the midst of the wheat vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>24-30, 36-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The tares are false believers and the wheat are genuine ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No one can discern the tares from the wheat until they are fully grown and the fruit is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The fruit of the wheat is golden yellow but that of the tares is black.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before the fruit is produced, no one can tell whether or not someone is a real believer.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only the Lord knows; we do not.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But what we should do is to exercise our spirit to preach the genuine and high gospel to stir up people s faith.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then we can ask them to call on the Lord to receive Him as their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As long as they have called on the Lord and have believed into Him, we can say according to the Scriptures that they have to be baptized Mark 16:16; John 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then we baptize them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is all that we can do in fulfilling our commission to go to the nations and baptize them into the Triune God Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>According to our observation, however, we have seen a great number of positive ones among the thirty-eight thousand baptized in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need to pay our attention to life, but we also need to realize that life needs exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After eating, I have a habit of walking for about five to ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This helps me digest my food and helps my physical well-being.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I must eat and exercise in order to maintain my health.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Again I say, life needs exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>From 1978 to 1984 we talked about life week after week.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We emphasized life, but we had very little activity.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even physically, if we eat much food and do not exercise, we may become sick.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In 1984 I studied our situation in the light of the Bible, church history, and our past experience.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I found out that we need the proper activity.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But I do not mean that when we pay attention to the matter of preaching the gospel by door-knocking that we drop the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the summer training of 1987 in the United States regarding the new way, I fully emphasized the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Those training messages are in a book entitled The God-ordained Way to Practice the New Testament Economy.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In that training I shared something that I had never shared before, that is, that Christ today is the completed Christ chapter one .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We see that He was completed in the four Gospels and propagated in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I gave another three messages in that training that were unique.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They were entitled The Apostles Teaching and Fellowship chapter seventeen , The New Testament Ministry and Ministers chapter eighteen , and The Leadership in the New Testament Ministry and Among the New Testament Ministers chapter nineteen .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the final message, I pointed out that the leadership in the New Testament ministry is really not merely a matter of a person taking the lead but a matter of the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The leadership is produced, strengthened, and also limited, restricted, in the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>What we have fellowshipped concerning the new way should show us that we are taking the new way, which includes door-knocking, according to the New Testament economy based upon the very divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When we charged the full-time trainees to visit people by knocking on their doors, we charged them with life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We told them that before they went out, they had to spend twenty minutes to pray, making a thorough confession that they could receive the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Surely this is something of life.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Do not think that by picking up the new way we are only taking care of activities.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>That is absolutely not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Even our fellowship in this book from the winter training of 1987 stresses the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We cannot go on to take the new way without paying full attention to the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>What is the new way?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The new way is a reviving way.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It is a way that demands that we live a victorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>To come to meetings every week to listen to messages on life again and again without the proper activity as an outlet for life actually bored many of us.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The brothers who gave the messages in their locality had to study things that were already printed in Brother Nee s books and my books.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Then they may have given messages concerning the cross, resurrection, Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>These are big subjects among us in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The saints went to the big meetings again and again, week after week, Lord s Day after Lord s Day, to hear these things repeated again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Many times the nourishment the saints received from these meetings was minimal.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We need to ask how much all of us have grown in life in the traditional way of meeting and serving.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>At least we need to admit, in general, that we were barren for many years, that we hardly bore any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>One brother testified that he had been a leading one in the Lord s recovery for twenty years without bringing anyone to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>After he was trained in Taipei and returned to the United States, he baptized about ten within two weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Time testifies, time tests, and time proves everything.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Thus far, the old way has been tested, and it did not work very well.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We need the increase not only for the growth of the Body of Christ but also for our own growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In many places around the globe in the past three years, the saints who went out to visit people by knocking on their doors became excited and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Some saints who went to Taipei from the United States told us that they became addicted to door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>They wanted to go door-knocking every evening.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>You may not have baptized anyone for years, but if you go out to visit people in their homes and baptize three, you will be in the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>These baptisms will make you crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>A leading brother in San Francisco told me that about one hundred and thirty Chinese-speaking saints from San Francisco went to the San Gabriel gospel festival.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>After they came back to San Francisco, it was apparent that everyone was revived.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>They were excited and full of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>I do not think that any kind of revival could revive people so fast as going out to preach the gospel in the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Again, do not think that we neglect the matter of life when we preach the gospel in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>We depend upon life to carry out such an activity.</S>
