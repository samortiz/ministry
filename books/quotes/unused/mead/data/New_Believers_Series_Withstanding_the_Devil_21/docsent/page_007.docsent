   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>An even clearer example can be seen in Matthew 8, when the Lord Jesus ordered the disciples to depart to the other side of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He knew that powerful demons had to be cast out on the other side of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After He and the disciples stepped into the boat, suddenly a great tempest arose in the sea so that the boat was covered by the waves.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord was asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The disciples came near and roused Him, saying, "Lord, save us; we are perishing!" v. 25 . A few of the disciples were fishermen; they were very experienced sailors.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, they realized that the waves were more than they could handle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus rebuked their little faith; then He rose and rebuked the winds and the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The winds and the sea have no personality of their own, yet the Lord rebuked them because the devil was behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Satan had stirred up the winds and the waves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In conclusion, Satan not only attacks our body, our conscience, and our mind, but also attacks us through our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How should we react to Satan's attack in the environment?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, we must humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both James 4 and 1 Peter 5 tell us to withstand Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These two portions also tell us to humble ourselves before God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Satan attacks us in the environment, our first reaction should be to submit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot withstand the devil if we do not submit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our conscience will condemn us if we withstand the devil without submitting to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, our first reaction should be to submit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second, we should withstand the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When God's children encounter unreasonable and inexplicable things in the environment and have the clear sense within that these are attacks from Satan, they should withstand him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once they withstand, the attacks will be behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, they need to humble themselves under the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the other hand, they must withstand Satan's work in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When they humble themselves, and their attitude before God is firm, God will show them that it is not Him but Satan who is doing the work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, they will be able to differentiate God's arrangement from Satan's attack.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once they are clear and once they withstand the devil, the attacks will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Third, we must reject all forms of fear.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Satan has to find a lodging ground before he can work on God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He cannot work where he has no ground to work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, his first attack is to gain a beachhead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He then attacks us from this beachhead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not give any ground to him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the way to victory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is one area which can become Satan's greatest stronghold fear.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Satan tries to put us through trials, the first thing he does is to put fear into us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>An experienced sister once said, "Fear is Satan's calling card."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once you accept fear, Satan steps in. If you reject fear, he will not be able to come in.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All thoughts of fear are attacks from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whatever you are afraid of, you will surely experience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Job said, "For I dread something, and it comes upon me;/And what I fear comes to me" Job 3:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Job experienced everything that he feared.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Satan's attack in the environment comes mostly in the form of fear.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you withstand the fear, the things that you fear will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if you allow the fear to remain, you will give Satan the opportunity to do the very things that you fear.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, in order for God's children to withstand the work of Satan, the first thing they have to reject is fear.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Satan puts a fear in you for this or that thing, you must not give in to this fear.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You should say, "I will never accept what the Lord has not measured to me!"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once a person is delivered from fear, he is delivered from Satan's realm.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is what Paul meant when he said, "Neither give place to the devil" Eph 4:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why do we not need to fear?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not fear "because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world" 1 John 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are fearful, it is because we are ignorant of this fact.</S>
