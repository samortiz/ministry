   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God s intention is to join us to Christ that we may have an organic union with Him and become one with Him and that His history may become our history.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the spiritual principle in the Scriptures, the first mention concerning a matter becomes the spiritual significance of that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first mention of the believers baptism takes place in the Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, according to the meaning in typology, the Jordan River denotes the death of Christ into which the believers have been baptized.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Colossians 2:12 says, Buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead.</S>
