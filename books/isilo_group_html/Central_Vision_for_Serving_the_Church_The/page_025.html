<h1 class="title">LIVING IN THE SPIRIT AND LIVING BY THE LORD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL APPLICATION</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we spoke of entering into the Holy of Holies. In this chapter we will continue to fellowship concerning some practical applications. Some of my words may not be pleasant, but they illustrate our actual situation. This can be likened to a doctor presenting an unpleasant but factual diagnosis to one of his patients.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeing Only the Shortages of Others<br />
Being a Most Dangerous Situation</h2>
<p>When we come together for a meeting, I am afraid that many have not entered into their spirit in a real way; the majority remain in their mind, their soul. If there are one hundred saints in a meeting, ninety-five may apply the message to others, not to themselves. Anyone who listens to a message in this way is not in spirit. Our spirit is the Holy of Holies, and in the Holy of Holies there is only God. There were many people in the outer court, such as those who were slaughtering bulls and sheep. There were fewer people in the Holy Place, such as those who were burning incense, taking care of the lampstand, and setting out the bread of the Presence. However, in the Holy of Holies there was only God.</p>
<p>It is dangerous for our eyes to be focused on others. This gives Satan much ground in us. Although this problem varies in degrees, we all have this problem. It is easy to focus on the shortages of others as if they were the only ones in need of correction. When other saints look at us, however, they feel that we also are in need of adjustment. If we listen to messages and apply them only to others, we are actually in the soul, no matter how much we think that we are in the spirit. I am deeply concerned that many of us listen to messages in order to apply them to others. If we truly listen to the messages and receive them in the spirit, we will not criticize others. Our criticism of others shows that we have fallen into the realm of right and wrong. Even if our heart is good, and we have good motives related to others, to the Lord, and to His testimony, we can fall into the realm of right and wrong. The most dangerous thing in our spiritual pursuit is to focus on the shortages of others but be unwilling to look at ourselves.</p>
<p>A reluctance to look at ourselves is an issue of self-delusion and self-deception. If we think that we have seen something that others have not seen, we can be deeply concerned about them to the point of many prayers and tears. This, however, is a sign, a proof, that we are self-deluded and self-deceived. It also means that we have not truly seen the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Those Who Live in the Spirit<br />
Seeing Only the Lord, Not Others</h2>
<p>A person who truly lives in the spirit sees only the Lord when he enters into the Holy of Holies. There are no windows in the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies there is no communication with the outside world; there is only the Lord. The saints in a local church will not be supplied if our prayers are based on our perceptions of their shortages. This kind of prayer will not supply the saints or the local churches. If the elders in the church in Taipei ignore their own shortages and pray only for the shortages of others, there will be no benefit. The elders in the church in Taipei should pray for themselves first. If we pray only for others based on their shortages, we are not in the spirit. For example, if we &ldquo;see&rdquo; that another brother is in the flesh, our prayers will focus on him. However, this brother may be praying for us in the same way. If we look only at others, we are not in the spirit, and the Lord will not listen to our prayers.</p>
<p>Rather than looking at others, it is better to pray for ourselves first. The elders in the church in Taipei should pray for themselves first. The elders should pray until they are in the divine stream. Then others will jump into the stream spontaneously, and there will be no need to pray for others. If, however, the elders focus only on others, praying, &ldquo;O Lord, this one is not in the stream, and that one is not in his spirit,&rdquo; they will not be in the stream, no matter what they think. I hope that the elders and co-workers would enter into rest and cease from their labor, even their labor of praying for others. For forty years I have noticed this problem: As soon as a person receives a little grace, Satan immediately encourages him to use this experience of grace as a yardstick for measuring others.</p>
<p>Recently, the elders in the church in Taipei invited the leading brothers in Southeast Asia to participate in a training. I have no feeling either way about this, but I hope that the elders would forget about others and truly care for the church in Taipei. When the church in Taipei enters into the spirit, other localities will enter into the spirit as well. This principle can be applied to all the localities. We do not need to be &ldquo;high priests,&rdquo; who are focused on the &ldquo;care&rdquo; of others. As long as we take care of being in the spirit, this is good enough. If we are in the spirit, others will know, because our spirits are connected. During these years in America, we have not intentionally focused on caring for other churches. We have not had the thought of looking at or praying for the condition of the church in Taipei. If we are in the outer court, we will always regard the condition of others as pitiful. Only those who are in the outer court &ldquo;see&rdquo; the condition of others so clearly. If we are in the Holy of Holies, we see only the Lord Himself.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Vision for Serving the Church &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
