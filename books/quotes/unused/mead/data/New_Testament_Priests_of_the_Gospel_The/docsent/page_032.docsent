   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As a Nursing Mother</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Cherishing Her Own Children</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When you preach the gospel you beget as a father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After begetting, you immediately nourish as a nursing mother.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Leading Them: To Know the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, lead the new ones to know the four aspects of the Lord: to know Him as God Rom 9:5 , to know Him as Man 1 Tim 2:5 , to know Him as the Savior, as well as the Redeemer Luke 2:11 , and to know Him as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After you have learned these four aspects you should not teach others in a legal way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, talk to them spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Perhaps you can speak these points in four messages.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the first message help them to know that the Lord is God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then help them to know that the Lord is Man, that He is the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Following that, help them to know that this God-man is our Savior and our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the end, help them to see that this Lord has become the life-giving Spirit and is now living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If they want to know more, there are many books among us concerning all of these items.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You can introduce all of these books and publications to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To Know the Lord s Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After they know the person of the Lord, you have to help them know the salvation of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord has redeemed us with His precious blood and saved us by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The redemptive aspect of the Lord s salvation has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But He is still saving us daily in life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Redemption by the blood and deliverance in life added together equal the Lord s salvation for us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord s salvation includes both the redemption by the blood and the daily deliverance in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To Know That</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They Have the Life of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After this you have to lead them to know that they themselves have the life of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Formerly they only had the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now that they are saved they have the life of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, their spirit has been regenerated by the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To Exercise Their Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>to Call On the Lord, to Pray,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>and to Take In the Lord s Riches</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you want to lead them to exercise their spirit, you must first exercise your own spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You must not only lead them to know that He is the Spirit and that they have a spirit, you must also demonstrate that you are a person that uses your spirit and speaks from your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then you should help them use their spirit, pray with their spirit, and call on the name of the Lord from their spirit to take in the Lord s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To Enjoy the Milk of the Lord s Word in the Bible and to Grow in Life</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You should also lead them to enjoy the milk of the Lord s word by using some verses in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This kind of enjoyment will help them to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To Consecrate Themselves</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>as Living Sacrifices to God</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When they were saved you offered them up to God as sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, at that time it was you who offered them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After you have nourished them and they have grown in life, you have to tell them that now they have to offer themselves to the Lord as living sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Romans 12 says, I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service v. 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This Being the Pattern</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Revealed in the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Acts 5:42 says that every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ.</S>
