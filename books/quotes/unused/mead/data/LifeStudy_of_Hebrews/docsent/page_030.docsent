   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE NINE THE CAPTAIN OF SALVATION 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the Captain of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is difficult to understand this matter doctrinally.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It seems that, logically speaking, for salvation we need Jesus to be our Savior and Redeemer, not our Captain, Pioneer, or Forerunner.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nevertheless, in God s wonderful salvation, in His so great a salvation, we do need such a Captain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A captain is a leader who leads a group of people into a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is this Captain leading us into?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is leading us into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The glory of God is a most difficult thing for anyone to define or explain.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In His prayer to the Father in John 17, the Lord Jesus said, And the glory which You have given to Me I have given to them John 17:22, Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is this glory?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The glory into which our Captain is leading us is the glory which He has already given us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although glory has been given to us already, yet we still need to enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How difficult it is to speak about this glory!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some say this glory is a luxurious state into which we shall enter in the future and which will thrill and excite us very much.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I heard this kind of talk in the past, I was unhappy with it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Deep within, I felt that it was too light, that there was no weight or meaning in it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you turn the question to me, I would have to say that it is exceedingly difficult to define what is the divine glory which God has ordained for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The New Testament tells us that we have been called into glory and that this glory was designed according to God s wisdom in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Corinthians 2:7 says that in eternity past God ordained that we should be brought into this glory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Both 1 Thessalonians 2:12 and 1 Peter 5:10 tell us that we have been called into this glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And, according to Colossians 3:4, when Christ appears, we shall appear with Him in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is this glory?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Probably most Christians think that glory is merely a kind of shining or brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I would not say that glory is not such a shining or brightness, because I have not entered into it and dare not say that this understanding of glory is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, I would say that such an understanding is too objective and that it is absolutely according to objective considerations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To say that the glory into which we shall enter is merely a kind of radiant shining or brightness may be correct, but it is altogether an objective concept.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may illustrate this matter of glory by the example of a carnation flower.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The seed of a carnation plant is very small.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you sow this seed into the earth, it will grow until it eventually reaches the blossom stage.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the carnation blossoms, that is its glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A long process must transpire from the seed stage to the blossoming stage.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the carnation passes through this process, it must do a great deal of fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you were a carnation seed, you would be able to tell us how much fighting you must pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The carnation must firstly fight against itself, because the life element within the seed must fight against the shell and break through it in order to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then the carnation must fight against the soil in which it grows.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because the soil helps the carnation to grow, we may call it the growing soil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, even this growing soil is a frustration to the carnation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although the plant needs the soil and the soil helps it to grow, it is, nevertheless, a frustration to the growth of the carnation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The carnation must fight against the very soil that helps it to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Finally, after much fighting, the carnation reaches the stage of blossoming.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That is the glory of the carnation flower.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Its blossom is its glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every one of us, without exception, is like a carnation seed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through regeneration, the life of glory has come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We now have a seed of glory within us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The life that we have within us as a seed is the life of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is Christ in us, the hope of glory Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Glory is not merely a radiant shining in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That is too objective.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If glory were merely an outward shining, it would simply be another vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But that is not the glory that the Bible talks about.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The glory revealed in the Bible is the very blossoming of God s divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One day, God s divine element is going to blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Does it bother you when I say that the glory into which we shall enter is not merely something objective, but that it is the blossoming of the divine element from within us?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If it does, it means that, at least to some degree, you are still clinging to the old doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You need to cross the river.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Consider the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus on the mountaintop Matt 17:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the Lord Jesus ascended to the top of that mountain and was transfigured, did the shekinah glory suddenly come upon Him from the outside, from the third heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Did He enter into an outward shining or brightness?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No, the glory shone from within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>That is why it is called the transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Likewise, the glory into which we shall be brought is the very glory that is within us right now.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is not merely objective; it is altogether subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What a difference between this and the traditional teaching about glory!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At the time we were regenerated, the seed of glory was sown into us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In regeneration a life element came into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This life element is not a small thing: it is God s divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All that God is is in this substance, this life element, that has come into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Oh, how we all must realize what happened to us when we were regenerated!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God s divine element came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When the children of Israel entered into the land of Canaan, they began to blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That was their glory.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>That blossoming stage was also a fighting stage, for they began to fight almost immediately after entering into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The first battle they fought was at Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After Jericho, they fought continually until David defeated all the enemies and the temple was built.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then the glory of God filled the temple 1 Kings 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Apparently, the glory that filled the temple came down from above; actually, the glory was with the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Since the day they crossed the Red Sea, the glory was with them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The glory was in the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire Exo 14:19, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When they built the temple, the temple was filled with glory.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Again I say that the glory did not come from above.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It was present already, waiting for the people s growth and development.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When the children of Israel were fully developed, the glory filled the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Likewise, we all had our beginning at the time of our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>That was our Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Since the time of our Passover, the time when the seed of glory was sown into us, that seed has been growing.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This growing is a fighting process.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Even now we are still under the process of entering into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Now we are prepared to understand the Captain of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The salvation of which Christ is the Captain is the very salvation which brings us into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The so great a salvation brings us into glory, and Christ, our Savior, is the Captain of this salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It simply means that our Savior took the lead to fight through into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Lord Jesus did not suddenly enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>During all of His days on earth, a fighting process was going on.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The seed of glory was in Him and was fighting its way out.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If you read the Gospels, you will see that the life of Jesus was a life of fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The story of His life was a fighting story.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He was always fighting the battle for the growth of the seed of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He fought that the glory might come out and that He might be brought into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Do not think that the Lord entered into glory when He ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>No, before His ascension, while He was still on earth, He entered into glory on the day of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Luke 24:26 indicates that Christ entered into glory not by ascending but by resurrecting.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>His resurrection was His entrance into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>His whole life, from the time He was born until the day He was resurrected from the dead, was a fighting process.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The Lord did not only fight for victory but for glory.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He fought for His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>His fighting paved the way into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>In this matter of fighting for glory, He was the Pioneer.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>He pioneered the way into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Therefore, He spontaneously has become qualified to be the leader of those entering into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>So He is the Captain of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Today we are following this Pioneer who has paved the way and entered into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>That glory is now the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We must cross the river and enter into this land.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>In a sense, Christ has crossed the river and is now on the other side, in the land of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Although He is in the glory, we are not yet in it.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We are on the way, following Him as our Captain.</S>
