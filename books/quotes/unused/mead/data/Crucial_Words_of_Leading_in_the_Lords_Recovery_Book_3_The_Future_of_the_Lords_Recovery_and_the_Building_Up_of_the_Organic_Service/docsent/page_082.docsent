   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEMONSTRATING HOW TO ADVANCE THE SMALL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should demonstrate and explain how to advance the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose a co-worker goes to lead and nurture a small group in which there are many sisters but only a few brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This co-worker should not give a long message; rather, he should consider the saints as a family and greet them with an intimate concern.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He should also be aware of long pauses or gaps to avoid a dull and heavy atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a result of our meeting habits, many co-workers and elders like to formalize the small group meetings as if they are conducting a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To them, a group meeting is merely a large meeting held with fewer people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we eat the same food continually, even if it is good food, we will grow to dislike it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are famous for having numerous church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our meetings can be compared to eating, and just as we need to eat three meals a day, we need to meet frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if we eat dumplings three times a day for six months, dumplings will no longer be our favorite food.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to my understanding, nine out of ten saints come to the meetings only out of habit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we must avoid bringing in the atmosphere of a large meeting into a small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In particular, we must avoid the habit of giving a message.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The most important part of a small group meeting is its beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not consider what to say at the beginning of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>An opening word damages the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A group meeting does not need an opening word, and it does not need our conventional way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, we should chat with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The secret is to not consider the meeting as a special kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should simply be as if we are at home and chatting with the members of our family.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no need to prepare a special topic for conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once we prepare something, we ruin the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We either fall into a worship service or mere formality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We might ask a saint, whom we have not met before, his name.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can also ask the saints about their interests, but we should be careful not to hold general conversations about things like the weather.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Neither should the conversation center on one person; rather, everyone should be brought into the conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not a small matter; our ability to nurture a small group depends on such matters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our conversation with the saints should not be aimless.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Perhaps after ten minutes of conversing, we will come to a turning point.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At this juncture we can achieve our goal in leading the group by stirring up the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should perfect them to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should stir up their burden to restore the dormant saints.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should promote the gospel in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should also promote the community gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not let the conversations continue aimlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our purpose is to know the spiritual condition of the saints and then to fan into flame the gift that is within them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This depends on our skill and our spiritual sense.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need wisdom in the things we do.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, it would be inappropriate to say, Our desire is not merely to get to know one another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is more important for us to fan the gift within you into flame so that you are stirred up to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such a speaking will be counterproductive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can compare the group meetings to playing basketball.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After we dribble the ball, we must throw it into the basket.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, our conversation in the small group can be compared to dribbling a ball.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At a certain point we should aim at the basket to make a score.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not speak doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the contrary, we should exercise wisdom to lead the saints into the practical burdens for advancing the small group.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is easy to say but not so easy to carry out.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We often have meetings with no result, because we continually dribble the ball, but no one takes a shot at the basket.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those who serve the Lord have heard many messages, and some have given many messages.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As a result, when they speak, they have the habit of giving a message.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all need to learn to shoot for the basket shortly after receiving the ball in order to attain our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, concerning restoring the dormant saints, we may simply ask whether the saints know of other brothers and sisters in the neighborhood, and how they are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is a simple and direct way to stir up the saints related to this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It will lead the saints to fellowship mutually.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At an appropriate time, we can ask whether the dormant saints would come to the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This will also encourage the saints to fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, we must beware of falling into the trap of holding a drawn out discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As soon as every dormant saint in the neighborhood has been accounted for, we should wisely stop the conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At another time we should encourage everyone to pick up the burden to visit and restore the dormant saints.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is an easy way to help the group reach this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>With such a good beginning, the group will be able to achieve many things, and we will not be beating the air.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We will hit the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The group meeting also needs a good ending.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should give every member of the group the feeling to pick up the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This will fan the gift within them into a flame.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should also help them take action.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For example, if there was a conversation concerning a dormant sister who lives nearby, we should grasp the opportunity to ask whether some sisters have a burden to visit her.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Surely some will have such a burden, and their response will prove that their spirit has been fanned into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Such meetings will enable everyone to be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We do not have to consider this example as the best way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we have better ways, we should fellowship and study them together.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This example has no rituals, no routine worship, no regulations, and no formality.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It has none of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should simply let the saints come together in order to arrive at the goal of everyone in the group rising up to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should always restore the dormant saints and then begin the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Since the groups are formed according to where the saints live, a young sister might be assigned to a group with four elderly brothers and five elderly sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>For this reason, the young saints who intend to serve full time must exercise to be bold.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Furthermore, they must exercise to be calm but not timid.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They should be able to keep their composure regardless of the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Generally speaking, young sisters and even young brothers are afraid to function in front of others.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There is a common Chinese saying that one can be a hero at home but a worm when he leaves home.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The young ones need to be trained so that they are nothing at home but full of boldness when they meet with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Everyone who serves the Lord must exercise boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This does not mean we should be bold to do bad things.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Rather than being afraid of meeting people, we must be bold to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For example, if we meet the president, on the one hand, we should respect him, but on the other hand, we should be bold, not timid, to speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Unless we exercise in this matter, it will be difficult for us to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>How can we serve the Lord if we are afraid to meet people or are afraid to speak when we meet people?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Furthermore, we need to exercise to speak, but we should not speak like elementary students.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Since we have a desire to serve the Lord, the young serving ones, especially the sisters, must learn to be bold.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Being bold does not mean that we do anything we want or do things that we should not.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Being bold means that we are not afraid to contact people nor are we afraid of any situation.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Even if we are young, we should always be unperturbed.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We should also learn not to speak like a child.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Rather, we should be elegant, composed, and logical.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Since we desire to serve the Lord, we must contact people and we must speak.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We must exercise in these few things.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we can learn them, we will advance.</S>
