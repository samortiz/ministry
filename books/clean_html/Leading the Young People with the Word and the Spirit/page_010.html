CHRIST AND ALL THINGS</h1>

<p>In this chapter we will consider the matter of the relationship between Christ and all things. There are twelve points related to this truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST CREATING ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>First, Christ created all things. When we speak to the young people concerning the relationship between Christ and all things, we should begin with the matter of Christ&rsquo;s creating all things and explain that to create means to bring something into existence out of nothing.</p>
<p>In the Bible the word <em>create</em> means to produce something out of nothing, to call things not being as being. In Romans 4:17 God is identified as the One who &ldquo;calls the things not being as being&rdquo; and who &ldquo;gives life to the dead.&rdquo; God has two creations in the universe&mdash;the old creation and the new creation. The old creation came into existence through God&rsquo;s calling things not being as being, whereas the new creation came into being through death and resurrection. The old creation came into existence out of nothing, but the new creation was produced by God giving life to the redeemed believers in the old creation, who were damaged by death. Hence, God is a God who calls things not being as being and who gives life to the dead. We, the saved ones, are God&rsquo;s new creation in Christ.</p>
<p>There are several verses concerning Christ&rsquo;s creating all things. John 1:3 says, &ldquo;All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being.&rdquo; When we serve the young people, the most important matter is to plant into them the concept that all things and all matters come into being through Christ. Everything that has come into being came into being through Him.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 8:6 says, &ldquo;One Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we are through Him.&rdquo; Christ is the Lord, and through Him are all things. Colossians 1:16 says, &ldquo;All things have been created through Him.&rdquo; Hebrews 1:2 says, &ldquo;Through whom also He made the universe.&rdquo; To the young people who are relatively young in life, it is sufficient to give them two of these four verses. Those who are deeper in life, however, can be given all four verses.</p>
<p>If it is possible, we can also speak a word of correction and rebuttal concerning the theory of evolution to the young ones. Even though many scientific studies in recent years have shown that some parts of the evolution theory are not correct, many young ones may have been poisoned by it. We should mention a few points in a brief way, but there is no need to mention much else. First, the theory of evolution offers no explanation for the source from which all things evolve. Even if organisms evolve, they cannot evolve out of nothing. There has to be a beginning, a source, a point of origin. We cannot ignore the fact that there is a source. For example, a chair comes from wood, wood comes from trees, and trees come from seeds. However, where do the seeds of the tree come from? People have no answers to questions related to the origin of the source itself. Even scientists are unable to say how all things came into being. Only the Bible tells us that God created all things. In order for the theory of evolution to stand, it must account for creation. However, when we trace everything back to its beginning, there is nothing from which things could have evolved. The only explanation comes from the Bible, which is that God created all things by calling not being as being. It is also wrong to associate evolution with the mere phenomenon of change. For example, an egg undergoes a change when it is hatched and a chicken is produced, but this is not evolution. Similarly, a tree will gradually grow and bear fruit, which, in turn, will ripen gradually. The fact that living organisms change does not prove evolution or negate the revelation in the Bible that God is the Creator of all things. Even things that change have their source in God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must tell the young people that God established a law in His creation that stipulates that every organism is according to its own kind (Gen. 1:11-12, 21, 24-25). Living things cannot evolve from one species to another species. Fish are fish; they cannot evolve to become birds, and neither can birds evolve to become horses. This is a law that God established when He created all things. A horse and a donkey cannot evolve into a mule that can reproduce other mules because their different natures prevent this. Although a donkey and a horse can produce a mule, the mule that is produced is infertile and cannot procreate.</p>
