   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED OF CHRIST AS THE OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ has brought God down to the earth by being the tabernacle, but without Christ as the offerings, we simply cannot meet the requirements of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hallelujah, Christ is all kinds of offerings!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In all these offerings, Christ meets the requirements of the white linen, the gold, and the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ as the offerings is capable, qualified, and equipped to meet all the requirements of the divine righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Praise the Lord that we have Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And who is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is the righteousness of God, Christ is the holiness of God, and Christ is the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we have Christ, we have these three attributes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then we are able to meet all of God's requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But it is not in ourselves; it is in Christ and by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hallelujah, Christ is our righteousness!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is our holiness!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is our glory!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whatever God requires, we have, because we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we can walk into the tent of meeting with peace and joy to meet God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand Christ is the tabernacle for God to come to us, and on the other hand Christ is the offerings for us to go to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is the way for God to come to man, and He is also the way for man to go to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, He is the very tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here we meet not only with one another, but also with God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is because Christ has brought God to us, and Christ brings us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>OUR FIRST SITUATION BEFORE GOD The Burnt Offering</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the book of Leviticus, we see that Christ is typified by many different kinds of offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we read through the first six or seven chapters of this book, we see at least five main offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Accompanying these five, there are the wave offering and the heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why do we need so many kinds of offerings?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is because we are in a situation of at least five to seven aspects before God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our first situation is that we are not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Of course, before we were saved, we were absolutely not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now that we are saved, in a sense we are for God, but in another sense, we are still not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are you absolutely for God?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the first aspect of our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whether we are good or whether we are bad, whether we are doing right or doing wrong, the pitiful thing is that we are not really for God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may be doing good and still not be for God, just as others may be doing bad and not be for God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regardless of whether we are good or bad, we are altogether not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One person may be a bank robber, and another may be a gentleman, but both are not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, in a sense, all are the same, whether they are robbers or college professors.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes even the Christian teachers, preachers, and pastors are not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Your reading of the Bible may not be for God, just as reading a magazine may not be for God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A Man for God</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you really care absolutely for God?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Can you say that whatever you do, whatever you say, and whatever you are is one hundred percent for God?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No, none of us can honestly say this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must take Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need Him as our burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The burnt offering signifies that Christ is the One who is absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you would read the four Gospels again, you would see a Man living on the earth who was one hundred percent for God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whatever He was, whatever He spoke, and whatever He did was absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the contrary, we are not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are for our own interests and our own choices.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But Christ as our burnt offering is completely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the past, my realization was that we need Christ first of all as our trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But today my realization has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need Christ first as our burnt offering, because our first problem with God is not a matter of trespasses, but a matter of not being for God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whether we have trespassed or not, we are still not much for God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may have done nothing amiss, but we are still not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Though I may not be wrong with this person or that person, I am wrong with God because I am still not absolutely for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>So our first need is Christ as the burnt offering.</S>
