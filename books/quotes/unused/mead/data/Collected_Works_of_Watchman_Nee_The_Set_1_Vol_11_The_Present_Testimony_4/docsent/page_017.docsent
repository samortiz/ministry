   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many believers think that great joy and excitement mean power.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But I have to tell you that excitement in one's feelings is actually a hindrance to a life of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God has to strip you of everything you have received through your feeling, until only God and His Word remain.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He causes you to believe in a calm way; there is no feeling, no excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You believe "coldly."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you do that, you are brought up to the mountaintop again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is joy again, but the joy is different from the first experience of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first experience is groundless, but this joy has a basis.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This time God causes you to experience the real victory, not like the previous idealistic victory, because you have passed through the tunnel experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Please remember that every time a believer wants to acquire some spiritual experience, he has to first pass through the test of the tunnel before he can really acquire anything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you acquire a new truth, you are very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But you must be careful; immediately after this there is a tunnel waiting for you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you do not realize this fact and instead doubt the reliability of God's Word, you will be in danger.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because many Christians do not know this principle, they stay inside the tunnel and never come out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's goal is to remove your outward feelings and your outward crutches, so that His Word will take hold of you and so that you will be empowered through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers, before you acquire a spiritual truth, you must always go through the tunnel experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The feeling on the first peak is not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only after you have gone through the tunnel experience can the truth be yours.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is true with any kind of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At first, we hear a truth and receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is where the teachers come in. They share the truth with us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we must not think that just because we have heard and understood it, that it is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has to bring us down from the peak to the plain and into the tunnel before we can be on the third peak again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time the truth will be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is a particular danger with the preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When they reach the first peak, they think they have acquired something, and they blow their trumpet to tell others about it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who hear also think that they have acquired the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when they are brought by God to the plain and into the tunnel, they will think that what they heard was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The mistake is with the preachers themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When they are on the first peak, they need not be hasty in telling others anything, for everything will surely go into the tunnel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The length of time in the tunnel is not certain; it can be long or short.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only after they have come out of the tunnel will the truth be theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After they have gone through the tunnel experience, they will realize what that truth really means.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God leads us this way in order to show us that the just live by faith and not by feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we are brought into the tunnel, we realize that the only thing that will bring us through is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only God's Word counts; feelings do not count.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After we pass through the tunnel experience, the truth will be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we are brought into the tunnel by God, we think that we have lost all the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, God is turning the truth that we have received in our feelings into real experience through the test of the tunnel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, when we are in the tunnel we acquire the truth in a real way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let me now relate to you a story to illustrate this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have a friend who is a very good poet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One day he went to a potter to watch how porcelain ware is made.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He saw many people making many vases out of mud, smoothing them out, and painting flowers and letters on them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Finally, the vases were burned in the furnace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He thought of the pain the vases had to go through and wondered if the burning was necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A vase that has not gone through the fire looks the same outwardly as a vase that has gone through the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But inwardly they are very different.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A vase that has passed through the fire can hold water with flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A vase that has not passed through the fire dissolves once water is poured into it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There must be the burning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He noticed that of the numerous vases that went into the furnace, only about one-third would come out of the fire undamaged.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was touched by this, and he went home and wrote a poem based on Peter's word about the "fiery ordeal" 1 Pet 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the poem he metaphorically described himself as a vase, upon which were painted flowers and letters and colors.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was beautiful, yet it could not stand the touch of a finger or the splash of water.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Unless he went through the fire, nothing would be solid or firm.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There was no choice but to enter the furnace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Within the furnace, there was the sound of crying and murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But he had to suffer this before he could possess the lasting beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the time came, he emerged out of the furnace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then there was not only outward beauty, but an inward firmness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All the pictures and letters had firmly become one with him; they belonged to him and could not be erased or washed away anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now he could be presented before anyone, even before a king.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our experience of acquiring the truth is similar to the experience of the vase.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When the flowers and letters are first painted, we think everything is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But we cannot stand any touching and are destroyed by any washing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The truth is not ours; we only understand it in our mind and are excited in our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We rejoice over it a little too soon.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have to remember that every time we go through a test, it is to help us to possess the truth that we have just heard.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Suppose we have just heard the truth concerning patience.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A test will come to make us impatient.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The test we will face will put us in exactly the opposite place of the truth we received in our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God wants to put us through the burning of the furnace.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many people go into the furnace and never come out again.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But if we go through the fire and come out again, what we have acquired will be firm.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then we will be on the mountaintop once again.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The truth which we received before is unusable; but the truth we now have is usable.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The sword which we acquired before could not be used to fight; the sword we now have, can.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What we had before was only a nice outward appearance; what we now have within is something solid.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Previously, we were in the realm of the mind and the emotion; now we have really acquired something.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When we hear a new truth, we go home rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But what follows are the trials.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must pass through the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Here lies the difference between faithful ones and unfaithful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is not enough just to put some nice colors on a vase to make it look nice outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It must go through the fire and come out of the fire before it can be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>What we receive in our feeling is of no use before God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We have to go through the fire and lose every outward thing before we will receive something real.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When we receive a new truth and feel very happy about it, we must not think that we have the truth already.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In the tunnel everything is dark; there is no light at all.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But we should not think that we have lost the truth we have received initially.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We have to realize that this is the time we are actually acquiring the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>God's goal is to remove us from a life in the emotions and teach us to live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>There is only one principle: the just shall live by faith and not by feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>With every spiritual experience the principle is the same: first there is the mountaintop feeling of joy, then there is the experience of the tunnel, and then another mountaintop joy that is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>After this, what we have obtained is real.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Why does God always give us a mountaintop feeling of joy at the beginning of our spiritual experience?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>God has His intention for doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we do not have a taste of the truth, we will not receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Madame Guyon said that God allows us to have a taste of the joy of every new truth, so that we will not want to lose it even when we are in the tunnel.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>When we pass the test and come out of the tunnel, we will have a full taste of the joy of that truth.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>First we have a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>After the trial we come into the full and unrestricted enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Now we see the proper course of a Christian path.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We cannot possess any truth without going through the test of the tunnel.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Faith is the principle because feelings are unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>God takes away our feelings so that we can have the opportunity of trusting in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If our feelings are not removed, we will not trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Some brothers have asked, "Why is the truth that we think we received in the first peak, the truth we received in our feelings, not trustworthy?</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Why do we have to pass through the experience of the tunnel before it becomes trustworthy?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>What does this have to do with our feelings?"</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The reason is that when we receive the mountaintop feeling of joy concerning a certain truth, we think we have everything and everything is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Actually, we still have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>God puts us in a tunnel so that the truth can become really ours.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>When we enter the tunnel, everything is dark and there is no support anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>It seems as if God's Word has failed, and we do not understand why.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>It seems that God's Word, promises, and facts are all the same and ineffectual.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>It seems that our feelings have failed us, and according to our feelings, everything is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>After a while, the truth comes back to look for us.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Even though circumstantially we do not feel anything, the truth seems more real and is easier for us to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>God is delivering us from what we think we have and understand according to our feeling, so that we can actually possess and understand these things.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Mr. Andrew Murray once said that the Holy Spirit explains the Word of God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>I will add a word: only the Holy Spirit can explain God's Word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>For example, every evening we have our Bible study.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Even though we have read and expounded every verse, this does not count; we must forget about these things and allow them to fail inside the tunnel before there can be the beginning of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The Holy Spirit must explain the same thing to us a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Whatever we think we understand, we understand only in our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>We must pass through the tunnel.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Only the experience we gain in the tunnel is real.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>This is the principle of faith.</S>
