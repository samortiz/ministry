<P>IX."And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so" (v. 24). The work on the sixth day, like the work on the third day, was divided into two halves. The living creatures on the earth were created on the first half of the sixth day. At this point, the appearance of life is more advanced. Now there is no water and the virtues of the new man are produced.</P><P>If we combine the work on the fifth day with the work on the first half of the sixth day, we will find great significance. All the fish, birds, cattle, insects, and beasts are types of man (Matt. 4:19; Acts 10:12, 28). Christians, after their ascension, become a channel for the life of God; they convey God's life into the hearts of many. All these refer to today's life and work.</P><P>Now we will look into the work on the second half of the sixth day. God created man in His own image and after His likeness (Gen. 1:26-27). This brings us to the second coming of Christ. Spiritually, this is already a reality.</P><P>Saints who have experienced regeneration, co-crucifixion, co-resurrection, fruit-bearing, and ascension, and have expressed all these progressive stages in their spiritual life, will spontaneously attain to this step, that is to be completely like God. "Christ...formed in you" (Gal. 4:19) is the spiritual goal of the saints. When we are united with Christ in all things and have experienced all that He has accomplished for us, we will be able to experience being "transformed into the same image" (2 Cor. 3:18).</P><P>"Since you have put off the old man with his practices and have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him" (Col. 3:9-10). "That you put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man...and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality" (Eph. 4:22-24). In our experience we should have the life of the "new man" who is completely like God. "Putting off" and "putting on" are actions initiated by our will. Believers exercise their will to reject all the conduct of the old man and choose the newness of the new man. The highest level of Christian living is a living by the will. At this point, they will be renewed in their mind and knowledge, and they will have the image of God in full. The mind is the spiritual battlefield. They may be righteous and holy in their conduct and life (Eph. 4:24), but they may not have the experience of the mind being renewed. The mind is the greatest stronghold of old Adam's life; it is the part that is most deeply contaminated by sin. If the mind is renewed, the image of God is restored.</P><P>Nevertheless, the actual recovery of the image of God is still in the future, at the time of the second coming of the Lord Jesus. "For our commonwealth exists in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself" (Phil. 3:20-21). "If He is manifested, we will be like Him" (1 John 3:2).</P><P>Saints not only have the image of God, but also dominion over all things (Gen. 1:26, 28). This brings in the millennial kingdom. This is the ruling of the saints. "They...reigned with Christ for a thousand years" (Rev. 20:4). "Have authority over ten cities" (Luke 19:17).</P><P>Not every believer will have the glory of the millennial kingdom. Rather, only those who have experienced all the stages in Genesis 1 will have this glory. Those who are united with the past experiences of Christ will also be united with the future glory of Christ. We only need to believe in the Lord Jesus to be saved; but if we are not faithful, and if we do not suffer and overcome, we will not be able to reign with the Lord. The cross is the way to the crown. Suffering is the condition to entering into glory. God gives salvation freely, but He will not award glory without a price. Whosoever is willing to suffer loss in this age for the Lord's sake will receive in the coming age. How can someone who reigns in this age receive glory in the coming age? It is not easy to humble ourselves! Rather, we are always ready to be exalted and receive glory! Those who live a holy life with faithful work will surely receive praises before the Lord. Yet to have this kind of reigning, we do not have to wait until the next age. We can reign in our spirit, even though the complete fulfillment will be in the future. We can apply the authority from the Lord to rule over all things. We should be kings to rule over evil spirits and prohibit them from working. Since Satan will be bound in the millennial kingdom, we can apply the authority of the coming age to confine him to a certain limit. We also should use the weapon of prayer to rule over our environment; whether they are national affairs, family affairs, church affairs, or personal affairs, we can use prayer to rule over all of them. By our will and through the Holy Spirit, we can even bring ourselves under full control. This is, indeed, a victorious life. "Millennial kingdom" Christians are the most powerful Christians.</P><P>Besides reigning as kings, the saints will also have their own food (Gen. 1:29). The herb-bearing seed is a sign of life. The power of life is in it. Only those things that have life are good for food. Food is part of our future reward: "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God" (Rev. 2:7). "To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna" (v. 17). The matter of food will continue even after the resurrection because our Lord also ate and drank after His resurrection. The fruit of the tree of life is for man to eat in the eternal, heavenly city.</P><P>Nevertheless, today we can experience the place where we will be in the future. What we eat is the constituent of our health. Only life-food will give the nourishment of life to those who eat it. Therefore, all the living creatures are given "every green herb" for food. "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God" (Matt. 4:4). "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work" (John 4:34). "I am the bread of life" (John 6:48). "He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life" (v. 54). If we want to be strong, we must take in the word of God, take His will as our food, and eat and drink of the Lord Jesus. We should not read the Scriptures in a casual way, but use prayer and meditation to digest the word of God and receive nourishment for our spiritual life. Every time we faithfully take the will of God, we will sense that our inner man has once again been nourished. By faith we take the death (flesh) and the life (blood) of our Lord Jesus to assimilate them into our life so that we can go on with strength. In order to be healthy spiritually, we need to take in the bread of life. All other kinds of food are but chaff.</P>
