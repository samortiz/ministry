<h2 class="head1">"ELIJAH WITH MOSES"</h2><p>After the Lord was transfigured, suddenly Elijah and Moses appeared before the disciples and conversed with the Lord Jesus. Peter must have thought, "This is such a rare opportunity for the three of us to be with the three of you." He proposed to the Lord, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah." Yet the Lord did not answer him. What does this mean? Suppose someone invites you to tea and you only stare at him without saying a word. Saying nothing is more severe than saying "no" to him. Not saying anything means rejection. Silence means resistance. Christ should never be ranked equally with Moses and Elijah. The kingdom of God has replaced the law and the prophets. If the kingdom of God is here, Moses and Elijah must go away. Only then can Jesus Christ of Nazareth come. If Moses and Elijah are still here, Jesus cannot come. Moses and Elijah cannot be mixed together with Jesus. If the Old Testament continues, the New Testament cannot come. The disciples did not realize this.</p><p>Mark never followed the Lord Jesus. He was a young man, and he was a disciple of Peter. The Gospel of Mark is Mark's written account of what he heard from Peter. Peter spoke the words, but Mark recorded the message. This is an historical fact concerning the Bible. The Gospel of Mark is actually the Gospel of Peter. This is why the Gospel of Mark gives us more specific details concerning Peter. Peter loved to talk. Wherever he was, he always had something to say. At this point he said something foolish again. But after he said it, he did not know how to go on. The Lord was silent, and Peter did not know what to say. But God spoke at this juncture. The Father's words seemed to be directed at Peter specifically; they were words of rebuke. The Father seemed to be saying, "You should use your ears and not your mouth. You should listen to the Lord instead of asking the Lord to listen to you." Here we see what the New Testament is all about. We should not listen to the law and the prophets any longer. Instead, we should listen to the beloved Son of God, Jesus Christ. The prophets should be put aside, and the law should be put aside. The New Testament is Jesus Christ revealed. A life according to the New Testament is just a life of obedience to the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p><p>Moses represents the law, which tells us that God has established regulations for man. In addition to the Ten Commandments, the Pentateuch contains hundreds of additional commandments. These are also laws. The Old Testa- ment only contains God's law. When men in the Old Testament wanted to know whether a certain matter was right, all they had to do was find the answer in the law. They did not necessarily have an inner sense of right or wrong. Their "yes" and "no" were written in the law. If a person observed the various ordinances and laws, he would be justified. In the Old Testament all problems were dealt with by the law; the law determined what was right and what was wrong. Hence, the law separates man from God. It sets up a standard of right and wrong apart from God. But these are dead standards. Thank the Lord, the Old Testament is over. The law is over. Today in the New Testament dispensation, only God is our "yes" and "no." God in us becomes our law. If a man does not have God and only has regulations, and if all he knows is "yes" and "no," he is still in the Old Testament. Once a person has God, he will be delivered from right and wrong, and he will truly be one who lives in the New Testament.</p><p>I have a servant in my house called Mr. Wong. His disposition is entirely opposite of mine. He likes to have rules and regulations for everything he is about to do, and he likes to work by these rules and regulations. However, all I want is for him to obey me and to do things according to my desire. What he wants is in the principle of the Old Testament; what I like is in the principle of the New Testament.</p><p>With the law there is no need for man to draw near to God. He can know what is right and what is wrong. The law is a set of dead moral standards apart from God. It is something that once it is known, will be known forever. But the New Testament requires a daily knowing and a moment by moment knowing. In the New Testament Moses cannot exist; the law cannot exist. True knowledge of the Lord is not the knowledge of yesterday; nor is it derived from books. It is knowledge that comes from the Lord who is living and speaking in us; it is always in the present tense.</p><p>What do the prophets represent? The prophets supplemented what was lacking in the law. They were the ones who inquired of God on behalf of men. A prophet was one who sought God's will on behalf of others. For instance, you might be sick and not know whether you would become well or not. You could send for a prophet to inquire of God to see whether or not you would become well. Or you might not know whether or not you should go to a certain place. You could ask someone to inquire of God's will for you. This was the work of a prophet. The law enabled you to know right and wrong according to dead regulations, while a prophet told you what was right and wrong in place of you knowing it yourself.</p><p>God said that we should not listen to Moses or Elijah. However, there are many Elijahs today. Suppose we have a very spiritual brother or sister among us. If you have a problem, it is easy to ask him or her to inquire of God for you. If you are not clear about God's will, it is easy to charge him or her to inquire about God's will for you. This is the principle of a prophet. This is what Elijah did. The law takes away man's direct communication with God, and the prophet also takes away man's direct fellowship with God. Both the law and the prophets stand between man and God and separate man from God.</p><p>Some may ask why there are prophets in the New Testament. What is the difference between New Testament prophets and Old Testament prophets? New Testament prophets are completely different from Old Testament prophets. The Lord gave some prophets in the New Testament. Their principal work is the building up, encouragement, and consolation of men (1 Cor. 14:3). They only explain the prin- ciples of God's will. They do not go into the details of God's will.</p><h2 class="head1">"THIS IS MY SON, THE BELOVED. HEAR HIM"</h2><p>Isaiah prophesied that one day, "the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah,/As the waters cover the sea" (11:9). God's words are marvelous. He says the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah. "Full" means there is no longer any need. Hebrews 8:11 says, "And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them." This means that neither a fellow citizen nor a brother can be one's prophet any longer. We have to know God ourselves. This is the New Testament. The New Testament is the Lord living in us, telling us what is from God, what is right, and what is wrong. The New Testament is the Lord leading us inwardly. Because of this we have no need for others to instruct us anymore. We can receive spiritual help from others, but the detailed leading of God's will is strictly a matter between us and God. Today the prophets and the law are over. Thank God! We need to hear, "This is My Son, the Beloved. Hear Him!"</p>
