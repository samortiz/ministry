   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REALIZING GOD'S SEVERE JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ON THE HOUSE OF ELI</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Samuel came to realize that God's severe judgment was on the house of Eli 2:27-36; 3:4-18; 4:1-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not think that God is merely sitting in the heavens and is not doing anything about the situation of His people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is very busy in dealing with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. First, Prophesied by a Man of God</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, God's severe judgment on the house of Eli was prophesied by a man of God 2:27-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. Second, Confirmed by the Word</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>of Jehovah through Samuel</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, this severe judgment was confirmed by the word of Jehovah through Samuel 3:4-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that God's purpose in letting Eli know through Samuel of the coming judgment was to make an unforgettable impression on this young priestly boy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was God's wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. Third, Executed by God through the Philistines</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Third, God's severe judgment was executed through the Philistines 4:1-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The People of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Being Defeated by the Philistines</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The people of Israel were defeated by the Philistines, and 30,000 foot soldiers of them were slaughtered v. 10 . At the time of Hezekiah, Judah looked to the Lord for protection, and one night He sent an angel to strike 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians 2 Kings 19:35 . From this we see that it would have been easy for God to defeat the Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, at that time He had given up Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Ark of God Being Captured</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Israel was foolish in their degradation because they did not trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, they trusted in the systems ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In their situation they should have repented, made a thorough confession, and returned to God from their idols.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, they exercised their superstition to trust in the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Their past told them that quite often when the ark of God moved, there was a victory Num 10:35; Josh 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But this time their situation was not right.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In their degradation they offended God to the uttermost, and God left them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, instead of the ark saving Israel, the ark itself was captured 1 Sam 4:11a .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Two Sons of Eli,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hophni and Phinehas, Being Killed</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, who had gone out with the ark, were killed because they had altogether disregarded God v. 11b . This shows us that we need to learn the lesson of not being loose in the service of God.</S>
