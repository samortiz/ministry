   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 14 Date:July 9, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER H. F.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was saved in 1924.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After I became a Christian my parents began to persecute me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My father said that I could not remain in the house because my whole family was in turmoil because of me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I was sent to a seminary in Nanking and studied there for over three years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After I returned home, my father would not allow me to go out again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead, he told me to do my preaching at home.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Between 1927 and 1936 I was mostly at home.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That time was foolishly spent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The only lesson I learned was submission to family authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Later I went to Shanghai and lived at Hardoon Road for a year, fellowshipping with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later I felt to have a little house of my own in order to forget everyone else and live by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I avoided the brothers and sisters and would not fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1947 the church in Shanghai began to preach on handing oneself over to the Lord and to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I handed myself over at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since then I have lost the freedom to go wherever I want.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church decided that I should move to Customs Lane in Foochow, and I obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After I listened to Brother Nee's messages, I received the supply and was enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I was in Shanghai, others criticized me for being a closed person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I kept what I knew and would not ask others about what I did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Others have told me that I was proud.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But this is the way I am.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What can I do?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A cold person always wants to hide himself and shy away from others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some people live by the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While their outward activities still continue, their inner man sinks.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is our sister.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Her inner man has sunk.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Your spirit has sunk, but still you are trying to live by the outer man, that is, by the emotion, thoughts, and ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But they are not enough to support you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Your spirit is not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the reason you have become what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you see yourself under God's light, your spirit sinks, and many spiritual things become tasteless to you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is like a sick man who knows that he should eat but does not have an appetite for any food.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our sister only has spiritual knowledge but does not have spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She does not have any spiritual interest and has lost her appetite for spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You can go on being a Christian, but you will live according to cold knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Fortunately, you have not found a good house.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you had, you would have moved in and hidden yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But even if you were able to do that, such solitude would be boring after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When your spirit is down, you try to run away from any environment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When your spirit has lost touch with God and you are void of light, you are in darkness and sorrow, and you cannot touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Breaking of the Outer Man</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do not have God's light, all outward things become meaningless and tasteless, and all outward circumstances become boring to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then God has to do two things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First, He has to deal with our outer man, for the outer man can never replace the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God does not want us to sustain the inner life with anything outward.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He does not want us to live by a strong emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nor does He want us to live by a strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord will take this opportunity to break and dry up our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We will become discouraged, pessimistic, and negative, and we will realize that there is less and less of a chance for the outer man to reassert itself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Outwardly speaking, this seems discouraging, but by then our outward abnormal activities will have ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, the disobedient acts of the outer man will have stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the benefit on the negative side the improper activities are stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the inner man has sunk but the outer man is still active, you will have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is a good thing that the outer man will not support the inner man when it is down, because this will save some time in the breaking work.</S>
