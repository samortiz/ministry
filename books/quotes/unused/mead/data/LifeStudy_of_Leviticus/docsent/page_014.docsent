   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Scripture, the laying on of hands always signifies identification, union; it does not signify substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To lay our hand on the offering means that we are one with the offering and take the offering as being one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the laying on of hands makes the two parties one.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, spiritually speaking, by such a union He becomes one with us and lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As He lives in us, He will repeat in us the life He lived on earth, the life of the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In ourselves we cannot live this kind of life, but He can live it in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By laying our hands on Him we make Him one with us, and we make ourselves one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then He will repeat His living in us.</S>
