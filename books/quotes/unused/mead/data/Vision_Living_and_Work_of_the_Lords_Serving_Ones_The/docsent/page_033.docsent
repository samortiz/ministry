   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICING THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BECOME THE PROPER TESTIMONY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us consider the history of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God arranged for the people of Israel to be in the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was promised and ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later, the Israelites became degraded and were taken away into captivity to Babylon for seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the fullness of the times, God brought His people back to Jerusalem and charged them to rebuild His temple on this ground.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This picture typifies the experience of the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now let us ask a question.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Which group of people was more spiritual: those who were moved by God to return to Jerusalem or those who remained in Babylon?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not think that those who returned to Jerusalem were more spiritual than those who remained in Babylon, because at least one person who stayed in Babylon was very spiritual, and that was Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some of those who returned to Jerusalem married Gentile wives, and others violated the law of the Sabbath Neh 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, the group that returned was not all that proper.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether or not they were proper, God justified them and approved them, because the Lord Jesus was born not in Babylon but in Bethlehem, that is, from among those who returned to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus was born in the place chosen by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must humbly confess that there are many of God s children who love the Lord more than we do and are more spiritual than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, this does not indicate that they are standing on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I hope that this word will help us so that we would not merely listen to the truth concerning the church but still not know how to apply it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>May the Lord help us to understand this basic truth so that in our attitude and practice we will be a proper testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must know the truth so that we are not deceived by the confusion in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We thank the Lord that He has separated us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May He grant us the faithfulness and the prudence to be proper vessels in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I believe that this will bring in the Lord s return.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BEING ONE IN LIFE AND</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>BEING ON THE GROUND OF ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have been called by the Lord to participate in His recovery; He has placed us in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is one thing to be in the recovery and another thing to see the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although we are taking this way, it is possible that we do not have a clear understanding of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, when we encounter difficulties, problems, or warfare, we may become confused and even go astray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There have been many such incidents in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even some who had been in the work for a long time went astray when they ran into problems.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, we should not have confidence in ourselves, thinking that we have a clear vision and that there will not be any problems.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to receive more of His enlightening concerning the church so that we are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This will make us useful in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us consider how to maintain a proper relationship with Christians who do not meet with us on the one ground.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our relationship is based on the light of the truth and the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We know that God s economy is for the Triune God to be dispensed into His chosen people so that they may be His corporate testimony on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We experience oneness with the Lord when He dispenses Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more God dispenses Himself into us, the more we are mingled with Him and become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When this fact God and man mingled as one becomes our life and our experience, spontaneously our expression will be that the saints are one in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This oneness is His corporate testimony, and it is what God intends to achieve in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God s economy is to mingle Himself with us so that we are absolutely one with Him and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is what is referred to in Ephesians 1:10: Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this oneness we have a testimony in life and the ground in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are one in life, we cannot be divided on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Conversely, if we are divided on the ground, we cannot have the testimony of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to have the testimony of oneness, we must be one in life and one on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This proves that the ground of oneness is not merely an outward matter; it is related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we know this and see this, we will treasure the ground on which we stand, and we will not be deceived to leave the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the opportune time we will bring all God s children to this ground of oneness so that they may participate in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The ground is a crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>LEARNING TO PRESENT THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>CONCERNING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since we have a heart to serve the Lord either full time or part time, we must be active and aggressive to learn the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must pursue this truth diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not only read about it and discuss it; we should also learn to present it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You can practice presenting it to me, and I can practice presenting it to you, until we can all present this truth logically and clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This will help us have a clear view concerning the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If possible, when we contact Christians who are not on the ground, we can also speak with them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This does not mean that we should go to other groups and point out their mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our knowledge concerning the ground must be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then we will be able to stand solid and firm.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>While we are serving, we will inevitably encounter trials in our service or problems in our coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sometimes we may face temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At such times our knowledge of the truth will cause us to stand firm on the ground and not be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is easy to talk about the ground, but when the environment changes, when we are faced with temptations, or when we encounter trials, it may not be easy to stand firm for the Lord s sake.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I hope that as we review these chapters, we will study them thoroughly and have a clear understanding of the truth so that we will be able to speak this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even after we have such an understanding, we will still need to ask the Lord by His mercy to grant us to be faithful so that when we encounter difficult environments or trials, we will stand firm on the ground of the church.</S>
