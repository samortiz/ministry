   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Eighth, we have to pay special attention to the matter of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The double-tongued person to whom we have referred is a close kinsman of the liar.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All utterances that are made with an intent to give a false hope or a wrong impression fall into the category of lying.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sometimes a lie may not contain any false statement, but it is skillfully spoken to give others a false impression.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is in reality a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to remember that honesty in our speech is a matter of motive; it is not simply a matter of correctness in words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a brother asks a question we do not wish to answer or are unable to answer, we should politely refuse to reply, but we should not deceive the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A false statement is a lie, and anything that gives others a wrong impression is also a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We want people to believe the truth; therefore, we dare not use words that are true in order to convey a false impression.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For God's children, it should always be "Yes, yes; No, no."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Anything more than this is of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord once spoke very strongly to the Jews: "You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father....When he speaks the lie, he speaks it out of his own possessions; for he is a liar and the father of it" John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The devil is the author of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was a liar from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even today he is filled with lies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is a liar and the father of it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It would be unthinkable for a child of God and, even more, for a worker of the Lord to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet some are indeed lying.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no sickness more fundamental than this one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a very serious problem, very serious and very sobering!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must pay attention to the matter of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not think that everything we say is always accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more careful we are, the more we will realize the difficulty of being accurate in everything that we say.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes our intention is to speak the truth, but with a little carelessness we find ourselves off the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we can so easily veer off when we are trying to be accurate, how much more we will be off the mark if we are not consciously trying.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is hard enough for us to speak the truth by carefully watching over ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is harder still for us to speak the truth when we do not control ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, we must guard ourselves, pay attention to our words, and never be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Otherwise, we will not be able to serve our God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God cannot use a person who is His mouthpiece one minute and a mouthpiece of Satan the next minute.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No, He can never use such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ninth, we should pay special attention to another point, which is to "not strive nor cry out."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible prophesied of the Lord: "He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets" Matt 12:19; Isa 42:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul said, "A slave of the Lord ought not to contend" 2 Tim 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that no servant of the Lord can strive or make a loud noise.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Making a loud noise is an expression of rudeness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord's servant should be under such control that he will "not strive nor cry out."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He should not quarrel with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Loud speaking usually indicates a lack of power, at least the power of self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No servant of the Lord should be so loud that his neighbor can hear his voice next door.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No one could hear the Lord's voice in the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the pattern He left for us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means more than a rejection of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many words are indeed correct and true, but we would rather not strive or cry out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"A slave of the Lord ought not to contend."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can keep our mouth shut about many things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A brother or a sister has to be extremely loose before he or she can shout at others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He or she must have been living an undisciplined life for many years before he or she could shout with little restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should restrict ourselves and exercise discipline over our own voice, like the Lord, whose voice was not heard in the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let us learn to muzzle our mouth from unwarranted noise, shouting, crying, and clamor.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This does not mean that we should try to act in a sober and quiet way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to be spontaneous, and when we meet others, we have to speak with them in a proper and natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But the fact remains that those who have never been disciplined in their speaking will face difficult times in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We hope that all the workers of the Lord will learn to be finer and more tender and that no one will be rough and uncouth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our Lord is very fine and tender.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He did not strive or cry out, and no one heard His voice in the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's servants should give others the impression that they are fine and tender persons before the Lord.</S>
