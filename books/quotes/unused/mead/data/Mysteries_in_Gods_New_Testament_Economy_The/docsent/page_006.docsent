   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PROSPEROUS SITUATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This time during the Asia elders' and co-workers' meeting, besides the elders and co-workers on the whole island plus those from overseas churches, we have two hundred eighty full-time brothers and sisters who are here as participants.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Approximately two hundred among them are involved in the gospel outreach work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The other eighty are trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since January of last year, four groups have moved out to the villages for the spread of the gospel, and sixty-one churches have been raised up, bringing in approximately two thousand remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the past, the item which was most attacked was the Full-time Training.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But today by looking at the manifested result, you can see for yourself whether that was something outward or something intrinsic.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At present, doors are opened to the Lord's recovery in all six continents of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mainly they were opened through our publications and through the video and audio tapes of messages.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In places like Mexico, Central America, and South America, it is not the opening of city after city, but the opening of whole continents.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The need is unprecedented in the history of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even Africa and India in Asia are also opened up, not to mention many other places.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even if we had many more people, they would not be able to meet the demand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are truly short of manpower.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In southern California alone, we are unable to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason, we have to continue with this training.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now the ones sent out from here are welcomed everywhere they go.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Especially now that the Chinese-speaking meetings are springing up everywhere abroad like green shoots after the rainy season, the potential is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>REMOVING DOUBTS AND MOVING FORWARD</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, there is still one thing which causes my heart to ache very much.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From the time the Lord's recovery moved from the mainland to overseas, that is, since 1949 when we came to Taiwan, it has been forty years already.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our standard and quality is still not high enough.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some places are still at the kindergarten stage; they are merely maintaining a minimum testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord's recovery on earth is involved in a work of education.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should be continually uplifted and deepened in truth and life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During the recent storm, I was generally aware of the criticisms in all the places.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please pardon me and give me the liberty to be a fool and to speak the words of a fool.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have no intention to rebuke anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I only ask you to remove your doubts and to throw them all away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These doubts are not only hurting others but are even the more hurting yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I speak this word so that you will remove your doubts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord's recovery has absolutely no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If there is any doubt in you, I beg you to leave that behind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no problem in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no problem in Taipei, and there is no problem in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have already said this clearly in the book The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have spoken all these words not for myself, but for you who have come from afar.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You have sacrificed your time, your energy, and your money.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You have laid aside your jobs and families to come here.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am very grateful for this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you still have some doubts in you, they are unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is nothing to worry about.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord's truth is still among us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord's recovery has no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, please take this frank little fellowship in love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I pray that the Lord would be merciful to me and also to you, that from today we would not speak much concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I also hope that you would not discuss this matter behind our back anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let the past be past.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Forget the things that are behind, and press forward to the things that are before, so that we can all go on together.</S>
