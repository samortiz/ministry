   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOAL OF THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the goal of ministering to others with the word?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The purpose of ministering to others is not merely to deliver them out of their dire situations or to bring them through their trials.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must have a specific goal in ministering to others: The goal is that they would know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All revelations are revelations of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Unless a revelation is a revelation of Christ, it is not a worthwhile revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All revelations are given for the purpose of revealing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should realize that the ultimate goal of the ministry of the word is to lead men to know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When God puts us in a certain environment or allows us to face certain difficulties, we are faced with a great sense of need; we find that we are forced to seek the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should remember that every discipline of the Holy Spirit unveils a need to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Holy Spirit puts us in an environment in order to show us a need and to show us that we can never meet the need or overcome the situation by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At such times, our only solution is to know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without such a need, a man will not seek to know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without his thorn, Paul would not have known the grace of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The experience of a trial is not just for the sake of passing through the trial; it is for knowing the Lord through the trial.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul did not say, "All right, I will simply suffer."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, he said that he knew grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means he knew the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has to use the Spirit's discipline to create a need in us which can only be satisfied by the Lord; only the Lord can bring us through.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a need induces us to know certain aspects and attributes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second Corinthians 12 shows us that Paul's knowledge of the Lord's power was acquired through his weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he encountered pain, he found grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The thorn weakened him, but the thorn also led him to the knowledge of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord put him in weaknesses in order for him to have the knowledge of power.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He put him in sufferings in order for him to have the knowledge of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Where there is the need, there is the knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A certain kind of need produces a certain kind of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we want to have a full knowledge of the Lord, we have to have a wide range of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If our experience is limited, our knowledge of the Lord will be incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Perhaps we have known the Lord in many ways, yet our knowledge of Him concerning a certain matter is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to know the Lord, we have to know Him in a complete way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the discipline of the Spirit is not complete, our knowledge of the Lord will not be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the discipline we receive is short, we will not have the right word to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to pray that God would train us, that is, put us in all kinds of environments and trials.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the same time we have to give God the opportunity to bring us through such trials.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we yield ourselves to the trials, we afford the Lord the opportunity to give us more knowledge of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we face a dealing today, we will have a new realization of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we receive another dealing tomorrow, we will have another fresh realization of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this way, our knowledge of Christ will increase day by day, and we can minister the Christ we know to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What then is the word?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The word which we receive in our trials and discipline comes from our knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today there are thousands and millions of God's children in the church, but their knowledge of Christ is too limited.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some only know one or two things about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is the need for ministers to be raised up who will give God's children more knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A minister of the word, through the variety of trials that he experiences, acquires a wide range of knowledge of Christ and is equipped with an abundance of words.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These words are given so that he can minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the reason that we say that God's word is His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's word is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What we know through the word is what we know through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today we may find a brother here or there in the church who is short of the knowledge of Christ in one or more aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By the mercy of God, we may have passed through a certain experience, and our knowledge of the Lord gained through this experience will enable us to supply him with our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whatever he lacks, we will be able to supply him and fill up his lack.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We will be able to serve God's children because we have first learned the right lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If our ministry is built upon this foundation, our word will be God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At times, we make use of others' experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But it is not a simple matter to use others' experiences, because this results in too much activity in the mind if we are not careful.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many clever people make use of others' experiences all the time; they have no experience of their own.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They are blank before God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before one can draw from others' experiences, he himself must have gone through many dealings before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whenever we borrow an experience from someone, we have to preserve it and cultivate it in our own spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our own experiences must be preserved in our spirit as well.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Anything that is preserved in the spirit is living.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Suppose we acquire knowledge about the Body of Christ from God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This knowledge has to be cultivated in our spirit before it can be used to lead others to a knowledge of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is all right for us to borrow others' experiences as long as we have something in our spirit first.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But if we are individualistic and do not know anything about the Body of Christ and if there is nothing in our spirit, we cannot make use of others' experience.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must be those who are living in the Body of Christ and our experience must be nurtured in our spirit before we can serve others with such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we do not have these things, everything is an exercise of the mind, and it is powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We may think that we have delivered a logical message, but we have not touched the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When others listen to us, they do not touch the real thing.</S>
