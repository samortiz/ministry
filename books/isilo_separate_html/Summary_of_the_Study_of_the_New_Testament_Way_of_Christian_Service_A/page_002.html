I began this study in October of 1984. In this four and a half year study, the Lord has shown us four major points: the practice of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God, the practice of the raising up of the new believers, the practice of the perfecting of the saints, and the practice of prophesying-speaking for God and Christ, speaking forth God and Christ to impart (dispense) God and Christ into others, to minister Christ as life and life supply to people. These four practices are the practice of the Lord&#8217;s advanced recovery today. These points are very new to us. I consider them as new light, a new vision to us from the Lord.<p>The Lord has shown us the practice of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God (Rom. 15:16). This practice involves preaching the gospel by visiting people. Throughout church history, some lovers of Jesus practiced preaching the gospel by visiting people. This is not altogether new to us, but it has not been a general practice among us. We have not paid much attention to it. Two heretical groups, the Mormons and the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, practice visiting people in their homes. As a result, some devoted Christians may have despised this practice. But no one can say that preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes is wrong. No one has the ground to condemn such a practice. We knocked on the doors of half a million homes in Taipei, and we baptized approximately thirty-eight thousand people. To preach the gospel by visiting people is the main principle of gospel preaching in the New Testament. Christ came to visit people. The preaching of the gospel by visiting people where they are is a new practice among us.<p>In these recent years, the Lord has particularly impressed us with the priesthood of the gospel of God in the New Testament. First Peter and Revelation tell us that all the believers are priests, a universal priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:5b-6a; 5:9b-10). All the New Testament believers are priests, and the New Testament priests are the priests of the gospel of God. According to Romans 15:16, Paul considered himself as a New Testament priest of the gospel.<p>The main duty of the priests in the Old Testament was to offer the sacrifices to God. It was not until recently that the Lord showed us the main offerings which the New Testament priests offer to God. According to Romans 15:16, Paul was a New Testament priest offering the saved sinners to God as sacrifices. We feel that the best translation of this verse is as follows: &#8220;That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, a laboring priest of the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Paul was a priest who was laboring and ministering. He was a laboring priest of the gospel of God. We are not merely preachers of the gospel but priests of the gospel.<p>After people believe and are baptized through our priestly labor, they need to be raised up in the Lord. Therefore, we need to have home meetings with them to nourish and cherish them until they are established in the faith. Gradually, the Lord showed us that we need to have group meetings to take care of the new believers that they may grow not only in life but also in truth. The group meetings are for perfecting the saints in life and in truth.<p>The fourth item in the practice of the Lord&#8217;s advanced recovery today is the practice of prophesying in the church meetings. The church meeting in mutuality with all speaking for building up was seen by Brother Watchman Nee more than fifty years ago. We saw what was required by God in the New Testament concerning the church meetings of mutuality. We had the vision, but we did not have the way to practice it. Now the Lord is bringing us into the practice of having church meetings with all prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ.<p>Within the last ten years, I believe that many of us were considering the way we should take to practice the Lord&#8217;s recovery. We were not that certain or definite in every step which we were taking for the Lord&#8217;s recovery. The four practices that the Lord has shown us in His present recovery are the conclusion of our four and a half year study beginning in October of 1984. They are very certain and definite. They are the scriptural, God-ordained way of Christian service for the organic building up of the Body of Christ. According to the New Testament teaching, we should practice this God-ordained way in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. We have already spoken much concerning the practice of the Lord&#8217;s advanced recovery today, and we have printed much literature on this subject. What we will present in this small book is a summary of what we have received as a result of our four and a half year study. This may be considered as a summary of the study of the New Testament way of Christian service.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
