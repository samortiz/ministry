GOD BEING A SPEAKING GOD</H2><P>Our God is a speaking God (Heb. 1:1-2a). Since God is our Father, we as His children must follow Him to speak. We should speak all the time, but we should not speak in the way of murmuring or gossiping. Instead, we should speak the word of life (Phil. 2:16).</P><P>Hebrews 1:1-2a says, "God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son." In times of old God spoke to the fathers in the prophets, but now He is speaking in His Son. Actually, "the Son" mentioned in verse 2 is corporate. Today we believers are a part of the Son. God is still speaking in the Son. Throughout the past twenty centuries, the speaking of those who spoke forth the Lord according to the New Testament and its principles has been the Son's speaking. In the New Testament, the apostle Paul is an example of one whose speaking was the Son's speaking.</P><P>We have stressed that the entire New Testament is the teaching of the apostles (Acts 2:42). Therefore, if we teach the same thing as the New Testament teaches, our teaching is also a part of the apostles' teaching. Some dissenting ones have said that the apostles' teaching comprises only what the Lord Jesus spoke in the four Gospels and what He charged His disciples to teach others. They have neglected the Lord's word in John 16 which says, "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming" (vv. 12-13). No doubt, the place where the Lord declared the "many things" is in the Epistles.</P><P>Some Christians also consider that only the words spoken directly by the Lord Himself in the four Gospels are the Lord's word. They do not believe that what was spoken after the four Gospels in Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation is the Lord's word. This is not according to the truth. In Colossians 1:25 Paul said that he was commissioned to complete the word of God. This indicates that before Paul's writings, the holy Word in the Bible was not yet complete. The holy Word was not complete in regard to God's economy and the mystery of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. GOD EVEN BEING THE WORD</H2><P>God is even the Word (John 1:1). We must receive grace that we ourselves also would become the word, that is, God's speaking. Some may ridicule us by saying that "you are the word of God." They say this because we speak the word of God to them. In a sense, we are the word of God to people. We are the ones from whom they hear the word of God. Thus, we are the word of God to them. When we go to visit sinners, we must not forget that we are the word of God to them. Our going to visit them means that the word of God is also going to visit them. When we visit sinners, we must utter something of God's word to them. Therefore, we must learn to speak.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
