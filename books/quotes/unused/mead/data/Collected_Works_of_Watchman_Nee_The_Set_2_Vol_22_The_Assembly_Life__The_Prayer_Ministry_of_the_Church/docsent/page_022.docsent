   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: Suppose a brother has a letter of recommendation from the church in Tsinan, and he comes to meet with the assembly in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Later, if he is excommunicated by the assembly in Shanghai, should the brothers in Tsinan be consulted before he is excommunicated?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: When the letter of recommendation is received, we should receive this person according to the letter of recommendation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later, if we find out that this person is not yet saved, we can excommunicate him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the brothers in Tsinan are willing to recommend him, their decision must be right; we should believe in the words of the brothers in Tsinan absolutely and receive him initially.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if later we deal with this person and excommunicate him, we do not have to inform the brothers in Tsinan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is like excommunicating a brother who has always been meeting in the assembly in Shanghai; there is no need to inform the brothers in Tsinan of such a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When that person comes to the assembly in Shanghai with a letter of recommendation, he is received by the brothers in Shanghai and is treated like all other brothers in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we accept a letter of recommendation from the brothers in Tsinan, we have accepted the brother, referred to in the letter, as a brother in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thereafter, the assembly in Shanghai has the authority to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Question: Can we break bread in Kun-shan Garden?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we break bread there, are we acting contrary to the truth of the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Answer: At present, there are three tables in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are not sure that the table in Hardoon Road is right, we should not come here tomorrow for the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we break bread at a table, we should acknowledge that it represents the whole Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The table at Kun-shan Garden is of a certain group of the Exclusive Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They have a closed attitude and communicate only with those who fellowship with them; they do not fellowship with everyone who has fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their fellowship includes only so many.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even if you are a very good brother, they will not receive you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have to cut off your relationship with all other Christians before they will receive you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are one of the seven or eight groups of Exclusive Brethren, and these seven or eight groups do not even receive one another.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If there are two bread-breaking meetings in one place, we have to distinguish which is the right one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a meeting is raised up in one place, and another meeting is raised up in the same place, we cannot go to both places.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to ask if the second meeting is also standing on the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If both of them are standing on the ground of the church, they will surely fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is like the relationship the meeting in Wen-teh Lane has with the meeting in Gordon Lane.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who have been received by the meeting in Wen-teh Lane are also received by the meeting in Gordon Lane.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reverse is also true because we have only one fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not have the same fellowship, we cannot go to both places even when the form of the meetings in the two places is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must investigate and determine which meeting represents the church and meets on the ground of the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a meeting is not meeting in this way, it is a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I was in America, it was right for me to break bread with Dr. and Mrs. Stearn.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It would have been wrong if I had broken bread with those whom they would not recognize.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The reason for this is that I had broken bread with them in Tsinan already.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In a place where there is no assembly yet, we can act freely and set up the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course, we must also establish the oneness with the brothers whom we have fellowship with.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It would be wrong if I went to Hangchow and gathered a few people to set up a table, because there is a table in Hangchow already.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brother Luan would surely tell me that I should not set up another table.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If that happened, I would need to confess my mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Brethren say that they cannot receive anyone to their bread-breaking meeting who has not left the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But this makes them another sect.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As for us, we can fellowship with all those who are saved in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose that there were no bread-breaking meeting in Ningpo.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If two or three brothers went to Ningpo from Tsinan, they could start the bread- breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Question: In Peking, there is a bread-breaking meeting, but the brothers there are quite weak.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Can I break bread there and also go to another place to listen to a famous speaker?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Answer: It is not absolutely wrong to go to another place to listen to some famous speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do not forbid our people to go to other places to hear other speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But we have to make one thing clear: when you go to hear them, there is a limitation to your communication with them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the goal of their works is not up to the standard of God's goal, their works are not God's work according to the biblical standard.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have said that God's work is not an evangelistic crusade, a society for the promotion of some cause, a Sunday school, or a revival campaign.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From the beginning, God's work has been only one thing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His work in every place is the building up of the local church in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everything that comes short of this, that is, everything that endeavors for less than this goal, is not God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am not saying that evangelistic crusades and Bible studies are bad.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But if one only does these works and does not come up to the standard of the local church, he has not come up to the standard of God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In reality, he is lowering the standard of God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God's work in the book of Acts was nothing less than the local church; it never came short of this and never fell short of this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today, there are those in the church who preach the truth, lead others to salvation, or conduct Bible studies, preachings, or evangelistic meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Believers can do all of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But we have to lay hold of God's goal; we must come up to the standard of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am afraid that although many works are good, they do not come up to the standard of God's work, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I believe there are many gifted ones who are not with us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I also believe that if we are more faithful, God will raise up gifted ones among us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we live in God's light, there will not be the need for us to go to outsiders for messages.</S>
