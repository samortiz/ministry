   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO EXPERIENCE AND MINISTER CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After we have learned the truth, we still have to experience Christ so that He may become our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this way, when we speak to people, we will not give them knowledge or doctrines, but we will minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For instance, if we tell people about the benefit of Coca-Cola yet do not give them a can of Coca-Cola to drink, then no matter how interesting our speaking is, they will not be able to enjoy the benefit of Coca-Cola.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is mere speaking without supply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the past we mostly knew only to supply but not to speak; that also was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The proper practice is that we would all learn to speak Christ and minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Acts 5:42 tells us that the early disciples announced the gospel of Jesus as the Christ; this means they announced Jesus Christ as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What they announced was not an empty doctrine nor an elusive gospel but a living Jesus Christ, who is the reality and content of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After their preaching, once men received the gospel, they spontaneously received Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Ephesians 3:8, Paul said that he announced to people the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that Paul did not announce some doctrines; rather, he supplied them practically with the riches of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, Paul told us that Christ has both divinity and humanity Rom 1:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that He was God and man, possessing all the divine attributes and human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is an item of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, He also passed through human living, experienced all the trials and ordeals of human life, and endured all the pains of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then He went to the cross and died, and in His death He terminated all things and accomplished redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After His death, He resurrected and became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This life-giving Spirit is the Triune God, comprising the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the attributes of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, including love, light, holiness, righteousness, life, power, authority, peace, and joy, are items of the unsearchable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, how can all these riches become our practical experience?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How do we minister such a Christ to others in our speaking?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must tell people that this Christ, who possesses all these unsearchable riches, is now the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the Redeemer who has accomplished redemption for us, and He is the Savior who is waiting to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This Spirit, being omnipresent, is in our heart and in our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As long as we confess, repent, and call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, opening our mouth and believing in our heart, the Spirit will enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Spirit comes into us, He comes with all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From then on, as long as we call on Him, breathe Him, and enjoy Him day by day, all His riches will become our experience, and His attributes such as love, light, holiness, and righteousness will become our virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we will realize that our love is boundless, our patience is enduring and transcendent, and our power is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After speaking to people, we should also pray with them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once they pray, the Spirit will come into them and enable them to touch the reality and comprehend and receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the way to minister Christ to people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, we should speak the truth and present Christ clearly to them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we should pray with them to supply them practically in spirit with what we spoke to them, so that they can receive the Christ whom we have announced.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH DEPENDING ON</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE SPREAD OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The slow increase in the churches is due to the fact that we do not know how to speak the truth or how to minister Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not know how to present Christ clearly as the truth to people, nor do we know how to supply them with Christ as the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why after all these years it has been difficult for us to have people remain in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I hope that from now on we all would spend time to learn the truth and minister Christ to others for the multiplication and spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For instance, as college students you probably have thirty to forty classmates in your class.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You can find at least two or three friends from these to talk to about the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>College students like to listen to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you do not preach the truth but only chat with them, talking about all sorts of topics every day, when you graduate after four years, you will not have brought anyone to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You must make a change now and redeem the time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Aside from time for your schoolwork, you should not waste any time but always seize every opportunity to speak the truth to your classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more clearly you present the truth, the more they will enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They will also respect you because you know the Bible and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Perhaps they have attended mass in the Catholic Church for twenty years or have been to Sunday services in the denominations for more than ten years, but they may have never heard the things that you speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As long as you speak Christ in a clear, well-founded, and logical way, they will take your word seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to thoroughly and comprehensibly explain to people the truths concerning redemption and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Redemption and salvation are two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Redemption resolves the problem of our sins, redeems us back to God, and deals with the problem of our position.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It includes forgiveness, cleansing, justification, reconciliation, and acceptance by God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Salvation is related to God s purpose and includes God s regenerating, sanctifying, renewing, transforming, and conforming us into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In addition, it also includes His glory eventually being manifested from within us for our full glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more clearly we speak this, the more people will enjoy it, and in the end they will be subdued by us and will appreciate and respect what we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the young people would speak to their classmates in this way, they would build up some credibility among them and gain their respect and trust.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we cut straight the truth and reveal the light of the Word to them, they will spontaneously show their respect, and the Holy Spirit will also work in them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we speak to people, the Holy Spirit will touch them, causing them to feel convicted and then to repent, confess, and pray unto their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thus, to lead people to be saved is not a hard thing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we do not know how to speak the truth, we may only tell people, Our church is really good; when we sing, everyone shouts Hallelujah joyfully, and when people share, everyone says Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, if someone asks us why we do this, I am afraid that we will not be able to give an answer because we may not be clear ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then these people will have no way to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must practice this matter with wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do not say too much at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For example, in the four years of college you will have some classmates who attend classes and study with you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You can plan how to speak to them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Perhaps in the first two months you will not find a good opportunity, but you can speak a little.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Gradually they will notice that your Bible knowledge is advanced and that your knowledge of the truth is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At this time, whenever there is a chance, you have to open the Bible and speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You can tell them that God created man in His image, that as a result of this we all have God s image, and that we are not ordinary but noble people because we were created in God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They will surely be surprised upon hearing this and will want to hear more.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then you can speak to them little by little every time you see them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you do this, one by one, your classmates will be saved through you.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should do this not only in the schools but also with our neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In time, all our neighbors will realize that we are those who know the Bible, who are clear about the truth, and who experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They will sense that we are well-behaved and have a high character, so they will respect our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once we open our mouths, they will regard highly what we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Eventually, surely some will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should also speak to our parents and relatives in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Once they respect and trust us, it will not be too difficult for us to bring them to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the way to minister the truth to people and to bring them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I hope that we all can bring one person to the Lord each year.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Do not think that this way of increase is very slow; it is, in fact, very fast.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Take Taipei as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Now there are five thousand saints in the church in Taipei, and the population of the city of Taipei is two million.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There are three hundred and sixty-five days, or fifty-two weeks, in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It would be very easy for every saint to lead one person to be saved each year.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In this way, we will double our number each year.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then in less than ten years we will have gospelized the whole city of Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We have already pointed out that the church is God s garden.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Since it is a garden, it surely has to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Suppose there is a fruit tree which bears only one piece of fruit a year, either one banana or one mango.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If we saw this, would we be happy or sad?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The increase is so slow because we do not know how to speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If we cannot even explain the names Jesus and Christ clearly, how can we touch people?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we merely rely on gospel meetings, we will waste our energy, and in the end, people will not want to come.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We can no longer rely on evangelizing campaigns or gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Instead, we should all speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We all should speak to our classmates, neighbors, and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Do not speak too much at a time, but speak to them little by little, twice a week.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>One time you may tell them that man was created in God s image, the next time you may tell them about man s fall, and then you may speak of Christ s redemption and God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>For instance, in the beginning we may simply tell people, You are very good, but have you ever lost your temper?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If we always murmur and envy people, this proves that we are fallen sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>However, God was incarnated to become a man who possessed both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He is the God of love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we believe in Him and receive Him, we will be able to live out the human virtues of love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Therefore, we must believe in Him and receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If we speak to people like this twice a week, I believe that after some time we will surely bring one person to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>However, the key is that we lead people to pray and call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We have to tell them, Today the Lord is the real and living Spirit, and He is in your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>As long as you are willing to repent, open your mouth to call on Him, pray to Him, and believe in Him, He will enter into you and bring you into the experience of all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Eventually, you will not only lead one person to salvation in a year but perhaps four to five people.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This kind of increase would be tremendous.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>In short, the reason we cannot lead people to the Lord is that we do not know how to speak the truth or minister Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Hence, much of our labor is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Now I hope that we all would be awakened, would rise up to learn the truth, and would experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Only the truth can subdue and gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We have to learn, starting with the basics and going on to understand the fundamental truths and to study the deeper truths.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>If we do this, I believe that in five years we will become a group of wonderful saints who will not only know how to speak the truth but also will be able to minister Christ to people through the Spirit, to pray with them, and to open their eyes that they may also gain Christ and receive Jesus as their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>In this way the church will be able to gain the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>REDEEMING THE TIME TO LEARN THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>I hope that not one among us would say that he does not have time.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Some people say that they are really busy, but once they get on the telephone, they spend half an hour to an hour gossiping.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>If we would save our time to learn the truth, we would have more than enough time.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>It is very easy for us to waste time in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Hence, Paul told us to redeem the time Eph 5:16; Col 4:5 and understand what the will of the Lord is Eph 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>To redeem the time means to grasp every opportunity, and the way to redeem the time is to not make any casual telephone calls, to not gossip, and to not waste time.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Instead, we should save all our time to learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>In the past when someone wanted to learn the truth, it was not that easy for him to find reference books, but now there are many spiritual publications among us, and most of them are related to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>If we have the desire to enter into the truth, there is no lack of reference books, and they are not difficult to get into.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>As long as we are willing to put in the effort, soon we all will be able to speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>I hope that we all would meet the Lord s demand and make such a vow, so that from today onward we will save our time by not gossiping, not making unnecessary telephone calls, and not wasting our time.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Rather, we would endeavor to use the time to learn the truth, to know the truth, to speak the truth, to experience Christ through the truth, and to minister Christ to people by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>If we do this, the Lord will be able to gain a broad and opened way in every place.</S>
