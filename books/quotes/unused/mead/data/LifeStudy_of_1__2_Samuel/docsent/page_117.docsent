   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN A PROPHECY CONCERNING THE SEED OF DAVID</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING CALLED THE SON OF GOD Scripture Reading: 2 Sam 7:12-14a; Matt 22:41-45; Rev 22:16; Isa 11:1; Matt 26:63-64; Rom 1:3-4</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message I have the burden to give a further word on 2 Samuel 7:12-14a.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE SEED OF DAVID AND THE SON OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second Samuel 7:12 refers to the seed of David.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, this human seed becomes the Son of God v. 14 . Concerning this, the Lord Jesus asked a question of the Pharisees Matt 22:41-45 . First, He asked them, "What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He?" v. 42 . When they said that Christ was David's son, the Lord Jesus went on to ask how David could call Him Lord v. 43 . Finally, He said, "If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?" v. 45 . This is the greatest question in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How could Christ be the seed of a man and also the Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How could He be the son of David and also David's Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Pharisees knew the Bible very well, but when the Lord Jesus questioned them concerning the two aspects of His person, their mouths were shut.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Pharisees realized that Christ was the seed of David, and they answered without any hesitation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But when the Lord Jesus asked why David, a forefather of Christ, called Christ the Lord, they could not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, He was a man; on the other hand, He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No one can reconcile these two.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The study of Christ's person, Christology, began with the second generation of the church fathers, and it became a great concern among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today, however, most believers would not pay much attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They know that God is Christ and that Christ is their Savior and their Redeemer, but if we ask them how Christ can be God and also man, they cannot answer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>CHRIST STILL BEING</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A MAN WITH A PHYSICAL BODY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>AFTER HIS RESURRECTION AND ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today there are many who do not believe that Christ in His resurrection and ascension still has a physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They believe that when Christ died He died in the body, but when He resurrected He put off the body and resurrected only as a divine person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of this wrong understanding, there are many verses in the Bible which they have no way to interpret.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Root and the Offspring of David</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Revelation 22:16 says that Jesus is "the Root and the Offspring of David."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is God; thus, He can be the source, the Root, of David.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This refers to His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the same time, He is also a man; hence He is the Offspring, the issue, of David.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This refers to His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>David came out of Him as the Root, and as the Offspring He came out of David.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Isaiah 11:1 says, "There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All knowledgeable teachers of the Bible agree that this verse refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At Solomon's time the house of David was a flourishing tree, but a short time later that tree began to be cut down.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, it became a stump consisting mainly of two persons Joseph and Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Out of that stump a rod, a sprout, came out the little child Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That was God's building a house for David and giving David a seed.</S>
