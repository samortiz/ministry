   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE RENEWING OF THE INNER MAN OUTLINE The Lord is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord as the Spirit is the treasure in us as earthen vessels 4:7.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because we have the Lord as life in our spirit, our spirit becomes our inner man Eph 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our inner man takes Christ as the person Gal 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our outer man needs to decay so that our inner man may be renewed 2 Cor 4:16.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are being transformed into the image of the Lord, even as from the Lord Spirit, by the renewing of our inner man 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be transformed by the renewing of the mind requires the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit to be with us 2 Cor 13:14.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this message we will consider the renewing of the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This subject is both profound and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to make progress in spiritual matters, we need to learn to go deeper into them and to touch them in a deep and detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This will be our approach as we consider the renewing of the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>MAN HAVING A SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our physical body is outward and superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, within our body we have something that is most precious, something that neither scientists nor medical doctors are able to locate.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is our spirit Job 32:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible clearly reveals that man has three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First Thessalonians 5:23 says, And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This verse distinguishes the spirit from the soul, putting the word and between the two words.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This clearly shows us that the spirit and the soul are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The genuineness of our person is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes when we smile, our smile may not be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Genuineness comes not only from the heart but also from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we lose our temper, our spirit comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that moment we are being genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we become indignant or infuriated, our spirit really comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we get angry to such an extent, we forget about our rationality, our face, and our relationship with others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a result, our spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This kind of release of the spirit, however, is not normal but abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, in such a situation our spirit does come out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The spirit of most people is not released easily.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is even more difficult for the spirit of a person who is very patient and refined to be released, for even when such a person is furious within, outwardly he can appear quite rational and cheerful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He knows how to control himself, but he is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His refined manner is a pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can illustrate the three parts of man with three concentric circles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The outer circle represents man s body, the middle circle, which is within the outer circle, represents man s soul, and the inner circle, which is within the middle circle, represents man s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man s soul is within his body, and man s spirit is within his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everyone is familiar with the body, but the soul is a bit more complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Man s soul has three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first part, which is the leading part, is the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The mind is the faculty by which we think.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The mind can consider, memorize, comprehend, infer, and analyze.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The emotion, which is the second part of the soul, is also quite strong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The emotion can love, desire, hate, and have joy or sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The third part of the soul is the will.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The will can make plans and decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, the soul is composed of these three parts the mind, the emotion, and the will.</S>
