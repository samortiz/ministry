   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a result of man's first fall, man was put under the curse 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the curse?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ultimately, the curse is death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Death, including all other sufferings, is the consummation of the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our offering of Christ to God through the cross keeps the curse away.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All murmurings, gossipings, criticisms, complainings, etc. are signs of the curse of death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All these are done away by the experience of Christ through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without the experience of Christ through the cross, we would be under the curse of death, murmuring, gossiping, criticizing, and complaining.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then, if we come to the church meeting, we shall be under the curse of death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever we come to a meeting and have the sensation that the meeting is under death, it means that the meeting is more or less under some curse.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when we come to a meeting and it is filled with life and we have the sensation that something is living, glowing, and shining, there is no curse there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The curse is kept away.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead of the curse of death, we have the blessing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Bible, the consummate curse is death, and the greatest blessing is life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Life is the commanded blessing of God Psa 133:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a good meeting of the church, death is swallowed up and the curse is kept away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3 Bringing Blessing to the Earth</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eight items are mentioned in Genesis 8:22.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first is the seedtime, the time of sowing the seed.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must preach the gospel and minister Christ as the seed of life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we sow Him, then we have the seedtime.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After this, we have the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The seedtime is the beginning, and the harvest is the consummation, the time of reaping.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must also be cold to the self, the flesh, the soul-life, and to all other negative things.</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because they do not have the proper life, they are under the curse.</S>
