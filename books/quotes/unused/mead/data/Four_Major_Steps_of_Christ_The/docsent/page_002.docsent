   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FOUR MAJOR STEPS OF CHRIST I. INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is my burden that in the following messages we should see something very basic in the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This may be divided into four major steps: 1 the incarnation, 2 the crucifixion, 3 the resurrection, and 4 the ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Firstly, we need to say a few words regarding the eternal purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Scripture reveals to us that in eternity past God designed a plan according to His own good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In that plan God purposed to express Himself through His Son Jesus Christ and to have Jesus Christ expressed through a group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is how the hidden, invisible God would be manifested 1 Tim 3:16 and at the same time Christ would be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ should have the preeminence, the first place in all things Col 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But all this depends upon one thing: that Christ be wrought into a people as their all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These people, mingled with the full measure of God's life in Christ, would be a living Body to Christ Eph 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the central point of all Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must realize, however, that God's divine plan must be wholly accomplished in and through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although it had been planned in eternity past by God and was accomplished by Christ, yet it must be realized in us by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In these messages, therefore, we will see what it means to experience the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us start at the first major step of Christ, the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What does the incarnation of Christ mean?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We know that Christ is God incarnated as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is not only a man of God; He is also a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the incarnation of Christ simply means the mingling of God with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Mingling is much more than mixing together; it is an intrinsic union.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the entire history of mankind such a thing had never occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For four thousand years, God was God and man was man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yes, man had something to do with God, and God sometimes made contact with man; yet the two remained separate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, when Christ was born as a man, a strange and wonderful event took place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A child was born, a child who was called the Mighty God Isa 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Can you believe this a child called the Mighty God!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Have you ever considered the difference between the God of the Hebrews and the God of the Christians?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The God whom the Hebrews believe is only the Almighty Creator, but the God in whom we believe is more.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is still the Almighty God, but He is the Almighty One who came into humanity, born of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All that our Mighty Creator is and has, was in that little child.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This little child was not born into a noble family nor raised in a city of fame Matt 2:23; John 1:45-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was brought up in a lowly family to do the work of a carpenter Matt 13:55; Mark 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was a child; yet He was God Heb 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was a laborer, a carpenter; yet He was the Almighty Creator of the whole universe John 1:3; Heb 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps we have been Christians many years, yet have never been impressed with this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is indeed inconceivable to our natural mind that the Almighty God would one day mingle Himself with a man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But this was accomplished in Jesus Christ, and this is the very desire of God for you and me that He be mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do you know what it means to be a real Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be a Christian simply means to be mingled with God, to be a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not enough to be a good man; we have to be a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A good man might be a man of the tree of knowledge, the result of which is death Gen 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A God-man is a man of the tree of life Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In his spirit, God is mingled; in his heart, God is dwelling; in his soul mind, emotion, and will God is occupying.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a real, normal Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The first person who was mingled with God was Jesus Matt 1:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do you realize why He is so precious to us?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because in Him is the universal mingling of God with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should spend some time before the Lord, and say, "Lord, reveal to me the meaning of the mingling of God with man."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should ask ourselves, "Do I realize it, do I experience it, do I live in it?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we would bring this to the Lord, I believe our whole life would be revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We would realize that we are "peculiar," "strange," set apart from society because God is mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Think how wonderful it is that human beings such as we could have God as life, dwelling within and occupying our whole being!</S>
