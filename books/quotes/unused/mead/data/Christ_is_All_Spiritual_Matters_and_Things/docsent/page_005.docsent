   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO CHRIST IS THE RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE LIFE Scripture Reading: John 11:25 WHAT HE DOES VERSUS WHAT HE IS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chapter eleven of the Gospel of John shows us how the Lord Jesus gave life to a dead person; it shows us how the Lord Jesus resurrected a person from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord can resurrect man, but He did not say, I will resurrect the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, He said, I am the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After He said these words, He resurrected a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both Martha and Mary were there on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To them, it would have been better for the Lord Jesus to say, It does not matter that your brother has died; I can resurrect him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We like to hear this kind of word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our desire and hope is that God will do something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We often pray, hope, and wait before God for a word concerning what He will do for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the Lord does not want to show us what He will do; He wants to show us what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What He can do is based on what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Martha believed in the Lord s power.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She said to Jesus, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died v. 21 . Martha believed in God s power, and she also believed in the Lord Jesus power, but she did not see that the Lord Himself is the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must see that everything God can do is included in what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reason a man does not have God s power is that he does not know what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He who comes forward to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him Heb 11:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the power that God has is based upon what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus was not saying that He can preserve a man s life, but that He Himself is life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was not telling us of His ability to resurrect men, but of the fact that He Himself is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May God open our eyes to see who the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must see that in God s eyes, Christ is our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once we have this kind of understanding, it is possible to have genuine growth in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must realize that in God s eyes, there is not any other object; the only object is Christ Himself!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether or not we grow spiritually depends on whether we have truly touched spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, do we just know the individual things that God has done, or do we know God Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 11 does not say that the Lord Jesus resurrected Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead it says that the Lord Jesus was resurrection to Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brothers and sisters, do you see the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord was resurrection to Lazarus, and then Lazarus was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord did not give resurrection as a thing to Lazarus; He became resurrection to Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, what the Lord does is only the appearance; what He is is the reality of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are not saying that the Lord did not resurrect Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are saying that Lazarus resurrected because the Lord was resurrection to him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must remember that everything that God does in Christ is done in this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Lord is something to me, that something comes into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First He is, then He has.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many Christians separate the Grace-giver from the grace given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day we will find out that the Grace-giver is the very gift given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has not given us many things; He has only given us the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All spiritual things and all of God s gifts are but Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God does not give us something piece by piece.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God has given us Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day God will open our eyes to see that everything is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How wonderful it will be if we see this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In declaring who He is, the Lord said, I am the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why His delaying did not cause a problem in the resurrection of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In raising up Lazarus, the Lord was trying to lead men to the knowledge of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The resurrection of Lazarus was not the greatest thing; the greatest thing is to know that the Lord Jesus is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many people believe that the Lord Jesus is the Life-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But it is altogether different to believe that the Lord Himself is life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is not only the Life-giver; He is also the life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is the Life-giver, and He is the life which He gives.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is not only the Lord who resurrects; He is resurrection itself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once you see this, you will see that everything in Christ is living.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God has only given Christ to man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We hope that at least a little light will shine on us so that we can know that the Lord is everything and know Him as such a Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is the Grace-giver, and He is also the grace given.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our Lord said, I am the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Resurrection and life encompass the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is wonderful to know the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Let us now see what life is.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>CHRIST IS THE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God placed the man whom He had created in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There were two options before the man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>One was to receive life, and the other was to die.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the result would be death.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But if he ate of the fruit of the tree of life, he would receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The man created by God was good, but there was still one unresolved question the question of life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the garden of Eden man could think and act, but he did not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are not saying that he was not alive.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As far as his natural life was concerned, man was alive.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Genesis 2:7 speaks of man being a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Nevertheless, as far as the life represented by the tree of life was concerned, man did not yet have life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The life we are speaking of is this life represented by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>At the time of Genesis 2, although man was alive, he had no life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Man had sound thoughts and sound feelings these two being the most important elements of man s soul , but he did not have the life represented by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>From this we see that life is deeper than feelings and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In Christianity, there are counterfeits to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There is false repentance, false confession, false salvation, false zeal, false love, false spiritual works, and false spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Everything can be counterfeited; even life can be counterfeited.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Many Christians think that good feelings are life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They think that an exciting atmosphere and loud noises are life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If you ask them what life is, they will not separate life from feelings; they always mix the two together.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They do not realize that life is deeper than feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Other Christians do not take feelings as life, yet they take mental activity as life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This means that if there are enough ideas in a message to invoke mental activity, enough words to stir up one s interest, and enough doctrines to inspire admiration, they think that this is life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But those who are experienced and who have learned some lessons tell us that life is deeper than feelings and mental activities.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Neither is life a kind of activity.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We cannot say that just because a person is lively, energetic, and active, he has life.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>These are merely activities; they are not life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They are merely the performing of some activities; they are not the living of a life.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We are not saying that life does not express itself in mental activities, feelings, or actions.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We are saying that life is not feelings, mental activities, or actions.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The words that come out of one person s mouth may be life, while the same good words out of another person s mouth may only be nice ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>One may just touch excitement in one person, while he may touch life in another person.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Many brothers think that when they feel a certain way, they have life.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But an experienced brother will tell you that this is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Many brothers think that when they have a certain idea, they have life.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>But an experienced brother will tell you that this is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Two brothers may understand and expound a scriptural passage in the same way, but the strange thing is that an experienced Christian will sense a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>One has both the right thought and life, while the other merely has the right thought.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>It is true that one often can touch life and mental thoughts at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>But we must not presume to think that touching the mind is equivalent to touching life.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>These are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Many people think that because two people speak the same thing, they are therefore the same.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>But this is not necessarily true.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It is possible that in one person we have the mind, while in the other person we do not have the mind, but life.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Life is much deeper than mental activity; it is something deeper than good ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The Lord said, I am the life.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Life is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Life is not something other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If it is a thing, it is dead; it is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>To many Christians, life is something they can produce out of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>But the Lord told us that He alone is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We need the Lord s mercy before we can see something concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We can identify something as mental activity, we can identify something as feelings, and we can identify something as works.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>But we cannot identify what is life; there is no word to describe life clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We can only ask the Lord to show us what life is.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Brothers and sisters, one day when the Lord opens our eyes, we will know what life is, and spontaneously we will touch the Lord.</S>
