   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dealing with the Old Man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ's death also dealt with the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In ourselves we all are old because we belong to the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The old man is not the originally created man, but the fallen created man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>a. To Crucify Our Old Man</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 6:6a says that our old man has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This includes everything related to our old man, such as our thinking, our likes and dislikes, and our good temper and bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To Terminate the Old Creation,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Which Is Related to the World</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ's death terminated the old creation, which is related to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Galatians 6:14 says that the world was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then verse 15 says, "For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows that the crucifying of the world is related to the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do not go through the cross, we cannot be a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On one side of the cross is the old creation, and on the other side is the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we pass through the cross, the old creation becomes the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In our life-study of the book of Daniel, I pointed out that the crucifixion of Christ, the Messiah, the Anointed One Dan 9:26 , is a landmark between the old creation and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The old creation was terminated on the cross at Christ's death, so Christ's death becomes a landmark between the old creation and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were the old creation, yet we have all been brought to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the cross we were terminated, and this termination ushered us into Christ's resurrection in which we all have been germinated to become the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The new creation needs the crossing out of the old creation.</S>
