We have seen that anything that is divine is mysterious. This is true in particular of the sign of the divine glorification. We can explain what an abode, a vine, and a man are, but who can explain glorification? It is beyond our ability to explain fully something so mysterious as the divine glorification.<h2 class=head1>LIFTING UP HIS EYES TO HEAVEN</h2><p>John 17:1 says, &#8220;These things Jesus spoke, and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; This verse is the beginning of the Lord&#8217;s prayer, a prayer that is the conclusion of the Lord&#8217;s message recorded in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen. During His message, the Lord does not use the word &#8220;heaven&#8221; or refer to heaven. It may come as a surprise, then, that 17:1 tells us that the Lord lifted up His eyes to heaven.<p>Some who have grasped only part of what we have said in foregoing messages concerning a so-called heavenly mansion may be troubled and say, &#8220;You have said that there is no such thing as heaven, and now you are pointing out the fact that, according to John 17:1, the Lord lifted up His eyes to heaven when He prayed to the Father. Why do you say that there is no heaven?&#8221; I wish to make it emphatically clear that I have never said that there is no heaven. Yes, in earlier messages I did say that there is no such thing as a heavenly mansion, that the Father&#8217;s house spoken of by the Lord in 14:2 is not a house in the heavens. But I did not say that there is no heaven. According to the Scriptures, there certainly are the heavens.<p>Not satisfied with this explanation, some may go on to say, &#8220;Brother Lee, we agree with you when you say that you never denied that there are heavens. But didn&#8217;t you tell us that, according to the Bible, Christians do not go to heaven when they die?&#8221; Yes, I have said that the Scriptures do not teach that Christians go to heaven when they die.<p>In a previous message we pointed out that, according to the physical aspect of the truth concerning Christ recorded in the book of Acts, Christ ascended visibly to the heavens (Acts 1:9-11). Now He is remaining in the heavens until the time of restitution of all things (Acts 3:21). This verse indicates that heaven is an actual place. According to the Bible, there is a place in this universe called the third heaven, where God is and where the Lord Jesus went in His ascension and where He still is today. However, in these messages on the writings of John we are not emphasizing the physical aspect of the truth; instead, we are emphasizing the divine aspect. Nevertheless, even in emphasizing the divine aspect of the truth, we do not say that there is no heaven. We have said that, according to the Bible, there is no such thing as a heavenly mansion, and that it is not accurate to say that Christians go to heaven when they die.<h2 class=head1>THE SAINTS IN PARADISE</h2><p>When some read the statement that Christians do not go to heaven when they die, they may ask an important question: According to the Bible, where do believers go when they die? Because this is a serious and reasonable question, we would spend some time to consider it before going on to cover the sign of the divine glorification.<p>A verse that is helpful in answering the question of where believers go after death is Luke 23:43: &#8220;And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.&#8221; This is the word spoken to one of the thieves who was crucified with the Lord Jesus. This verse indicates that when the Lord Jesus died, He went to Paradise. Many Christians do not know that Paradise is in Hades. A strong proof that Paradise is in Hades is the comparison of the Lord&#8217;s word to the saved thief in Luke 23:43 with Acts 2:27 and 31. The verses in Acts reveal that when the Lord Jesus died, He went to Hades. Matthew 12:40 indicates that Hades is in &#8220;the heart of the earth&#8221; where the Lord Jesus went for three days and nights after His death. In Hades there is a pleasant section likened to Abraham&#8217;s bosom where Lazarus went (Luke 16:23). This is not the Paradise in the heavens; it is the Paradise in Hades.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_178.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_180.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 179</div><br></body></html>
