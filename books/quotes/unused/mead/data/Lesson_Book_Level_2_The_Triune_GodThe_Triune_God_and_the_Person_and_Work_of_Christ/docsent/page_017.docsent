   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lesson Eight THE TRIUNE GOD AS REVEALED IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS Scripture Reading Luke 15:4-32; Acts 2:21; 9:14; 22:16; 8:16; 19:5.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Outline The love of the Triune God toward sinners Luke 15 The Triune God in Acts Calling on the name of the Lord Baptized into the Lord Text</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From Genesis to Revelation the Triune God is revealed to us in a progressive way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although we see a lot about the Trinity in the Old Testament, it is not enough for our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is still rather hidden and symbolic.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Beginning with the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the New Testament reveals the Triune God to us in a further and clearer way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matthew 28:19 is the first place in the Bible to mention clearly all three of the Trinity together.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Gospels are a major unveiling of the distinctions between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We see that God is economically three for the accomplishment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Matthew, Mark, and Luke mainly tell us about the coming of Jesus the Son and His redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Gospel of John goes much further to show us that this Jesus is the Triune God who comes to be our life essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John speaks more about the divine life and shows us more about the relationship between the Father, Son, and Spirit than any other book of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have already used many verses from John to describe the Triune God and our experience of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is, however, a section in Luke that we ought to consider in this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I. THE LOVE OF THE TRIUNE GOD TOWARD SINNERS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>LUKE 15</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Luke 15 unveils to us the love of the Triune God toward sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this chapter are three parables that are wonderful pictures of God's salvation worked out by the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The three parables refer to the Three in the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first parable is about the shepherd who goes out to seek one lost sheep vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>4-7 ; it refers to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second is about the woman who lights a lamp to search for one lost coin vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>8-10 ; it refers to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The third is about the loving father who receives back his prodigal wasteful son vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>11-32 ; it refers to the heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sequence is not according to the Person of the Trinity, as in Matthew 28:19, but according to our access entrance into the Triune God, as in Ephesians 2:18.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the four Gospels the Son, portrayed as the good shepherd, comes first to accomplish redemption, the foundation of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then in the Acts the Spirit comes to find us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This results in our repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we come back to God the Father who is waiting to receive us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Son as the Shepherd came to the wilderness to seek the one lost sheep v. 4 . In the eyes of God the entire world is a wilderness, a wild and desolate place in which everyone is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Son's way to seek us out is to die for us John 10:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Holy Spirit came to find us, just like the woman looked for the lost coin in the house v. 8 . The house refers to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The "sweeping" work of the Spirit is to enlighten our mind, emotion, will, and conscience our entire inner being finely and carefully, until we are found.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The lamp used by the woman signifies the word of God Psa 119:105, 130 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word is used by the Spirit to expose our position and condition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That is what it means to be "found."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then, having been enlightened, we repent; that is, we make a decision to return to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Father is waiting for us to return v. 20 , and eventually He brings us back into His house v. 25 , which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How wonderful is the divine love expressed in these parables!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Have you ever considered yourself as a lost sheep in the wilderness?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Read Luke 15 again while considering this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You should appreciate how precious we are to the Triune God.</S>
