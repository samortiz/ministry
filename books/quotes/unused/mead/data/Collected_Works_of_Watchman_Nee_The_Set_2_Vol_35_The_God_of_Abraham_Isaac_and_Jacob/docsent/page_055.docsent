   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE QUIET JACOB</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Beginning from Genesis 37 Jacob withdrew; he retired.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before this time Jacob was active from morning until evening.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As soon as he was finished with one matter, he would become involved in another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jacob typified the strength of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one could stop Jacob from his activity or his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At Peniel God touched him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At Bethel God perfected him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At Hebron Jacob withdrew to the background.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Beginning from chapter thirty-seven, he only occasionally came forward to speak a few words or to take care of something.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Most of the time he retreated to the background.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He became quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we know Jacob, we will realize that his natural energy would not allow him to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some Christians are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you ask them to rest for a couple of days, they simply cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They do not know how to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, Jacob was quiet in his later years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was no longer active in his natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was the fruit of the Spirit in Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This does not mean that after our natural life has been dealt with, we will become a lazy person; nor does it mean that a person who seldom endeavors is necessarily one that dwells in Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we think that being spiritual is doing very little or even doing nothing, we are very wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we say that Jacob was quiet, we mean that Jacob's natural energy stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After Jacob returned to his father's house to dwell in Hebron, he became quiet and retreated.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The work of the Spirit prevailed in Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The most outstanding characteristic of a person whose flesh has been dealt with by God is the cessation of fleshly activities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even an energetic person such as Jacob can become quiet and inactive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is nothing to marvel at when a lazy person retreats to the background.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord may deal with such a person by pushing him to the foreground.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, Jacob was a person who was always active, always asserting himself in the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His retreat to the background was truly the result of God's work on him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We know that Jacob was a crafty, cunning, and scheming person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This kind of person does not usually have any concern for others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is difficult to find a scheming person who truly loves others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A person who always plots against others has only one goal to profit at the expense of others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He will do whatever profits him and not do anything that does not profit him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He can never sympathize with others or be considerate of others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He can never love others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jacob's nature was one that only cared for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He did not know how to love others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even his love for Rachel was a selfish love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet God disciplined him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After he left his father's house, he endured much suffering and encountered many difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When he returned to his father's house, his loved ones passed away one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His daughter, Dinah, was defiled, and his eldest son, Reuben, defiled his bed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Jacob's sufferings were really great.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By the time he settled in Hebron he had lost everything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet through all these sufferings, he gradually became mature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was no longer active in himself; rather, he became quiet and retreated to the background.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE COMPASSIONATE JACOB</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Jacob began to turn into a compassionate person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When his sons were feeding the flock away from home, he sent Joseph to inquire after them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here we see that he was an elderly person who loved and cared for the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was afraid that his sons might get into mischief, and he sent Joseph to inquire after their welfare.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He never expected that Joseph would be sold or that his sons would deceive him by showing him Joseph's many-colored coat dipped in blood.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Genesis 37:33 says, "And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What a great sorrow this was for an old man to repeat, "Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The next verses say, "And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus his father wept for him" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Step by step God took everything away from Jacob; step by step Jacob was stripped.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even Joseph was taken from him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The record in the latter part of Genesis 37 is truly sad and sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once again Jacob was disciplined and tried in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God was making Jacob a person full of compassion and sympathy for others.</S>
