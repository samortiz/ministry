   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE ORGANISM OF THE TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4; 1:4-5, 7-11, 13-14, 19-23 THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING ABSOLUTELY ORGANIC</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The burden of these messages is to point out that the church is absolutely organic.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to see that the church as the Body of Christ is altogether organic, absolutely of life, with nothing organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Triune God has an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>An organism and an organization are entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To illustrate this difference, we may compare a living person to a wooden stand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The wooden stand is without life, while a living person is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The wooden stand is an organization of pieces of wood put together, but a living person has many members which are joined together organically.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A person is a living, moving, functioning organism, unlike a robot, which is an organization of inorganic parts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church is not an organization without life, but an organism with life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One of the most damaging things to the church is organization.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>History tells us that nothing kills, damages, and annuls the reality of the church as much as organization does.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some may think that the appointment of the elders is something organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They may feel that an appointment is always something organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must realize, however, that the elders are appointed according to the manifestation of the measure of their growth in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To appoint a principal of a school or a manager in a corporation is not according to life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kind of appointment is organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in the Lord s recovery, according to the New Testament, the appointment of the elders is absolutely according to the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a brother does not have the adequate growth in life, he cannot be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to their physical life, older people are elders.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Their age comes from their growth in their physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Their being elders is an organic matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In like manner, the elders in the churches are appointed according to the manifestation of the measure of their growth in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The appointment of the elders is altogether organic, having nothing to do with organization.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To even mention the word organization concerning the church and the church life is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church and the church life are not in the field of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Apostle Paul told us that the church is God s farm 1 Cor 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Anything that grows on a farm does not belong to an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rice or wheat cannot be organized by a farmer to grow in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A farmer plants the seed and then waters what he has planted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His work on the farm is something of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Planting and watering are matters of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul said, I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow 1 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church as God s farm, God s cultivated land, is something totally of life, having nothing to do with organization.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul also tells us that the church is God s building 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A physical building is something of organization because it is composed of lifeless materials.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the church as God s building is not a lifeless building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is a building full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The divine life is the basic and unique factor of all the building materials of this spiritual building, God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God s house is an organic matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>FOR HIS FULLNESS, HIS EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The organism of the Triune God is a Body Eph 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The very abstract and mysterious God has an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God is invisible, yet He has a visible organism, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church as the Body of Christ is for His fullness, His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The definition of the church as the fullness of Christ may be illustrated by a cup that is filled with water to the extent that it overflows with water.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The water within the cup is seen and expressed when it overflows from the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The overflow of the water is the fullness of the water, and the fullness of the water is the expression of the water that is inside the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>John 1:16 says, For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We received of the fullness of the incarnated Christ who came as grace and truth v. 17 . The Word became flesh, and He was full of grace and truth v. 14 . The fullness of grace and truth is the fullness of the incarnated Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To fill a cup with water until it overflows is to have water upon water.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord Jesus was full of grace, grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Of His fullness we all have received grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The fullness is the expression of the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A person s body is his fullness, his expression.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A husky American man who has enjoyed so much of the rich foodstuffs of America, the riches of America, may be considered as the fullness of America, the expression of America.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church as the Body of Christ is the expression, the fullness, of Christ.</S>
