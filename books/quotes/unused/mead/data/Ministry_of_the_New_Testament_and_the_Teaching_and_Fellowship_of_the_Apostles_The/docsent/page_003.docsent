   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING UNIQUELY ONE UNIVERSALLY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all need to be clear that the ministry of the New Testament, which is the ministry of the new covenant, is uniquely one universally.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Ministry of the Spirit and</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>of Righteousness of the New Covenant</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>in Contrast with the Ministry of Death and</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>of Condemnation of the Old Covenant</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the entire universe there have been only two ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 2 Corinthians 3 the ministry of the old covenant is referred to as "the ministry of death" and "the ministry of condemnation" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The ministry of the old covenant did only two things: it condemned people and put people to death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the new covenant and the new ministry based on the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness, that is, of justification vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>8, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The old covenant ministry of Moses was a ministry of death and condemnation, but the new covenant ministry is the exact opposite: it is a ministry not of death but of the Spirit, that is, of life, and not of condemnation but of righteousness for God's justification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, we may say that the ministry of the old covenant was a ministry of death and condemnation, and the ministry of the new covenant is a ministry of life and justification.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Comprising All the Works Ministries</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>of All the Apostles, the Ministers</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>of the New Covenant</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The unique ministry of the New Testament comprises all the works ministries of all the apostles, the ministers of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 2 Corinthians 3 the plural ministers is used clearly in verse 6, and the singular ministry is used in verses 8 and 9.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then, in the first verse of chapter four Paul said, "Therefore having this ministry as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here Paul used the plural pronoun we.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He did not say that he singular had this ministry; rather, he said that we plural have this ministry singular .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We here includes not only Paul but all the New Testament ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All this indicates that there is one new covenant ministry of many new covenant ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first of the new covenant ministers were the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Acts 1:17 and 25 Peter used the term this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That ministry was the ministry of the twelve apostles, who were the first twelve New Testament ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The ministry is the service, the work, and the ministers are the persons who serve.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The persons who serve are many.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After the twelve apostles, many ministers, including Paul, Barnabas, and many others, entered into the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although the ministers were many, all these many ministers had only one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 2 Corinthians 4:1 Paul used the pronoun we, referring to many ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then in 2 Timothy 4:5 Paul charged Timothy to fully accomplish his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this verse Paul spoke of Timothy's ministry, referring to an individual's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was Timothy's personal ministry, but this personal ministry was a part of the corporate ministry, "this ministry," the unique ministry of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The ministry in 2 Corinthians 4:1 is the corporate ministry of all the New Testament ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this corporate ministry Paul had his portion, Peter had his portion, and Timothy had his portion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the ministers have their own portion of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we add all the portions together, we have "this ministry," which is the New Testament ministry.</S>
