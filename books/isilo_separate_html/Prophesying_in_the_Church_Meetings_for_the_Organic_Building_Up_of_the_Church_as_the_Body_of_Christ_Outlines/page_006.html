		<li>In considering one another and in exhorting one another&mdash;&ldquo;And let us consider <em>one another</em> for inciting to love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting <em>one another,</em> and so much the more as you see the day drawing near&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. 10:24-25.</li>
		<li>In listening&mdash;&ldquo;Do not despise prophecies&rdquo;&mdash; 1 Thes. 5:20; cf. Rev. 2:7a.</li>

			<li>Concerning the deep things of Christ&mdash; 1 Cor. 2:10 and note 3).</li>

	<li>All the attendants in the church meetings can and should speak in prophecy&mdash;1 Cor. 14:31, 29-30, 6:

			<li>To convict people.</li>
			<li>To judge people.</li>
			<li>That the secrets of the hearts of the unbelieving and unlearned may be manifested.</li>
			<li>That the unbelieving and unlearned may worship God, reporting that God is really among the saints who are meeting together.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Having seen by revelation the God-ordained way of all prophesying in the meetings of the church, the apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 14 highly recommended it.:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Earnestly desire the greater gifts&rdquo;&mdash;1 Cor. 12:31.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy&rdquo;&mdash;v. 1.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;He who prophesies speaks to men building up and encouragement and consolation [lit.]&rdquo;&mdash;v. 3.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;He who prophesies builds up the church&rdquo;&mdash;v. 4.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;I desire that you all...may prophesy: ...greater is he who prophesies...that the church may receive building up&rdquo;&mdash;v. 5.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits [lit.], seek that you may excel to the building up of the church&rdquo;&mdash; v. 12.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;If all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all; the secrets of his heart become manifest; and so falling on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is really among you&rdquo;&mdash;vv. 24-25.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;You can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged&rdquo;&mdash;v. 31.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy&rdquo;&mdash;v. 39a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul also charged all the saints to prophesy in the meetings of the church:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul used certain verbs in this chapter to encourage the saints to prophesy:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Pursue&mdash;v. 1.</li>
		<li>Desire&mdash;vv. 1, 39.</li>
		<li>Seek&mdash;v. 12.</li>
		<li>Excel&mdash;v. 12.</li>
		<li>Learn&mdash;v. 31.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Paul, as an example to the Corinthians, aspired to speak words of profit, i.e. to speak to the church...in prophecy&mdash;v. 6.</li>
	<li>Paul, likewise, encouraged the saints to excel by speaking words of profit for building up, i.e. to come together having a prophecy to speak&mdash; vv. 3-5, 12, 26, 31.</li>
	<li>Paul promoted all prophesying:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;Now I desire that you all...may prophesy&rdquo;&mdash;v. 5.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;You can <em>all</em> prophesy&rdquo;&mdash;v. 31.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;If <em>all</em> prophesy&rdquo;&mdash;v. 24.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;He is convicted by <em>all</em>&rdquo;&mdash;v. 24.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;He is judged by <em>all</em>&rdquo;&mdash;v. 24.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;<em>Each one</em> has&rdquo;&mdash;v. 26.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Paul equated being a prophet with being spiritual&mdash;v. 37.</li>
	<li>Paul indicated in this chapter that the saints in Corinth had to be limited in their speaking in tongues and increased in their speaking for the Lord, i.e. prophesying:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Speaking in tongues, even if it is genuine and proper, only edifies the speaker himself.</li>
		<li>Prophesying builds up the church.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Principles for prophesying:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Your speaking should be short; do not speak too much:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The more you speak, the dimmer the light may become.</li>
		<li>The more you speak, the more the saints may get confused.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>You should use the time economically:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To speak a short, clear, profitable word.</li>
		<li>To leave time for others to prophesy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>You should practice speaking not longer than three minutes:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If you speak for less than one minute, you should have a main point.</li>
		<li>If you speak for more than one minute, you should have a line of development.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>You should be systematic:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Do not keep speaking and speaking without a main point or a specific and clear line of development.</li>
		<li>Do not go far away from your topic; learn to follow a particular line.</li>
		<li>Do not speak in a scattered manner with unrelated points.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>You should strike the crucial points clearly.</li>
	<li>You should not repeat the points you have already spoken:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Only strike the central points.</li>
		<li>Do not explain too much.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>You should be confident in what you are speaking.</li>
	<li>You should speak with authority:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Having the Word.</li>
		<li>Having the Spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>You should exercise to have the influencing power; exercise to have the impact that can move others:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This is related to your spirit and your word.</li>
		<li>Every sentence you speak must have the proper expression and be uttered with an exercised and released spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>You should let the people see the light and get the life supply:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Release the truth.</li>
		<li>Dispense the life.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The short prophecies of not more than three minutes are most appropriate for district meetings, for meetings of the whole church, and for small group meetings.</li>
