<P>Before Christ's incarnation and resurrection, divinity and humanity were separate entities. But humanity and divinity were mingled together in Christ. Jesus is the mingling of divinity with humanity. In His incarnation divinity entered into humanity. In His resurrection humanity entered into divinity, and divinity was mingled and compounded with humanity. With the lemon tea, the water, the tea, and the lemon are no longer separate elements. When we drink this, we are drinking "lemon-tea-water." The water has been compounded with another two elements. Our God has also been compounded with humanity and with all the elements of the process through which He passed.</P><P>After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus charged His disciples to baptize people into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. The Acts and the Epistles say that the disciples baptized people into the name of the Lord Jesus (Acts 8:16; 19:5) and into Christ (Rom. 6:3; Gal. 3:27). This is because Christ is the totality of the three of the Godhead. This is like saying that tea is the totality of water, lemon, and tea. In our baptizing of people, we may be too dogmatic. We may insist on saying, "Brother, we are baptizing you into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit." To repeat this, however, can be dogmatic. It is better to say, "Brother, I'm baptizing you into Christ." Christ is the embodiment and totality of the Triune God.</P><P>The Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;is mingled and compounded with humanity. The Son entered into humanity, and He brought this humanity into divinity. Into divinity means into the Divine Trinity. Today all three of the Godhead are involved with humanity. First Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. The last Adam was Christ as a person in the flesh. This person in the flesh became a life-giving Spirit. The word became indicates mingling. Christ became a life-giving Spirit by the way of compounding, by the way of mingling. Thus, the life-giving Spirit is the mingling of divinity and humanity. With the lemon-tea-water, the spirit (the essence) of the tea and the spirit (the essence) of the lemon are in the water. The essence of lemon and the essence of tea cannot be seen, but they can be tasted. Today we cannot see how man is in God and God is in man, but these divine and human essences are mingled together and are included in the all-inclusive Spirit.</P>
