<P>I would advise all of you here, whether you are an elder, a co-worker, or a full-timer, that if you want to take the new way today, you must give yourselves to it. You must risk all for this. Otherwise, it is better for you not to take this way. When I came back in 1984 to take the lead to practice the new way, I was risking all. At that time I had served the Lord for over fifty years. I cannot claim to have accomplished very much, but I must say that I have done something. I took the risk to come back to Taiwan for this work, and I have encountered much opposition and attack. Yet I have been at ease. Nothing can deter me or frustrate me. I have given my all. No matter how people slandered me or opposed me, I was not shaken. I advise you that if you want to take the new way, you must give yourselves to it in this way.</P><P>I must remind you of another thing: never bring in the way you learned to serve the Lord in the past. That would make you one who takes the new way, but with the old method. If you want to take the new way, you must go all the way. If you do not understand something, you must study and learn. It is worthwhile even to fast and lose sleep because of this. This past Lord's Day I went to one meeting hall for a meeting. I looked into the situation there, and I found out that every one of the saints there was produced by this way of giving oneself to the work. During the past two or three years, every year they have realized a one hundred percent increase. I heard their testimonies. Every one of them was sincere and genuine. My point is that you cannot practice the new way with the old way anymore. You must learn to start from the most basic step, and you must pick up the points one by one.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, I cannot say that I am very experienced in the Lord's work. But by the Lord's mercy, I always know what I should say at any given time. I believe the subject I have chosen for today, "Distinctive Virtues of an Elder," is the need in Taiwan today. Some of you have been serving the Lord here for decades. You think that you know everything. But where is the result? Do not be offended by me; this is my word of exhortation in love. You have not seen any result in the new way because you have not given yourself to it. I advise you not to dabble any longer. Otherwise, you will spoil others as well as yourself. If you do it, give yourself to do it. If you are not for it, simply reject it. I am not being rude to you; I am merely trying to stir you up a little.</P><P>Dear ones, I hope that you will receive my sober words. May the Lord be merciful to us. By the grace of God, may we rise up to take the new way, learning step by step and going on step by step. Take, for example, the matter of preaching the gospel. Actually, we do not need to knock on "cold" doors; there are many "warm" doors. Every brother or sister has at least twenty gospel friends, either their unsaved relatives, their friends, or their neighbors. We do not have to take care of them all by ourselves. We can coordinate together. Some relatives have heard our preaching for years and are still not saved. This may change if someone else preaches to them. Some may get saved in just this kind of way. In nourishing the new ones after they are saved, we should not use the old methods. We must learn to be new. In the past, we have been affected too much by tradition and natural concepts. We have not followed the Spirit very much. The proper way for us to help people is not to solve their problems, but to lead them to call, "O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!" That is all that is needed. As long as a person touches the Lord and enjoys Him, all his problems will be solved. We must believe that the Lord in whom we believe is real and living. For this reason, we should not work according to our old methods anymore. That way is not effective. We must practice strictly according to the new way.</P><P>This is the reason we must strive, struggle, and wrestle. Strictly speaking, we cannot consider ourselves as having accomplished anything yet. We are still in the process of learning. We must learn diligently and in a desperate way. Please believe my word: anyone who is willing to give himself to learn will become an expert in the new way. Ability comes from learning. I believe all of you are for the new way. But it is not enough just to be for the new way; we must all be diligent, laboring, striving, and struggling to give ourselves to practice the new way.</P>
