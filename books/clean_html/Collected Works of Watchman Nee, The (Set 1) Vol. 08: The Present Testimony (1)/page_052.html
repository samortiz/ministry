<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE FOREMOST CONDITION<br>IN THE SPIRITUAL LIFE</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 16</H2><P>The one thing a seeking believer should fear most is the over-activity of the soul --activity that goes beyond God's boundary. The soul has reigned long enough. Even when a believer is willing to consecrate himself to God, he still thinks that he must work and accomplish what he has consecrated himself to do, in order to please God. Many believers do not realize that the cross should work deeply until all the power from their living is rejected. Many believers do not realize the reality of the indwelling Holy Spirit in them. They do not realize how much authority He should have and how all of their thoughts, desires, and feelings should be under His control to the extent that they have no self-confidence. Without this, the Holy Spirit cannot accomplish His work. Therefore, the greatest temptation that befalls zealously seeking believers is to exercise their own strength in the work of God.</P><P>The call of the cross of the Lord Jesus is to hate our own life. We should look for opportunity to lose our life and not for an opportunity to keep it. The Lord's intention is that our self should be sacrificed and fully consecrated, so that the Holy Spirit can work in us. All opinions, works, and mental powers of the soul-life must be put to death before we can regain our true life under the life and leading of the Holy Spirit. The Lord also spoke to us about the matter of hating or loving our soul-life. The soul loves itself. Unless we hate our natural life wholeheartedly, we cannot genuinely live in the Holy Spirit. If believers do not understand this, they will not be afraid of themselves or their wisdom, and they will not trust fully in the Holy Spirit, wait on Him, or look to Him. This is the foremost condition in the spiritual life.</P>
