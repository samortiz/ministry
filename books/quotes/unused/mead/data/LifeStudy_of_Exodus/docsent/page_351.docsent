   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FIVE CUBITS LONG AND FIVE CUBITS WIDE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to verse 1, the altar was five cubits long and five cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Five times five signifies Christ bearing full responsibility on the cross to fulfill all the requirements of God s righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Five is the number of responsibility, and five times five indicates full responsibility, responsibility upon responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus bore such a responsibility on the cross in fulfilling God s threefold demands.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>V. THREE CUBITS HIGH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 1 also indicates that the height of the altar was three cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why was the altar three cubits high?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why was the height less than the length and the width?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fact that the height is less than the length and width indicates that the Lord s redemption is spreading in a wide way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, the altar is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If it were too narrow, it could not include so much.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Also, if it were too high, we could not reach it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The number three refers either to the Triune God or to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not believe that the thought of resurrection is appropriate here.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, the number three here should refer to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The redemption accomplished on the cross was not only by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself; it was accomplished by the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hebrews 9:14 says that the Lord Jesus offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to Colossians 2, God the Father was busy when Christ was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While God the Son was dying an all-inclusive death, God the Father was very active.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we pointed out already, the evil spirits were also busy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hebrews 9:14 shows that the Triune God was involved in the accomplishing of redemption: It tells us that Christ offered Himself to God through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the Triune God signified by the three cubits as the height of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, the Triune God is the standard of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Redemption was accomplished by the Triune God according to the standard of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The three parables in Luke 15 also show that the Triune God is involved in man s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Son, signified by the shepherd, seeks out the lost sheep; the Spirit, signified by the woman lighting a lamp, searches for the lost coin; and the Father, signified by the father of the prodigal son, receives the returned prodigal, covers him with the best robe, and feeds him with the fatted calf.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here we see that the Triune God is involved in receiving back a repentant sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the significance of the height of the altar being three cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From our experience we know that the Triune God was involved in our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When as sinners we heard the gospel, the Spirit was working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we repented, we began to appreciate the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the same time, the Father also was working.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, the Spirit, the Son, and the Father all worked together to redeem us, bring us back, and accept us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the meaning of the height of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The three cubits as the height of the altar signifies that it is built by the Triune God and according to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I believe that this is the true significance of the height of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The redemption accomplished on the cross was by the Triune God, by the Son, the Spirit, and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>WITH HORNS UPON FOUR CORNERS</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 2 says, And you shall make its horns upon its four corners.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The horns upon the four corners of the altar signify the power of the cross of Christ see Psalm 92:10a to reach the four corners of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The horns at the corners were sprinkled with the blood of the sacrifices Lev 4:25, 34 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I believe this was the reason someone could take hold of the horns of the altar and be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>An example of this is found in 1 Kings 1:50.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In contrast, another verse, Exodus 21:14, says that even if a certain kind of sinful person does lay hold of the horns on the altar, he will not receive forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The horns signify strength, and in typology the four corners signify the four ends, or corners, of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that the redemptive work of Christ is so effective that it can spread throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It has the strength, the power, to reach the four corners of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In history, especially today, it has been seen that the efficacy of Christ s redemption has reached the uttermost part of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This indicates the power of the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, the horns on the four corners of the altar signify the power and strength of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>THE HORNS</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>BEING ONE WITH THE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 2 says that its horns shall be from it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This indicates that the horns were one with the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The horns were not made separately and attached to the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Instead, they were made of one piece with the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This indicates that the power and strength of Christ s redemption cannot be separated from Christ s cross.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Without the altar there would be no horns, no power or strength.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do not think that you can have any strength or power in the spiritual realm apart from the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This power can never be separated from the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The horns must be one with the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>OVERLAID WITH BRONZE</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Verse 2 says concerning the altar, And you shall overlay it with bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This signifies God s righteous judgment on Christ as our Substitute Num 16:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In Numbers 16 we see that the bronze used to overlay the altar came from the censers of two hundred fifty rebellious ones who were judged by God with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After God judged them, He charged Moses to take the bronze censers and use them to overlay the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Thus, the bronze overlaying the altar indicates judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In typology, copper, bronze, and brass all signify God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When Christ was on the cross, He was a man, signified by the acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But He was overlaid with bronze, with God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Unlike the ark, which was overlaid with gold signifying God s nature, the altar was overlaid with bronze, signifying God s righteous judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Thus, as the Man who died on the cross, Christ was fully judged by God as our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He bore for us the judgment which we should have borne.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He was fully covered, overlaid, by God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>On the cross He was the Man judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>ALL UTENSILS MADE OF BRONZE</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Verse 3 says, And you shall make its pots to remove its ashes, its shovels, and its sprinkling bowls, and its flesh-forks, and its fire pans; you shall make all its utensils of bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The pots for receiving ashes, the shovels for removing ashes, the sprinkling bowls for receiving blood Zech 9:15 , the flesh-forks for turning meat, and the fire pans for containing charcoal were all made of bronze, the same material as that used to overlay the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The fact that all the utensils were made of bronze signifies that all things related to the cross are for God s judgment.</S>
