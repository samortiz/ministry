   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE A CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THAT FULFILLS GOD S ETERNAL PURPOSE THE RIGHT TRACK FOR THE LORD S SEEKERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the beginning of this chapter I would like to consider the world situation as far as the Lord s interest is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In many countries of Europe the situation is tragic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In France and all the southern European countries, from Portugal to Greece, there is nearly nothing for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I visited a number of places in Athens, Greece, but all that I found there was superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Concerning Scandinavia, there is something for the Lord in Norway, but it is very shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Pentecostal movement in that country is quite prevailing, and it is better than in other places because it is not so wild.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Denmark, however, there is a deeper work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In England, Scotland, and Ireland, although there was something for the Lord thirty years ago, the situation today is pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I was in Glasgow in 1958, a friend told me that in the district where we were staying, many people did not even know who Jesus was.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is still something for the Lord in England, but not as much as a century ago, when most of the important things of the Lord came from there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Germany, even though there are quite a number of Christians, there is not much at all for the Lord s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From this we can learn something.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even though there have been revivals in these places throughout history, none of the revivals lasted very long.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, even as recently as ten years ago there was a revival in Argentina, and thousands of people were brought to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if you go there today, very little is left.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, when I visited Turkey and some countries in the Middle East Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Iraq, and Iran I discovered that there is nothing for the Lord s interest in these places.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Far East, China has at least one-fifth of the world s population.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1949 there were more than five hundred local churches there and approximately one thousand full-time co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We planned to evangelize the whole of China in ten years, but suddenly, within the space of two years, the country fell into the hands of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Finally, it is difficult to find anything for the Lord s interest in Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, we praise the Lord that today throughout America there are many Christians, and among them a good number are genuinely seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They only need to be brought onto the right track.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be on the right track is, first, to know Christ and experience Him as life and everything, not in doctrine or teaching but in daily practice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moment by moment we need to practice one thing, that is, to apply Christ and appropriate Him in all the events, situations, and conditions in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second, to be on the right track is to come together with the seeking ones in the place where we live, without division or any sectarian spirit, to be nothing but general Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not be Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, or Lutheran, but just Christians in general, children of God, who are open to all the believers in Christ and who come together as a living, corporate expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The right track, therefore, is to take Christ as our life and everything and then to meet with all the seeking ones purely as a living, corporate expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This will bring much blessing from the Lord to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord will honor this, and all the positive things that were lost during the past generations will gradually be recovered and experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have the assurance that in these last days, before He comes back, the Lord will recover Christ as life and the church as His expression, not by a movement or a revival but by the fellowship of the Body of Christ and the current of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THAT FULFILLS GOD S ETERNAL PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Scriptures there are two different ways to approach God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One way is from our side, and the other is from God s side.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first way is seen in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This book begins by revealing that we are all sinners under God s condemnation 1:18 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then it reveals Christ s redemption for our justification Rom 3:21 5:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Following this, Romans reveals that not only our works and deeds are sinful, but even our nature, our very being, is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We were all born in Adam, and there is nothing good in our flesh 5:19; 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But this sinful man has been crucified on the cross with Christ 6:6 , and now Christ as the Spirit lives within us 8:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, while we are walking, living, and doing things in the Spirit, we are members of one wonderful, universal, mystical Body 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we must have the Body life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>1-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The book of Ephesians, however, is different.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whereas Romans begins with sinners, Ephesians begins with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The starting point of Ephesians is in the heavenlies, not on the earth, and in eternity, not in time 1:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This book shows us that in eternity past there was within God a desire, a good pleasure vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to His good pleasure God made a purpose, a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This plan was made in eternity and for eternity, and thus it is called the eternal plan, or the eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is an eternal plan made in Christ, with Christ, through Christ, and for Christ according to God s desire and pleasure vv.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>9-11; 3:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After God created all things, He called a number of people according to His selection and His predestination 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He redeemed them, forgave them, and regenerated them to make them members of the Body of Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>7, 13, 22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now these people must be built up together as a living Body, a corporate vessel, to contain, express, and exhibit Christ to the whole universe 2:21-22; 3:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For this they need to have the Body life 4:1 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, although the two books begin differently, eventually Ephesians and Romans arrive at the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Romans begins with sinners, and Ephesians begins with God in eternity and in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Both books reveal that God s plan, His intention, is to manifest and express Himself through Christ, His Son, in a universal, mystical Body composed of many created and regenerated persons.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God needs an expression, one that is in Christ and through Christ, and also one that is through a Body of regenerated human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Without humanity, God can never be revealed or manifested, for man was created as a vessel for the purpose of revealing, expressing, and manifesting God Gen 1:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the reason that God created us with a mind with which to think, an emotion with which to love, and a will with which to make decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Without the human mind, God can never be revealed or expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Similarly, without the human emotion and will, God can never be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Men were made as vessels for God Rom 9:21, 23; Acts 9:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many Christians today consider that we are instruments of God, but this is actually a wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is a significant difference between a vessel and an instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A knife and a hammer are instruments, whereas a cup is a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A vessel is a container.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Romans 9:21 says that we are vessels of clay, and 2 Corinthians 4:7 says that we are earthen vessels that contain a priceless treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We are containers for Christ and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As vessels we have a mind, a will, an emotion, and a heart.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We may use a glove to illustrate this.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In order to contain a hand, a glove must have five fingers, because there are five fingers on a hand.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Likewise, God created us with a mind, an emotion, and a will because Christ has a mind, an emotion, and a will.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The human mind is needed as a container for the mind of Christ, and the human emotion is needed as a container for Christ s emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>First Corinthians 2:16 says, We have the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we did not have a mind, we could never have the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, our mind is a container for the mind of Christ, and our whole being is a vessel for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We are not vessels for milk, eggs, or bread; we are vessels for Christ so that we might contain Him and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In order to express Christ, we were created by God according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Man was created in the image of God Gen 1:26 , and Christ is the image of the invisible God Col 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Hence, to be created in the image of God is to be created according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Just as a glove is made in the form of a hand so that it can contain a hand, we were created according to Christ so that we might be proper vessels to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Christ has a heart, and the heart within us is a container for the heart of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Christ has a mind, and the human mind is a container for the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Christ also has a will, and the human will is a container for the will of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Furthermore, we are vessels not merely to contain Christ but also to be filled with Him so that He may be formed in us Eph 3:17, 19; Gal 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We may put a hand in a glove, but the hand may not be formed in the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Only when every finger has been fitted exactly inside the glove can we say that the hand is formed in the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Christ may be in us but not yet formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We need to be filled with Christ, and Christ must be formed within us.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We need to be impressed that God created the universe in order for Christ to be expressed through His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>All the things on the earth and in the heavens, with man as the center Zech 12:1 , are for the purpose of expressing Christ through His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is also the reason that God selected us as the object of His divine grace.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He needed us to be a Body to contain, express, and exhibit Christ to the whole universe.</S>
