   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MAN-SAVIOR S VICTORY OVER DEATH,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INCLUDING SATAN, HADES, AND THE GRAVE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Man-Savior s resurrection was also His victory over death, Satan, Hades, and the grave Acts 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Satan, death, Hades, and the grave form a group.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Man-Savior was not only vindicated by God and was proved to be a success in His achievements, but He was victorious over death, Satan, Hades, and the grave, all of which are a great concern and trouble to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Man-Savior overcame death and destroyed Satan Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The keys of death and of Hades are now in His hand Rev 1:18 , and He is victorious over the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second Timothy 1:10 says that Christ nullified death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ nullified death, making it of none effect, through His Devil-destroying death Heb 2:14 and death-swallowing resurrection 1 Cor 15:52-54 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the gospel the revelation is brought to us that Christ has nullified death and has brought us eternal, indestructible life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ was manifested to nullify death and to bring in eternal, indestructible life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He not only defeated death He nullified it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through His resurrection, death has become of none effect; death has lost its power, even its taste.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ could nullify death because He destroyed the Devil, the one who has the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, by overcoming Satan and nullifying death, the Lord Jesus also defeated Hades and the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, Christ s resurrection declares that He is victorious over death, Satan, Hades, and the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No longer are these a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, Christ s resurrection was not only God s vindication and the Lord s success, but also His victory over death, Satan, Hades, and the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ through His resurrection has made this troublesome group of none effect.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE MAN-SAVIOR S GLORIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, the Man-Savior s resurrection was His glorification John 13:31-32; 17:1; Luke 24:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because this matter is difficult to understand and define, it is helpful to use the illustration of a grain of wheat John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is life in a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the grain is sown into the earth, it dies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But at the same time it grows.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a grain of wheat is not sown into the ground, it will neither die nor grow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But a seed that is put into the ground is eventually glorified through its growth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The principle is the same with other kinds of seeds, for example, a carnation seed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Like a grain of wheat, a carnation seed dies in the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But eventually it grows, rises out of the earth, and blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The blossoming of a carnation flower is its glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, a carnation seed is fully glorified in the blossoming of a carnation flower.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to His own word in John 12:24, the Lord Jesus was a grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But as He was in the ground dying, He was also growing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, in resurrection He blossomed and brought forth many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These grains are His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Wheat growing in a field is the glorification of all the grains of wheat sown into that field.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ears of ripe wheat have been described as golden ears of grain.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The time is coming when in the universe there will be a field full of golden ears of grain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then God will be able to say, Satan, look at this field.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the glorification of My Son, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even today in the proper church life we may have a miniature of this glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Man-Savior s Shell Broken through His Death</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a grain of wheat the Lord Jesus had a human shell.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For Him to be glorified John 12:23 required that His divine life be released from within the shell of His humanity to produce many believers in resurrection 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through His death on the cross the shell of His humanity was broken.</S>
