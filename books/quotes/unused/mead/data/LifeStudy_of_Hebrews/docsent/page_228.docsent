   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE SIXTY-SEVEN THE COMPLETION OF SONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The focus of God s revelation in the New Testament is sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sonship is God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God can only satisfy His desire for sonship by having His Son become the model and prototype.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This prototype must be wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is being wrought into us is not only the Savior or the divine life, but also the prototype of the sonship, the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we have pointed out, there is a great difference between the Only Begotten Son of God and the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With the Only Begotten Son, there was no humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was divine, but He was not human.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With the Firstborn Son, on the contrary, there are both divinity and humanity because He is not only the Son of God but also the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Son of Man has been brought into sonship through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now this Firstborn Son, constituted with both divinity and humanity, has been wrought into our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>PREDESTINATED UNTO SONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ephesians 1:5 says that we have been predestinated unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sonship is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our destiny is not to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Salvation is a process; it is not the goal but the way to reach the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God s goal is sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God s forgiveness, justification, salvation, and regeneration are all focused on sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has forgiven us, justified us, saved us, and regenerated us that we might be His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE PROCESS OF SANCTIFICATION,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>TRANSFORMATION, AND CONFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sonship has both a beginning and a completion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It begins with regeneration and it will be completed with glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Between regeneration and glorification there is the process of sanctification, transformation, and conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many Christians have heard about sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the concept of sanctification in Christianity is much different from that found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The vocabulary, the terminology, is the same, but the understanding is vastly different, because the dictionary of today s Christianity differs from the dictionary of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the pure word of the Bible, the meaning of sanctification is to be saturated with the element of the prototype.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more we are saturated by the element of the Firstborn Son as the prototype, the more we are separated unto God from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through sanctification we are separated from the world, not by teachings or miracles, but by being permeated with the element of the divine and human nature of the prototype.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our whole being is like a black spot.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day, the wonderful element of the prototype came into our spirit and sanctified it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What about the remainder of our being?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must admit that it is still very dark.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although you may consider yourself to be good, moral, ethical, and even spiritual, you are still dark.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps you are in a dark grave.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether you are good or bad, right or wrong, moral or immoral, ethical or unethical, spiritual or unspiritual, your being is still dark.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever others contact you, they sense your opaqueness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You dwell in the gloomy dungeon of your religion and ethics, and there is nothing transparent about you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because you are so dark and non-transparent, you need to be sanctified by having the wonderful element of the prototype saturate your being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more Christ spreads into you, the more you will be sanctified and separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Transformation is related to sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more we are saturated with the element of Christ, the more we are sanctified, and the more we are sanctified, the more we are transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As we have pointed out several times, transformation is not an outward change, adjustment, or correction.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is an inward metabolic change, a change in life, nature, and form.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sanctification is for transformation and transformation is for conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must be transformed in order to be conformed to the image of the Firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By the Lord s mercy, we are in the proper church life being sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of God s Firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is deeper, higher, and more profound than being moral, ethical, or even spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some teachings regarding so-called spirituality are merely vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Genuine spirituality is conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Being spiritual depends upon being conformed to the image of the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No human effort, labor, or imitation can manufacture this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It can only be produced by the indwelling prototype, the real and living Firstborn Son of God, who automatically works in us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As He works in us by the law of life, He continually anoints us from within.</S>
