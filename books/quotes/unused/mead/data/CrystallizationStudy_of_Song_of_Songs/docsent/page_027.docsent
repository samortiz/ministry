   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The lover of Christ expects the cold north wind to awake and the hot south wind to come blowing upon her garden that her spices may flow forth v. 16a . The wind from the north is cold and harsh, but this causes the apple trees to give forth the best fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If she has only the north wind, everything will die.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not easy to say, Awake, O north wind; / And come, O south wind! v. 16a . We have to learn of the lover of Christ in Song of Songs to appreciate both kinds of winds.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is eating His own things, and He invites His beloved friends, the Triune God, to eat and drink deeply with Him v. 1c . The Bridegroom, Christ, the Son in the Divine Trinity, invites His beloved friends, God the Father and God the Spirit, to enjoy His garden.</S>
