   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ as the Body of All the Shadows</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:16 and 17 Paul says, Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All these items of the ceremonial law are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, which are the things to come.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The body in verse 17, like a man s physical body, is the substance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The rituals in the law are a shadow of the real things in the gospel, like the shadow of a man s body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is the reality of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is all the good things in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The book of Colossians unveils such an all-inclusive Christ as the focus of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Holding the Head to Grow with the</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Growth of God</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 2:19 Paul refers to holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, by means of the joints and bands being supplied and knit together, grows with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Holding the Head that we may grow with the growth of God is related primarily to His subjective death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 20 says, If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why as living in the world do you subject yourself to ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The elements of the world are the ordinances, primarily the Jewish ordinances, but also the ordinances of the Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These ordinances are related to do not handle, do not taste, do not touch v. 21 . We must hold the Head that we may grow with the growth of God, with the increase of God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we live such a life, surely we will experience His subjective death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ Being Our Life</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Colossians 3:3 and 4 say, For you died, and your life has been hidden with Christ in God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Christ our life is manifested, then you also shall be manifested with Him in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because our life not our natural life, but our spiritual life which is Christ has been hidden with Christ in God, who is in the heavens, we should no longer care for things on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God in the heavens should be the sphere of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With Christ we should live in God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In God, Christ, not ourself, our soul, is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This life is now hidden, but it will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we shall be manifested with this life in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Letting the Word of Christ Dwell in Us</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 3:16 Paul says, Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, we have Christ as our life, then we have His living Word personified as His Person dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word of Christ is the word spoken by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In His New Testament economy God speaks in the Son, and the Son speaks not only directly in the Gospels, but also through His members, the apostles and prophets, in Acts, in the Epistles, and in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All these may be considered as His word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this passage the infilling of spiritual life that overflows in praising and singing is related to the Word, whereas in its parallel passage, Ephesians 5:18-20, the infilling of spiritual life is related to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that the Word and the Spirit are identical John 6:63b .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A normal Christian life should be one that is filled with the Word so that the Spirit may bubble from within us in lauding melodies, melodies of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word of Christ includes the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to be filled with this word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that we should allow the word of Christ to dwell in us, to inhabit us, to make home in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Greek word rendered dwell literally means to be in a house, to inhabit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The word of the Lord must have adequate room within us so that it may operate and minister the riches of Christ into our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To Pray that the Door</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May Be Opened for the Word</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 4:3 Paul says, Praying at the same time for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, because of which also I have been bound.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In chapter three the last crucial point is to let the word of Christ dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The crucial point in chapter four, the last crucial point of the entire book, is to pray for the door to be opened for the word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The open door for the word is related to the divine speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this matter I would recommend two books for you to prayerfully read The Home Meetings The Unique Way for the Increase and Building Up of the Church and The Divine Speaking.</S>
