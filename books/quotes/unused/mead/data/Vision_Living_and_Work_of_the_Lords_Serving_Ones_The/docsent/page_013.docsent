   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE FOUNDATION FOR SPIRITUAL GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These three aspects of proof are crucial points concerning the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should use these points when we preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should read all the books that cover this subject, such as Assurance of Salvation The Collected Works of Watchman Nee, vol. 6 , and chapter 15 in Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, we should practice speaking these points until we are familiar with them and are able to present them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No one helped me after I was saved, and I did not understand my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, I often vacillated between both doubt and fear.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This went on for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was not until I read Assurance of Salvation by Brother Nee that I was assured of my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I obtained assurance and possessed the title deed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, in order to help new believers have the assurance of their salvation, we need to lead them to see their title deed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The assurance of salvation is the foundation for growth in our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a believer does not have the assurance of his salvation, it will be very difficult for him to make spiritual progress.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, after leading someone to salvation, we must first perfect him by letting him know that he is saved, and we must give him the title deed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more secure this foundation is, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are three aspects of this foundation: the outward proof God s word; the inward proof God s Spirit; and the proof of our experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These three items God s word, God s Spirit, and the experience of life can be compared to a threefold cord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After a person is saved, he needs such a cord so that his salvation is secure and solid.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>LEARNING TO SPEAK</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must also train ourselves in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we converse with others, we must speak in a way that they can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not uncommon, however, for us to continue to speak even when others do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we must try our best to speak in a way that others can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am from Shantung Province, and I speak with a Shantung dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, by the Lord s arrangement and under Brother Nee s leading, I moved to Shanghai in 1933 and was required to give messages to the local saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By the Lord s mercy and grace, I made the effort to avoid using expressions that the Southerners would not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although my accent was still from Shantung, I tried to avoid words or expressions that they would not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This continued to be my practice when I went to America.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although my English is not good, the Americans understand me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have tried my best to learn to speak in a way that they can understand and to avoid using words or expressions that are incomprehensible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a practice is related to the effectiveness of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without such a practice, people will have only a vague idea of what we are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The inflection of our voice and the speed of our speaking also have an impact on the effectiveness of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is especially true with the inflection of our voice; hence, we should practice speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have stayed with many American families and have observed that their children are trained to speak from an early age.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As a result, everyone can understand them when they share in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Chinese families, however, are relatively weak in giving this kind of education to their children.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a result, the Chinese-speaking brothers and sisters often speak with accents of various dialects, making it difficult for people to understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This fellowship is especially for those who are learning to serve the Lord, because their work is mainly to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to preach the gospel, we need to speak; in order to edify the saints, we need to speak; when we visit people, we also need to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What do we do when we serve full time?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We speak.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, we must learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I was serving with Brother Nee in Shanghai, in every meeting he paid much attention to how the brothers and sisters prayed and spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whenever he heard something inappropriate, he would write a personal note to the brother or sister, telling them that what they said or prayed was inappropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even his mother received such a note.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was very strict in leading the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was never loose.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, all the full-timers must learn to speak properly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should neither be careless nor fearful when we speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We simply need to learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Learning to speak can be compared to learning a language.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should first listen, then speak, and then speak after being corrected.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not be afraid to speak after we are corrected; instead, we should continue to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Moreover, when we speak, we should care for others ears more than our throat.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This means that we should open our mouth and thrust forth our voice.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not rush our words even if we speak fast; we should enunciate every word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These matters require training.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Furthermore, we must also learn to put sentences together so that what we say has meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must express ourselves clearly and use words that are full of meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not be pretentious and use complex words that mean nothing to the hearers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is better to use simple words so that people can understand us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Furthermore, if we use too many quotations from the Bible, others will be puzzled and not understand the main point.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All these matters require practice.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I hope that those who are serving full time would be willing to schedule a time to study the truth, grasping this opportunity and not wasting their time.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Since we have consecrated our life to the Lord, separating ourselves from the world and placing ourselves in the Lord s hand, we should treasure every breath, treasure every drop of blood, and treasure every minute we have.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should seize every opportunity to learn these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At the same time, we should pay attention to our health.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We need some amount of exercise to maintain proper health.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord has always had mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He cares for me and keeps me so that I have been able to work for Him until this day.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>May we all be like this before the Lord.</S>
