   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Breaking Down</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Middle Wall of Partition 1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By Abolishing the Law</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>of the Commandments in Ordinances</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ broke down the middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles by abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When He was crucified on the cross, all the ordinances were nailed there.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The law spoken of in 2:15 is not the law of the moral commandments, but the law of the ritual commandments, such as the ordinances of circumcision, keeping the Sabbath, and eating certain foods.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ordinances are the forms or ways of living and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every people has its own way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to be careful not to make our way of living or worship an ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the same time, we should not regard what others do as ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we all practice this, there will be no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord s recovery is spreading worldwide.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the various countries where the recovery is growing for example, in Japan, Korea, and Indonesia there are ways of living different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Certainly the Lord s recovery cannot require the Japanese, Koreans, and Indonesians to have the same way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our way of living greatly affects our way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, in Korea it is easy to have morning watch extremely early, even at 5:30.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, if this practice is imposed on Americans, it will cause serious difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The various ways of living are seen in the instruments used for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Americans and Europeans use a knife and fork, the Chinese use chop sticks, and the Indonesians use their fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who can say which way is best?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because this is a very delicate matter, we need to take care of the feelings of others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you visit Indonesia or Taiwan, you should follow the custom of the people there.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise those from Indonesia and Taiwan should do the same when they visit the West.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we want to eliminate ordinances, this must be our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Due to the improvements in transportation and communication, the people of the world are becoming intermingled more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is under the sovereignty of the Lord so that He can have the new man, the proper church life which includes all different peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, concerning our way of life, we all must learn not to impose requirements on others and not to have any ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The differences among the peoples began at Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In God s economy in the church life we must overcome Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our very language can become an ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we stay for a long period of time in another country or even live there, we should, if possible, learn the language of the people there and not insist on our native tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the redeemed and recovered ones, those who have been transferred into Christ and into the church life, we must learn to hate the differences that divide the peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The worldly people regard cultural differences as a mark of prestige.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But in Christ we have all lost this prestige.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now our only prestige is Christ and the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not have a prestige unique to our locality or meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all need to exercise ourselves to go along with others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As long as a certain practice does not involve idolatry or immorality, there is nothing wrong with it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not hold on to your prestige.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are willing to let go of our cultural pride, it will be possible for the Lord to have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The breaking down of the middle wall of partition is for the new man, the commonwealth of God, the household of God, and the building of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we keep our differences, it will be impossible to have the church life in these four aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christianity is filled with the divisive differences among the various peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason, it is impossible for Christians outside the recovery to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For the sake of the church life, all the differences must be under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Ephesians 2:15 says that Christ abolished in His flesh the law of commandments in ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because mankind became flesh Gen 6:3 and was thus kept from God and His purpose, God ordained His chosen people to be circumcised from the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This ordinance was given because of man s flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was in the flesh that Christ was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When he was crucified, His flesh, which was typified by the separating veil in the temple, was rent Heb 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By breaking down the middle wall of partition on the cross, Christ has made peace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have seen that, according to the Bible, the basic ordinances are those regarding circumcision, the Sabbath, and diet.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But even these ordinances, which were ordained by God, have been abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the basic ordinances have been abolished, how much more should the minor ones be abolished also.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not keep any ordinances, and we should not create new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By the Lord s grace, we must learn to be flexible and to drop all differences for the sake of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No matter where we may go, we must learn to be the same as others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then we shall enjoy the church life as the new man, the commonwealth of God, the household of God, and the dwelling place of God.</S>
