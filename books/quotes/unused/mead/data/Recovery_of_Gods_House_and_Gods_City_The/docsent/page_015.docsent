   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE CHRIST AS EVERYTHING FOR GOD'S BUILDING Scripture Reading: Zech 1 8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter, we come to another wonderful book of the recovery, Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I cannot tell you how much I love this book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Years ago it was a closed book to me, but later, due to the recovery of the local churches, it was opened.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The whole book has become transparent, from the first page to the last.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of course, we do not have the time to cover it entirely, but no other book of the Old Testament tells us so much about Christ as this one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even Isaiah cannot compare with Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Isaiah has sixty-six chapters, and Zechariah has only fourteen, yet Zechariah tells us more concerning Christ than Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fourteen chapters of Zechariah are divided into two sections: the first eight chapters are one section, and the last six are another.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the first section, there are eight visions, in which the prophet Zechariah saw the things of Christ related to the recovery of God's building; in the last section, Zechariah prophesies about Christ in the future, after the recovery of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE DESIRE OF ALL NATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before we go on to Zechariah, we need to see something more regarding Haggai.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the book of Haggai, there is not much mentioned about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Haggai came into the situation while the hands of the governor, the high priest, and the people were weakened by the opposition of the adversaries.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They had turned from building the temple to caring for their own houses and interests.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Haggai came to rebuke and strengthen them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit of God again stirred up the spirit of the governor, the spirit of the high priest, and the spirit of the remnant of the people Hag 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Three times this verse mentions the stirring up of the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord also reminded them that since the day he brought them out of Egypt, His Spirit had never left them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Their spirit had to be stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we see that the recovery of God's building is something in our human spirit and the Lord's divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our human spirit must be stirred up by His divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not a matter of the mind or emotion, but a matter of His Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Haggai also points out that if the recovery of the building of the Lord's house is prevailing, Christ will come.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ was prophesied in Haggai as "the Desire of all nations."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"And I will shake all nations, and the Desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts" Hag 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ, the Desire of all nations shall come.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Have you realized that all the nations have a kind of desire?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Deep within all human beings there is a desire for peace, rest, and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But is there any peace, rest, or satisfaction?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are all aware of today's situations with riots, wars, and tensions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no peace, no rest, and no satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But we know Who is the peace, the rest, the safety, the security, and the satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is Christ, the Desire of all nations!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although the world in a sense is opposing Christ, yet Christ is their Desire.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But how can Christ come as the Desire of all nations?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is only by the recovery of the building of the house of God!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The recovery of the local churches has very much to do with the coming of Christ as the Desire of all nations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us look at the situation again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Due to the degradation of God's people, they were carried away from the land of Canaan to Syria and Egypt, with the majority going to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose no one had returned from these three places of captivity to Jerusalem in the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How could Christ have come the first time?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was plainly prophesied that Christ, the Messiah, would be born in Bethlehem, and of the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet all the people of God had been carried away, and if none returned, how could Christ be born of the people of Israel at Bethlehem?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There would be no possibility.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>So we see the importance of the return of the captivity, not only for the building up of the temple, but even more for the coming of the Desire of all nations.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today, many dear Christians love the Lord and are so much for the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet they still argue with us, saying, "Why must we all go back to the local church?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Don't you realize that we are doing a good work for the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But we must look at the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They may do much good work for the Lord in Babylon, but it is impossible for them to bring the Lord back.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not possible for the Lord to come back as the Desire of all nations in the place of captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For His return, some of His people must return to the original ground.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I do believe it will be the local churches that will bring Christ back!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Regardless of how much they work for God in Babylon, they can never bring Christ back to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is so clear in Haggai that the recovery of the building up of God's house has much to do with Christ's coming as the Desire of all nations.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We know that He did come, not to those who remained in Babylon, but to those who returned to the land of Israel.</S>
