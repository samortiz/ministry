<p>When the Lord Jesus died, we died with Him (Rom. 6:6). He was God clothed with humanity, and He died as God mingled with man. Hence, His death involved two parties: He passed through death in His humanity in the flesh, and we passed through death in His humanity. It is through such a death that His life could be released and imparted into us. It is through such a death that His life could be released to enter into innumerable people. This glorious fact was accomplished on the cross and is the gospel that we preach.</p>
<p>The gospel is that as a man, God has already accomplished what He wants to achieve in us. The gospel conveys to us the fact of His accomplishment. When a person receives the gospel, he confesses this fact, and the Holy Spirit accomplishes it in him. The content of the gospel is that God became flesh, put on humanity, was mingled with man, lived as a man on the earth, and died on the cross as a man. In His death both God and man died (Acts 20:28). Through this death the life within Him was released and imparted into man. He has accomplished this fact, and the gospel conveys it to us. When we believed in and acknowledged this gospel, the Spirit touched our inner being and fulfilled this fact in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE LIFE GROWING THROUGH DEATH</h2>
<p>According to what the Holy Spirit has fulfilled in us, we were joined to God in His death, and we received Him as our life. These are facts. The life within us now needs to be expressed. This life flows out of God into us, and it must also flow out of us into others. The divine life will flow out of us in the same way that it entered into us. It entered into us through death, and it will flow out of us also through death. Death is the way of life. In order for life to flow, there must be death. If there is no death, life will not have the way to flow out or to flow in. Just as life needed death in order to flow out of God and enter into us, only through death can life flow out of us and enter into others. Death is the only gateway. For this reason, those who know life also treasure death, because if there is death, there is also life. If we desire to touch life, we must first touch death. If there is no death, there cannot be life. Simply speaking, no death, no life. This is a law. Life enters through death and flows out through death. Life was imparted into us through death and grows in us through death. Without death, life cannot enter, and without death, life cannot grow. This is a law.</p>
<p>Every time that life operates in us, it results in our being put to death. The operation of life always demands that we die; it puts us in death. If we consider our experience, we will see that whenever we consecrate ourselves to the Lord and are willing to respond to His demands by being a vessel and letting Him live in us, He gains more ground in us and operates a little more in us. When He operates, He asks us to cut off or forsake certain things. This cutting off and forsaking are according to the principle of death. God&rsquo;s only demand is that we die. By responding to His demand, we are agreeing to die. In other words, we are agreeing to pass through death by His life.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother is very close to a friend who is an unbeliever. The divine life within him may demand that he give up this friendship. If the brother&rsquo;s love for his friend is too strong, he may be reluctant to meet this demand. As a result, he will be in conflict with the life of God within him. The human life and the divine life have different tastes. The brother might feel that his friendship is very sweet, but the divine life says that this friendship is not sweet. These tastes are entirely different. When we were saved, we received God&rsquo;s life in addition to our human life. These two different lives, the human life and the divine life with their different natures and tastes, are now in us. For this reason, there is often a conflict within us.</p>
<p>It is difficult for a person to have two lives within him. The human life loves to make friends with the world, but God&rsquo;s life hates any friendship with the world. The human life is very irritable, but God&rsquo;s life is very gentle. When the human life says, &ldquo;Hurry up! Hurry up!&rdquo; the divine life says, &ldquo;Slow down! Slow down!&rdquo; We are in a hurry, but He is not; we want to run, but He does not move. Is this not difficult? This is our situation in small things and in our daily life. This is the situation of every believer. After we received God&rsquo;s life into us, there have been two lives in us. Hence, either we die, or He suffers. In order to live out the life of God, we must die. When we consecrate ourselves, we give God the opportunity to gain more ground in us and to live out of us. He is always requiring that we die. He requires that we cut off worldly friendships, that is, forsake our friends in the world. In principle, such a cutting off, such a forsaking, is to die.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Knowing and Experiencing God as Life &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
