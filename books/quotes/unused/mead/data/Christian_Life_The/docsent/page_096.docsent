   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CRUCIFYING OUR FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH ITS PASSIONS AND ITS LUSTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN DEALING WITH OUR BODY OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man is a tripartite being spirit, soul, and body 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the fact in the Bible, although God has condemned sinful man and Satan has corrupted man, in God's economy, God has drawn a boundary around our spirit so that Satan cannot enter into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Satan can corrupt our body and our soul, but God has restricted Satan's corrupting to these two parts of our being and has reserved our spirit for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When God enters into us, He enters into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Satan came in to corrupt our soul and our body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the garden of Eden the serpent came to corrupt both Eve and Adam Gen 3:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First he corrupted their soul, their mind; then their taking the fruit of the tree of knowledge corrupted their body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sin was brought into the body, making the body the flesh, full of lusts and full of passions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the spirit was preserved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, there is still the possibility for us to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Repentance originates in one part of the spirit, that is, the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The best way to preach the gospel is to stir up people's conscience so that they realize that they are sinful before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Based on such a realization, they can repent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Repentance initiates from our conscience, and our conscience is a part of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because of the existence of the conscience in man's spirit, the Chinese philosophers said that within human beings there is a part that they called "the bright virtue."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In their logic they discovered that there is a part in fallen man that is reserved for God's use.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus told us that we must bear the cross to deal with our soul, our self Matt 16:24-26; Luke 9:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then Paul said that he was crucified with Christ Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one can crucify himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be crucified one needs others to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is possible for a person to commit suicide by many means, but no one can commit suicide by crucifixion, because no one can crucify himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet, Galatians 5:24 says, "But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although we cannot crucify ourselves, we can crucify our flesh, our fallen body, with its passions and its lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is to deal with the body of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Romans 6:6 Paul wrote, "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled or, unemployed, jobless, inactive ."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then in Galatians 5:24 Paul said that we must crucify our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This corresponds with Romans 8:13, which says, "For if you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we by the indwelling Spirit put to death the practices of our fallen body, we will not only live, but the divine life will also be transfused into our mortal body Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here is the victory over sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our victory over sin is not that we are able to conquer sin; our victory over sin is in our remaining under the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through the entire day, by our regenerated spirit with the help of the indwelling Spirit, we need to exercise Christ's crucifixion upon our flesh with its passions and its lusts.</S>
