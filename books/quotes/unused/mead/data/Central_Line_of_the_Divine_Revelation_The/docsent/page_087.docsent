   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By Living and Walking by the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The sixth way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by living and walking by the Spirit Gal 5:16, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Living and walking by the Spirit is equivalent to having our being by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit is in our human spirit Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is often difficult in Paul's writings for translators to determine whether spirit should be capitalized or not.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The spirit in Paul's writings is the mingled spirit, the Spirit who is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After rising up in the morning, we should do everything by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must begin our day by living and walking in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we rise up in a loose way, we will spoil the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The best thing to do after rising up is to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we call "O Lord Jesus," we are in the spirit 1 Cor 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Calling in this way brings us back from everything to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then we will have a good beginning of the day, and we will be able to face any situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will be able to encounter every circumstance by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is to live and to walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This experience follows the experience of being identified with Christ in His death in order that He may live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without experiencing the identification with Christ, we cannot live and walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By Having Christ Formed in Us through Travail</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ as the Spirit is also by having Christ formed in us through travail.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Galatians 4:19 says, "My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Galatians 1:16 Christ is revealed in us; in 2:20 Christ lives in us; and in 3:27 Christ is upon us, clothing us like a garment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now, in 4:19 Christ is formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The second stanza of Hymns, #499 says,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Oh, what a joy!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Oh, what a rest!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ now is being formed in me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His very nature and life divine</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In my whole being inwrought shall be.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All that I am came to an end,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And all of Christ is all to me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The last two lines in the Chinese say that all that we are has been terminated, and Christ's all in all has become our element.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now His element is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the meaning of Christ's being formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In his writings Paul also used the words transformed 2 Cor 3:18 and conformed Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are not transformed, Christ has not been formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ's being formed in us depends on our being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are transformed to His image, and He is formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our being transformed and His being formed cause us to be conformed to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our being conformed to His image is His being formed in us further.</S>
