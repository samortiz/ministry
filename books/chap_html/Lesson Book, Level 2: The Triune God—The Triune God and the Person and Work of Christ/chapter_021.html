This was the last major step of the process He went through. Ephesians 4:8 says He "ascended to the height." Christ is now at the highest place in the universe. Mark 16:19 says that the Lord was "taken up into heaven and sat at the right hand of God." To be seated at God's right hand means that Christ is at the place of greatest honor and highest authority. There He is crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 2:9), has been exalted far above all, and has received the name above all names (Phil. 2:9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. BEING MADE LORD</H2><P>In His ascension, Christ was made the Lord (Acts 2:36), the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5), as well as Head over all things (Eph. 1:22). This means that He is the Ruler of the universe, the authority on the throne of God's government. He is the landlord of the whole universe! This may not impress you that much. You might think that because Christ is God, the Creator, He already was the Lord and Ruler of the universe. But you must realize that the Christ who is Lord today is not just the Lord who created the universe. The Christ who is Lord today is God incarnated to be a man. In His resurrection and ascension He is still a man. So now, there is a man in the heavens, exalted and established as the Lord of the universe! It is easy for us to believe that the Creator God is the Lord. But can you believe that the man Jesus, the poor carpenter, is now on the throne over the entire universe? A little man from the small country village of Nazareth has been made Head over all things!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. BEING MADE THE CHRIST</H2><P>Acts 2:36 says that in His ascension Jesus was also made Christ. "Christ" means that He is God's Anointed One; He is the One appointed by God to accomplish God's plan. The Father sent the Son to do all the work of redemption and everything related to God's purpose. So, the Son is called Christ. But wasn't He the Christ before His ascension? Yes, He was, but not officially. In His ascension the Lord was officially made Christ.</P>
