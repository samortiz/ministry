   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE A GOOD LISTENER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The personal life of a worker of the Lord is intimately related to his work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, we have to consider matters of character, habit, and conduct when considering the qualifications necessary to be in God's employment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This relates to the constitution of character and the formation of habits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A man must have not only a certain amount of spiritual experience, but a certain constitution in his disposition; the Lord must constitute a certain kind of disposition within him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many things need to be built up, cultivated, and developed into habits within a worker.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These things relate more to our outward man than to our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As these things mold the outward man into a proper shape, we will become suitable for the Lord's use.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It takes grace and mercy from God for this to occur; character is not built up in a day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if the Lord gives a person enough light and if He speaks to him often enough, his natural and undesirable elements will be burned away; they will not be allowed to remain or grow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In His mercy, God will reconstruct a new character in him through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us now speak of a few things that all seasoned servants of the Lord have realized and apprehended.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The lack of any of these will result in a breakdown in service.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>ONE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first thing we want to speak of is an ability to listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A worker of the Lord must build up the habit in his daily life of listening to others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not mean that he should listen to others in the sense of obeying them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I mean that he should listen to others in the sense of being able to hear what they are saying and to understand what he has heard.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is a great need for this trait to be built up in a worker's personal life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No worker of the Lord can do a good job if he can only speak to others but cannot listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A worker is of little use to God if he can only speak to others, if he can only blast incessantly at others like a firecracker.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No worker of the Lord can be an incessant talker.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he can only speak to others, but cannot listen to them and realize their problems through conversation, his usefulness is very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a Christian turns to a servant of the Lord for help, the worker should be able to discern three aspects of his brother's words while he is listening: the words that are being uttered, the words that are being held back, and the words that are lying in the depth of the brother's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, you must fully understand what the person is actually saying.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that you need to be a quiet person before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Your mind must be clear and your spirit must be calm.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Your inner being should be like a blank piece of paper before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You should not have any prejudice, preconception, or inclination.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You should not make any determination in your mind or pass any judgment on anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You should remain perfectly calm before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the other person opens his mouth and relates a story, you should learn to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As you listen quietly, you will know what he or she is talking about.</S>
