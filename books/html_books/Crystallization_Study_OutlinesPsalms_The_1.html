<h1 class="title">The Central Thought of the Book of Psalms</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 2:6-9; 27:4; 36:8-9; 48:1-2; 72:8; 22:27</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The Psalms are fully Christ centered; Christ is not only the centrality but also the universality of the Psalms-Luke 24:44.</li>
<li>The central thought of the book of Psalms is Christ, as revealed in plain words, and the church as the house of God and the city of God for His kingdom, as typified by the temple and by the city of Jerusalem-2:6-9; 26:8; 27:4; 46:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The spirit, the reality, the characteristic, of the divine revelation in the book of Psalms is Christ as the centrality and universality of the eternal economy of God-2:6-9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>For this, Christ is first the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9), then the house, the habitation, of God (signified by the temple-John 2:19-21), the kingdom of God (signified by the city of Jerusalem-Luke 17:21; Rev. 22:3b), and the Ruler of the entire earth from the house of God and in the kingdom of God (Dan. 2:34-35).</li>
		<li>Christ is therefore all in all in the entire universe-Eph. 1:23; Col. 3:11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The picture given in the book of Psalms is the same as that portrayed by the entire Bible: Christ, the church, and the reigning of Christ over the whole earth with the New Jerusalem as the center-Matt. 16:16, 18; Rev. 21:1-3, 24.</li>
	<li>The particular point related to the divine revelation in the Psalms is that such a high revelation is prophesied in the expressions of the sentiments of the ancient godly saints.</li>
	<li>The consummation of the divine revelation is the city of New Jerusalem as a sign of the habitation, the tabernacle, of God, through which the processed and consummated Triune God will be manifested and expressed in the all-inclusive Christ and will reign on the new earth in the new universe for eternity-Rev. 21:1-3.</li>
	<li>The five books of the Psalms are arranged in the same progressive way as the entire Bible is arranged:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>From the first book of the Psalms to the fifth book, the revelation progresses higher and higher; the fifth book is filled with the psalmists&#8217; praising of God.</li>
		<li>The central thought in this progressive revelation is that God is embodied in Christ, Christ is in His Body, and His Body is God&#8217;s house and God&#8217;s city for God&#8217;s kingdom over the earth-Col. 2:9; Eph. 1:22-23; 2:19; Rev. 11:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The book of Psalms covers four main points in a wonderful sequence: Christ-house-city-earth-2:6-7; 27:4; 48:2; 72:8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the Psalms we see the details concerning the all-inclusive Christ in God&#8217;s eternal economy:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ in His divinity-45:6; Heb. 1:8.</li>
		<li>Christ in His incarnation-Psa. 8:4; Heb. 2:6.</li>
		<li>Christ in His humanity-Psa. 8:4; Heb. 2:6.</li>
		<li>Christ in His human living-Psa. 16:1-8.</li>
		<li>Christ in His death-22:1-21.</li>
		<li>Christ in His resurrection-2:7; 16:10; 22:22; Heb. 2:12; Acts 2:25-32; 13:33-37.</li>
		<li>Christ in His ascension-Psa. 68:18; Eph. 4:8.</li>
		<li>Christ in His exaltation-Psa. 80:17; 110:1.</li>
		<li>Christ in His being crowned-8:5; Heb. 2:9.</li>
		<li>Christ in His enthronement-Psa. 2:6.</li>
		<li>Christ in His dominion, kingship, and authority-v. 8; 8:6; 47:2; 72:8.</li>
		<li>Christ in His priesthood-110:4.</li>
		<li>Christ in His fighting-vv. 5-6; 45:3-5.</li>
		<li>Christ in His victory-110:5-6.</li>
		<li>Christ in His indwelling-22:22.</li>
		<li>Christ in His shepherding-23.</li>
		<li>Christ as the stone for the building-118:22.</li>
		<li>Christ in His coming-72; 96; 110.</li>
		<li>Christ in His reigning-93-101.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Psalms reveal many aspects of the church as God&#8217;s house, such as:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&#8217;s dwelling-68:18; 84:1.</li>
		<li>The ground, the site-24:3; 68:16; 76:2.</li>
		<li>Its foundation-87:1.</li>
		<li>The place of God&#8217;s presence, which is God&#8217;s glory-26:8; 27:4; 29:9.</li>
		<li>The place of revelation-73:17.</li>
		<li>The saints&#8217; desire-84:2, 10.</li>
		<li>Its loveliness-v. 1.</li>
		<li>The place where we may be planted, flourish, and bear fruit-92:13-14.</li>
		<li>The place of springs-87:7.</li>
		<li>The place of worship-99:9.</li>
		<li>The place where God is our portion-73:26.</li>
		<li>The place where we are mingled with God-92:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Psalms reveal aspects of the church as the city, such as:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It is the city of the great King-48:2.</li>
		<li>There is a river with streams within it-46:4.</li>
		<li>God is in the midst of the city-v. 5.</li>
		<li>It is God&#8217;s holy mountain-48:1.</li>
		<li>It is beautiful in elevation and the joy of the whole earth-v. 2.</li>
		<li>It is the perfection of beauty-50:2.</li>
		<li>It is the goal of God&#8217;s good pleasure-51:18.</li>
		<li>It is the salvation of God&#8217;s people-53:6.</li>
		<li>It is God&#8217;s resting place forever-132:14.</li>
		<li>The city is built up by the Lord-147:2.</li>
		<li>The Lord blesses others from the city-134:3.</li>
		<li>The Lord is blessed from the city-135:21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Various aspects of the earth are also seen in the Psalms, such as:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The earth has been given to Christ as an inheritance-2:8.</li>
		<li>The Lord&#8217;s name will be excellent in all the earth-8:1.</li>
		<li>The earth and its fullness are the Lord&#8217;s-24:1.</li>
		<li>Christ will come back to take the earth-96:13.</li>
		<li>Christ will reign over the earth-72:8.</li>
		<li>The earth will return to Christ-22:27.</li>
		<li>The earth will remember Christ-v. 27.</li>
		<li>The earth will worship Christ-vv. 27, 29.</li>
		<li>The earth will praise Christ-98:4.</li>
		<li>The whole earth will be filled with God&#8217;s glory-72:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The book of Psalms reveals that the earth is the ultimate intention of God&#8217;s desire-8:1, 9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Psalms show us that God&#8217;s intention is to recover His title, His legal rights, over the whole earth through Christ in the church as the house and the city-2:6-8; 36:8-9; 48:2; 72:8.</li>
	<li>God must conquer the earth, recover the earth, and bring the earth back under His rightful rule (8:1, 9); this is why the Lord taught us to pray, &#8220;Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth&#8221; (Matt. 6:10).</li>
	<li>God&#8217;s purpose is to express Himself in a corporate way, and the key to the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose is the building up of the church; without the church as the house and the city, there is no beachhead for the Lord to come back and recover the earth-16:18; Eph. 3:9-11; 4:16; Rev. 11:15.</li>
	<li>When the church is enlarged from the house to the city for the recovery of the earth, God&#8217;s purpose will be fulfilled, and we will declare, &#8220;O Jehovah our Lord, / How excellent is Your name / In all the earth!&#8221;-Psa. 8:9.</li>
	</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">The Revelation concerning Christ in God&rsquo;s Economy</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 2</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>In our study of the Psalms, we need to realize that the spirit of the Bible is to exalt Christ&mdash;Col. 1:15-19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The spirit of the Bible exalts the Christ ordained by God to have the first place in the old creation, in the new creation, in the Body of Christ, and in everything&mdash;Matt. 17:5; Col. 1:18.</li>
	<li>Since Christ has the first place in all things, we must give Him the first place in our being and in all that we do&mdash;v. 18; Rev. 2:4.</li>
	<li>Psalm 2 is according to the divine concept of exalting Christ; in Psalm 2 Christ is exalted as the center of the economy of God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 2 is God&rsquo;s speaking, God&rsquo;s declaration, God&rsquo;s proclamation, concerning Christ as the center of His economy&mdash;vv. 6, 8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The word <em>economy</em> is not in Psalm 2, but the revelation and reality of God&rsquo;s economy are there.</li>
	<li>The King and the kingdom in Psalm 2 show us the economy of God&mdash;vv. 6, 8-9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>For God to have a King is for the fulfilling of His economy&mdash;v. 6.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s kingdom will be a great kingdom of all the nations, covering the entire earth; His kingdom will be everywhere to include everyone&mdash;vv. 8-9; 22:28; Dan. 7:14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Psalm 2 reveals the steps of Christ in God&rsquo;s economy, beginning from His being anointed in eternity in His divinity (v. 2) and continuing with His resurrection (implying His death also&mdash;v. 7; cf. Acts 13:33), His ascension (Psa. 2:6), His setting up His universal kingdom (Rev. 11:15) with the nations as His inheritance and the ends of the earth as His possession (Psa. 2:8), and His ruling the nations with an iron rod (v. 9).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to see the divine revelation of Christ in God&rsquo;s economy in Psalm 2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Verses 1 through 3 predict the opposition of the world rulers to Christ; the fulfillment of these verses began with Herod and Pontius Pilate and will conclude with Antichrist&mdash;Acts 4:25-28; Rev. 19:19.</li>
	<li>In Psalm 2:2 God came in to declare that Christ was His Anointed:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In His divinity Christ was anointed by God in eternity to be the Messiah&mdash;Christ&mdash;the anointed One&mdash;Dan. 9:26; John 1:41.</li>
		<li>Christ came in His incarnation as the anointed One to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal plan&mdash;Luke 2:11; Matt. 1:16; 16:16.</li>
		<li>In His humanity Christ was anointed again in time at His baptism for His ministry, mainly on the earth&mdash;3:16-17; Luke 4:18-19; Heb. 1:9; Acts 10:38.</li>
		<li>In His resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit for the purpose of being God&rsquo;s Anointed, and in His ascension He was made both Lord and Christ, becoming God&rsquo;s Anointed in an official way to carry out God&rsquo;s commission, mainly in His heavenly ministry&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; Acts 2:36.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Psalm 2:4-6 is God&rsquo;s declaration concerning Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In His ascension Christ was installed as God&rsquo;s King for God&rsquo;s kingdom&mdash;v. 6; Acts 5:31; Rev. 1:5a.</li>
		<li>God proclaimed that He had installed Christ upon Mount Zion, not upon Mount Sinai&mdash;Heb. 12:18-22; Gal. 4:25-26:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Mount Sinai was the place where the law was given; Mount Zion in the heavens is the place where Christ is today in His ascension&mdash;Rev. 14:1; Psa. 68:15-16; Eph. 4:8.</li>
			<li>The New Testament believers have come not to Mount Sinai but to Mount Zion, where we have the church, the Body of Christ, and God&rsquo;s economy for God&rsquo;s testimony&mdash;Heb. 12:18-24.</li>
			<li>Mount Sinai produces children of slavery under the law, but our mother, the Jerusalem above, which is in the heavens at Mount Zion, produces children of promise who inherit the promised blessing&mdash;the all-inclusive Spirit&mdash;Gal. 4:24-26, 28; 3:14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Psalm 2:7-9 is the declaration of Christ Himself:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Verse 7 is quoted by the apostle Paul in Acts 13:33, indicating that Psalm 2:7 refers to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</li>
		<li>After being cut off, crucified (Dan. 9:26), Christ, God&rsquo;s anointed One, was resurrected to be begotten in His humanity as the firstborn Son of God&mdash;Psa. 2:7; Acts 13:33; Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29; Heb. 1:5-6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li><em>Today</em> in Psalm 2:7 is the day of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</li>
			<li>By resurrection Christ brought His humanity into the divine sonship and was designated the Son of God with His humanity; His resurrection was His birth as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son&mdash;Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29; Acts 13:33:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Before His incarnation Christ already was the Son of God, the only begotten Son&mdash;John 1:18; Rom. 8:3.</li>
				<li>2) By incarnation Christ put on an element, the human flesh, which had nothing to do with divinity; that part of Him needed to be sanctified and uplifted by passing through death and resurrection&mdash;John 1:14; Rom. 1:3-4.</li>
				<li>3) By resurrection His human nature was sanctified, uplifted, and transformed; hence, by resurrection He was designated the Son of God with His humanity, and now, as the Son of God, He possesses humanity as well as divinity&mdash;Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5.</li>
				<li>4) God is using such a Christ, the firstborn Son, as the producer and as the prototype, the model, to produce His many sons&mdash;Rom. 8:29.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>Through the same resurrection all His believers were born with Him to be His many brothers, the many sons of God&mdash;John 20:17; 1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Christ has been given the nations as His inheritance and the limits of the earth as His possession&mdash;Psa. 2:8; 72:8, 11; Rev. 11:15.</li>
		<li>Christ will rule the nations in His kingdom with an iron rod&mdash;Psa. 2:9; Rev. 2:26-27; 19:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Psalm 2:10-12 is the preaching of the gospel:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>These verses are a warning concerning the coming wrath of God and Christ upon the world:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>One day Christ will come to execute His judgment in His wrath&mdash;v. 12; Rev. 6:15-17; Joel 1:15; 2:11, 31; 3:14; 1 Cor. 4:3-5.</li>
			<li>In the New Testament the period in which Christ will come to execute His judgment in His wrath upon the world is called &ldquo;the day of the Lord&rdquo; (Acts 2:20; 1 Cor. 5:5; 1 Thes. 5:2; 2 Thes. 2:2; 2 Pet. 3:10), which is also the day of God (v. 12; Joel 1:15).</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We all need to realize that we are nothing and vanity (Psa. 39:4-5); our realizing that we are nothing, that our condition is sinful, and that our situation is one of vanity opens the way for Christ to crucify us and enter into us to replace us by living Himself through us and causing us to live together with Him in an organic union&mdash;Gal. 2:20.</li>
		<li>To take refuge in the Son is to believe into the Son, Christ, taking Him as our refuge, protection, and hiding place, and to kiss the Son is to love the Son and thereby to enjoy Him&mdash;Psa. 2:12; John 3:16, 36:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To believe in the Lord is to receive Him, and to love the Lord is to enjoy Him&mdash;1 Tim. 1:14.</li>
			<li>The Gospel of John presents faith and love as the two requirements for us to participate in the Lord&mdash;3:16; 14:23.</li>
			<li>Through faith we receive the Lord, and through love we enjoy the Lord whom we have received&mdash;1:12; 14:21, 23; 21:15-17; Eph. 6:23.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">The Excellency of Christ</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 8</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Psalm 8 shows that God&rsquo;s purpose and plan for man to express Him with His image and to represent Him with His dominion have never changed&mdash;Gen. 1:26:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The man prophesied in Psalm 8 is the second man, the Lord Jesus, who has recovered man&rsquo;s lost ordination and has fulfilled God&rsquo;s original purpose&mdash;Heb. 2:5-9.</li>
	<li>This second man is also a corporate man, the new man, the corporate Christ, who expresses God in His image and represents God to have dominion over all things for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;Eph. 2:15; Col. 3:10-11; Acts 9:4-5; Eph. 1:22-23; Heb. 2:10-11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 8 is David&rsquo;s inspired praise of the excellency of Christ&mdash;this psalm speaks of the heavens, the earth, babes and sucklings, man, three categories of enemies, and the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension, the Body of Christ, His coming back, and His kingdom.</li>
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s name is excellent (majestic) in all the earth, and His splendor (glory) has been set over the heavens&mdash;v. 1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Psalms 3 through 7 it was a mess on the earth, according to David&rsquo;s human concept.</li>
	<li>Here in Psalm 8 the name of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, ascended, and exalted Jesus (Phil. 2:5-11) is excellent (majestic) in all the earth according to the divine revelation, and the Lord&rsquo;s glory is over the heavens in the sight of David.</li>
	<li>The goal of this psalm is to join the earth to the heavens and bring the heavens down to the earth, making the earth and the heavens one&mdash;John 1:51; Gen. 28:12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings the Lord has established strength (praise&mdash;Matt. 21:16) because of His adversaries, to stop the enemy and the avenger&mdash;Psa. 8:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Babes and sucklings are the youngest, smallest, and weakest among men, indicating the highest consummation of the Lord&rsquo;s work in His redemption.</li>
	<li>The Lord has established praise out of the mouths of babes and sucklings because of His adversaries (within) and for the stopping of the enemy and the avenger (without).</li>
	<li>Satan is God&rsquo;s adversary within God&rsquo;s kingdom, God&rsquo;s enemy outside God&rsquo;s kingdom, and the avenger who roves to and fro over the earth&mdash;cf. Job 1:7; 1 Pet. 5:8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>David saw the heavens, the works of the Lord&rsquo;s fingers, the moon and the stars, which the Lord has ordained&mdash;Psa. 8:3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The moon and the stars indicate that David had this view&mdash;a view turned from looking at the earth to contemplating the heavens in the night.</li>
	<li>In this view David had a pure vision to see the pure work in God&rsquo;s creation and ordination.</li>
	<li>The aim in the Lord&rsquo;s redemption is to turn us from the messy earth to the bright heaven.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>What is mortal man, that the Lord remembers him, and the son of man, that He visits him?&mdash;v. 4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In his view in the heavens, David turned his consideration to man on the earth.</li>
	<li>Man is the central object of God in His creation for the accomplishment of His economy to fulfill His heart&rsquo;s desire.</li>
	<li>The first &ldquo;man&rdquo; in verse 4 is <em>enosh</em> in Hebrew, and the second &ldquo;man&rdquo; is <em>adam</em> in Hebrew, both referring to:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The God-created man in God&rsquo;s creation in Genesis 1:26.</li>
		<li>The Satan-captured man in man&rsquo;s fall in Psalm 8:4.</li>
		<li>Christ as a man in His incarnation for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s redemption in Hebrews 2:6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Such a man God remembers in His economy and visits in His incarnation&mdash;John 1:14; Phil. 2:7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord has made man a little lower than angels&mdash;Psa. 8:5a; Heb. 2:7a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This refers to Christ&rsquo;s incarnation with His human living for His all-inclusive death&mdash;John 1:14; Heb. 2:9a.</li>
	<li>In His incarnation Christ was made a little lower than angels, physically not positionally, in the sense of being in the flesh.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God has crowned man (Christ) with glory and honor&mdash;Psa. 8:5b; Heb. 2:7b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This refers to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection in His glory (John 7:39b; Luke 24:26) and His ascension in His honor (Acts 2:33-36; 5:31a).</li>
	<li>This was through His all-inclusive death&mdash;Heb. 2:9.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 8:2-5 shows us how the babes and sucklings are produced:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In order to produce babes and sucklings, God has visited man&mdash;v. 4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God visited man by becoming incarnated, by putting on humanity and becoming a man to be a little lower than the angels&mdash;v. 5a.</li>
		<li>God visited man also by living on earth, dying, rising up from the dead, and ascending to the heavens to be crowned with glory and honor&mdash;v. 5b.</li>
		<li>God visited man through the long journey of His process to become the life-giving Spirit to reach us and to enter into us&mdash;John 1:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17; cf. 1 Pet. 2:12; Luke 1:68, 78.</li>
		<li>The incarnated One has become the life-giving Spirit, and it is this One who produces babes and sucklings.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We become babes and sucklings in the initial stage through regeneration:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We are remade, re-created, through regeneration&mdash;cf. Matt. 18:3; 19:14.</li>
		<li>Regeneration reduces our natural activity.</li>
		<li>The proper, genuine salvation stops our human doing and makes us babes and sucklings to praise the Lord.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The process of producing babes and sucklings continues with sanctification, renewing, and transformation&mdash;Heb. 2:11; Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
	<li>The Lord has perfected praise, or established strength, out of the mouths of babes and sucklings for the purpose of stopping His adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger&mdash;Psa. 8:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God overcomes His enemy through babes and sucklings, the youngest, smallest, and weakest among men; this is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and victory&mdash;cf. 1 Cor. 1:26-31.</li>
		<li>All things will be ruled over by Christ with His Body, and all things will be subjected under His feet&mdash;Psa. 8:6-8.</li>
		<li>The perfected praise of the babes and sucklings is the ultimate consummation of the Lord&rsquo;s work of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, ascension, and coming back to rule on earth:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We may praise the Lord, but our praise needs to be perfected; through transformation we are perfected in praising the Lord.</li>
			<li>The perfected praise is the praise for the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, ascension, and kingdom.</li>
			<li>In order to praise the Lord, we need to see Jesus, turning our view from the messy earth to the bright heaven&mdash;Heb. 2:9; 12:1-2.</li>
			<li>The perfected praise is the strength out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, the praise that defeats the adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger&mdash;2 Chron. 20:22; cf. vv. 12, 20-21.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>&ldquo;Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. 13:15.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 22; Matt. 27:45-46; Heb. 2:10-12</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The subject of Psalm 22 is the Christ who has passed through His redeeming death and entered into His church-producing resurrection.</li>
<li>Psalm 22:1-21 gives a detailed picture of Christ in His suffering of death (cf. Isa. 53), as typified by David in his suffering:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The question in Psalm 22:1 was spoken by David in his suffering, but it became a prophecy concerning Christ in His suffering of His redeeming death.</li>
	<li>Verses 6 through 8 display Christ&rsquo;s suffering unto death through men&rsquo;s reproach, despising, deriding, sneering, head-shaking, and mocking.</li>
	<li>Verses 9 through 11 show that while people were mocking Him and deriding Him, Christ trusted in God for deliverance, that is, for resurrection; He intended definitely to die and expected to be delivered from death, that is, to be resurrected from the dead&mdash;Luke 18:31-33; Heb. 5:7.</li>
	<li>Psalm 22:12-18 depicts in vivid detail how Christ passed through His suffering of crucifixion&mdash;Mark 15:16-37.</li>
	<li>God judged Christ and put Him into death for our redemption&mdash;Psa. 22:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>On the one hand, man crucified the Lord Jesus; on the other hand, God killed Him:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the first three hours that Christ was on the cross, He was persecuted by men for doing God&rsquo;s will.</li>
			<li>In the last three hours, Christ was our Substitute, He became sin on our behalf, and He died a vicarious death to redeem us from our sins and from God&rsquo;s judgment&mdash;2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Pet. 3:18; 1 Cor. 15:3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>All the sin of the world was laid on Christ as the Lamb of God; God judged Him and put Him into death for our redemption&mdash;Isa. 53:6b, 10a; 1 Pet. 2:24a; John 1:29.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>On the cross Christ was forsaken by God&mdash;Psa. 22:1; Matt. 27:45-46:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>While Christ was on the earth, God the Father was with Him all the time, but at a certain point in His crucifixion, God forsook Him&mdash;John 8:29; Matt. 27:45-46.</li>
		<li>When the Lord Jesus died on the cross under God&rsquo;s judgment, He had God within Him essentially as His divine being; nevertheless, He was forsaken by the righteous and judging God economically&mdash;1:20; 3:16-17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord Jesus had been born of the Spirit; thus, the Spirit was one of the two essences of His being&mdash;1:20; Luke 1:35.</li>
			<li>Before the Spirit of God descended and came upon the Lord Jesus, He already had the Spirit of God within Him&mdash;Matt. 3:16.</li>
			<li>On the cross Christ, the God-man, presented Himself to God as the all-inclusive sacrifice through the eternal Spirit&mdash;Heb. 9:14.</li>
			<li>After God had counted Christ as a sinner to be our Substitute and had accepted His offering, God, as the Holy Spirit who had come upon Him, forsook Him&mdash;Matt. 27:46.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Although God as the Spirit left the Lord Jesus economically, Christ nevertheless died as the Son of God, a God-man; hence, in His death there is a divine and eternal element&mdash;Acts 20:28; 1 John 1:7; Heb. 9:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>After passing through His redeeming death, Christ entered into His church-producing resurrection&mdash;Psa. 22:22-31:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Verses 22 through 31 refer to Christ in His resurrection, as typified by Solomon in his kingly reign.</li>
	<li><em>I</em> in verse 22a is the resurrected Christ who declares the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers&mdash;Heb. 2:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It was in His resurrection that Christ called His disciples His brothers, for in God&rsquo;s eternal view His disciples were regenerated and became God&rsquo;s sons in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;John 20:17; Matt. 28:10; 1 Pet. 1:3.</li>
		<li>In His resurrection Christ Himself was begotten to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son (Psa. 2:7; Acts 13:33) and became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), and all God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people were regenerated to be the many sons of God, the many brothers of Christ (Heb. 2:10-12; Rom. 8:29).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In Psalm 22:22b the assembly signifies the church, indicating that the Lord&rsquo;s brothers constitute the church; thus, His resurrection is the church-producing resurrection&mdash;Heb. 2:10-12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church is a living composition of the many sons of God, who are the many brothers of Christ, brought forth in His resurrection&mdash;vv. 10-12.</li>
		<li>As the many brothers of Christ, we are the same as the firstborn Son; He is divine and human, and we are human and divine, and thus the church is both human and divine&mdash;an organism with two lives and two natures combined and mingled together&mdash;v. 11; 1:6; Rom. 8:29; cf. Lev. 2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In Psalm 22:22 <em>You</em> and <em>Your</em> refer to the Father:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In resurrection Christ declared the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers and praised the Father in the church&mdash;Heb. 2:12.</li>
		<li>The praise in Psalm 22:22 is the firstborn Son&rsquo;s praising of the Father within the Father&rsquo;s many sons in the church meetings&mdash;Heb. 2:10, 12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>It is not that the Son praises the Father apart from us and alone; rather, He praises within us and with us through our praising.</li>
			<li>When we, the many sons of God, meet as the church and praise the Father, the firstborn Son praises the Father in our praising&mdash;v. 12b; cf. Matt. 26:30.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church ushers in Christ&rsquo;s kingdom for Christ to rule over the nations; the church, produced by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, is the reality of the kingdom and a precursor to the manifestation of the kingdom in the millennium&mdash;Psa. 22:27-28; Matt. 16:18-19; Rom. 14:17.</li>
	<li>Jehovah as Christ will rule over the nations in the millennial kingdom&mdash;Psa. 22:28; 2:8-9; Rev. 19:15; 20:4, 6.</li>
	<li>The believers are the seed of Christ, and their declaring the Lord&rsquo;s righteousness (justification, salvation) to a coming generation refers to the preaching of the gospel&mdash;Psa. 22:30-31.</li>

John 21:15-17; Heb. 13:20-21; 1 Pet. 2:25; 5:1-4</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>In Psalm 22 Christ was the Redeemer and the Regenerator, in Psalm 23 He is now the Shepherd, and in Psalm 24 He will be the King who will regain the entire earth through the church, His Body, the people whom He has redeemed and regenerated and is shepherding today:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In His heavenly ministry Christ is shepherding people, and we need to cooperate with Him by shepherding people; this is the apostolic ministry in cooperation with Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry&mdash;John 21:15-17; Heb. 13:20; 1 Pet. 5:1-4.</li>
	<li>If all the churches receive the teaching to participate in Christ&rsquo;s wonderful shepherding, there will be a big revival in the recovery; our cooperation with Him in His heavenly ministry of shepherding will build up His Body, prepare His bride, for His second coming to be the King in the next age.</li>
	<li>To shepherd people is to cherish and nourish them, as illustrated by the entire New Testament:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ as the Son of Man came to redeem us from sin (1 Tim. 1:15)&mdash;cherishing.</li>
		<li>Christ as the Son of God came to impart the divine life into us abundantly (John 10:10b)&mdash;nourishing.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Christ is our inward, pneumatic Shepherd, taking care of our inner being&mdash;v. 11; Heb. 13:20-21; 1 Pet. 5:1-4; 2:25.</li>
<li>The indwelling, pneumatic Christ is &ldquo;my Shepherd,&rdquo; and under His all-inclusive, tender care &ldquo;I will lack nothing&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 3:17a; 2 Tim. 4:22; 1 Cor. 6:17; Phil. 1:19; Psa. 23:1.</li>
<li>According to Psalm 23, Christ shepherds us in five stages:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The initial stage is the enjoyment of Christ as the green pastures and of the Spirit as the waters of rest&mdash;v. 2.</li>
	<li>The second stage is the revival and transformation on the paths of righteousness&mdash;v. 3.</li>
	<li>The third stage is the experience of the resurrected pneumatic Christ while walking through the valley of the shadow of death&mdash;v. 4.</li>
	<li>The fourth stage is the deeper and higher enjoyment of the resurrected Christ in fighting against the adversaries&mdash;v. 5.</li>
	<li>The fifth stage is the lifelong enjoyment of the divine goodness and lovingkindness in the house of Jehovah&mdash;v. 6.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In His organic shepherding, the pneumatic Christ &ldquo;makes me lie down in green pastures&rdquo;&mdash;v. 2a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Green</em> signifies the riches of life; the green pastures are Christ Himself as our nourishment&mdash;John 10:9.</li>
	<li>Christ can be our green pasture, our feeding place, through His incarnation, death, and resurrection.</li>
	<li>The base of the Greek word for <em>economy</em> in 1 Timothy 1:4 is of the same origin as that for <em>pasture</em> in John 10:9, implying a distribution of pasture to the flock; this reveals that Psalm 23 is a psalm on God&rsquo;s economy, His household administration, to dispense Himself as the green pastures into His people and build them up to be the house of Jehovah, the divine-human incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God with His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite people&mdash;v. 6.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In His organic shepherding, the pneumatic Christ &ldquo;leads me beside waters of rest&rdquo;&mdash;v. 2b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The waters of rest signify the Spirit, the consummated Spirit after Christ&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;John 7:37-39.</li>
	<li>Both the green pastures and the restful waters are the resurrected, pneumatic Christ as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; John 14:16-18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In His organic shepherding, the pneumatic Christ &ldquo;restores my soul&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 23:3a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>For our soul to be restored means that we are revived; restoring also includes renewing and transforming&mdash;Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
	<li>Our Lord, as the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls, shepherds us by caring for the welfare of our inner being and by exercising His oversight over the condition of our real person&mdash;1 Pet. 2:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ takes care of us in a tender, all-inclusive way; this kind of shepherding is an inward, intrinsic, organic comforting&mdash;John 14:16, 26; cf. 2 Cor. 1:3-4.</li>
		<li>Because our soul is very complicated, we need Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit, to shepherd us in our soul, to take care of our mind, emotion, and will and of our problems, needs, and wounds&mdash;cf. Isa. 61:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In His organic shepherding, the pneumatic Christ &ldquo;guides me on the paths of righteousness / For His name&rsquo;s sake&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 23:3b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ guides us (to walk according to the spirit) on the paths of righteousness (to fulfill the requirement of righteousness&mdash;Rom. 8:4).</li>
	<li><em>The paths of righteousness</em> indicates our walk&mdash;v. 4; Gal. 5:16, 25.</li>
	<li><em>For His name&rsquo;s sake</em> means for the sake of His person, His living person as the pneumatic Christ&mdash;Matt. 28:19; 18:20; Col. 3:17.</li>
	<li>Christ restores our soul so that we may take His way and walk on the paths of righteousness:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to be proper and balanced in our mind, emotion, and will; otherwise, we cannot be righteous.</li>
		<li>Under the organic shepherding of the pneumatic Christ, we are balanced, corrected, and adjusted.</li>
		<li>In all that we do, we need to be under Christ&rsquo;s shepherding, taking Christ as both our paths and our righteousness.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Righteousness is being right with persons, things, and matters before God according to His righteous and strict requirements&mdash;Matt. 5:20.</li>
	<li>Righteousness is a matter of God&rsquo;s kingdom; thus, righteousness issues from God for His administration and is related to His government and rule&mdash;6:33; Psa. 89:14a; 97:2b; Isa. 32:1.</li>
	<li>Righteousness is the living out and genuine expression of Christ, who as the life-giving Spirit lives in us&mdash;Rev. 19:8; 2 Cor. 3:9.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Under the organic shepherding of the pneumatic Christ, &ldquo;even though I walk / Through the valley of the shadow of death, / I do not fear evil, / For You are with me; / Your rod and Your staff, / They comfort me&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 23:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>For the pneumatic Christ to be with us means that we enjoy His invisible presence, which is special, personal, and intimate&mdash;Matt. 28:20b; 2 Tim. 4:22a.</li>
	<li>The presence of the pneumatic Christ is a comfort, a rescue, and a sustaining power to us when we are walking through the valley of the shadow of death.</li>
	<li>When we are in the valley, we should simply remain there and rest in the Lord; our resting in the Lord will shorten the valley, reduce the shadow, and remove the death.</li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s rod, a symbol of His authority, is for our protection:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We are under the Lord&rsquo;s authority and take the way marked out by Him.</li>
		<li>Every negative thing&mdash;death, darkness, fear, evil&mdash;is under His rule, control, and authority.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s staff is for guidance, instruction, training, direction, and sustenance.</li>
	<li>Under the organic shepherding of the pneumatic Christ in the valley of the shadow of death, we experience God as the God of resurrection and may attain to the out-resurrection&mdash;John 11:25; 2 Cor. 1:8-9; Phil. 3:10-11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Under the organic shepherding of the pneumatic Christ, He spreads &ldquo;a table before me / In the presence of my adversaries; / You anoint my head with oil; / My cup runs over&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 23:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord spreads a table before us in the presence of our adversaries&mdash;v. 5a; cf. 2 Sam. 4:4; 9:7, 13; Gen. 14:18-20; Neh. 4:17.</li>
	<li>The Lord anoints our head with oil (as at a festal banquet), and our cup (the cup of blessing) runs over&mdash;Psa. 23:5b; Heb. 1:9; 1 Cor. 10:16a, 21.</li>
	<li>In Psalm 23:5 we have the Triune God&mdash;the Son as the table, the feast, the Spirit as the anointing oil, and the Father as the source of blessing.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Under the organic shepherding of the pneumatic Christ, &ldquo;surely goodness and lovingkindness will follow me / All the days of my life, / And I will dwell in the house of Jehovah / For the length of my days&rdquo;&mdash;v. 6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Goodness</em> refers to the grace of Christ, <em>lovingkindness</em> refers to the love of the Father, and <em>follow</em> refers to the fellowship of the Spirit; thus, the grace of the Son, the love of the Father, and the fellowship of the Spirit are with us&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14.</li>
	<li>The enjoyment of the processed and consummated Triune God ushers us into the enjoyment of God in the house of God (Christ, the church, and the New Jerusalem&mdash;John 1:14; 2:21; 1 Tim. 3:15-16; Eph. 2:22; Rev. 21:2-3, 22) for the length of our days (in the present age, in the coming age, and in eternity).</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 45</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Psalm 45 presents a complete view, a full picture, of Christ&rsquo;s beauty, which is in Christ Himself (vv. 1-8), as unveiled in the four Gospels (in the stage of His incarnation); in the church, His wife (vv. 9-15), as revealed in the Epistles (in the stage of His inclusion); and in all His sons, the overcomers as the princes (vv. 16-17), as seen in Revelation (in the stage of His intensification):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This psalm praises Christ not only concerning the things that are of Him directly but also concerning the things that are of Him indirectly, as manifested through His church and His overcomers.</li>
	<li>Our speaking well of the church and the believers is also a praise to Christ&mdash;cf. Num. 23:21; 24:9b.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Hear, O daughter, and see; and incline your ear; / And forget your people and your father&rsquo;s house; / Thus the King will desire your beauty&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 45:10-11a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>All the local churches must learn how to hear and how to forget, how to hear the Spirit&rsquo;s living, up-to-date speaking and how to forget the past&mdash;the old relationships, the old ways, and the old background.</li>
	<li>The more we forget the past and go on with the Lord in a new way, the more beautiful we become in the King&rsquo;s eyes.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 45, the highest and greatest of all the psalms, is one of the psalms of the sons of Korah, a song of love according to the melody of lilies:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The great work of God is to restore the desolated building of God and to recover &ldquo;the sons of Korah&rdquo; by transforming rebellious ones, through His unlimited mercy and grace, into Christ&rsquo;s overcomers to make them the constituents of His bride, His overcoming queen&mdash;Num. 16:1-3; Psa. 42, title; 106:16; 1 Chron. 6:33-37; Psa. 88, title; Rev. 19:7-9.</li>
	<li>If we are those who affectionately love the Lord, we eventually become His love, His favorite&mdash;S. S. 1:1-4, 14-15; 2:4.</li>
	<li>A lily denotes a pure, simple, single life of trusting in God&mdash;vv. 1-2; Matt. 6:28-29; cf. 1 Kings 7:17-19.</li>

<li>The psalmist praises Christ the King in His fairness; Christ is fairer than the sons of men&mdash;Psa. 45:1-2; cf. 27:4b; S. S. 5:9-16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Grace is poured upon Christ&rsquo;s lips&mdash;Luke 4:17-22; cf. Eph. 4:29-30.</li>
	<li>Because the man Jesus is fair, sweet, and full of grace, God has been moved to bless Him forever&mdash;Rom. 9:5.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The psalmist praises Christ the King in His victory&mdash;Psa. 45:3-5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the eyes of Satan and his fallen angels, Christ is the mighty One who has girded His sword upon His thigh, the One with majesty and splendor as signs of His victory&mdash;v. 3.</li>
	<li>In His splendor Christ rides on victoriously because of truth, meekness, and righteousness; regardless of what the situation is on earth, regardless of what the nations are doing, Christ is riding on triumphantly, prosperously; from the day of His ascension He began to ride on, and He will continue to ride until He comes back in victory&mdash;v. 4a; Acts 5:31; Rev. 6:2; 19:11-16.</li>
	<li>His right hand performs awesome deeds; Christ&rsquo;s awesome deeds include His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension; everything that the Lord Jesus does, whether great or small, is awesome&mdash;Psa. 45:4b.</li>
	<li>His arrows are sharp in the heart of His enemies, and the peoples fall under Him&mdash;v. 5; cf. Rev. 6:2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The psalmist praises Christ the King in His kingdom&mdash;Psa. 45:6-7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As God, Christ&rsquo;s throne is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of His kingdom&mdash;v. 6; Heb. 1:8.</li>

	</ol></li>
<li>The psalmist praises Christ the King in the sweetness of His virtues&mdash;Psa. 45:8; cf. 1 Pet. 2:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>All His garments smell of myrrh and aloes and of cassia&mdash;Psa. 45:8a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Garments signify Christ&rsquo;s deeds and virtues; myrrh and aloes signify the sweetness of His death; and cassia signifies the fragrance and repelling power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</li>
		<li>The way to experience Christ in His crucifixion by the power of His resurrection is by the Spirit Himself, who is in our spirit&mdash;cf. S. S. 2:8-14; Rom. 8:16; Phil. 3:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>From palaces of ivory, harpstrings have made Him glad&mdash;Psa. 45:8b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Palaces signify the local churches; ivory, a bone-like substance, signifies the resurrection life of Christ (John 19:36; cf. S. S. 7:4; 4:4; 1 Kings 10:18); and harpstrings signify praises.</li>
		<li>The local churches are beautiful in the eyes of the Lord and are His expression, and they are built with the resurrection life of Christ; from the local churches come the praises that make Him glad.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The psalmist praises Christ the King in the praising of the queen with the daughters of kings among the king&rsquo;s most prized (honorable) women and the virgins, the queen&rsquo;s companions&mdash;Psa. 45:9-15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The queen typifies the church, especially the overcomers, as the unique wife of Christ, and the honorable women around the queen signify Christ&rsquo;s overcoming guests; this indicates that the bride of Christ is actually a group of overcomers&mdash;vv. 9-10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The daughters of kings signify the believers of Christ in their royalty.</li>
		<li>The king&rsquo;s most prized women signify the believers of Christ in their honor and majesty.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The king desires the queen&rsquo;s beauty; the queen&rsquo;s beauty signifies the virtues of Christ expressed through the church&mdash;v. 11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The beauty of the bride comes from the Christ who is wrought into the church and who is then expressed through the church&mdash;Eph. 1:17-23; 3:16-21; 5:25-27.</li>
		<li>Our only beauty is the shining out of Christ from within us; what Christ appreciates in us is the expression of Himself&mdash;Phil. 1:20; 2:15-16; Isa. 60:1, 5; cf. Exo. 28:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In Psalm 45 the queen has two garments:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first garment is the gold of Ophir, the woven work inwrought with gold&mdash;vv. 9b, 13b:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This garment corresponds to Christ as our objective righteousness, which is for our salvation&mdash;Luke 15:22; 1 Cor. 1:30; Isa. 61:10.</li>
			<li>The queen&rsquo;s being covered with gold signifies the church&rsquo;s appearing in the divine nature&mdash;Psa. 45:9b; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
			<li>The garment of woven work inwrought with gold signifies that the Christ who has been dealt with through death and resurrection is the righteousness of the church to meet the righteous requirement of God for her to be justified before God&mdash;Gal. 2:16; Rom. 3:26.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The second garment is the embroidered clothing&mdash;Psa. 45:14a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This garment corresponds to Christ lived out of us as our subjective righteousnesses, which are for our victory&mdash;Rev. 19:8.</li>
			<li>As our subjective righteousnesses, Christ is the One dwelling in us to live for us a life that is always acceptable to God&mdash;Phil. 3:9; Matt. 5:6, 20; Rom. 8:4; cf. Psa. 23:3.</li>
			<li>The garment of embroidered clothing signifies that the church will be led to Christ clothed with the righteousnesses of the saints to meet the requirement of Christ for their marriage&mdash;Rev. 19:8; cf. Matt. 22:11-14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The king&rsquo;s daughter is all glorious within the royal abode, and the virgins will enter the king&rsquo;s palace&mdash;Psa. 45:13a, 14-15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The king&rsquo;s daughter is the queen, signifying the church, and her being all glorious within the royal abode signifies the glorious church taking Christ as her royal abode&mdash;v. 13a; John 15:4a.</li>
		<li>We take Christ as our abode, we become His abode, and this mutual abode eventually becomes the palace, which signifies the New Jerusalem&mdash;14:23; 15:5; Psa. 45:15b; Rev. 21:3, 22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The psalmist praises Christ the King in the praising of His sons, His descendants&mdash;Psa. 45:16-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;In the place of Your fathers will be Your sons; / You will make them princes in all the earth&rdquo;&mdash;v. 16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Here <em>fathers</em> signifies Christ&rsquo;s forefathers in the flesh, <em>sons</em> signifies the overcomers of Christ as His descendants, and <em>princes</em> signifies the overcomers of Christ as His co-kings, who will reign with Christ over the nations&mdash;Rev. 2:26-27; 20:4, 6.</li>
		<li>Only Christ the King reigning on the earth with the overcomers as His helpers in the kingship can solve the problems of today&rsquo;s world&mdash;Isa. 42:1-4; Hag. 2:7a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s name will be remembered in all generations through the overcoming saints, and Christ will be praised by the nations through His overcoming and co-reigning saints&mdash;Psa. 45:17.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 51</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Psalm 51 was composed after David&rsquo;s great sin in murdering Uriah and robbing him of his wife and after David was rebuked by the prophet Nathan; Psalm 51 is David&rsquo;s psalm of repentance&mdash;2 Sam. 11:1&mdash;12:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>First, there were transgression and repentance plus forgiveness; after that, there was Solomon (12:24), the one who built God&rsquo;s temple.</li>
	<li>Thus, God&rsquo;s forgiveness &ldquo;married&rdquo; David&rsquo;s transgression and repentance, and this marriage brought forth the man named Solomon, who built the temple of God; Solomon is a type of Christ and of those who experience Christ to be one with Him:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The name Solomon means &ldquo;peaceful&rdquo; (v. 24; 1 Chron. 22:9), but Solomon has another name, Jedidiah (2 Sam. 12:25), which means &ldquo;beloved of the Lord.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>Solomon built the temple of God in the kingdom (1 Kings 6:1-2) and spoke the word of wisdom (10:23-24; Matt. 12:42); today we can be one with Christ to prophesy by speaking Him forth as the word of wisdom for the building up of the church as the temple of God&mdash;1 Cor. 12:8; 14:4b; cf. 3:12a, 16-17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The building up of God&rsquo;s temple, the church consummating in the New Jerusalem, comes from man&rsquo;s transgression and repentance plus God&rsquo;s forgiveness&mdash;Matt. 1:6; Psa. 51:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Confessing our sins in the divine light for God&rsquo;s forgiveness is the way to drink Christ as the living water for us to become the New Jerusalem&mdash;John 4:14-18; cf. Num. 21:16-18.</li>
		<li>Confessing our sins in the divine light for God&rsquo;s forgiveness is the way to keep ourselves in the fellowship of life for our growth in life unto the maturity in life&mdash;1 John 1:2-3, 5-9; Acts 24:16.</li>
		<li>Receiving the forgiveness of sins issues in our fearing God and loving God&mdash;Psa. 130:4; Luke 7:47-50.</li>
		<li>Ministering Christ as the sin-dealing life to the saints kills the germs, destroys the problems, and maintains the oneness of the Spirit&mdash;John 8:1-11; 1 John 5:16; Rom. 2:4b; Lev. 10:17; Gal. 6:1; Psa. 51:13.</li>
		</ol></li>

<li>Like David, we need to stay in the presence of God to have a thorough and genuine repentance and confession to receive a full forgiveness from God&mdash;v. 2; Acts 24:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The verbs used by David in Psalm 51&mdash;<em>blot out</em> (vv. 1, 9), <em>wash</em> (vv. 2, 7), <em>cleanse</em> (v. 2), and <em>purge</em> (v. 7)&mdash;indicate that his repentance and confession were thorough and that his asking for forgiveness was genuine.</li>
	<li>Since the Lord knows the record of our sinful doings, it is best for us to ask Him to rid us of that record by confessing&mdash;1 John 1:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us all the time, continuously and constantly, from every sin&mdash;v. 7.</li>
		<li>Once God forgives us, He erases our sins from His memory and remembers them no longer&mdash;Heb. 8:12; Psa. 103:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>After such a thorough and fine confession, we will be filled with the Spirit essentially and economically to make us buoyant and bold in our God to speak the gospel of God&mdash;1 Thes. 2:2, 4; Acts 26:18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>David confessed that he was born in sin, and he pleaded with God to blot out his transgressions, wash him thoroughly from his iniquity, cleanse him from his sin, and purge his sin with hyssop&mdash;Psa. 51:1-2, 5, 7, 9; cf. 1 John 1:8-10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To pray in this way indicates that we have no trust in ourselves.</li>
	<li>Hyssop typifies Christ in His humble and humiliated human nature (1 Kings 4:33a; Exo. 12:22a), implying Christ as the Mediator and the sacrifice (Heb. 8:6; 9:15; 10:9-10).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>David asked God to create in him a clean (pure) heart and to renew a steadfast spirit within him&mdash;Psa. 51:10:

<li>David&rsquo;s repentance and confession issued in his asking for God&rsquo;s goal&mdash;&ldquo;Do good in Your good pleasure unto Zion; / Build the walls of Jerusalem&rdquo;&mdash;v. 18:

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 68</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Psalm 68 reveals God&rsquo;s move on the earth:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s move began after the rearing up of the tabernacle with the Ark, signifying Christ incarnated to be the dwelling place of God on the earth, with Himself as the center for God&rsquo;s move in His economy&mdash;v. 1; John 1:14a; Num. 9:15a.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s move in the tabernacle with the Ark from Mount Sinai (Psa. 68:8b, 17b) through the wilderness (vv. 4b, 7b) to Mount Zion (v. 16) was a type of His move in Christ from the incarnation to the ascension&mdash;John 1:17; Eph. 4:8-10.</li>
	<li>God is still moving on this earth in and through the church, and He is moving with Christ as the center of the church&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15-16; Psa. 68:4, 7.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s move in man is to deify man, making man the same as He is in life and in nature but not in the Godhead&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:10, 6, 11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 68 reveals God&rsquo;s victory in Christ as the center, typified by the Ark:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Let God arise; let His enemies be scattered; / And let those who hate Him flee before Him&rdquo;&mdash;wherever the Ark, a type of Christ, went, the victory was won&mdash;v. 1; Num. 10:35.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;The kings of the armies flee. / They flee!&rdquo;&mdash;these kings, who were defeated and scattered, typify Satan and the rulers, the rebellious angels&mdash;Psa. 68:12a, 14; Eph. 6:12.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;The Lord gives the command; / The women who bear the glad tidings are a great host&rdquo;&mdash;these women of Israel signify the weak ones who publish the gospel&mdash;Psa. 68:11.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;She who abides at home / Divides the spoil&rdquo;&mdash;the spoil signifies all the gains of the accomplishment, consummation, attainment, and obtainment of Christ as the reapings of the victory of His death, resurrection, and ascension&mdash;v. 12b.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Though you lie among the sheepfolds&rdquo;&mdash;lying among the sheepfolds signifies resting in God&rsquo;s provision and care for His elect&mdash;v. 13a.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;There are dove wings covered with silver, / And its pinions, with greenish-yellow gold&rdquo;&mdash;this verse reveals four items among the spoil&mdash;v. 13b:

		<li>The dove wings signify the moving power of the Spirit.</li>
		<li>Silver signifies Christ in His redemption for our justification, which is indicated by the color white, the color of approval.</li>
		<li>Pinions (the feathers at the end of a bird&rsquo;s wings giving it the strength to fly and soar) signify the flying and soaring power of the Spirit&mdash;Isa. 40:31.</li>
		<li>The greenish-yellow, glittering gold with which the pinions are covered signifies God&rsquo;s nature glittering in the divine life and glory&mdash;2 Pet. 1:4; cf. John 4:24; 1 John 4:8; 1:5.</li>
		<li>The contents of the above four items, as Christ&rsquo;s spoil in His victory for the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s elect, are actually the Triune God with all the items of His complete, full, and all-inclusive salvation&mdash;cf. Rom. 5:10, 17, 21.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s elect enjoy all the above items as their portion in Christ and announce them to others as the glad tidings&mdash;Psa. 68:11.</li>

		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Those taken captive</em> refers to the redeemed saints, who were taken captive by Satan and imprisoned before being saved by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection.</li>
		<li>Christ defeated Satan and captured his captives (including us); then like a general leading his captives, Christ in His ascension to the heavens led us to the Father&mdash;cf. 2 Cor. 2:12-14.</li>
		<li>The Amplified New Testament renders &ldquo;He led captive those taken captive&rdquo; in Ephesians 4:8 as &ldquo;He led a train of vanquished foes&rdquo;; in Christ&rsquo;s ascension there was a procession of these vanquished foes, led as captives from a war, for the celebration of Christ&rsquo;s victory.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 68 reveals Christ&rsquo;s receiving the gifts:

	<li>The gifts received by Christ have become the gifted believers, whom He gave to His Body for its building up&mdash;Eph. 4:7-12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 68 reveals the building up of the dwelling place of God:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;That Jehovah God may dwell among them&rdquo;&mdash;the gifts as the gifted persons, the believers in Christ, are built together to be the dwelling place for God; this dwelling place signifies the church, the Body of Christ&mdash;v. 18; Eph. 4:11-12.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;A Father to the orphans and a Judge for the widows / Is God in His holy habitation. / God causes the solitary to dwell in a household; / He brings the prisoners forth into prosperity&rdquo;&mdash;God&rsquo;s dwelling place is also the habitation of the believers (the needy, the solitary, and the bound ones)&mdash;Psa. 68:5-6a; Eph. 2:22.</li>
	<li>The &ldquo;mountain on which God desires to dwell&rdquo; (Psa. 68:15-16) is Mount Zion, the highest peak in the universe&mdash;cf. Rev. 14:1.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 68 reveals the enjoyment of God in His house:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">

	<li>In God&rsquo;s house we also enjoy His victory over the enemies&mdash;Psa. 68:21-23; Matt. 16:18; Rom. 16:20.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 68 reveals the praising of God according to His New Testament economy:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;They have seen Your goings, O God, / The goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary&rdquo;&mdash;<em>they</em> refers to the enemies, <em>goings</em> refers to God&rsquo;s activities, and the <em>sanctuary</em> signifies the church&mdash;v. 24.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Singers go before; players after; / In the midst of virgins sounding the tambourines&rdquo;&mdash;<em>virgins</em> signifies the believers&mdash;v. 25; 2 Cor. 11:2; Phil. 4:4.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Bless God in the congregations, / Even Jehovah, O you who are of the fountain of Israel. / There are little Benjamin, who rules them, / And the princes of Judah in their company, / The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali. / Your God has commanded your strength; / Strengthen, O God, that which You have done for us&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 68:26-28.</li>
	<li>In the praise rendered to God by His elect, there is portrayed a scenery in typology concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s redemption for His salvation by Christ and in the spreading of the glad tidings of Christ&rsquo;s accomplishment with the beautiful words of the gospel:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Psalm 68:27 speaks of &ldquo;little Benjamin&rdquo;:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>As the son of sorrows, Ben-oni, Benjamin typifies Christ, who, as the man of sorrows in His incarnation and human life on earth, accomplished God&rsquo;s eternal redemption for His full salvation&mdash;Gen. 35:18a; Isa. 53:3.</li>
			<li>As the son of the right hand, Benjamin typifies Christ, who, as the Son of the right hand of God in His resurrection, victory, and ascension, ministers in the heavens to carry out the application of God&rsquo;s redemption for His salvation&mdash;Gen. 35:18b; Heb. 1:3; 5:5-10; 7:25; 8:2.</li>

			<li>Judah reveals the victory of Christ (vv. 8-9), the kingdom of Christ (v. 10), and the enjoyment and rest in Christ (vv. 11-12).</li>
			<li>Judah, as the kingly tribe, was accompanied always by Benjamin, as a warrior tribe, for God&rsquo;s kingdom on the earth&mdash;v. 27; Rom. 5:17.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Psalm 68:27 speaks of &ldquo;the princes of Zebulun&rdquo;:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Dwelling at the shore of the sea (Galilee) and being a shore for ships (Gen. 49:13), Zebulun typifies Christ as the &ldquo;shore&rdquo; of the evangelists for the transportation and spreading in the preaching of God&rsquo;s gospel.</li>
			<li>On the day of Pentecost, at least one hundred twenty gospel &ldquo;ships,&rdquo; all of whom were Galileans, set out to spread the gospel&mdash;Acts 1:8, 11; 2:2-41.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Psalm 68:27 speaks of &ldquo;the princes of Naphtali&rdquo;:

			<li>People of both Zebulun and Naphtali were men of Galilee (4:12-17; Acts 1:11), from whom the gospel of Christ has been spread, preached, and propagated.</li>
			<li>In typology Zebulun and Naphtali form a group for the spreading and the propagating of the glad tidings of Christ&rsquo;s redemption for God&rsquo;s salvation.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 69; 40:6-8</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Psalm 69 is on the suffering Christ, typified by the suffering David&mdash;vv. 1-3, 19-20, 26:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>David was a warrior who won victories and gained territories for God&rsquo;s kingdom, yet his life was a life of suffering, and in his suffering he was a type of the suffering Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>David trusted in God and walked according to God&rsquo;s sovereignty in all his trials; under God&rsquo;s sovereignty, David took the lessons of the cross&mdash;1 Sam. 17:36-37; 23:14-16; 30:6b-10.</li>
		<li>We all need to learn two vital lessons&mdash;the lesson of God&rsquo;s sovereignty and the lesson of taking the cross with the power of resurrection&mdash;Rom. 8:28; Phil. 3:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Psalm 69 speaks of Christ&rsquo;s sufferings in a detailed way:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ was hated by many without cause&mdash;v. 4a; John 15:25.</li>
		<li>Christ suffered in bearing reproaches for the sake of God&mdash;Psa. 69:7a, 9b; Rom. 15:3.</li>
		<li>Christ was devoured by the zeal of God&rsquo;s house&mdash;Psa. 69:9a; John 2:17.</li>
		<li>Christ suffered much, and no one took pity on Him&mdash;Psa. 69:29a, 19-20; John 16:32.</li>
		<li>Christ suffered in His weeping and entreating God to deliver Him out of the waters of death&mdash;Psa. 69:10, 13-17, 1-2; Heb. 5:7.</li>
		<li>Christ was given gall as His food while He was suffering on the cross&mdash;Psa. 69:21a; Matt. 27:34.</li>
		<li>Christ in His thirst on the cross was given vinegar to drink&mdash;Psa. 69:21b; John 19:28-30.</li>
		<li>Christ was stricken and wounded by God&mdash;Psa. 69:26; Isa. 53:10a.</li>
		<li>Christ was betrayed by one of His disciples&mdash;Psa. 69:25; Acts 1:16-20a.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s suffering was for Zion and for the building of the cities of God&rsquo;s people&mdash;Psa. 69:35-36; Eph. 5:25b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus has set His suffering life before us so that we can copy it by tracing and following His steps&mdash;1 Pet. 2:21-23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord kept committing all His insults and injuries to Him who judges righteously in His government, the righteous God, to whom He submitted Himself; this indicates that the Lord recognized God&rsquo;s government while He was living a human life on earth&mdash;vv. 22-23.</li>
		<li>To follow His steps does not refer to a mere imitation of Him and His life but to a reproduction of Him that comes from enjoying Him as grace in our sufferings, so that He Himself as the indwelling Spirit, with all the riches of His life, reproduces Himself in us&mdash;v. 21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The ministry of the new covenant is produced in the new covenant ministers by the experiences of the riches of Christ gained through sufferings, consuming pressures, and the killing work of the cross&mdash;2 Cor. 1:8; 4:8-12.</li>
	<li>The apostles and the believers need to fill up &ldquo;that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ...for His Body, which is the church&rdquo;&mdash;Col. 1:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The afflictions of Christ are of two categories: those for accomplishing redemption and those for producing and building up the church through the release of the divine life&mdash;John 12:24.</li>
		<li>We cannot have fellowship (participation) in Christ&rsquo;s sufferings for redemption, but we need to have much fellowship in Christ&rsquo;s sufferings for the church; the sufferings in which we participate are for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Col. 1:24; Phil. 3:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ is the factor to enact God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Psa. 40:6-8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The prophecy in Psalm 40:6-8 is one of the greatest revelations concerning the all-inclusive Christ in the commission that God committed to Christ in His first coming through incarnation, which was to put away the animal sacrifices of the old covenant and to establish Himself, in His body, as the sacrifice of the new covenant&mdash;Heb. 10:7, 9-10.</li>
	<li>This is to terminate God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy and to initiate God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, in which Christ replaces all the offerings as well as all things, all matters, and all persons&mdash;cf. Matt. 17:4-8; Col. 2:16-17; 3:10-11.</li>
	<li>The prophecy concerning Christ in Psalm 40:6-8 is the goal and destination of the revelation of Christ in Psalms 2, 8, 16, and 22 through 24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The words <em>I have come</em> in Psalm 40:7 indicate Christ&rsquo;s first coming through His incarnation for the establishing of the new testament (covenant) by Himself as the enacting sacrifice and offering&mdash;Matt. 26:28.</li>
		<li>A sacrifice is for sin and sins before God, and an offering is for fellowship with God&mdash;Psa. 40:6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>These two things were the elements upon which the old covenant was established, and the old covenant was the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s economy in the Old Testament&mdash;Exo. 24:1-8.</li>
			<li>God&rsquo;s not delighting in and not requiring sacrifice and offering points to the termination of His economy in the Old Testament; this is the importance and the greatness of this prophecy&mdash;Psa. 40:6.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In this prophecy Christ comes through incarnation to terminate God&rsquo;s old economy and initiate God&rsquo;s new economy, His New Testament economy, by replacing the animal sacrifices and establishing Himself as the unique sacrifice of the new covenant&mdash;Heb. 10:5-9.</li>
		<li>As such a unique sacrifice, Christ is the factor to enact God&rsquo;s New Testament economy that He may be the centrality and universality for the producing and building up of the church as His organic Body, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:16; Rev. 21:2, 10-11.</li>
		<li>Christ has changed the age for the consummating of God&rsquo;s new creation out of God&rsquo;s old creation; His changing of the age is greater than the creation of the universe&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15.</li>

<li>At His second coming, Christ will take possession of the earth, which has been given to Him as His possession, and will establish God&rsquo;s kingdom on the whole earth, thus recovering God&rsquo;s right over the earth&mdash;Psa. 24:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Psalm 24:7-10 unveils the victorious Christ as the coming King in God&rsquo;s eternal kingdom.</li>
	<li>The King of glory is Jehovah of hosts, the consummated Triune God embodied in the victorious and coming Christ&mdash;vv. 7-10; Luke 21:27; Matt. 25:31:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Jehovah is Jesus (1:21 and footnote), and Jesus is the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Triune God, who is strong in fighting and is victorious&mdash;Rev. 5:5.</li>

		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Whereas Psalm 69 is on the suffering Christ, typified by the suffering David, Psalm 72 is on the reigning Christ, typified by the reigning Solomon:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Psalm 72 is actually a psalm on King Solomon, who is a type of Christ as the reigning One&mdash;Matt. 12:42.</li>
	<li>Solomon is a type of Christ as the son of David, the One who inherits the throne and kingdom of David&mdash;1:1; 2 Sam. 7:12-13; Luke 1:32-33.</li>
	<li>After His life of suffering on earth, typified by the sufferings of David, Christ ascended to the heavens, where He is now reigning as the King, typified by Solomon&mdash;1 Cor. 15:25; Rev. 17:14.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The reigning Christ is typified in Psalm 72 by the reigning Solomon, the son of David (Matt. 1:1; 22:42), in his prosperous and flourishing time (1 Kings 9&mdash;10), as indicated by the title of this psalm and by the first verse:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Psalm 72 reveals Christ reigning over the earth, with all the kings bowing down to Him and all the nations serving Him&mdash;vv. 8-11.</li>
	<li>Psalm 72 is a glorious picture of what it will be like for the Lord to recover, possess, and reign over the whole earth&mdash;vv. 17-19.</li>
	<li>The reign of Christ, typified by Solomon, will be in the millennium in the age of restoration&mdash;Rev. 20:4, 6; Matt. 19:28.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The reigning of Christ will be in righteousness and in justice, by which peace will be ushered in&mdash;Psa. 72:1-4, 7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When Christ returns, He will be the King ruling over the entire earth with righteousness and justice&mdash;89:14a; Isa. 32:1, 17; 11:4-5; 61:11b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Righteousness is a matter of God&rsquo;s kingdom, for it is related to God&rsquo;s government, administration, and rule&mdash;Matt. 6:33; Psa. 89:14a; 97:2b.</li>
		<li>Justice is righteousness with a judgment; without judgment, there is no possibility of justice.</li>
		<li>Justice comes from judgment according to a person&rsquo;s righteousness, and it declares his righteousness.</li>
		<li>This corresponds with the fact that the foundation of God&rsquo;s throne in the New Jerusalem is pure gold, signifying God&rsquo;s nature in the attributes of righteousness and justice&mdash;Rev. 21:18b; 22:1; Isa. 32:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Peace is a sign that righteousness and justice are present; as a result of Christ&rsquo;s rule with righteousness and justice, the earth will be full of peace&mdash;vv. 16-17.</li>
	<li>There will be no peace until Christ returns; under His rule, peace will begin its reign&mdash;9:6-7; cf. 1 Thes. 5:3; Jer. 6:14.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Psalm 72 reveals that in His reigning, Christ will recover the earth by watering&mdash;vv. 6, 8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;He will drop like rain upon mown grass, / Like abundant showers dripping on the earth&rdquo;&mdash;v. 6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ gains the earth not by fighting and judging but by watering.</li>
		<li>In His coming back, the Lord will not mainly exercise His righteous judgment; rather, He will come primarily like showers to water the earth.</li>
		<li>Christ will have mercy on the earth, and He will come back graciously like showers of rain to water the barren land and to satisfy the depressed and empty people&mdash;v. 6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The whole earth is a dry and barren wilderness, and many evil things spring forth from this drought and dryness; people are often sinful because they are disappointed and dissatisfied&mdash;John 4:14-18.</li>
			<li>The Lord Jesus will be the King, not merely by exercising power to subdue others but mainly by supplying living water to satisfy the thirsty ones&mdash;Rev. 22:17.</li>
			<li>In that day all nations will be rained upon by the Lord Jesus and will be happy under His dominion; all will be satisfied by His living water&mdash;Isa. 35:6b-7a; 41:18; 43:19-20; Zech. 14:16-17.</li>
			</ol></li>

	<li>&ldquo;He will have dominion from sea to sea / And from the River unto the ends of the earth&rdquo;&mdash;Psa. 72:8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s kingdom will spread to the ends of the earth by His flowing as a river&mdash;Dan. 2:44; Rev. 11:15; Joel 3:18:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ will have dominion from sea to sea and will flow as a river to the ends of the earth; where the flow is, there His dominion will be.</li>
			<li>The Lord&rsquo;s dominion will be by Himself as the flowing river; He will gain the dominion and recover the earth by His watering.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus will recover the earth by means of the river that will flow from Jerusalem&mdash;Ezek. 47:1-12; Joel 3:18:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In that day the center of the earth will be Jerusalem, and the center of Jerusalem will be the house of God, from which the river will flow.</li>
			<li>This river will reach all the earth in four directions, as in Genesis 2:10-14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In the Scriptures the concept of the divine stream is crucial&mdash;v. 10; Psa. 46:4a; John 7:37-39; Rev. 22:1-2:

			<li>The Bible reveals the flowing Triune God&mdash;the Father as the fountain of life, the Son as the spring of life, and the Spirit as the river of life&mdash;Jer. 2:13; Psa. 36:9a; John 4:14; 7:37-39.</li>
			<li>The source of the flow is the throne of God and of the Lamb&mdash;Rev. 22:1.</li>
			<li>In the Scriptures there is only one flow, only one divine stream:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) The divine stream, which has been flowing throughout the generations, is uniquely one&mdash;Gen. 2:10-14; Rev. 22:1.</li>
				<li>2) Since there is only one divine stream and since the flow is uniquely one, we need to keep ourselves in this one flow.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>Where the divine stream flows, we have the life of God, the fellowship of the Body, the testimony of Jesus, and the work of God&mdash;1 John 1:1-3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In His kingdom the reigning Christ will recover the earth by means of this river, the unique divine stream&mdash;Psa. 72:8.</li>
