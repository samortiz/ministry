   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WRITINGS OF PAUL AND JOHN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians was written in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In writing this Epistle Paul s intention was to correct and adjust the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That church was in confusion, both in the Christian life and in relation to God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul s intention was to regulate the Corinthians, rescue them from their distractions, and bring them back to the central lane of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Paul wrote this Epistle, he was enjoying the excellent church life in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The book of Romans was written in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After writing 1 Corinthians, Paul eventually left Ephesus and visited Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As he says in 2 Corinthians, he delayed coming to them because he wanted to spare them and did not want to come in sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But because they repented and were adjusted after receiving his first Epistle, Paul was happy and went to Corinth to see them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While he was in Corinth, he wrote the Epistle to the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Romans is a basic sketch, a governing sketch, of the Christian life and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this book Paul does not say a word about tongue-speaking or divine healing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He knew from his experience in Corinth how much the church had been damaged by tongue-speaking and by the so-called miraculous healing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the time, Corinth was a hotbed for such things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many were extremely enthusiastic about tongue-speaking and ecstatic over the miraculous things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, by these very things the church was ruined, destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Realizing the damage this had caused to the church in Corinth, Paul was very sober when he wrote the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Romans 12 Paul speaks of the function of the proper gifts in the Lord s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I repeat, here Paul does not say a word concerning tongue-speaking or divine healing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, he stresses having mercy, loving one another, and pursuing hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that Paul took the lead to belittle tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul s attitude in his completing ministry toward speaking in tongues is to belittle it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If this is Paul s attitude in his completing ministry, then what is John s attitude in his mending ministry?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Does John say anything about tongue-speaking, divine healing, or miracles in his first Epistle?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No, what he says in this book is based upon his Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In John 7:37-39 John points out that all those who believe in Christ will receive the Spirit and out of their being will flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This refers not to the Spirit in tongue-speaking or healing, but to the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The believers in Christ will drink the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then out of their innermost being will flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is what John says in his Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In his first Epistle he goes on to speak of the anointing which we have within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He does not speak of an ointment upon us, but of the anointing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Within us we have the Spirit of life, and this Spirit is the ointment with which we are anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This ointment is typified in Exodus 30 by the oil compounded with the spices.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This anointing is experienced not in a miraculous way, but in a spontaneous way in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, from this we see that John is one with Paul in placing no emphasis on tongue-speaking, healing, or miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What does John say concerning the Spirit in Revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He does not say anything about tongue-speaking or divine healing, but he does speak of the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to Revelation 4:5, these seven Spirits are seven lamps shining with something within them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These seven lamps do not shine in a miraculous way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, they shine in a normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Revelation 4 we have the seven Spirits of God as the seven lamps, but in chapter twenty-two we have the Spirit signified by the river flowing from the throne of God and the Lamb to water the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once again, nothing is said about tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If tongue-speaking were so important, so crucial, certainly Paul and John would have emphasized it.</S>
