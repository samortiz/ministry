   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not Keeping the Oneness in the Sects</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Heresy is a sect and is considered by God to be a work of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, we cannot keep the oneness of the sects.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must keep Christian oneness but not the oneness of the sects.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We break our Christian oneness when we maintain the oneness of the sects.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sects Bringing Swift Destruction upon Men</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second Peter 2:1 says, "But there arose also false prophets among the people, as also among you there will be false teachers, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies sects , even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sects bring in destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are brought in by the false teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We who are of God must learn to uphold Christian oneness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not maintain any oneness that is smaller than Christian oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>V. ONENESS NOT BEING AN ECUMENICAL WORK A. General Awareness among God's Children</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>of the Need of Oneness</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After a man realizes that sects lead to destruction and that they are condemned by God, he begins to see the need for oneness among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many people feel that sectarianism and division are wrong, that they should fellowship with all of God's children, and that this fellowship should be as broad as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I think this awareness has become quite common in China during the past ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Last year someone wrote to me, saying, "Although we cannot agree with your teachings against sectarianism, we feel that it is true and right for Christians to be one."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was written by a leader in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today many leaders in Christianity feel that they should pay attention to Christian oneness rather than oneness of the sects.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>B. Ecumenism</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A Oneness That Is a Halfway House</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I realize that many people have been emphasizing oneness during the past years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But what they have produced is a kind of ecumenical movement.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not a return to the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This oneness is man made.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is nothing more than an ecumenical or interdenominational work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This ecumenism accomplishes little more than to de-emphasize denominational distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Personally, I feel that this kind of oneness is just a halfway house; neither side will make it all the way home.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>C. The Need for Christians to Be Absolute</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let me say a frank word: If sectarianism is right, we should uphold it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If it is wrong, we should destroy it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What do men do today?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They say that there is nothing wrong with the sects, yet they oppose them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Or they agree that sectarianism is wrong, yet they try to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, they are reluctant to give up sectarianism.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, they oppose it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They want to keep both sides happy, and they want to maintain fellowship with both groups.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not a Christian attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the Lord's desire is for His children to have the fellowship of the Body, we should cast aside all other fellowship and only have the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I say to them: If you feel that sects are necessary, then you should do your best to uphold them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You may be wrong in conduct, but at least your intention will be right.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christians must not vacillate in their stand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A Christian must be absolute and faithful in whatever he does.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If sectarianism is right, we should maintain it at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If it is wrong, we should oppose it at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The worst thing to have is a halfway house.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the one hand, they admit that sectarianism is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the other hand, they are reluctant to give it up, and they try hard to improve it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They admit that denominationalism is wrong, but they try to organize ecumenical affiliations.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are not clear what position they are taking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not the Christian way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A Christian must not change his mind all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If something is right, there should be a proper way to handle it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If something is wrong, there should be a proper way to handle it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Any compromise or reconciliation is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A Christian should be one who does things in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If sectarianism is right, it should be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If it is wrong, it should be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There cannot be any compromise or reconciliation.</S>
