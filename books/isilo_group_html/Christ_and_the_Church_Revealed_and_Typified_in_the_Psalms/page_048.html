And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.&#8221; Psalm 41 closes the first book of the Psalms, and its last verse says, &#8220;Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.&#8221; By comparing the closing verses of Book I and Book II, we see the improvement. The conclusion of Book I is not so definite and strong as that of Book II. In Book II something is added: it still says, &#8220;Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel,&#8221; but it adds, &#8220;who only doeth wondrous things. And blessed be his glorious name for ever.&#8221; Then the Psalmist proceeds to speak something of the earth. We have read in Psalm 8, &#8220;O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth.&#8221; Psalm 8 is not fulfilled in Book I, but in Book II. Therefore, at the end of Book II, the Psalmist exclaims, &#8220;Let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.&#8221;<p>Have you seen the improvement? In Book I we have mainly Christ with the house and just a hint of the city-that is all. But when we come to the second book, we have Psalms 46, 47, 48, and 68, in which we reach the climax of the city, and we see that the city is for the entire earth. Hence, at the conclusion of Book II, we find such a marked improvement.<p>When we reach the end of Psalm 68, everything has been accomplished. Christ has ascended on high, He has received all the gifts for the building up of God&#8217;s house, and the house is built and enlarged to the city for the recovery of the entire earth. We may feel there is no need of any additional Psalms. But we must realize the style in which the Psalms are written. They always cover certain matters, repeat, and then add a little more later on. Something is mentioned in Book I, and then something more in Book II, until we reach Psalm 68, the peak of all the peaks. But following Psalm 68, something is still repeated and something is added.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST EXPRESSED IN HIS SUFFERING</h2><p>In Psalms 69 to 71 we mainly see the sufferings of Christ and how He behaves and expresses Himself in all His sufferings. Let us note His sufferings as mentioned in Psalm 69 with the New Testament references concerning their fulfillment: (1) He was hated by many without a cause-Psalm 69:4, cf. John 15:25; (2) He bore reproaches for God&#8217;s sake-Psalm 69:7, 9, cf. Rom. 15:3; (3) The zeal of God&#8217;s house has eaten Him up-Psalm 69:9, cf. John 2:17. While Christ was suffering, the zeal of God&#8217;s house consumed Him. His suffering could not cause Him to forget the house of God. He was one hundred percent for God&#8217;s house, for He came to this earth with the express purpose of building it up. (4) He suffered much, and no one took pity upon Him-Psalm 69:29, 19-20, cf. John 16:32; (5) He wept and entreated God to deliver Him out of the waters of death-Psalm 69:10, 13-17, 1-2, cf. Heb. 5:7; (6) He asked God to set Him up on high-Psalm 69:29, cf. Acts 2:32-33; (7) He promised God that He would praise Him-Psalm 69:30-34, cf. Heb. 2:12; (8) While He suffered on the cross, He was given gall as His food-Psalm 69:21, cf. Matt. 27:34; (9) In His thirst on the cross He was given vinegar to drink-Psalm 69:21, cf. John 19:28-30; (10) He was smitten and wounded by God-Psalm 69:26, cf. Isa. 53:10. He was not only persecuted and crucified by man, but, because He suffered in our stead, He was smitten and wounded by God. (11) His suffering was for the salvation of Zion and the building of the cities of God&#8217;s people-Psalm 69:35-36, cf. Eph. 5:25b. His suffering was for God&#8217;s house, for the local church, for all God&#8217;s people. In other words, He suffered that God&#8217;s people might have a dwelling place on this earth. (12) His betrayer&#8217;s habitation will become desolate-Psalm 69:25, cf. Acts 1:20.<p>Psalm 70, briefly, is the desire uttered by the Spirit of the suffering Christ in the expression of the suffering saint. Psalm 71 is also the utterance of Christ in His suffering in the suffering saint&#8217;s expression.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Church Revealed and Typified in the Psalms &nbsp; pg 48</div><br></body></html>
