<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in February of 1956 in meetings held in Taipei. These messages speak of what the church is and has, the building of the church, and the coordination, order, and authority of the Body of Christ. These messages have been translated from Chinese.</p>
