 <h2 class="head2">The Church Being the Body of Christ,<br />
the Totality of the Divine Sonship,<br />
Having the Divine Life and Nature</h2>
<p>It is not easy to define what the church is. When I was young, I often heard about the church in our Sunday school class. At that time we thought that the church was simply a physical building that has a high tower with a bell in it. Today many people still understand the church in this way. Gradually, however, we found out that the church is not a physical building. Later on, we received an improved definition of the church from the teachers among the Brethren. They told us that the church is the gathering together of the believers. When the believers, the called ones, gather together, that is the church. This definition is according to the Greek word <em>ekklesia,</em> which is translated &ldquo;church.&rdquo; However, this is still a somewhat natural understanding of the church. According to the New Testament, the church is not only the meeting together of the believers. Rather, the church is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22b-23; 1 Cor. 12:27; Col. 1:18), and it is the totality of the sonship of all God&rsquo;s children. This sonship indicates that we possess the divine life and the divine nature.</p>
<p>According to our experience, we cannot deny that as human beings we do have the divine life and the divine nature. We do not mean that we are God Himself. We can never be God Himself; we will be human beings for eternity. Nevertheless, in our humanity there is the element of God&rsquo;s divinity. We in the church are still human, but there is another element within us, which is God Himself. If someone spills a glass of plain water on his shirt, it will not change the appearance of the shirt, but if the water has the element of tea in it, it will leave a brown color. In the same way, no one should touch us without being affected by the divine element within us. We can boast to Satan, saying, &ldquo;Satan, do not touch me. I am a son of God, and within me is another element&mdash;God&rsquo;s divine life and divine nature.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living by the Divine Life and the Divine Nature<br />
for the Corporate Expression of God<br />
in the Divine Sonship</h2>
<p>This church as the divine sonship requires us to gather together, not in our self but in the divine life and the divine nature. Whenever we come together, and even in our daily life, we should not live by ourselves. We need to live according to the extra element within us, the divine life and the divine nature. This is the reason that the Christian walk requires faith. To have faith is to believe in something that we cannot see, feel, or touch. We must all live according to something unseen (2 Cor. 4:18). In himself no one can be a perfect husband. Realizing this, a brother may pray, &ldquo;O Lord, help me to be a perfect husband.&rdquo; However, the Lord does not care to help us in this way. Rather, He wants us to forget about ourselves and live by Him. We should tell the Lord, &ldquo;I can never be a perfect husband; therefore, I will forget about myself and not live by myself. Instead, I want to live by You.&rdquo; We are still a &ldquo;glass of water,&rdquo; but now our color, appearance, taste, and element have changed. In ourselves we are not good. If someone rebukes us and says that we are not a perfect husband, we can say, &ldquo;You are speaking the truth, but I am actually worse than this. I have nothing good in myself.&rdquo; Then we can say to the Lord, &ldquo;I do not ask You to help me to be good. Instead, I want to forget about myself. Thank You, Lord, that You are in me. I am no longer only water; I have the divine tea in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we can see that we are all &ldquo;teaified,&rdquo; that is, sanctified, the church will be rich, uplifted, and living. When someone drinks tea-water, he cares mainly for the tea, not for the water. We are still &ldquo;water,&rdquo; but we have an additional element with its color, appearance, and taste. The church is not a religion, a society, or a social body. Therefore, it does not serve people with mere &ldquo;water&rdquo; or with &ldquo;dry tea.&rdquo; People cannot take tea by itself. In order to take tea, it must be mingled with water. If someone looks at a glass of plain water, he may say that there is no tea, but if he has a glass of tea-water, he will see the tea. Likewise, some people today say that there is no God. They should not say this. If they would come to the church, they will see God. When we meet together as the church, we must have the element, color, appearance, and taste of God. After people attend our meeting, they should not say, &ldquo;I saw some American people, British people, young people, and older people.&rdquo; To see only this much is meaningless. Rather, they should say, &ldquo;I cannot explain what impressed me in that meeting. I did not even care for that way of meeting, but I received something there that I cannot deny.&rdquo; What people must receive in our meetings is God Himself (1 Cor. 14:24-25). This is the meaning of the church as the divine sonship.</p>
<p>In the past fifty years I have seen many cases like this. Sometimes the parents of a young person did not want their son or daughter to be involved with the church life, but once the parents started coming to the church meetings, they received the &ldquo;tea-water.&rdquo; In this way, many parents eventually took the way of the church. This is our experience in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Christianity today is a religion that offers a limited concept of salvation, but the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to bring us back to the living sonship. Here we do not care for mere opinions or concepts. Rather, we are all drinking &ldquo;tea-water&rdquo; and serving others with it. In this message I have used the illustration of tea-water because the spiritual reality that it points to is mysterious, abstract, and profound, and we do not have the adequate vocabulary in our human language to express it. We all must have a heavenly vision. Today we praise the Lord that we are saved, forgiven, and redeemed. However, we are also the sons of God. We have the divine sonship with the divine life and the divine nature within us. We are not God Himself, but we do have God&rsquo;s life and nature. Therefore, God lives in us, and we can live by God. This is not merely to be saved, forgiven, and redeemed. It is altogether a matter of the divine sonship.</p>
