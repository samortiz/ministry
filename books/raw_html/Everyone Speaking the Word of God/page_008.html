<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
AND SPEAKING THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>In the previous message I indicated first that in order to speak for God, prayer is indispensable. Second, I said that to speak for God also requires the filling of the Holy Spirit, which is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. We have already mentioned that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, or the filling of the Holy Spirit, is a matter accomplished by the Lord. It is the last of the seven great accomplishments of the Lord. We have believed in the Lord, and we all have faith; therefore, we need to enjoy these seven great accomplishments of the Lord.</p>
<p>I have been speaking for the Lord for more than fifty-three years. I cannot say that every time I speak for the Lord I am filled with the Holy Spirit or have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, but I can tell you that many times I knew that indeed I had the filling of the Holy Spirit; this was undeniable. We do not pay much attention to outward miracles; however, in the past when I spoke for the Lord, such things as miracles and wonders did occur. Nevertheless, we do not like to emphasize these things.</p>
<p>We all should realize that the Lord in whom we believe is the Lord who accomplished these seven great items: as God He was incarnated; He passed through human living; His all-inclusive death solved all our problems; He was resurrected, and He caused us to be resurrected together with Him in order that we might be regenerated; then He became the life-giving Spirit and breathed Himself into us; He ascended to the height and was made both Lord and Christ; and as the outpoured Spirit, who is also the Spirit of power, the economical Spirit, He poured Himself upon us, the church.</p>
<p>Today, the One in whom we believe is such a Lord. Let us enjoy all that He has accomplished. When you exercise to speak the word of God to others, you must believe that you have the Spirit within you and that you also have the Spirit upon you. You have the Spirit of life, the essential Spirit, within you and the Spirit of power, the economical Spirit, upon you.</p>
