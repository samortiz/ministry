<h1 class="title">THE ETERNAL JUDGMENT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rev. 20:11-15</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The conclusion of the last days
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The last days of the universe will be concluded by judgment.</li>
	<li>Of all God&rsquo;s judgments the greatest will be His judgment upon men of all generations at the end of the present heavens and earth.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s judgment
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s judgment at the end of the present heavens and earth will be executed at the great white throne. Whiteness signifies righteousness and purity. All of man&rsquo;s unrighteousness and filthiness will be reflected in front of that throne of judgment.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s judgment will be based upon the books before Him. These are the records of all of men&rsquo;s words and deeds. God&rsquo;s judgment will be made according to these records.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s judgment in that day will be made according to what we do today.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The result of God&rsquo;s judgment
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>All those whose names are not written in the book of life will be cast into the lake of fire.</li>
	<li>All those whose names are written in the book of life are the ones who have believed in the Lord Jesus and have obtained His life.</li>
	<li>The result of the judgment is that all those who did not believe in the Lord Jesus will be cast into the lake of fire.</li>
	<li>To be cast into the lake of fire is to perish forever.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to avoid the eternal judgment
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Repent and turn to God.</li>
	<li>Receive the Lord Jesus as our Savior. This is also to obtain God&rsquo;s life so that our names may be written in the book of life. Only those whose names are written in the book of life can escape the eternal judgment.</li>
	</ol></li>
