Zechariah 12:10 says, "They shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn." In Romans 11:26 Paul says, "So all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come out of Zion, He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob." In the future, Israel will be forced to turn to Christ. Presently they are neither willing nor inclined to do this because they are ignorant of Christ. Although the prime minister of Israel is an intelligent man, he, along with all others in the Israeli government, is ignorant concerning Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(d) Ignorant concerning Christ</H2><P>Genesis 42:8 says, "And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him." Just as Joseph's brothers were ignorant of him, so the people on earth today are ignorant of Christ. We, however, are knowledgeable regarding Him. Oh, we know Christ! We in the churches are not stupid. We know the world situation better than the political leaders do. We are at least as intelligent as the diplomats are, if not more intelligent. Because we are not stupid, but rather the most clever of people, we know where we must spend our time. The church is the best place for the young people to spend their time. When I was a teenager, I wasted time in so many activities. Eventually, I realized how dissatisfied I was and I turned to Christ. Now I am in the good land, the land of the church. I enjoy this land because Christ is here. We used to be ignorant concerning Christ, but now we are very clear regarding Him.</P><P>Whenever I read the newspaper, I realize that those diplomats discussing matters at the conference tables are, in the eyes of God, speaking ignorantly. They are altogether ignorant and foolish. All the conferences held in Geneva are filled with vain talk. It is much better that we come here and talk about the Bible. Our talk is most sensible, reasonable, logical, and even philosophical. Because we are no longer ignorant of Christ, we know what we are doing here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(e) Christ Testing Them</H2><P>We have pointed out that 42:8 says that Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him. Because they did not know him, Joseph tested them. This also is a type of Christ's testing Israel after they have been forced to turn to Him in ignorance. Today the nation of Israel is still struggling by itself. The Jews do not realize their need to turn to Christ. But after they have been forced to turn to Him, although in ignorance, Christ will put them to the test.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(f) Christ Disciplining Them</H2><P>In 42:17-24 we see that Joseph disciplined his brothers. This typifies Christ's disciplining the children of Israel. Christ expects that the nation of Israel will turn to Him. But He is not loose or careless. When Israel is in the process of turning to Him, He will not only test them, but also discipline them. According to the prophecies in the Bible, the reformed nation of Israel will suffer many tests and endure a great deal of discipline. The Lord will chasten them that they may learn.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_653.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_655.html">Next</a> </body></html>
