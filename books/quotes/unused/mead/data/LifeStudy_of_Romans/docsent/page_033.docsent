   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROCESS OF TRANSFUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How is this transfusion accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God, as the heavenly electricity, comes to His chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, God came to Abraham by appearing to him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we study Genesis 11 through 24, including the record in Acts 7, we find that God appeared to Abraham several times.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Acts 7:2 says that the God of glory appeared to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is sure that Abraham was attracted by the appearing of the God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be attracted simply means that God transfused Himself into Abraham without his realizing it or being conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is similar to the radium treatment practiced in modern medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The patient is placed under the X-ray, unconscious of the beams that are penetrating him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is the strongest radium.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we sit under Him for an hour, He will transfuse Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This transfusion will cause infusion, saturation, and permeation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE TRANSFUSION IN THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In any proper gospel preaching there should be such a transfusion, the transfusion of Christ into people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How can Christ be transfused into us?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is by the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever we preach the gospel of Jesus Christ in a normal way, there will be an appearing of the living Christ, and this appearing will transfuse Christ into people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I can confirm this by my own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although I was born in China and learned the teachings of Confucius, Confucius had no attraction for me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christianity as a religion did not appeal to me either.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I was nineteen years old, the Lord sent a young sister to my town to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I was curious to see her.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As I sat in the meeting place and heard her singing and speaking, the glory of God appeared, and I was attracted.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No one had to convince me to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As I listened to her, God transfused Himself into me, and this transfusion overwhelmed and conquered me, causing a very positive reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Coming out of the meeting hall and walking along the road, I lifted up my eyes to the heavens and said, God, You know I am an ambitious young man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But, even if the people promise me the whole world to be my empire, I would refuse it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I want to take You.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From this day onward I want to serve You.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I would like to be a poor preacher going from village to village, telling people how good Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this way the living Jesus was transfused into my being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Immediately I reacted to God, and God reacted back to me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My reaction to God was my believing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That was my faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God s reaction back to me was to justify me, to give His righteousness with peace and joy to me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The righteousness of God reacted to me, and from that time on I had that righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ was made the righteousness of God to me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus I had peace and joy, and I was filled with hope.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I had been justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God had called me out of everything other than Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once Christ has transfused Himself into you, you can never escape; you must believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am familiar with many cases that occurred under my own gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some people said, I simply don t know what happened to me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After I listened to that preacher the first time and came home, I said that I didn t want anything to do with Christ, that I did not like Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But something got into me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I tried to cast it away, but I couldn t do it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although I don t want to go back, something within me urges me to go hear him again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the effect of the transfusing of Christ into people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Out of this transfusion a reaction comes believing in Jesus by the faith of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>GOD S APPEARING TO ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God appeared to Abraham again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many of us have held the wrong concept about Abraham, the concept that he was a giant in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When I heard this as a young Christian, I was frightened, thinking to myself, Forget about that.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I can never be a giant of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Later, as I considered the history of Abraham, I realized that he was not the giant of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The only giant of faith is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God, as the giant of faith, transfused Himself into him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After Abraham had spent time in God s presence, He could not help believing in Him, because he had been transfused with God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thus, Abraham was attracted to God and reacted to Him in believing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His reaction was his believing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Suppose a poor man visited Abraham and said, Abraham, I know you don t have a child.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Next year I will enable you to have a child born of your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Abraham would have driven such a man away from him, telling him not to talk nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Who actually appeared to Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The incident in Genesis 15 was not God s first appearing to him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Several other appearings preceded it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The first appearing was that recorded in Acts 7.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Two more appearings are found in Genesis 12: in the first of these vv.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>1-3 God told Abraham to leave his country, his kindred, and his father s house; in the second one vv.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>7-8 God promised Abraham to give the land to his seed.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After this, Abraham, who had little experience in believing, fell into Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God s fourth appearing to Abraham was in Genesis 13:14-17, when He told Abraham to lift up his eyes and look in every direction at the land.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, the appearing of God in Genesis 15:1-7 was the fifth; it was nothing new to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God had appeared to Abraham repeatedly, and Abraham had experienced the riches of God s appearing, coming to have confidence in them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>During the first four appearings, God s element had been transfused and infused into Abraham s being.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When God appeared to Abraham, He did not leave suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He stayed with Abraham for a length of time.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>How long did God remain with Abraham in Genesis 18?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He stayed with him for about half a day, conversing with him for hours as with an intimate friend.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Throughout that whole visitation Abraham was infused with God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>During the fifth appearing Gen 15 God told Abraham that the number of his seed would be like the stars of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>As a result of the fifth appearing, Abraham had experienced such a rich infusion of God that he believed.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness Rom 4:3; Gen 15:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Abraham s faith did not come from his natural ability and it did not originate with himself.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>His believing in God was a reaction to the heavenly radium, a response to the divine infusion.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Figuratively speaking, Abraham s believing was simply God working like radium within him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What is the proper faith?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Genuine faith is the working of God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This is why God counted Abraham s faith as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It seemed that God was saying, This faith is something of Me. It corresponds to Me. This is Abraham s righteousness before Me. What was that righteousness? It was the righteousness of God.</S>
