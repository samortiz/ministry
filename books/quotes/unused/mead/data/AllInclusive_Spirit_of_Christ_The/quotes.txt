[1]  THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT OF CHRIST I. WHAT IS CHRIST?
[2]  In order for us to properly understand the all- inclusive Spirit of Christ, we must first see what Christ is.
[3]  There are many different names given to Christ in the Scriptures; however, we are not going to consider the names of Christ, but the substance of Christ, His very essence.
[4]  We are all more than clear that the Scripture reveals Christ to us as the Son of God Matt 16:15-17 .
[5]  Dean Alford, in his New Testament for English Readers, page 265, says, " The Lord,' as here 2 Cor 3:17 spoken of is identical with the Holy Spirit Christ, here, is the Spirit of Christ."
[6]  Let us now add many more things to our illustration in this way: II.
[7]  We have seen what Christ is; now we must see what the Spirit is.
[8]  Through the Old Testament He was always called the Spirit of God or the Spirit of the Lord; the name of Holy Spirit He did not yet bear as His own proper name.
[9]  When poured out at Pentecost, He came as the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, the Spirit of the Incarnate, crucified, and exalted Christ, the bearer and communicator to us, not of the life of God as such, but of that life as it had been interwoven into human nature in the person of Christ Jesus.
[10]  Let us now read Acts 16:7: "After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; but the Spirit suffered them not."
[11]  Since Jesus was a man, and is still a man, "the Spirit of Jesus" is the Spirit of the man Jesus.
[12]  The Spirit of Jesus is not only the Spirit of God with divinity in Him that we may live the divine life, but also the Spirit of the man Jesus with humanity in Him that we may live the proper human life and endure its sufferings.
[13]  By the Spirit of Jesus we can share "the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death"; but by the Spirit of Christ we can partake of "the power of his resurrection" Phil 3:10, ASV , identified with Him in the transcendency of His ascension and in the authority of His enthronement.
[14]  Since the Spirit of God today is the Spirit of Jesus and the Spirit of Christ, we have "the Spirit of Jesus Christ" in Philippians 1:19.
[15]  It says, "This shall turn to my salvation through the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ."
[16]  If we give our attention to this all-inclusive Spirit, we will continually experience the working of these items within us.
[17]  We may never have heard about the cross as the killing element within us, but when we experience the Spirit of Jesus Christ working in us, we sense that something is killing our natural, selfish character, our bad habits, our temper, and many other negative things.
[18]  As long as I experience the Holy Spirit moving and working within me, I will sense the killing of my desires, my intentions, my habits, my character, etc. The more I am filled with the Holy Spirit, the more I will be killed, for within the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the effective killing element of Christ's death.
[19]  We must realize that we are one with this all-inclusive Spirit.
[20]  He is the Spirit of truth John 14:17; 16:13 , that is, the Spirit of reality the reality of God, of man, of the Father, of the Son, and of all the elements to which we have referred.
[21]  Since the Lord Jesus Christ is the all-inclusive Spirit, this word means that the all-inclusive Spirit is in our spirit.
