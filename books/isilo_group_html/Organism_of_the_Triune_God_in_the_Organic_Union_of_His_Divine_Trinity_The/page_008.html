<p>Our organic union with the Lord is also in the Spirit. Christ and the Spirit are not two separate persons. They are one person. This is a divine mystery that is beyond human understanding. Christ is the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). The One who died on the cross, resurrected from the dead, and ascended to the heavens is Christ. But this Christ enters into us as the Spirit. When we call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; the Spirit gets into us. When we call the name of a person, we get the person of that name. If I call a brother&rsquo;s name, that brother will respond to me. The name and the person are one. When we call on the name of Jesus, we get His person&mdash;the Spirit. When we believed into the Lord Jesus, we did not call on the Spirit. We called on the Lord Jesus and we received Him as the Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; The name of the last Adam is Jesus. We called on the objective name of Jesus, and the subjective Spirit came into us. This is because the last Adam in His resurrection was transfigured into the Spirit, that is, He became the Spirit. The Spirit and Jesus Christ are one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONE SPIRIT<br />
BEING THE REALITY OF THE ONE BODY</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:4 says that there is one Body and one Spirit. The Body is the organism, and the Spirit is the reality of the organism. There is one organism and one reality. If we do not have the Spirit, we do not have the organism. As long as the Spirit is with us, we have the organism.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Very Essence of the Triune God</h2>
<p>The Spirit, who is the reality of the organism of the Triune God, is the very essence of the Triune God. John 4:24 says that God is Spirit. We may say that the essence of a certain table is wood. The Triune God also has His essence. A certain table is wood, and the Triune God is Spirit. The Spirit is His essence.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Very Reality of God</h2>
<p>The Spirit is also the very reality of God (1 John 5:6b; John 16:13). If we do not have the Spirit, we do not have God in reality. We may have God only in terminology and not as reality. The reality of God is the Spirit. When we called on the name of Jesus, God Himself came into us as the Spirit. Now God is in us. God dwells in us, and we dwell in Him because we have the Spirit who is the reality of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Reaching of the Triune God to Man</h2>
<p>The Spirit is the reaching of the Triune God to man (Eph. 2:18). Seemingly, God is far away from us in the third heavens. How could He reach us? He reaches us not as the Father or as the Son, but as the Spirit. Every Christian has experienced God reaching him as the Spirit. The Spirit is the realization of the Son, and the Son is the embodiment of the Father. In other words, the Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit. If we have the Spirit, we have the Son and the Father. When we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit entered into us. The Spirit within us is the Triune God because the Spirit is the realization of the Son, who is the embodiment of the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Processed and Compound Spirit</h2>
<p>The Spirit is also the processed and compound Spirit (Phil. 1:19). Because the Spirit has been processed, He is a compound Spirit. The Spirit has passed through the process of God&rsquo;s incarnation. When God became a man, He picked up humanity. In eternity past He was only God without humanity. But in His incarnation, humanity was added to divinity. Incarnation was a process for God to add humanity to Himself. Then God with humanity went to the cross and died. His all-inclusive death was also a wonderful process. God passed through death in humanity, in the flesh, in man. In the shell of a human body, He went through His all-inclusive death, and He was raised up in resurrection. He went into death, walked through death, and came out of death. Death could not hold Him because He is the resurrection. He raised Himself up from among the dead and entered into resurrection. He is now a God of divinity, of humanity, of incarnation, of an all-inclusive death, and of a wonderful, excellent, transcendent resurrection. The name of our God is Jesus Christ, and when we called upon Him, the Spirit as the processed God came into us. The Spirit is the processed God and the compound Spirit that has been compounded with divinity, humanity, incarnation, death, and resurrection.</p>
<p>When someone cooks a feast, the food of the feast passes through many processes. The food may be salted, other spices may be added to it, and then it is cooked. There is a great difference between a cooked fish and a raw fish. A cooked fish is a processed fish that is good for eating. The very Spirit whom we have received is the processed Spirit, not the raw Spirit. He is the cooked Spirit, the cooked God. Because the Spirit has been cooked, processed, He is edible, refreshing, and nourishing. The processed Spirit of God has come into us as a rich feast for our enjoyment.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
