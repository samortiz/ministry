   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You should know that Christ first died and then resurrected; however, we first resurrected and then died.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is like the Lord Jesus who first bore the cross and then was crucified; but we were first crucified and then we bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the time we believed and were saved, we were already crucified and resurrected with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After that, in our Christian life, the Lord put us into different situations such as our family life, the church life, the training center, the kingdom houses, or the brothers and sisters houses, in order that we would daily experience death and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we encounter some troubles, difficulties, or even ill-treatment, we will have a genuine joy and release if we know the power of Christ s resurrection and are conformed to His death.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The power God has toward us is the same as the power which He wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How surpassingly great is this power!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to know and experience this power.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The third portion in Acts 2:23-24 says, This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to the cross and killed; whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ in His resurrection far surpasses death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since He was resurrected from among the dead, He took care of death completely.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not only so, the One who raised Christ from among the dead was God, and God Himself is resurrection, and resurrection is the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today this Spirit dwells within us, giving life to our mortal bodies so that our mortal bodies can be made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The fifth portion in 1 Corinthians 15:45b says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ not only resurrected from among the dead by the Spirit of God, He Himself in resurrection became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And now this life-giving Spirit is the reality of resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The sixth portion in 2 Corinthians 4:10-12 says, Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>So then death operates in us, but life in you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The putting to death of Jesus destroys our natural man, the outward man, and the flesh so that our inward man may have the opportunity to develop and be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This kind of daily putting to death will eventually cause the resurrection life to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the living we ought to have.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The seventh portion in Romans 6:4-5 says, We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into death that as Christ was raised from among the dead through the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By the Spirit means by the power of resurrection because the Spirit is the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To put to death the practices of the body is to deny whatever I am and whatever I do outside of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The result is that the power of resurrection will give us the strength of life to make us live.</S>
