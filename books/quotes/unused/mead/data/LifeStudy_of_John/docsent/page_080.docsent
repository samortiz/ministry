   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO THE NEED OF THE BLIND IN RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIFE S SIGHT AND LIFE S SHEPHERDING 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to John 10.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a very interesting chapter, but it is also a misunderstood chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This chapter is actually a continuation of chapter nine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 21 helps us to realize this, for the question is asked, Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both chapters center around the record of the case of the man born blind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The thought in this chapter is deep.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the surface, it seems easy to understand, but actually it is not easy to understand this parable or allegory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord brought out this allegory about the sheepfold immediately after He cured the blind man who was cast out of the synagogue by the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This incident, therefore, became the setting for the parable of the sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>LIFE S SHEPHERDING FOR THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>OUTSIDE OF RELIGION A. The Sheepfold, the Door, and the Pasture</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>for the Sheep</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must now consider the significance of the sheepfold in this parable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not easy to define the sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps you know something about the Bible and especially about the gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps you were told from your youth about the stories from the gospels in Sunday School.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps you have even graduated from seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Let me ask you this question: what do you realize about the sheepfold?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What have you been taught about this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The key to unlocking the secret of this parable depends very much upon the meaning of the sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Sheepfold</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Signifying the Law, or Judaism,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>the Religion of the Law</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The sheepfold, in its better usage, signifies the law of the Old Testament, but in its common and ordinary usage, it signifies Judaism, the religion of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Originally, before the first advent of Christ, God gave His law to the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What was God s purpose in giving them the law?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Did He expect them to keep it?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No, that was not His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Galatians 3:23-26 reveals God s purpose in giving the law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>So the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But faith having come, we are no longer under a child-conductor; for you are all the sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before faith in Christ came, we were kept under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In other words, we were kept like sheep in a fold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Greek word translated kept means confined.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before faith came that is, before Christ came the chosen people of God were confined under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They were shut up under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Shut up is a special word in Greek, meaning to be kept in custody or under special care in a ward.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For instance, if the parents of a family pass away, the children might be put in the custody of their aunt or uncle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In other words, they are put under the care of someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This shows how the chosen people of God were placed under the custody of the law before faith in Christ came.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The law kept God s people under custody unto the faith, which is better translated as for preparation to the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Galatians 3:24 says that the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Actually, the translation of the King James Version for this verse is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Greek text it means that the law was our slave to bring us to our schoolmaster, who is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In ancient times, the children of the rich, Jewish families were escorted to their schoolmaster by a trained slave.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Likewise, the law served as a slave to bring us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before we were brought to Christ, the schoolmaster, we were under the care of a slave, the law.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God the Father used the law as a slave to take care of us and to bring us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before Christ came, we were put under the hand of the law which was to be our custodian.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The law was responsible for the care and protection of God s chosen people and eventually it brought them to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once we have been brought to Christ, we are justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since faith has come that is, since Christ has come we are no longer under the custody of the slave.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now we understand what is the sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Before Christ came, God put His chosen people under the custody of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The law was the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For example, if you visit the ranch country, you will discover that the sheep do not stay in the fold most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Most of the year the sheep stay in the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The pasture is the permanent place for them to stay, but the sheepfold is merely a temporary place.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only when the pasture is not ready will the sheep be kept in the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The fold is used temporarily to keep and protect the sheep until the pasture is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This illustrates that Christ is the pasture, the permanent place for the Lord s children to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But before Christ came, God prepared the law as the sheepfold to keep and confine His chosen people temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, when the Lord came, the Jewish religion had utilized the law to form Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Judaism had become the sheepfold.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Before the blind man was healed by the Lord, he was one of the sheep confined in Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When he was cast out of the synagogue, he was actually driven out of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, he was put out of the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Formerly, he had been one of the sheep in the fold; now, he was cast out of the fold of Judaism.</S>
