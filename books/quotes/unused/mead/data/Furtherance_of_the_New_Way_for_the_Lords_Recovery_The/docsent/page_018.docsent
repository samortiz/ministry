   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>According to our concept, after baptism there needs to be some edification of the new believers; otherwise, the new ones will not be able to stand firm.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But after the eunuch was baptized, the Holy Spirit immediately caught Philip away without giving the eunuch the slightest chance to receive any edification.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the end, the eunuch returned to Ethiopia, which is a Gentile nation even today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This life pulse of the church has continued without break until this present day.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, I exhort the elderly brothers and sisters to give up the old methods and learn this new way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is like a military academy; the military teaching and training of forty or fifty years ago are useless today because everything has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why we say, "The new way gains new ones, and the new ones walk in the new way."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must be a new man new both inwardly and outwardly in order to be able to walk in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not begin to walk in the new way and yet inwardly still be filled with the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I want especially to mention the booklet called The Mystery of Human Life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we go out door-knocking, we must take this booklet in addition to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After two years of use, it has been translated into all the languages spoken in the countries where there are churches in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This booklet speaks of the four keys for opening up the mystery of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We only need to learn how to speak according to this booklet, and we will obtain the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whoever has the experience of going out door-knocking can testify that the more they speak according to the words in this booklet, the easier it is to bring people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It used to be that baptizing people was not to be done carelessly; rather, baptism had to be carried out by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, sometimes when a person had to wait, he would wait so long that he disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the northern Chinese dialect we have a very interesting expression called huo ho, which means "optimum cooking temperature."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This Chinese expression means that when we do something, we must seize the best opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may compare this to a housewife who heats the oil in the wok to just the right temperature and prepares to stir-fry some vegetables, but delays for three minutes in order to answer the phone; as a result, the vegetables do not taste as good as they should.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same way, we should lead a person to baptism once he believes in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If there is a waiting period, then his baptism may be frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible says to believe and be baptized Mark 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is a spontaneous matter to baptize someone immediately after he has believed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I was the one who designed and taught our previous way of practice, including the interview for baptism and the procedure for baptism, so I am the one best qualified to overthrow it, and I should overthrow it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the past we rode in ox carts, so I certainly had to teach you how to ride in an ox cart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we have changed our mode of transportation to the automobile, so we should not do things in the same way as when we used carts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, we should learn the new way; we should learn to drive an automobile.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not think of driving oxen while riding in an automobile even though we are accustomed to driving oxen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the past when the women sewed or embroidered, they did it all stitch by stitch.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now they have sewing machines, but they may think that the clothes they make do not look nice enough.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, the problem is that they are not attentive enough when using the sewing machine.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are really willing to humble ourselves and diligently learn anew, rejecting our old habits and customs, then we will certainly do things faster and better.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is very hard to change one's concept.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I myself have been making the turn for five years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From 1980 to 1984 I was constantly studying why in the Lord's recovery we would preach the gospel and labor hard every year, but our numbers would not increase.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was not only like this in Taiwan; it was also the same in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This question pressed me until I had no other way but to return to the Bible and spend time studying it diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the end the Lord showed me the concept of the "home."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the revelation of the Bible, God Himself came down from heaven to be incarnated and at His own discretion went from one home to another to seek sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Himself went to the home of Zaccheus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He also made a special trip to seek the sinful woman by the well in Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The New Testament clearly shows us that the home is the center and that the gospel is a matter of being delivered to the home and not a matter of inviting people to come and listen.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If today God were to invite us to where He sits in the heavens, we would never find a way to get there.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead, He came down and brought the gospel to us, making it so available for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because we have acted against this principle, we have not had the Lord's blessing for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I saw this clearly, I made a thorough repentance to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thirty years ago when I was still living in Taiwan, I saw people riding bicycles with a sign that said, "Delivering Shots to Your Home."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This meant that a person did not have to go to the doctor's clinic, but the doctor would come to the person's home and give him the shot.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now America has home delivery services for food which make it very helpful for business.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you make it convenient for people, they will welcome you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the same way, if our hope is that the Lord's recovery will increase and spread, then we must change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead of inviting people to come and hear the gospel, we should deliver the gospel to their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This will help us to increase.</S>
