<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">REVELATION 1:9</h1><p>"I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus." It is significant that John calls himself a partaker in the endurance of Jesus at the beginning of a book which specifically deals with judgment. The book of Revelation brings us to a point where God sets endurance aside and executes judgment. As soon as judgment is carried out there is no more need for endurance. Endurance is only needed when judgment lies in the future. John, as he is about to write on the subject of judgment, declares that he is still living in the realm of endurance. Before God opens up His judgments, John secures a spirit of endurance.</p><p>In Revelation 6:10 we hear the cry, "How long?" Those who utter this complaint find it difficult to exercise any more endurance. Who are they? Perhaps they are the Old Testament saints, but certainly they are the pre-tribulation saints. They cry for vengeance, for the execution of judgment. If impatience is justified in any, it is justified in the dead saints rather than the living, for they have waited longer. But even those who have waited so long are told that the time of endurance has not expired. God has determined to avenge all His saints at one time, and the martyred saints are told to wait patiently until the number of martyrs is complete.</p><p>God's wrath is not poured out until the seventh trumpet sounds. (The seven bowls are included in it.) Officially, the time of God's patience is not over until then; therefore, His saints need to exercise endurance until then. They must not exert force. At the time of Antichrist the children of God will readily fall into the snare of resorting to force, as seen in Revelation 13. But God's appointment for His children during the day of His patience is non-resistance. The saints are to submit to being overcome (v. 7). If ever there was a holy war, it is the war against Antichrist. If ever there was reason for resistance, there will be a reason then. If ever there was a righteous cause to fight, it is to fight against Antichrist. But God's Word on this very point says, "If anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he is to be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints" (Rev. 13:10). Matthew 24 makes it very clear that at the time of Antichrist the children of God have only one responsibility, that is, to flee. When the power of Antichrist nears its climax, all the saints must leave the cities and flee to the country, because government is related to the cities. We must be prepared to flee without our possessions, because we will be unable to escape if we take time to collect them. Note the need of detachment. The warning to nursing and pregnant mothers and the exhortation to pray that our flight be neither in winter nor on a Sabbath emphasize the urgency of the matter of fleeing in the day of Antichrist's authority. There is no guarantee that those who flee will not be slain, but the best measure of security lies in fleeing. It is our responsibility to warn men to flee if they fall under the power of Antichrist. Flight under such circumstances will not in any way reflect on the dignity of God's children; it is His distinct command. Fleeing will not present a problem to those who see the absolute spirituality of the church, and it will not be a hindrance to the functioning of the church, for a spiritual church can function in the simplest manner.</p>
