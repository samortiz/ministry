   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PRAISE OF THE SAINT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN HIS GOING UP TO ZION CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>JEHOVAH'S KEEPING OF HIM FROM EVIL</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Psalm 121 is the praise of the saint in his going up to Zion concerning Jehovah's keeping of him from all evil, disasters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. Jehovah as the Keeper of Hezekiah</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 5 says, "Jehovah is your Keeper;/Jehovah is your shade at your right hand."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to history, the "Keeper" here refers to Jehovah as the Keeper of Hezekiah 2 Kings 19:14-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Apart from Jehovah's protection, Hezekiah surely would have been slain by the Assyrians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. "To the Hills" Referring to Jehovah,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who Created the Heaven and Earth</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Psalm 121:1 and 2 say, "I will lift up my eyes to the hills.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>/From where will my help come?/My help comes from Jehovah, / Who made heaven and earth."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"To the hills" in verse 1 refers to Jehovah, who created the heaven and earth, including the hills 2 Kings 19:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>C. The Sun and the Moon</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Becoming the Instruments of God's Keeping</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Psalm 121:6 the psalmist says, "The sun will not strike you by day,/Nor the moon by night."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here "sun" and "moon" refer to God's creation, and both became the instruments of God's keeping.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I experienced a particular fulfillment of this verse during the Japanese invasion of China in 1937.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I had been asked by the co-workers to return from Hangkow in central China to my home town of Chefoo, on the tip of the Shantung Peninsula.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This involved a long, complicated trip by train.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The country was in confusion, and because of the threat of attack by Japanese airplanes, it was a fearful thing to travel by train.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the sky was clear, the airplanes could attack either during the day or at night.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever the alarm sounded, we had to leave the train and hide in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The passengers were relieved that the sky was cloudy during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, at night the sky was clear, the moon was bright, and the people were afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that very time, I happened to be reading Psalm 121, and I praised the Lord for His word in verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then I testified to the other passengers, saying, "I am a Christian and I have just read in the Bible, the Word of God, that the sun will not strike you by day nor the moon by night.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I believe that God will keep me safe.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All those who are traveling with me will also be safe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Be at peace."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some of them laughed at me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But after we safely made the long trip to the capital of Shantung Province without any alarms, I asked them about what I had said, and they admitted that it was true.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In that situation I, like Hezekiah, experienced God as my Keeper.</S>
