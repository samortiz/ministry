THE SEVEN SPIRITS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this lesson we shall consider the matter of the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit is mysterious and wonderful enough without such a term as the "seven Spirits of God."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nevertheless, the book of Revelation reveals something further about the Spirit today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let's read Revelation 1:4-5: "John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To Him who loves us and has loosed us from our sins by His blood."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. Not Seven Different Spirits</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the book of Revelation, the age is the age of the Spirit, and in this age the Spirit has been intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because the Spirit in 1:4 is the intensified Spirit of God, He is called the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The seven Spirits are undoubtedly the Spirit of God because they are ranked among the Triune God in verses 4 and 5.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot understand the Bible according to our natural, limited mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to our concept, the words "seven Spirits" denote seven individual spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But this is not the meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The number seven here does not refer to seven different spirits but to one sevenfold Spirit.</S>
