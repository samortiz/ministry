   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Condition of the Experience</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of the Meeting in Ts'ai's House</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This locality was originally a part of the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1928 they turned and began to meet according to 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before they could accomplish the turn, they went through a period of fighting for about two or three years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Most of the brothers obeyed the Lord, but a few brothers wanted to preserve the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They had arguments over the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother A said, "There should be organization."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brother B said, "There should not be organization."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother A said, "There should be a chairman for the meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother B said, "The Holy Spirit is the only Chairman in the meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brother A said, "We should have the large and small general meetings to maintain the fellowship among ourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother B said, "We should not have the large and small general meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are joined by the blood, and our fellowship is in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not have a special fellowship."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brother A said, "The offering should not be put into a box.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It should be designated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If it is not designated, we should not have it."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother B said, "The money for the offering should be put into the box.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It should not be designated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The workers should also live by faith in Jehovah, and the brothers should be happy to give to God for the workers' use."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is difficult to describe the details of all the debates.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Chen Ch'ing Fa was living among them at the time, and they received much help from him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, a small number of them had a hard attitude!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They could not enter into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Soon afterward, Brother Chen left that locality to return to his native place.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The denominational leaders sent another worker to them to continue working.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although the brothers still received him as before, they were completely different in the matter of receiving the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So they always had debates with him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through these debates, many brothers who had blindly followed listened quietly and woke up to the error of denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They obeyed the Lord then.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the teacher of the China Inland Mission could no longer do anything, he left.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that point nearly everyone met in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There was still one family of three, a father and two sons, who were for preserving the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thank the Lord, his two sons have obeyed now, and only the father will not come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The meetings are in the house of Brother Ts'ai Wei Ts'ung, who faithfully loves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He and his brother are happy to offer their home for the Lord's use.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are twenty-two brothers and sisters in the table meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are sixteen people who come to hear the messages but do not take the table yet.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brothers Ts'ai Wei Ts'ung, Ts'ai T'ien Cheng, and Ts'ai Tze Chu bear the responsibility for the messages and the affairs of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Beginning and Experience</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>of the Meeting in Hsiu Hsi</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This locality originally belonged to the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There were more sisters than brothers in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is very difficult to say how this locality left the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Probably it began when the Lord led one brother, Chiu Chi Po, to a conference in Shanghai in 1930 and revived him there.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then Brothers Mao Ch'ing Shih, Lai Chi Ho, Chen Ch'ing Fa, and Ts'ai Ch'i did some edification among them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They left the denomination in 1931, but the denomination did not want to let them go.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It still sent a worker there.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The brothers continued to receive them as they had in the past, but their meetings were no longer according to the denominational way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They were according to the principles in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Later, the brothers discussed firing the denominational teacher, but he found out about it and stopped coming.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this way they broke their relationship with the denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now the church meets in Brother Chiu's house which he has joyfully offered for the Lord's use because he loves the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There are nineteen brothers and sisters in the table meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are also more than ten people who come to hear the message but do not take the table yet.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are more than thirty people in the meetings altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sometimes brothers from other localities come to help with the messages, and sometimes Brother Chi Po takes care of the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is also responsible for the affairs of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The sisters believe in the Lord and love Him, but some among them are not free because their husbands or families stop them from coming to the meetings or cause problems and persecute them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Brothers and sisters, please pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Origin and Recent Condition</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>of the Meeting in T'o Ti</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The brothers and sisters in this locality used to meet in Hsiu Hsi.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although the brothers in T'o Ti received the enlightenment of the truth at the same time as the brothers in Hsiu Hsi, they were keener than the brothers in Hsiu Hsi in their obedience to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, while the brothers in Hsiu Hsi were still in the denominations, the brothers in T'o Ti separated from those in Hsiu Hsi and began their own local meeting in Brother Mao Ping Ch'i's house.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When they were just starting, there were only about ten or so, but they solidly obeyed the Lord's truth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Although the building was simple, they were very happy in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Brother Mao Ch'ing Shih was originally an old master carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After believing in the Lord, he was faithful and strong for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He later saw that the Lord's will was for him to set aside his occupation and do the Lord's holy work, so he obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord saved many sinners through him; the number in the meeting increased gradually until there were too many for the small house to contain.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The brothers prayed for the Lord to make provision in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In 1932 the Lord blessed them, and they built a new meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It was not very large, but it could hold around eighty people.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The meeting hall is upstairs.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There is a kitchen and living room downstairs.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After the meeting hall was finished, Brother Mao Ch'ing Shih's health became unexpectedly weak.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He ran a fever day and night, and it became a kind of bone disease.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He must stay in bed night and day and cannot get up.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The sickness began in the second month of the lunar calendar last year, and he is still not better.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But thank the Lord and praise God, he has not backslidden.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>On the contrary, he is much closer to the Lord than before and has grown in life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He often testifies for the Lord from his bed so that many are established and comforted by him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I have heard some friends say that recently his health is much better.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Brothers and sisters, please pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>May the Lord bless him so that he can leave his bed soon.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This brother is useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The meetings in several localities were started by the Lord through him and helped through his visits.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Because of his sickness, those localities are having some difficulties now.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>There are twenty brothers and sisters in his own locality who partake of the table.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>There are sixteen who come to hear the messages but have not taken the table yet.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>There are eleven new ones this year.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Every Lord's Day Brother Mao Ch'ing Shih mentioned above and Brother Chen Wan Pi bear the responsibility for the messages and the affairs of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The rest of the brothers farm tomatoes for a living, so they have great difficulties in the necessities of physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Brothers and sisters, please pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>May the Lord bless them that they might become rich in the faith.</S>
