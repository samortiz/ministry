   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ORGANIC LESSONS IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is a Chinese proverb that says, A long illness makes the patient a good doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have suffered tuberculosis and stomach ulcers, and during my convalescence, I learned many things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I discovered that doctors are limited in what they know.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It does not matter whether a doctor has studied diligently for ten or even twenty years, what he knows is only a superficial amount concerning the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is because the body is a mysterious organism that is difficult to comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is easy to understand the way a desk is made; we can even take it apart with a hammer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, we cannot use the same method to study human beings, because life is complicated and difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is the same with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the surface, the Bible seems easy to read.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such passages as, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God John 1:1 ; I am the light 8:12, 9:5 ; I am the bread 6:35, 48 ; the water that I will give 4:14 ; I am the door 10:7 are clear and easy to read.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, it is not easy to understand what these passages mean.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more times you read the Bible, the more you feel that the Bible is a difficult book to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is because the Bible covers the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the same type of difficulty we experience in leading the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>More than fifty years ago the Lord raised me up to lead the church and to speak for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the time I could answer any question clearly and logically.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, I could clearly tell a brother the type of sister he should or should not marry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I knew who would be a good spouse, a perfect match for him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I could also tell a sister who would be a perfect match for her.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Initially, I was very bold to speak these things, and I spoke clearly and reasonably.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the more I spoke, the more I felt that there was something wrong, because the Lord did not fulfill the things that I had spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, for at least ten years, I have not dared to speak concerning these things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a saint asks me how to choose the best spouse, I can only say that I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even though this has disappointed many brothers and sisters, they are not harmed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In America marriage is one of the most popular topics, but the more it is discussed, the more people get divorced.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have been leading the local churches and speaking for the Lord for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I can testify that the more I lead, the less I understand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, some saints might consider a young brother to be so good that he can become an apostle in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But in five years he turns completely to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We might consider that some saints are not very good material, but in five years they might be the ones who love the Lord the most and are the most consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everything depends on God, not on man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is what makes it difficult to lead the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When a local church is raised up, it must have elders, or there will be no way to administrate the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There might be disputes concerning who should decide matters, when to visit the saints and when the meetings should be held.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, some saints might be in favor of having meetings in the middle of the night, because that is the only time they are free.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such situations show the need for elders to make arrangements and to carry out the church s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, it is difficult to appoint elders.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How should the elders be appointed?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Who should be appointed?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even though we appoint elders in fear and trembling, we may still appoint someone who is not appropriate, and once the elders have been appointed, we cannot casually announce that we are changing them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is difficult to be an elder, and it is even more difficult to appoint elders.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must learn not to depend on ourselves but to remain in the Lord with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The elders must remember that it is not a light thing to decide on any matter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Considerations related to full-time service are a great responsibility and can be compared to the Chinese proverb: A timely warning may avert a national crisis; a single wrong statement can bring disaster to the nation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The consideration of those who desire to serve full time is a big responsibility, because a mistake can ruin a young person s future in relation to serving the Lord for the rest of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not a word of warning.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This word is for us all to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The testimony of the Lord s recovery is not one of organization but one of a functioning, living organism.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We do not want an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What the elders do in the localities, especially when they consider the saints who desire to serve full time, must come out of an organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must pray before we consider the saints, and we must pray as we are considering the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If there is something that we do not understand, we should stop and pray and then consider further.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If there is a sense to tell a saint that he is not ready to serve full time, it must be done with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must not convey the erroneous impression that he can never serve full time for the rest of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must help him to understand that it is not appropriate for him to serve now, because he does not have sufficient growth in life or because the Lord has not given him a suitable arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead of refusing him, we should lead him in life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is entirely apart from organization; it is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Organizations approve and reject people without giving any leading in life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should do things according to a person s situation and lead him in life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We want the elders to consider the saints so that full-timers are raised up in the local churches and so that the elders are clear concerning the situation of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>According to principle, this matter should be carried out by the elders in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The elders must be in fear and trembling before the Lord and follow the leading of the Spirit to help the young people in life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If the elders feel that it is not appropriate for a saint to serve full time, that saint must not be given the impression that he has been rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Instead, he must be led to understand that the time is not right, and he must be encouraged to mature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is a need for such leading.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Let me repeat, the elders must follow the Spirit in every matter.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If they prohibit a saint from attending the table meeting or quarantine him from the fellowship of the church, they must be in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They cannot make arbitrary decisions based on the letter of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If a saint commits a sin for which he should be quarantined, but he repents, he should be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A saint should be quarantined only if he remains unrepentant.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We cannot be a court of law; otherwise, we are an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must remember that even if a saint has sinned, he is still a member of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must take care of the problem according to our organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must fear God in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is an organic lesson that the elders must learn in their administration of the church.</S>
