<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>20. Concerning the New Jerusalem<br>and the New Heaven and the New Earth<br>21. Concerning the Principles of the Holy Scriptures</H2><P>In order to be helped concerning the principles of the holy Scriptures, I would recommend our reading message eight of the Life-study of the Psalms.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>22. Concerning the Way to Cut Straight<br>the Word of the Truth</H2><P>We must learn the truth concerning the way to cut straight the word of the truth. In 2 Timothy 2:15b Paul charged Timothy to cut the word straight. To cut the word straight is like a carpenter cutting a piece of wood. A skilled carpenter can cut the wood in the exact shape of the design. When we interpret the Word, we need to unfold it in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Experiences of Life</H2><P>In order to practice prophesying, we not only need to learn the truths, but also need to have the experiences of life. Our prophesying should be enriched with much truth and many experiences of life. We would like to point out twenty-two items of the experiences of life which we need to learn.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Of the Spirit's Sanctification<br>That Leads the Sinners to Repent</H2><P>The initial experience of life is the experience of the Spirit's sanctification that leads the sinners to repent (Luke 15:8; 1 Pet. 1:2a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Of Repentance and Confession of Sins</H2><P>In addition to this, we must have the experience of repentance and confession of sins. Though we have been saved and regenerated, we may never have made a thorough confession of sins. In 1935 Brother Nee came to my town, Chefoo, and stayed in my home for over one month. He caused us to aspire and desire to learn how to live a victorious life by Christ. One morning I went to the meeting hall to have a time with the Lord. While in the hall, I knelt down and began to confess. I had been saved ten years earlier in 1925, and I made a confession at that time. But the confession I made in 1935 was much more thorough. It took me more than two hours to make this confession of all my failures and sins. That confession was like a thorough shower, washing away every bit of dirt within me. We all need the experience of repenting and confessing our sins before God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Of God's Forgiveness and<br>Cleansing of Sins</H2><P>After making that thorough confession, I was thoroughly forgiven and cleansed. Because I have had that experience, my prophesying can have the element of the repentance and confession of sins.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Of God's Justification<br>through the Redemption of Christ</H2><P>We need to have the experience of God's justification through the redemption of Christ. Many Christians do not know what justification and redemption are and what the difference is between these two items. Redemption was completed by the death of Christ through the shedding of His blood. Justification is God's application of Christ's redemption upon us to make us righteous in Christ, to justify us.</P>
