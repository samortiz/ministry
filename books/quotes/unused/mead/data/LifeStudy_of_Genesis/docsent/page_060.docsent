   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>f The Consummation of Rest</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The consummation of rest is the rest in the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the redeemed ones as one Body will express the glory of God for eternity Rev 21:11, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Also, all the redeemed ones as one Body will reign for God for eternity Rev 22:5b .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That will be the consummation of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rest in Genesis 2 was simply a type; the consummation will be in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everyone will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everyone will have rest because God Himself will be satisfied and God Himself will find His rest there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church life today is a miniature of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church life is a foretaste of that full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The consummate rest mainly includes two items: the expression of God's image and the exercise of God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>g Man Also Rested with God</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you read Genesis 1 carefully, you will see that after God created man He didn't tell him to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God simply spoke about man's eating Gen 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>1 God's Seventh Day Was Man's First Day</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the calendar of the Bible, a day does not start in the morning, but in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I believe that man was made late on the sixth day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When man came out of God's creating hand, he immediately entered the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The seventh day was to God the day of rest Gen 2:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's seventh day was man's first day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that God had prepared everything for man's enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After man was created, he didn't join in God's work; he entered into God's rest.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Don't think that you must do something.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God doesn't need you to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has plenty of riches and He wants you to come and enjoy them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Don't work!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you try to work, God will say, "Foolish child, I have no work for you to do, but I do have great riches for you to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Come, join Me in My rest.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My sabbath day is your first day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have worked for six days.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now, come and join Me in rest as your first day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us go together and rest."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man did.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have spent a good deal of time to find out what man did after he was created.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I found out that he did nothing but eat and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Isn't this wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After people are saved, they always think that they must do something.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Forget about doing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Come to eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Come to be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Come to join God in His rest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God will say, "Little child, forget your doing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Forget your working.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have done everything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now is My time to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Come to join Me in My rest."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 1936, I was working in north China, very burdened for the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The work was hard and testing and circumstances were difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I would ride by bicycle to the suburbs, throw it down, fall flat on the ground and cry, "Lord, help me!"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I was bothered and tested.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One day, before giving a message, the word came to me and said, "Do you know that man's first day is God's seventh day?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God's seventh day was man's first day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why do you labor so hard?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Stupid child, give up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Throw away your work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Just come to Me and join Me in My rest."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On that Sunday morning I gave a message that God's seventh day was man's first day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I told people, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today is my first day.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For months I have been laboring very hard, but now I am throwing away my work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I will labor no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today I have begun to rest with God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>His seventh day is my first day."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You may ask, "What about the day after the seventh day?"</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>That was the first day of the week, the Lord's day, a new rest and a new sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Praise the Lord!</S>
