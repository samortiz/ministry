<p>Fornication always involves overstepping the regulation of the marriage relationship. The relationship between male and female was ordained by God. Marriage is a holy matter that was ordained by God and is under His strict regulation. Therefore, the contact between male and female must be according to God’s ordination and regulation. Otherwise there may be some kind of transgression, overstepping, breaking of God’s regulation.<p>In verse 7 Paul says, “For God has not called us for uncleanness but in sanctification.” The Greek preposition translated “for” in this verse, epi, means upon, on condition of. Uncleanness in this verse denotes uncleanness in things like fornication and adultery. Some teachers say that verse 6 speaks of taking advantage of a brother in doing business. To refer uncleanness here to unfair gain in business is not acceptable according to the context of this section, which begins in verse 3 with the charge to abstain from fornication. Actually, verse 7 is the concluding word of this charge.<p>The apostle’s charge to abstain from fornication is based upon sanctification (v. 3), strengthened by sanctification (v. 4), and concluded here with sanctification, because fornication, as the most unclean thing, destroys the holy standing and character of God’s called saints.<p>God has not called us on condition of uncleanness, but He has called us in sanctification. This indicates that we must always remain in sanctification. God’s calling has nothing to do with uncleanness. His calling is in sanctification, and this sanctification is versus fornication.<p>Verse 8 says, “Consequently, he who rejects, rejects not man but God, Who also gives His Holy Spirit to you.” This verse is the conclusion of the section which begins in verse 3. The word “rejects” here refers to the charge given in the preceding verses. Here Paul seems to be saying, “I have given you a warning. If you reject it, you are not rejecting me, but you are rejecting God, the One who gave His Holy Spirit to you.” Here the Holy Spirit is referred to as the Holy One who sanctifies us, making us holy before God (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 1:2; 1 Cor. 6:11).<p>The will (v. 3), the call (v. 7), and the Spirit of God are all for our sanctification. God had His will first, then His call, and then the giving of His Holy Spirit. By His Spirit we may be sanctified to answer His call and fulfill His will.<p>God has given His Holy Spirit to us to sanctify us, to make us holy, to separate us unto God for His purpose. Thus, this Holy Spirit is moving, working, and acting within us constantly for a purpose. If we fall into fornication, we reject this indwelling Spirit who is working within us to sanctify us unto God. This is Paul’s meaning here, in the verse that concludes a section on sanctification versus fornication.<p>May we all, especially the young people, be impressed with Paul’s word of warning. The age in which we live certainly is no better than the age in which Paul lived. Furthermore, the cities where we live today are not better than Corinth or Thessalonica. On the contrary, both the age and the cities may be worse. Therefore, we need this warning concerning sanctification versus fornication.<h2 class=head1>BROTHERLY LOVE</h2><p>In verses 9 and 10 Paul goes on to exhort the believers regarding brotherly love: “Now concerning brotherly love, you have no need for me to write to you, for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another; For indeed you do it unto all the brothers in the whole of Macedonia. But we entreat you, brothers, to abound more.” The words “brotherly love” are a translation of the Greek word philadelphia, composed of phileo, to love, and adelphos, brother. Here Paul reiterates his word in 3:12 concerning love: “And the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love to one another and to all, even as we also to you.” This emphasis on love indicates that love is a vital factor in the Christian life. According to Galatians 5:14 and Romans 13:10, love is the fulfillment of the law. If we love others, certainly we shall not commit fornication, steal, or lie.
