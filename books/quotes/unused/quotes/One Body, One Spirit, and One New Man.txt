If someone in today's Christianity were here and heard these terms, one Body and one Spirit, he may ask, 'There are thousands of bodies here
If such a one thinks in this way and begins to roll his eyes, the speaker on the platform is not able to continue his message
Before the Lord Jesus resurrected and ascended, the Spirit of God was there, but we may compare Him to plain water
The flesh and the humanity that He had put on did not have a single bit of glory; in this sense, they were like our own flesh and humanity
After these four spices were compounded into the olive oil, the olive oil was no longer only oil; it was an ointment
Added together they equal a total of three units, each unit of five hundred shekels, indicating three units of responsibility
That hymn says, 'Let us reckon, reckon, reckon Let us reckon ourselves to be dead to sin Let us reckon ourselves as alive in Him'
In the summer of 1935, Brother Nee came to Chefoo, my hometown, and spoke a message in which he gave an illustration
He said that the fact of our co-death with Christ that we see in Romans 6 can be experienced only in the Spirit found in Romans 8
You can never have the experience of the fact of being crucified with Christ in Romans 6 unless you are in the Spirit in Romans 8
In other words, it does not depend on your believing or reckoning; it depends only on your being in the Spirit
Romans 6 can only be a fact to you; it can never become your experience unless you live in the Spirit in Romans 8
The Spirit's moving within us is the anointing mentioned in 1 John 2, which is typified by the holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30
If you are not in the Spirit, every word of preaching will be empty and ineffective, but if you are in the Spirit, the reality will be there
They said that the New Testament employs many figures of speech to portray the church, such as a wife and a body
They also said that this does not mean that the church is actually a wife or a body but that the church is only likened to a wife or a body
Even, which husband and wife who truly love each other can testify that he or she has never found the other unlovable?
Those who love one another are members one of another; those who do not love one another are still members one of another
Even if they gnash their teeth, the fact remains that they are still members one of another; there is no alternative
In addition, almost all the ones from Southeast Asia who have come to attend this conference and training are young people
Since the gospel has been preached all over the earth today, it is hard to find a city that is without the gospel
Brothers and sisters, we must pray for the day to come when our eyes will be opened and we will know what the Spirit is and what the Body is
You should not merely preach the gospel to get people saved; neither should you merely bring people to know life and understand the Bible
All is used twice, successively, once referring to Christ's filling all and another time referring to Christ's being in all
All comprises all persons, all matters, and all things and includes every person, every matter, and every thing
According to its meaning, all is the correct translation, but according to its usage, it is very difficult to understand
Suppose we have a strong, husky brother here who does not have a body but who only has a head hanging in the air
Please remember that if you put a big pile of food here, it would not be called fullness; it would be called riches
Once you have eaten these riches item by item and have digested them, they become your cells and the elements of your body
The riches of Christ are boundless, immeasurable, and unsearchable, but you still need to eat and assimilate these riches of Christ
The more Christ you eat and the more Christ is assimilated into you, the more element of the fullness you will gain
Their original Jewish and Greek persons have not yet been touched, so one is still a Jew and the other is still a Greek
As we come together, if everyone still lives in his natural being, can we say that this is the Body of Christ?
We are putting off our natural man: the Jew and the Greek, the free man and the slave, the male and the female
Today in the Lords recovery however we all need to see that we can let go of everything but we cannot let go of this oneness which is Christ
We have clearly seen that the Body of Christ is the fullness of Christ, which comes out of our enjoyment of the riches of Christ
It is in this oneness this fullness that there is no natural man no Chinese no foreigner no Honanese no Hopeinese no male and no female
It is not a recovery of a certain truth or of a certain doctrine; the Lord's recovery today is a recovery of this oneness in Christ
Our mentality, our thoughts, and our opinions may be different, but by the Lord's grace we all must deny these differences
If we are still paying attention to these methods of baptism, it proves that our eyes are darkened and we have not seen the light
These things do not matter; what matters is that you are a person living in Christ and not living according to your natural person
Baptism is necessary, but when we baptize, we do not need to be so particular in letter about the ways of baptism
It is your inward enjoyment and experience of Christ; it is your living in Christ and your allowing Christ to live in you
What the Lord wants is not merely the subjective experience but the church that is produced through the subjective experience
If your subjective experience makes you so individualistic that you cannot be blended with others, then that is a big mistake
If your spirituality, your holiness, and your subjective experience make you individualistic, then you have to put a question mark on them
If a drop of oil falls into the water, it remains a drop of oil; it does not blend with the water even though it is in the water
Some brothers are very good, yet they do not go along with the flow, get along with others, blend with others, or coordinate with others
After visiting many places and observing many kinds of Christians in the past twenty-five years, my heart truly grieves
Those who love the world, love the world; those who love sin, love sin; those who do not know the flesh, do not know the flesh
Today it is not a matter of how spiritual or how holy we are; it is a matter of the oneness, of the Body, of the fullness
It is a matter of there not being Jew and Greek, slave and free man, male and female, because we all are one in Christ
Three of us coming together are one; thirty of us coming together are one; three hundred of us coming together are still one
There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus'
The Brethren rose up in the last century to strongly teach that a chapel, as a building for worship, is not the church
They found the light in the New Testament to prove that the church is a gathering together of the redeemed ones
On the surface it is right to say that the church is not a place or a hall but a gathering together of the ones called by God
Suppose that none of us lives in the spirit, that all one hundred of us are living in one hundred different minds
Three Christians may be totally French, another three are completely German, and another eight are wholly Singaporean
We all feel that our sins have been washed away, and we have been saved; we also feel that the Lord loves us, and we belong to Him
Although we have Christ, our Christ is on the throne in the heavens and in our minds, but He is not in our spirit or in our living
When we come together we cannot say that here there is no French, no German, no Singaporean, no Filipino but all are one in Christ
It is true that we are the assembly of the called-out ones, and based on this we acknowledge that we are the church
If you have this light and use it to carefully examine today's Christianity, you will say that the Body of Christ is nowhere to be found
It is by your receiving the riches of Christ into you to be enjoyed and assimilated by you and even to become you
In the new man, there cannot be Greek and Jew, and so on, but Christ is all the believers and in all the believers
All things here and all in 1:23 are the same word in Greek, so it is not proper to translate it as 'all people'
The reason that He first descended to the earth and then ascended above all the heavens was that He might fill all things
According to Ephesians 4:10, Ephesians 1:23 should be translated, 'the One who fills all things in all things'
Christ today is not a local Christ but a universal Christ, and this universal Christ has a part of Himself in every locality
When they come together, they are not willing to drop their politics, individualities, dispositions, and preferences
Sometimes we talked about certain people, and Brother Nee made a joke saying, 'Those people have been saved but have not been regenerated'
To be sure, a saved person is regenerated, and a regenerated person is surely saved; salvation and regeneration cannot be separated
In the same principle, there are places where the church is as if it has been saved without ever being regenerated
In doctrine the church is the Body, but as to reality there is still a question of how much element of the Body is there
Ephesians 4:13 goes one step further; there is not only the fullness of Christ but also the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
The phrase the measure of the stature includes two concepts: one is the stature and the other is the measure of that stature
Let us say, for example, that he is six feet two inches tall and over two feet wide; this measure is the measure of his stature
When you read Ephesians 413 you can see that the church as the Body of Christ does not become full instantly instead it grows continually
Suppose the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is eighteen feet tall, but the church in Taipei is only nine feet tall
The lack in the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ indicates that the believers are more in their natural man
You still must go on until you come to 413 Until we all arrive at a fullgrown man at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
What the Lord wants today is not only the churches on the ground of locality-one locality, one church-but also the Body as His fullness
In the book of Ephesians, fullness as a noun is used twice: His fullness and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
The fullness is within us and is subjective, being the result of what we have enjoyed and experienced of the riches
If the riches of Christ are placed outside of us, they will be merely the riches of Christ and will not constitute the fullness of Christ
Because the fullness is the Body, it certainly has its stature, which in turn has its measure, which is the measure of the stature
There are four nouns here-'measure,' 'stature,' 'fullness,' and 'Christ'-joined into one great phrase by three 'ofs'
You may have this kind of understanding because you do not have the vision of the Body of Christ being the fullness of Christ
The fullness of Christ is a concrete item, but on the other hand, it is also spiritual, mysterious, and abstract
It is because the assembly of the called-out ones is physical and easily seen by everyone; therefore, it is easy to understand
In the New Testament the fullness is the issue of the overflow of Christ out of those who experience and enjoy Him
In the New Testament, the Lord Jesus in Himself is the Head, but when He gets into all of us and is constituted into us, then He is the Body
Christianity is not the church, and even we in the Lord's recovery are not the church unless Christ comes out when we meet
Even we who are in the Lord's recovery meeting in the Lord's name are not the Body if we do not allow Christ to live out of us
No one who allows Christ to be experienced from within would be divided from others, because Christ is definitely not divided
One who truly experiences Christ from within will certainly practice one church in each locality, and he will stand firm on the ground
The church in Taipei is the Body of Christ, but has this Body grown and arrived at the measure of the stature?
There is only one way for you to grow, and there is only one way for the local churches to grow, and that is by enjoying the Lord
In verses 16 through 20, the Lord said, 'I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever
1 Corinthians 15:45b says, 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,' and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, 'The Lord is the Spirit'
Your decision is not trustworthy, because the Bible says, 'To will is present with me, but to work out the good is not'
We all know that whatever food we take into us causes an organic function within us, which is called metabolism
We can be transformed into the image of God , having the divine nature , but we absolutely cannot become the Person of God or the Godhead
The Godhead is special and unique, but because of the divine life, we may have the divine nature in a general, or universal, way
We teach that the unique Creator, who is the Triune God, became flesh and shed His blood to accomplish redemption
He rose from the dead and brought His humanity into resurrection, uplifting His humanity and mingling it with divinity
We, the redeemed sinners, must constantly open to Him by His blood to absorb the supply of this all-inclusive Spirit
As we enjoy Him, He becomes our experience; He spreads out from our spirit, saturating every part of our being until we are filled with Him
We can say, 'For to me, to live is Christ,' and when we come together it is the manifestation of God in the flesh
If you young ones are not clear, when you hear their speaking, you will not be able to discern what is true and what is false
Every child has the life and the nature of his father, but this does not mean that the child eventually will become his father
Nor do we say that Christ fills all, and He fills you and me, and therefore we make all things God, which is pantheism
Some people are not satisfied with the present condition of our meetings because we shout, pray loudly, and release our spirits
From their youth they have been taught that they must be careful with the way they walk when they enter a 'sanctuary'
Most Christian worship services on Sunday mornings have a set format; they begin with a hymn and end with a benediction
When you come to our meetings, a small sister in the corner next to the wall may say, 'O Lord, hallelujah, amen'!
We do not have preachers or pastors; sometimes everybody speaks in our meetings, and there is no benediction at the end
After the pastor had rung the bell for a very long time, everybody finally stopped, and then Brother Nee spoke a message
He simply said in a light, moderate tone, 'There is no word in the New Testament that tells us definitely what is the right way to meet'
If we truly know and experience the Son of God and truly become His Body, His fullness, we will not care for forms of meeting
My main point is this: You must see Ephesians 4:13, which says, 'Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith'
As we continue to grow in Christ until the day we become full-grown, we should put away all these differences, which are like toys
It is not that the fullness of Christ is what Christ is to us; rather, the fullness of Christ is what we are to Christ
When you explain something to this slow one, you can speak for three days and three nights, and he still will not understand
If the arm were to expel the hand, the hand may not suffer, but without the hand, the arm would not be able to do anything
If today they are happy, they will come together; if tomorrow they are unhappy, they will just forget about it
If you merely love one another, then when you are happy, you love the others, and when you are unhappy, you do not love them
The Body is a matter of being members one of another, but for the new man the requirements are even more than what the Body requires
It is already restricting enough to be members one of another, and now even when we speak, we all have to have one mouth
Many preachers and pastors in today's Christianity are all their own persons, all have their own mouths, and all speak their own things
You speak your thing and he speaks his; sometimes someone will use something from someone else's speaking, but he will do it secretly
There is only one new man, and this one new man has only one person, so the one new man speaks with one mouth and says the same thing
In the church, in the Body of Christ, and especially in the new man, neither your natural man nor my natural man has freedom of speech
You have to consider one mouth in Romans 156 and speak the same thing in 1 Corinthians 110 together with one new man in Ephesians 215
You may wonder how the entire church can have only one mouth and how millions of members can speak the same thing
We should not only eat His riches to take them in and assimilate them into our being; we should also allow Him to be our person
If you visit Christianity throughout all the world, you will not hear the phrase 'taking Christ as the person'
Brothers and sisters, in the last days of this age, before the Lord will be able to return, we must see the Body and the new man
We must see that we who were far off and separated from God were reconciled to God not individually but in a corporate instrument
When the church preaches the gospel, this is an action, and this action is in the Body and is carried out by the Body
Our life needs to increase and grow in order that our body might be healthy and strong enough to meet the need of our moving
Concerning the new man, Ephesians 4:24 says that it was created according to God in righteousness and holiness
You can see two things: the church as the Body is for moving, and the church as the new man is for living by making decisions
On the one hand, the church is the Body of Christ, and we take Christ as our life to act, to work, and to bear responsibilities
On the other hand, the church is the new man, and we take Christ as our person to make plans and to decide on how we should live
Christ is our Head, so we move, and our moving is not based on our own strength or our own life but upon Christ as our life and strength
As we have said before, on the one hand, the church is the Body, and on the other hand, the church is the new man
To the Father the church is His house to Christ the church is His Body with respect to Gods move in the universe the church is a new man
In this new man there are not even any members because members are a matter of the Body, not a matter of the new man
In chapter two he said that Christ had slain the enmity between the Jews and Gentiles and created the two in Himself into one new man
When he mentioned the one, he could not forget the other; when he spoke about the other, he had to speak also about the one
The new man here is a full-grown man, and the Body here is the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
These specially gifted persons do not build up the church directly; instead, they perfect the saints to build up the church
The first thing in perfecting the saints is to feed them that they may grow, and the second thing is to teach them
We know that the higher a life is, the longer it takes to grow; and the lower the life is, the less time it takes to grow
At the time the church arrives at a full-grown man, it arrives at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
A full-grown person certainly has the proper measure of the stature of his fullness; these two things are equivalent
In this passage the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is not mentioned first; rather, it speaks first of the full-grown man
If you take Christ in this way as the person of this corporate new man, you will not decide anything in your life by yourself
Because you see that you are a part of the churches as the new man, you will not be able to decide anything merely by yourself
Have you thought of the churches in Brazil, South America, and the churches in Canada and the United States, North America?
Two thousand years ago at the time of the apostle Paul, it was quite difficult to speak of the new man being universal
When we put on the new man, we put on the universal new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality
We should first ask the Lord to enlighten us and then confess our sins one by one and apply the Lord's precious blood
We need to take the Lord Jesus as our person this includes everything such as dealing with our sins consecration and seeking the will of God
Whether we are from Europe, North America, South America, or Africa, we all should take Christ as our unique person
Those of us who are gifted, whether apostles or prophets or evangelists or shepherds and teachers, should all take this as our goal
We must perfect the saints in locality after locality that they may all enter into a situation where they take Christ as their person
All the components of this old man are the same in their corruption, evil, filthiness, fornication, and disorderliness
Something that has only recently come into the market in the United States is immediately available in other places
The Lord's desire is to have the one new man on the earth, so we all need to rise up to take Christ as our corporate person
If there is a full-grown man, then there will definitely be the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
The result will be that the Body of Christ will grow and have the adequate measure of stature as the fullness of Christ
You can see that as long as we grow and mature, there will be the necessary measure of the stature of the fullness
Christ as our person is for the growth of the new man; Christ as our life is for the increase of the measure of the stature of the Body
Verse 14 says, 'That we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching'
You will see through today's Christianity and realize that it has the sleight, the deceit, of men and that it is involved with craftiness
You must know that many zealous Christians today who are working for the Lord do not mean to be crafty or deceitful
Many members of these groups do not have an ear to hear when you try to talk to them about the truth of the Body or the new man
During this time their craftiness was not to damage the useless ones; they sought to damage only the promising ones
On the surface, they said they had seen the vision of the full Christ, but secretly they were doing this kind of damaging work
It is one in all of Indonesia, one in all of Thailand, one in all of Southeast Asia, and one on the entire earth
If someone makes another one, regardless of how real it looks outwardly, it must be false because there is only one Body and one new man
Over the past ten or more years, it seems that we have become seriously ill due to that incident that happened among us
You must know that after your body goes through a serious illness and recovers, its resistance to that particular sickness is strengthened
We cannot say that to understand the church as a congregation is wrong, but this concept is too human, natural, and religious
If we speak according to the scriptural utterance, however, the church is the house of God, or preferably the household, the family, of God
The house refers to mainly the dwelling place, and the household, the family, refers to the members of the house
From the time the Brethren in England were raised up in the last century, all these aspects of the church have been made known
They saw that the church is the assembly of the calledout ones that the church is the house of God and that the church is the Body of Christ
They need to love one another: We are all in one congregation; as we are all members of this congregation, we should love one another
In Christianity, most of the speaking is concerning the church being a group of people who are of the same persuasion
Loving one another as members of a congregation is a far cry from loving one another as members of a household, a family
When they are not happy with each other, they separate; one goes to the beach at Keelung and the other goes to Mount Ali
In the Body we have the members; in the household we have the family members; in the assembly we have the assembly members
On the cross the Lord slew the enmity and created both the Jewish and Gentile believers in Himself into one new man
Now we want people from all six continents, people with different colors of skin-white, black, yellow, and brown-to become one
At that time, there was a brother in Manila who was twenty years older than I; he was an old English missionary working there
Again in the same year 1957 after the release of the messages on the ground of the church we all saw the matter of one locality one church
They were all silent for a moment, then someone said, 'Brothers, this is good, but we would still like to meet in our own meetings'
They say, 'Even though this is the truth, there is no way to practice it today, so we can only wait for that day'
After the kingdom age is over, it will be the New Jerusalem, and in the New Jerusalem we will not need to practice the church
They begin to criticize and condemn us by saying that the people in the Lord's recovery are foolish to follow a man
We are not simply one assembly, nor are we merely one household, nor are we even merely one Body; we are one new man
The things that happen in the churches in Ghana, Africa can be known immediately by the churches in every other locality
Twenty years ago if we wanted to make a long-distance phone call, we had to make a trip to the Telegraph Bureau
The secret that all the saints on the entire earth will become the one new man depends first on holding to truth in love
If we grow up into Christ in all things, then in Christ there will not be this kind of person or that kind of person
When we hold to Christ as the truth in love and grow up into Him in all things, then we will no longer be many different kinds of people
Verse 16 continues by saying that the whole Body is from Him and out of Him, something that comes out from Him
Verse 15 says that we must grow up into Him in all things, and verse 16 says that all the Body comes from Him and out of Him
The churches in our different localities do not have strict rules to regulate us to be the same and to make us all do the same thing
When that happens, even though we all are many, when we speak, it will be with one mouth because we will all speak the same thing
Having one heart and one mouth means that even though we are many and all are speaking, we all speak the same thing
Since God has released this word in this training, He will definitely not allow this word to return to Him void
By holding to truth, to reality, in love and by growing up into Christ the Head in all things, that is, by taking Him as your person
The first appearing of the church was among a group of people from many different places and countries who spoke many different languages
In a matter of moments, all those people from so many places and countries, who spoke so many different languages, became one new man
The first appearing of the church was not merely among a local group of people; instead, it was among an international group of people
The regions represented here today are even more widespread than those represented by the people in Jerusalem at that time
Christianity has been bearing a negative testimony for several centuries by constantly saying that Christians have no way to be one
Today the Lord wants to present a positive testimony for Christianity to see that Christians can certainly be one
Without the Lord's mercy and grace, all of us descendants of Adam are 'little demons,' and no one can be one with anyone else
On the day of Pentecost the Lord came in, and those speakers of different dialects immediately became one in the Lord
The two days of gospel meetings that we had during the conference would not have been possible in a mere Christianity alliance
Rather, it is entirely a matter of spiritual life, and this spiritual life is our Lord Jesus truly and practically being our life
What we want is to experience Christ inwardly as our life and thus spontaneously produce the new man as its result
Today in the Lords recovery the Lord wants to have an absolute thorough and complete recovery of the allinclusive Spirit as our daily life
Moment by moment we enjoy Him, experience Him, and allow Him to live out of us; therefore, in Him we cannot be anything else but one
There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus'
Even though we are of different nationalities, races, and languages, we have one thing in common: Christ is our life
In any organization there are liaison officers, but in the church we do not need such liaison officers because Christ is our 'liaison'
When you grow up into Christ in all things, then out from Him you can spontaneously be joined and knit together with all the saints
He accomplished whatever He needed, and He accomplished whatever we needed; He accomplished everything that both God and man needed
The Spirit gets into anyone who calls on the Lord's name, and then He operates and works in him in many ways to transform him
Not only are the Chinese and the Americans different, but even the northern Chinese and the southern Chinese have many differences
Today we all must see that this is not merely a conference of all the continents in which we decide what we all will speak about from now on
The Lord today wants to show Satan that He can produce the one new man out of every tongue and people from among the nations
It is not an outward teaching or an outward movement, but it is He Himself within us as life and as our person
We all receive Him and grow up into Him in all things, and then the whole Body is joined and knit together out from Him
Dear brothers and sisters perhaps you would ask me Is there anything in the first few verses in Ephesians 4 that speaks about transformation
When we are all transformed, all the cultures, backgrounds, customs, and languages will be swallowed up by Christ
A brother from Ghana, Africa will speak, sing, fellowship, and praise with a brother from Germany; this is the glory of Christ
Not to mention the Chinese and the Americans, even you who are from the same island and from the same home cannot be one
In this view, putting off the old man means putting off the old nature, while putting on the new man means putting on the new nature
The Lord's salvation today does not cause us merely to put on a new nature, but it causes us to put on the church life
Putting off the old man and putting on the new man mean to put off our old social life and put on the church life
In the Lord's life and in Him as the all-inclusive Spirit, we are putting off the old social life and putting on the new church life
It is hard to say if this spirit is our human spirit or the Spirit of Christ; it must be the two spirits mingled as one spirit
Transformation is not the result of any outward teaching rather it is the issue of the Spirits saturating permeating watering and processing
The life-giving Spirit enters our spirit to process us, and this processing is transformation because the element of the Spirit increases
Ephesians speaks of the Body at the very beginning and continues to speak of the Body, connecting it to the new man
At this time we want to point out clearly that on the one hand, the Spirit is life, and on the other hand, He is a person
In the past we spoke something about life being in the Spirit, and we also spoke about the Spirit being the person of the Lord
Today we can clearly see that with respect to the Body, the Spirit is life, and with respect to the new man, this Spirit is a person
Corinthians 12:13 says that whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, we were all baptized into one Body
According to the Pentecostal people, it does not matter whether you speak of the Holy Spirit or the Spirit of God
They say that if you speak in tongues, you have the Holy Spirit, and if you do not speak in tongues, you do not have the Holy Spirit
In addition, throughout history there have been millions of people who really had life and power yet never spoke in tongues
The telegram had neither a salutation nor a complimentary close; it contained only one sentence: 'Not all speak in tongues'
You can see the two extremes in Christianity: One is to teach empty doctrines, and the other is to promote speaking in tongues
Because of the dead doctrines on one side and the wild Pentecostal things on the other, we were led to the Bible to make a thorough study
We read and studied the Bible again and again, and we have gotten clear about almost every passage in the Bible that refers to the Spirit
From this we have discovered that two things are lacking in the discussions concerning the Spirit throughout the centuries
There is the lack of the knowledge of how the Lord in His death and resurrection became the life-giving Spirit
In the past it seems that this was something seen uniquely among us and that we may have been the only ones to tell people about it
When we were in mainland China prior to 1949 the books we put out did not have this teaching that the last Adam became a lifegiving Spirit
Some said that in resurrection Christ and the Holy Spirit are equal; some said that in resurrection Christ is the Spirit of power
These points have been seen, but throughout the centuries no one has sufficiently emphasized or developed them
It is not sufficient to see only these two matters we must go on to see that the resurrected Christ is the lifegiving Spirit in resurrection
On the one hand, the Lord resurrected and ascended to the heavens, but on the other hand, He remained on the earth after His resurrection
Today in the church's darkest hour He is the sevenfold intensified Spirit, the seven Spirits before the throne of God
The Spirit spoken of in these passages is the Holy Spirit the Spirit of Pentecost the lifegiving Spirit and the sevenfold intensified Spirit
The Spirit is life with respect to the Body of Christ, and the Spirit is the person with respect to the new man
From the first day that we were baptized into the Body, we were placed in a position in which we were given to drink one Spirit
You do not get a drink by talking about it, nor do you get a drink by understanding it or by speaking about it correctly
Let us all leave our position as 'scholars' and be 'country folks,' living the 'country life' and drinking together
From our experience, we have discovered that if you do not call on the Lord's name, you will probably not get a drink of the living water
From that time until today, we have spoken more and more on this topic, and the more we speak, the more we have to speak
When we sing hymns, there are not even any shadows, but all are in life, and the angels in the air shout for joy
If you go back and reread both the Old and New Testaments, you will discover that there are several hundred records of calling on the Lord
When we call on the Lord's name and drink the Spirit, the Spirit is life to the Body and the person to the new man
In chapters two and three, seven times in a row it says that he who has an ear should hear what the Spirit says to the churches
There is yet another marvelous matter; that is, in Revelation we cannot find the title Holy Spirit; it is not mentioned even once
In the Old Testament there are 'the Spirit of God' and 'the Spirit of Jehovah,' but there is not yet 'the Holy Spirit'
But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet'
By the time of Revelation, the Spirit had been there for a long time, and furthermore, the Spirit became the sevenfold intensified Spirit
We have said that this Spirit is our life with respect to the Body of Christ and our person with respect to the new man that God wants
Poor Christianity has degraded into a religion that pays attention only to outward actions and outward corrections
Concerning self-improvement and ethics or morality, the books written by Confucius and Mencius are already sufficient
We know what the church is, what the Body is, what the fullness is, what being filled is, and what is meant by the word all
Although the word spoken by the Spirit is to all the churches, the Bible also says that whoever has an ear let him hear
We are blunt in speaking of Christianity because the 'anity' is a bad thing, but despite this fact we love the Christians
Regardless of what denomination Christians are in, even if they are in Catholicism, they are still the believers and our brothers
Today many do not have an ear to hear, but you have an ear, so you cannot listen in the same way they listen; you need to overcome
All those with an ear should hear what the Spirit speaks to the churches, and those who hear will be overcomers
In everything and in every matter in your living you must also continuously follow what the Spirit within you is speaking to the churches
From now on there should not be doctrinal disputes among us, nor should there be arguments about insignificant matters or anything outward
We should all simply seek to arrive at the oneness of the faith, endeavoring to keep the oneness of the Spirit
We do not listen to mere objective doctrines; instead, we listen to what the subjective Spirit speaks within us
