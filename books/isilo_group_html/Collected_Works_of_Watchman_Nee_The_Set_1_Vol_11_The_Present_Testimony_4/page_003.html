We will not only see how God judges and rejects man's wisdom in his living, but also how a man can please God in his work.</P><P>The first thing we should notice is that there are three crucial items in the flesh that oppose God. These three items of the flesh must first be dealt with in our work. If we have not dealt with these three items, we can never expect to do a good work for God. The first of these three is the wisdom of the flesh; the second is the power of the flesh; and the third is the boasting of the flesh. If these three things are not removed, one cannot do a proper work. The wisdom of the flesh, its power, and its boasting have the greatest negative influence on the work of God. I know very deeply that these three fleshly things corrupt the work of God. The natural order of these three things is: (1) wisdom, (2) power, and (3) glory. They are closely related to one another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD WORKING FIRST BY DEALING WITH MAN</H2><P>Moses was the first servant chosen by God. The first man whom God chose to serve Him was Moses. Although Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were before Moses, they were not God's servants. God only established a covenant with them. Just as Paul was God's first chosen servant in the New Testament, Moses was God's first chosen servant in the Old Testament. How did God deal with Moses? How did Moses gain God's favor? Before God could deal with the children of Israel, He had to first deal with Moses. Before He could deal with Pharaoh, He had to first deal with Moses. Before God could deal with the Egyptians, He had to first deal with Moses.</P><P>The author of the book Causes for Spiritual Power said that when man wants to do something, he first considers the way. But when God wants to do something, He first looks for a man. If God cannot find the man, He has no way. Today in the church there are all kinds of ways, plans, and organizations, but there is no man. What God wants is not the way, but the man. Today man's view and vision are greatly different from this. Man thinks that as long as the way is good, there will be satisfactory results. But as long as the person doing these works remains unchanged, good fruit will never be produced.</P><P>Today God is not short of greatly talented men; what He cannot find is some who can be used by Him. When Moses was only three months old, he was put into the water. Later he was pulled out of the water by Pharaoh's daughter, who adopted him as her son. His name was Moses, which means "drawn out of the water." Moses was the first one to be drawn out; later many of the people were also drawn out with him. First God dealt with Moses in the wilderness. Then Moses could lead the children of Israel out of Egypt into the wilderness, where they could be dealt with by God. If we have not experienced deliverance, we cannot expect others to be delivered. If we cannot see the vision, we cannot expect others to see God's way. If we do not walk on this way, no one else will want to walk on it. Today God expects us to be dealt with by Him first. If God cannot gain a few people from among us, we cannot expect to gain others in turn.</P><P>In the beginning God gained only a few people, but with these few He was able to spread the gospel over the entire Roman world within twenty to thirty years. Many local churches were established. By gaining one person, Paul, God was able to spread the gospel all over the Roman world and cause many to accept and believe the gospel. If we were like Paul, the gospel would already have covered every nation of this world. We do not need to employ various ways to propagate, advertise, solicit contributions, or attract people to believe in the Word. The only thing that is needed is that we be persons whom God can use. Can God use us? Is our work the result of God using us or our using our own ways?</P><P>Before God could deliver the children of Israel, He had to first gain Moses. If God had not gained Moses, He could not have delivered the children of Israel. Without man, God has no way. If the first man had not been drawn out, many other men could not have been drawn out. If the first man had not been dealt with in the wilderness, many others could not have been dealt with in the wilderness. If God had not delivered Moses, He could not have delivered the whole nation. Today it is the same. If God cannot use us, He has no way to work. If the Holy Spirit has not filled us, we cannot expect that He will use us to work in others to save them, and we will not have the strength to work either. If God does not gain us first, His power and life will have no way to flow out. God's fullness can only flow through you. If you want to be this kind of person, there are two things you must do: trust and obey.</P><P>God established a covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that He would deliver their seed. Then He saw that the children of Israel were afflicted by the Egyptians; He heard the voice of their crying. He intended to deliver them according to the covenant which had been established with them. But please remember, in order to save men, God first had to find a channel as a link between Him and the ones He wanted to save. God first had to gain this before He could do what He wanted to do. Moses was the channel used by God. He did not disappoint God. God was able to use him. Today many people disappoint God and make it impossible for God to use them. God is now searching to find the men He needs, the men whom He can use.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 11: The Present Testimony (4) &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
