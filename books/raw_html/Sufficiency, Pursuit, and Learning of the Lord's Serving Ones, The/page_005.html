         <h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEM BEING OUR LACK OF MUTUAL LOVE</h2>
<p>A brother asked how we should manifest our functions when we are together. John 15:16-17 says, &ldquo;You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you. These things I command you that you may love one another.&rdquo; According to John 15, the basic condition for bearing fruit is abiding in the Lord and fellowshipping with Him. However, this chapter concerns not only a believer&rsquo;s personal fellowship with the Lord but also the members&rsquo; loving one another; that is, it concerns our relationship with the Lord and our relationship with the other brothers and sisters. Hence, there are two conditions for bearing fruit: abiding in the Lord and loving one another. Abiding in the Lord is a matter of our fellowshipping with Him, and loving one another involves all the saints.</p>
<p>Most believers see the first condition, but they often neglect the second condition. They think that as long as they fellowship with the Lord, they will not have problems. They do not realize that there is another condition in the Bible. It is necessary that we fellowship with the Lord; however, we must also love the other members. The Lord is the vine tree, and I am not the only branch; there are many other branches. I am not the only member in the Lord&rsquo;s Body; there are many other members. I should maintain a proper relationship not only with the vine tree but also with the other branches. We need to abide in the Lord and also to love the other members.</p>
<p>We become discouraged or proud, not because we lack fellowship with the Lord but because we are short of love for one another. If we practice loving one another, we will not become discouraged or proud. Loving one another is a matter of coordination. Many of us should manifest our functions. The fact that we are not manifesting our functions indicates that there is a problem in our coordination. While some are discouraged because their functions are not being manifested, others are proud because their functions are being manifested. Being proud and self-content destroys a person&rsquo;s function. Both being discouraged and being proud cause us to suffer a great loss. Both of these problems are the issue of not loving one another.</p>
<p>The Lord does not require all of us to be capable. There were many apostles, but only Paul wrote Ephesians. The Lord does not intend for each of us to be like Paul. Many believers, including Timothy and Titus, received help from Paul. The truth is balanced. On one hand, every serving one should learn to live before the Lord, but on the other hand, not all the serving ones receive burdens directly from the Lord. For example, Titus appointed elders in every city, but he did not receive this burden directly from the Lord. Instead, he was charged to do so by the apostle Paul (Titus 1:5). Perhaps some would say that they do not have the burden to preach the gospel; hence, those who have the burden should preach the gospel. This thought indicates that we are not in coordination. Coordination means that some members are eyes, and others are feet. The eyes have the function of seeing, but they need the feet in order to move. Our problem is that we want to be both the feet as well as the eyes. This means that we do not have proper coordination.</p>
<p>If the Lord would have mercy on us, we must learn to coordinate. On one hand, we should learn to live before the Lord and fellowship with Him. On the other hand, we should learn to coordinate with one another. A sister should learn to live before the Lord and to serve joyfully by means of her faith. Nevertheless, in anything related to her service, she should learn to coordinate with others and accept the arrangement. She has neither the position nor the gift to receive a burden directly from the Lord. Her position is to accept the arrangement in the work. She should also joyfully receive whatever is assigned and entrusted to her from those with whom she coordinates. Then she will have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. We are not an organization that operates according to human opinions.</p>
<p>If the Lord allows, even the speaking from the podium will be in coordination. Before the word is released on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, the brothers who are burdened to release the word should come together to fellowship concerning the content of the message and concerning their situations. Someone may say, &ldquo;I have some feeling to release a message. I feel that the Lord desires to speak concerning this matter, because this is the need of the brothers and sisters.&rdquo; He may also fellowship how he will speak so that others can consider it. Perhaps another brother may support it with a supplementary word, and still some others may add a word concerning what he needs to avoid or guard against. Some brothers serving together with him may even share something from their own experience. After this kind of fellowship, the message that is released will definitely be stronger, richer, and more practical than a message that is given without fellowship.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
