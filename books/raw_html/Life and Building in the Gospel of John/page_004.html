        <h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING WITH GOD, AND<br />
THE WORD BEING GOD</h2>
<p>John 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.&rdquo; In these verses John speaks of the Word and God. If he had only said, &ldquo;The Word was with God,&rdquo; we might think that the Word and God are two separate entities, because <em>with</em> implies that there are two things. However, John also says, &ldquo;The Word was God,&rdquo; indicating that the two are one. God&rsquo;s speaking cannot be separated from God Himself. However, when a man speaks, his word is one thing, and he himself is another thing; the two are not one. For example, we can read a letter written by a person in our family, but we cannot touch the person when we read his letter. His words and his person are separate. The Lord Jesus, as the Word of God, cannot be separated from God; He and God are eternally one. This is the reason that John says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; As the Word, the Lord is not only with God; He is God Himself. God cannot be found apart from this Word. The Word is not only with God; the Word is God Himself. This is a mysterious, incomprehensible matter. John used simple words, but they referred to things full of mystery.</p>
<p>If God did not want to be manifested, understood, or known by man, He would be an unfathomable God. But since He desires to be manifested, understood, and known, He moves as the Word. The Word is His going forth. Rather than hiding through inaction, He goes forth through His utterance as the Word. His word is not separate from Him. As soon as a man speaks, his word is separated from him, but since God is the Word, His word is Himself. He is God even when He does not move, but when He moves, He is the Word. God&rsquo;s word is not separate from Him when He speaks, because God is the Word.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s coming to be our life is God&rsquo;s coming forth in His move and in His expression. Without being the Word, God would have no way to be our life. God is inseparable from the Word because He is the Word. God goes wherever His word goes.</p>
<p>God being the Word is an eternal matter; in the beginning He was the Word. This means that God in eternity was not stationary, unexpressive, or silent. God has been speaking and manifesting Himself throughout all eternity: &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.&rdquo; This means that God has always been going forth, moving, and speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THINGS COMING INTO BEING THROUGH HIM</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s activity and utterance brought in the creation of all things: &ldquo;All things came into being through Him&rdquo; (v. 3). Once He moved, all things came forth; once He spoke, all things were created. He spoke, and it was; He commanded, and it stood (Psa. 33:9). This is an incredible matter. As soon as God moved in the universe, all things were created. The creation of all things can be considered as God&rsquo;s going forth, God&rsquo;s being expressed.</p>
<p>Hence, Psalm 19:1 says, &ldquo;The heavens declare the glory of God, / And the expanse proclaims the work of His hands.&rdquo; When God came forth, God was expressed, and His move brought forth all things. The myriads of things in the universe speak of God&rsquo;s move, which is like an expanding ripple on the surface of water. When a stone is cast into a pool of water, there is an expanding ripple on the surface. This ripple expands from the center to the circumference. Radio waves and electrical current also spread out like ripples on the water. These examples illustrate the effect of God&rsquo;s speaking; His speaking produces &ldquo;ripples&rdquo; that bring forth everything. All things are the issue of God&rsquo;s going forth.</p>
<p>It is difficult for a person to look at a mountain range, sail across the ocean, or gaze at the night sky without having some sense of God&rsquo;s existence. Those who are saved feel God&rsquo;s presence, but even atheists feel something of God&rsquo;s presence. A sense of God&rsquo;s presence may not be as strong in the midst of a bustling city, in a movie theater, or in a dance club because of their stupefying effects. But when we are in some remote mountains or on the vast ocean, a feeling that there is a sovereign Lord, a Creator in the universe, spontaneously rises up in us. This is because God&rsquo;s going forth is manifested in the things made by God (Rom. 1:20). This does not mean that all things are God but rather that all things that were made by God&rsquo;s speaking manifest and express Him. When God moved in eternity to express Himself through His speaking, all things issued forth. This is a mysterious matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING IN THE WORD</h2>
<p>John says, &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo; (John 1:4). God&rsquo;s speaking not only resulted in the creation of all things, but His speaking enables man to have God&rsquo;s life. God spoke in Genesis 1, and all things were created. God&rsquo;s speaking in the Gospel of John brings His life into created man. Verse 25 of chapter 5 says, &ldquo;The dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s speaking enables created man to receive His life. A person who hears God&rsquo;s inward speaking is a person in whom God is moving and living. The extent to which God can work and live in us depends on the extent to which we let Him speak in us. The more He speaks in us, the more He works and lives in us. If we want to be filled with Him, we must be filled with His word.</p>
<p>Not letting God speak in us is like shutting Him outside a door. When we give Him a little opportunity to speak, He will do a little work of &ldquo;creation&rdquo; in us. When we let Him speak more in us, He will impart more life into us. The more we let Him speak, the more He will work in us, and the richer His life element will be in us. God reaches us as the Word.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
