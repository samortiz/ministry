[1]  Three Aspects of the Church: The Course of the Church, Book 2 CONTENTS
[2]  The course of the church means the progression of the church, or what we normally call the history of the church.
[3]  The church came out from God s eternal plan; therefore, in eternity past, before the creation of all things, God s intention was the church.
[4]  This is why we can say that apart from the Triune God, the church is the most ancient thing Eph 3:9-11; 1:4-11 .
[5]  In other words, even though God wanted the church in eternity past, He did not tell anyone not even the angels anything about the church.
[6]  In the same way, the church was a mystery because it was hidden in God from eternity past; it existed, but it was not spoken of, because it was hidden in God.
[7]  During the time that the church was hidden, only God Himself knew about it; no one else knew about the church.
[8]  However, the people who passed through these incidents or read about them later did not understand that these stories indicated and referred to the church, because in the Old Testament age the church was still hidden in God.
[9]  In other generations God never made the church known to man as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit v. 5b . The word prophets does not refer to Old Testament prophets but to New Testament prophets, like the ones in Acts 13:1: Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers.
[10]  Thus, at the time the Lord spoke this word, from the human perspective the church still seemed to be something in the future, but in reality the church existed for a long time in God.
[11]  The true meaning of the universe is a story of God and His relationship with man, and this story, this relationship, is a mystery which has two sections.
[12]  Christ Himself is a mystery, but all the matters concerning Christ, all the stories of Christ, and all the contents of the mystery have been placed in the church; therefore, the church is the mystery of Christ.
[13]  On the other hand, the church, the Body, is the mystery of Christ, and all the stories of Christ are in the church as His Body.
[14]  Thus, when we speak of the mystery of God, we are emphasizing the stories of God that are manifested in Christ, and when we speak of the mystery of Christ, we are emphasizing the stories of Christ that are manifested in the church.
[15]  If we would know the mystery, story, and matters of God and man, man and God, then we must know Christ and the church.
[16]  Therefore, if we want to know God, we must know Christ, and if we want to know Christ, we must know the church.
[17]  REVEALED IN TIME The Lord s Revelation concerning the Church
[18]  The third item of the course of the church is that it is revealed in time.
[19]  The Lord revealed the church in Matthew 16, because at that time Christ as the mystery of God had been manifested.
[20]  Since God had been manifested in the flesh, Christ could reveal His own mystery, the church.
[21]  In Luke 15 we see the joy of God the Father, signified by the father s rejoicing at the younger son s return v. 24 . However, in Luke 15 the joy is small; in Matthew 16 God s joy is greater because on that day God s mystery in the universe was known by man.
[22]  This is the reason the Lord immediately said to Peter, I also say to you that you are Peter the Greek word meaning stone , and upon this rock I will build My church v. 18 . The rock is the mystery of God, which is Christ.
[23]  When we speak of the revelation of the church, we must go back prior to the day of Pentecost, to the time before the work on the cross had been accomplished.
[24]  The church was first planned, then hidden, then revealed, and finally fulfilled.
[25]  On the day of Pentecost the church was not only in God s thought, but it had actually come out from within God.
[26]  The church was not only hidden in God in eternity past; it was also revealed in time, produced at Pentecost, and spread on the earth.
[27]  The spreading of the church not only took place in time, but it also occurred on the earth.
[28]  After the church was produced at Pentecost, it has been constantly spreading for the past two thousand years and has spread everywhere.
[29]  In other words, the church that God wants is a church in the whole universe and not simply a church in one place.
[30]  Thus, when the church was produced on the day of Pentecost, even though it was produced in Jerusalem, its nature was not merely that of the church in Jerusalem.
[31]  The church can be produced in one place, but it is impossible to continue the church in one place forever and force it to grow only there.
[32]  Therefore, if a local church does not spread, the nature of that church is too low, and it will lose its universal and eternal character.
[33]  In Peter s mind the church belonged to Jerusalem and to the Jews and should not go to the Gentile lands or to the Gentile people; however, the church had to spread.
[34]  God confirmed that the church needed to spread; therefore, the first step in the church s spread was to Samaria, to a people who were partly Jew and partly Gentile.
[35]  The person God saved and chose to be an apostle was not a pious person who obeyed God but a person who opposed God, persecuted the church, and inflicted harm on Christians.
[36]  During the age of the apostles, there are many examples which show that God can spread the church to many people whom we think cannot possibly become the church.
[37]  It was not easy for someone to go to his home and preach the gospel to him, to his family, and to his friends, and the Holy Spirit met resistance in Peter v. 14 . From the record in Acts we see that Peter strongly felt that the church was Jewish and should be in Judea.
[38]  Peter did not understand and refused three times v. 16 . Eventually, Peter obeyed the Spirit and went to the house of Cornelius, and while he was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those hearing the word v. 44 . This told Peter and those with him that the church is not of the Jews and that it must spread to the Gentiles; the church is not local but universal.
[39]  Promoting the church s spread through human work is ineffective and will not last, but we should bear the responsibility to allow the church to spread in order to eliminate our narrow concepts.
[40]  The church in Antioch was also part of the story of the church s spreading Acts 13:1 .
[41]  CHAPTER THREE THE SPREADING OF THE CHURCH 2 THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED
[42]  When the church was spreading, Satan created three problems through various people.
[43]  Throughout church history, each time the church has spread, it has been through a group of people whom God empowered to break through religious rituals, ordinances, and dead letters.
[44]  After the problem of the Jewish religion was resolved, Paul and Barnabas immediately went out to the Gentile lands to preach the gospel.
[45]  The spread of the church is the building up of the Body of Christ; if the church does not spread, the Body of Christ cannot be built up and God s eternal plan cannot be completed.
[46]  As the Holy Spirit works to spread and build up the church, Satan follows to damage the Spirit s work of spreading and building up the church.
[47]  Paul s old concepts were revealed not only in his second ministry journey but also in his third.
[48]  When Paul was in Corinth during his third journey, he wrote a letter to the church in Rome and spoke of his feeling to go to Rome to visit the church there and from there to go to Spain Rom 1:15; 15:23-24, 28 .
[49]  This was the will of the Holy Spirit related to the spread of the church.
[50]  Thank God that He did not allow His children to go back to the Old Testament, nor did He allow the church to be mixed with Judaism.
[51]  The Bible records the spread of the church through Acts 28.
[52]  The Bible also records many other matters, including the desolation of the church.
[53]  The first line is the meaning of the church or the spiritual aspect of the church.
[54]  The second line is the course of the church, the third line is the organization of the church, and the fourth line is the desolation of the church.
[55]  Therefore, if we want to know the situation of the church, we must know about the desolation of the church.
[56]  In Acts 20, as Paul traveled to Jerusalem on his return from his third journey, he passed through Ephesus.
[57]  However, Paul said that fierce wolves would come into the church in Ephesus; these were false, evil men who came into the church speaking heresy and leading people astray.
[58]  Moreover, even those who had nothing good to say about me were members of the church of God, and I could not speak negatively about the church to an unbeliever.
[59]  In 2 Timothy the desolation of the church reached an extreme level.
[60]  Although the second epistle, addressed to the church in Smyrna, and the sixth epistle, addressed to the church in Philadelphia, do not mention the desolation of the church in these particular localities, they still indicate that the church was in desolation.
[61]  If we consider the portions concerning the desolation of the church from 2 Corinthians, Philippians, 2 Timothy, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, and the epistles in Revelation, we will see that the matters that the Bible records as part of the desolation of the early church are still present in the church today.
[62]  As those who live during the desolation of the church, we need to realize that the desolation manifests our condition.

[64]  DURING THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH 2 Praying out of a Pure Heart
[65]  In the desolation of the church many people cannot find the way because their heart is impure, and they are unable to discern the nature of things.
[66]  Some people have asked me to show them where the Bible says that we should leave the denominations.
[67]  We need to be pure in heart, but we also need to pray to the Lord.
[68]  Prayer means that we reject and do not rely on ourselves in spiritual matters, in church affairs, and in matters related to the work and serving the Lord.
[69]  THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH 3 Needing to Be an Overcomer God Calling the Overcomers
[70]  The final seven epistles from the Lord to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3 speak very clearly regarding the desolation of the church.
[71]  We need to see what the Lord says concerning the church s overcoming in the seven epistles in Revelation.
[72]  According to the order of the seven epistles, the desolation of the church began with losing the first love for the Lord.
[73]  Initially, the church s love toward the Lord was fresh.
[74]  We build up the church because of our fellowship of love with the Lord; we administrate the church in a proper way because there is a story of love between us and the Lord.
[75]  The Lord did not rebuke the church in Smyrna; He only praised it.
[76]  However, in the epistle to Smyrna the Lord commanded the saints to overcome; He wanted them to be faithful unto death v. 10 . In other words, because of their love for Him, they were not even to care for their lives.
[77]  When the church has the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans, that is, when the church is full of human opinions and organization, those who refuse, reject, and abandon these teachings and stand on the Lord s side to maintain His testimony will be able to experience Christ as the hidden manna.
[78]  The church in Thyatira is full of idols, fornication, and the deep things of Satan vv.
[79]  In this epistle, the Lord says, You have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name v. 8 . The believers kept the Lord s name and His word in love, and their situation was expressed in the love among the brothers.
[80]  The church fell to such an extent that the Lord left it, and it was filled with the things of the world, producing the church in Thyatira, the Roman Catholic Church.
[81]  TO THE COURSE OF THE CHURCH 1 THE STORY OF HUMANITY
[82]  From the day the church was produced, it has been assisted and hindered in many ways.
[83]  In order to have a thorough knowledge of the course of the church, we need to know what conveniences and problems it has encountered.
[84]  Without knowing this, it is difficult to understand the course of the church, because the course of the church is very much related to the assistance it has received and the hindrances it has encountered.
[85]  THE ASSISTANCE ENJOYED BY THE CHURCH Assistance from Hebrew Religion Judaism
[86]  In a sense, the church came out of Judaism; at least, the first group of people in the church came out of Judaism.
[87]  The Old Testament occupies a significant portion of the Bible read by the church.
[88]  The Jews and the members of the church believe in and worship the same one God.
[89]  From a historical viewpoint, the early members of the church received most of their knowledge of God from Judaism.
[90]  The manger that produced the church was the Jewish temple in Jerusalem; the temple was the place in which the church was produced.
[91]  In Acts 1 the one hundred and twenty were praying in the upper room v. 13 when they received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit 2:2-4 , but their meetings were held in the Jewish temple v. 46 . If Judaism had not persecuted the church, we would have to acknowledge that it helped the church enormously.
[92]  Roman politics was a frustration and trouble to the Jews but was a great help in the spread of the church.
[93]  Roman politics aided the church in the following three points.
[94]  TO THE COURSE OF THE CHURCH 2 The Hindrance from Greek Culture
[95]  When the early church was spreading on the earth, it was mixed with Hebrew religion and Greek culture.
[96]  Bringing anything other than Christ into the church causes the church to suffer loss, because whatever is not Christ reduces the element of Christ in the church.
[97]  Early in the history of the church, the Roman Empire aided the spread of the church by providing public security and ease of travel over a good transportation system.
[98]  This was a great help in building up the church.
[99]  They persecuted the church to such an extent that one Roman official reported to Caesar that the more they killed Christians, the faster Christianity spread.
[100]  Since the church should be the pure bride of Christ, its union with the Roman Empire was spiritual fornication; this was the fulfillment of the church in Pergamos in Revelation 2.
[101]  Throughout church history the church has constantly faced this kind of problem and has shown a tendency to be mixed with politics.
[102]  When Martin Luther led the Protestant Reformation, he did not bring the church out of politics; on the contrary, the church under Luther became involved with politics.
[103]  To know the church in these last days, we must know Hebrew religion, Greek philosophy, and Roman politics, all of which should not have any position in the church.
[104]  The transmutation of the church refers to the church being altered in its organization and administration, that is, in its government.
[105]  There is some truth to these concepts both Constantine s acceptance of Christianity and the formation of the Roman Catholic Church resulted in many great changes in the church.
[106]  This shows that the church was already taking the Jewish religion as a model for the organization and administration of the church.
[107]  Ignatius s mistaken belief was a seed sown into the church that has had a far-reaching influence on the church throughout the ages; even today this teaching has not been weeded out.
[108]  Furthermore, we are not the first to recognize that the church should not have a unified organization; in the third century, as the transmutation of the administration and organization of the church was occurring, some of God s children rose up to oppose it.
[109]  In the beginning the constituents of the church were the Lord and those who had His life; it consisted only of those who were saved, not unsaved ones.
[110]  We cannot allow unsaved ones into the church, we stand against classes in the church, we stand against an organizational unification of the church, and we stand against bishops and overseers being above the elders.
[111]  The constituting element of the church should be simple; the church can be constituted only with saved persons, those who contact God and have the Lord s life.
[112]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE UNION OF THE CHURCH AND POLITICS THE UNION OF
[113]  The transmutation of the church in administration and organization began with the Judaic system, methods, and priesthood, a group of specialists in serving God, being brought into the church.
[114]  Judaism took root in the church, damaging the life of the church and dealing it a severe blow.
[115]  The transmutation of the organization and administration of the church began with Clement around A.D. 100; it continued from that time, growing worse and worse until A.D. 312, when Constantine united the church with the Roman Empire.
[116]  While it may seem that the church had gained the victory and that the Roman Empire was under its hand, in reality, the world was united with the church, and the world had come into the church.
[117]  The church and the Roman Empire were united to such an extent that it was almost as if the church was the Roman Empire and the Roman Empire was the church.
[118]  There are many examples in church history of ones who loved the Lord and did not take part in the corruption; they did not want a transmuted church, and they did not approve of the union of the church with human government.
[119]  In the second century he brought the Jewish priestly system into the church; this system of priests was like a seed sown in the church.
[120]  This hierarchical organization was formed into a unified church called the catholic church.
[121]  I hope that God would open our eyes to see the things that should be in the church and the things that are filthy and corrupt, to see the things that were originally in the church and the things which were not originally in the church.
[122]  During the process in which the church became the Roman Catholic Church, strong distinctions developed among the various groups within the church.
[123]  The transmutation of the organization of the church began from when Bishop Clement suggested that the system of the Jewish priesthood be brought into the church.
[124]  Once the transmutation started, those in the church who lived before the Lord began to differ from the majority in their thought.
[125]  Those who accepted the transmuted organization of the church organized themselves into the catholic church in approximately A.D. 250, when Cyprian was bishop of Carthage in northern Africa.
[126]  However, after the catholic church was formed, the sectarianism within the church was clearly manifested, and two lines developed within Christianity.
[127]  Their stand for the Lord distinguished them not only from those in the catholic church but also from most people in society; therefore, these pure-hearted believers were not welcomed by human society, and history records very little concerning them.
[128]  The division of the catholic church between the East and the West eventually also developed into two distinct lines.
[129]  It is difficult to speak about the church with them because they think that all Christian groups are wrong and have problems; therefore, they do not want any church.
[130]  A careful study of church history and spiritual biographies shows that although Martin Luther formally brought the church out of Catholicism, there were still many spiritual people in the Roman Catholic Church.
[131]  A short time later, the system of the elders administration of the church was recovered.
[132]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH 2 THE RECOVERY AMONG THE BRETHREN
[133]  In the nineteenth century the brothers of the so-called Brethren assemblies were raised up.
[134]  This was one of God s great recoveries in the history of the church.
[135]  Many basic truths concerning things such as the church, the Lord s return, prophecies, and the separation between the church and the world were recovered at that time.
[136]  Another thing recovered by the Brethren is material offering; this is also a great recovery.
[137]  Another great recovery, which we should not neglect, is the recovery of the gospel.
[138]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE HISTORY OF THE LORD S MOVE IN CHINA 1 EARLY HISTORY BEFORE 1900 Nestorianism
[139]  Because we were born in China, raised in China, and live in China, we must include the history of Christianity in China in a discussion of our origins.
[140]  RECENT HISTORY 1900 TO 1925 The Turn in 1900
[141]  In 1900 there was an important turn in the history of the church in China.
[142]  There the church in China encountered its greatest persecution; it was also the greatest purification for the church in China.
[143]  At the beginning of the twentieth century, the Lord raised up many witnesses among the Chinese.
[144]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE HISTORY OF THE LORD S MOVE IN CHINA 2 OUR GENEALOGY A Seed Prepared by God
[145]  Sister M. E. Barber, an English woman, is related to the genealogy of the Lord s recovery.
[146]  After Sister Dora Yu went to Foochow to preach the gospel, a group of young believers was raised up in Foochow.
[147]  About two years after Brother Nee began putting out The Christian, many believers were raised up to pursue the Lord both in northern and southern China, because the messages in The Christian provoked the lovers of the Lord regarding the real condition of the church.
[148]  After the war was over, Shanghai and Nanking became the center of the entire country.
[149]  When I arrived in Taiwan in 1949, the church in Taipei was the only relatively large church on the island.
[150]  Because the church in Taipei was small and weak, the co-workers asked these four brothers to take the responsibility to lead the church.
[151]  We have had one conference per year except in 1955 and this year, in which we have had two conferences.
[152]  The spiritual recoveries among us are the most precious part of our history.
[153]  The history of how God has blessed us is focused not on acts or actions but on spiritual things.
[154]  Although the Baptist Church existed and sent brothers to China who baptized people, the battle for the truth concerning baptism did not really begin until God raised us up in China.
[155]  After they were clearly saved and saw in God s Word the truth of baptism by immersion, they went to fellowship about it with Miss M. E. Barber.
[156]  Thank God that the gospel, the truth, the Bible, the Lord, the Lord s name, and His salvation came to China through the Western missionaries.
[157]  Formerly, almost no one among the believers in China lived by faith before God.
[158]  Sister Dora Yu had this experience to some extent, but there was not a solid testimony of living by faith until we were raised up.
[159]  A person who has truly been called does not need to study theology.
[160]  THE RECOVERY OF GIVING ALL FOR THE LORD S USE
[161]  In 1943 in northern China, the flow of the Holy Spirit was so strong that of eight hundred brothers and sisters, more than ninety percent placed their all into the Lord s hands not merely in prayer or in word, but even more, they placed everything practically in the Lord s hands.
[162]  During the revival in northern China in 1943, Brother Sun Feng-lu said to me, I feel that the condition of the church today is just like the condition of the church on the day of Pentecost.
[163]  If we want to know what attitude we should have toward today s Christianity, we must understand God s attitude toward Christianity.
[164]  The church is the Body of Christ and the place where God is mingled with man; the church is the dwelling place of God for His expression on earth and the place where Christ manifests His victory among men.
[165]  In this age the Lord has commissioned us to preach the gospel and minister life; He has not asked us to touch the situation in Christianity.
[166]  He repeatedly insisted that I answer him regarding the church, but I could only say, The question of the church cannot be resolved by any person but only by your spiritual life.
[167]  I really hope that our gospel preaching is the going forth of the pure gospel and not just a work; I hope that we are ministering only life to people and that we are not concerned with the visible church meetings.
[168]  If we meet someone who has never contacted Christianity, we should do our best to bring him into the Lord s churches, but we should not announce to people who are already in the realm of Christianity that God s presence is with us or attempt to draw them to meet with us.
[169]  It would be ideal if in every city there was a church that we were at peace with in our conscience; then there would be no need for us to set up other meetings.
[170]  The believers should love one another, but we do not love one another merely because we serve the Lord together.
