<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Revelation is a book of prophecy (1:3; 22:7). Most of its content refers to things to come. In this lesson we will see the visions of the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls in the book of Revelation, as well as the prophecies concerning them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SEVEN SEALS, THE SEVEN TRUMPETS,<br />
AND THE SEVEN BOWLS</h2>
<p>The first four seals cover the history of the world from Christ&rsquo;s ascension to the end of this age (6:1-8). With the opening of these seals there are four horses with their riders, signifying the gospel, war, famine, and death respectively. This has been the situation of the history of the world during the past twenty centuries. Since Christ&rsquo;s ascension, the gospel has been preached. Throughout the centuries, along with the preaching of the gospel, there has been war. War brings in famine, and famine brings in death. With the fifth seal there is the cry of the martyred saints (vv. 9-11). As a result of the preaching of the gospel throughout the centuries, many saints have been martyred. Close to the end of this age these martyred saints will cry to God for vengeance. The sixth seal, which takes place close to the beginning of the great tribulation, involves the shaking of the earth and heaven (vv. 12-17) and will be a warning to earth&rsquo;s dwellers, reminding them that there is a God in the universe. At that time, the earth will no longer be a suitable place for evil men to live boastfully. The seventh seal includes the seven trumpets and will last for eternity.</p>
<p>The seven trumpets are the contents of the seventh seal. The first four trumpets are the judgments on the earth, the sea, the rivers, the sun, the moon, and the stars (8:7-12). As a result of the judgments in the first four trumpets, the earth will no longer be a suitable place for people to live. The fifth trumpet, which is the first woe as a judgment on men, will be the beginning of the serious woes of the great tribulation (8:13&mdash;9:11). The sixth trumpet, which is the second woe and a further judgment on men, is also a part of the great tribulation (vv. 12-21). The seventh trumpet consists of the eternal kingdom of Christ; the third woe comprising the seven bowls; the judgment of the dead; the rewarding of the prophets, the saints, and the God-fearing people; and the destruction of the destroyers of the earth (11:14-18). The third woe will be the closing of the great tribulation. After this there will be the rewarding of the prophets, the saints, and those who fear God&rsquo;s name. These three categories of people have been produced throughout the generations. The prophets are mainly from the Old Testament, the saints from the New Testament, and those who fear the name of God will be produced during the great tribulation. The seventh trumpet also contains the judgment of the dead, and the destruction of Satan, Antichrist, the false prophet, and all their followers. Hence, the seventh trumpet includes everything from the end of the great tribulation to eternity.</p>
<p>The seven bowls, which are a part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet as the last plagues of God&rsquo;s wrath on men, will be the end of the great tribulation (15:1, 6-8; 16:1-21).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_060.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_062.html">Next</a> </body></html>
