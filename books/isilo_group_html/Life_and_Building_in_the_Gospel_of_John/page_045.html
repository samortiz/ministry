BEING THE FIRST SIGN</h2>
<p>We will now look at the important points concerning the sign of changing water into wine in chapter 2. May the Lord open our eyes so that we may understand what He desires to do in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">On the Third Day</h2>
<p>Chapter 2 begins with the words <em>and the third day</em> (v. 1). If we begin reading from chapter 1, we will see that this day was not the third day. In chapter 1 the expression <em>the next day</em> is used at least three times&mdash;in verses 29, 35, and 43. Hence, the day at the beginning of chapter 2 should be at least the fifth day, but instead of saying &ldquo;the fifth day,&rdquo; John says, &ldquo;And the third day.&rdquo; The third day is the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection (v. 19). This means that the Lord comes to man in resurrection. Chapter 2 covers two matters, both of which are related to the third day, indicating that the Lord was in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Cana of Galilee</h2>
<p>The first sign took place in Cana of Galilee (v. 1). Galilee was a place in a low condition; it was a place despised by people. <em>Cana</em> in the original language means &ldquo;a land of reeds.&rdquo; Reeds signify weak and fragile people. The Lord came to a place in a low condition, filled with weak and fragile people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Wine in the Wedding Feast</h2>
<p>The Lord came to Cana to attend a wedding feast. In the eyes of the world, marriage is the center of human life. Marriage signifies human life because human life depends on marriage. A wedding feast signifies the pleasure and enjoyment of human life. The primary item in a wedding feast is wine. Whether in ancient times or in the present, wine is always at the center of a wedding feast. If there is no wine, there is no wedding feast. Wine refers to excitement, enthusiasm, and rejoicing on earth. Wine is made from the life juice of grapes; hence, it signifies life. Water in this case signifies death.</p>
<p>Marriage depends on a wedding feast, and a wedding feast depends on wine. This means that the pleasure of human life depends on the life of man. When the life of man runs out, the pleasure and enjoyment of life also end. When the wine in a wedding feast runs out, the pleasure of the feast also ceases. Hence, this sign provides a background showing that the enjoyment of human life depends on man&rsquo;s life and that there is an end to man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Listening to the Lord&rsquo;s Command</h2>
<p>When the wine ran out, Mary the mother of Jesus said to Him, &ldquo;They have no wine&rdquo; (v. 3). Like Martha in chapter 11, the mother of Jesus rushed to take the lead, trying to command the Lord. The Lord refused to respond, saying, &ldquo;Woman, what do I have in this that concerns you?&rdquo; (v. 4). When Mary heard this, she knew that she was wrong. Hence, she stopped and said to the servants, &ldquo;Whatever He says to you, do&rdquo; (v. 5). She realized that this was the Lord&rsquo;s business, not hers. Whatever needed to be done should be initiated by the Lord, not by her.</p>
<p>In chapter 11 the Lord dealt with Martha in the same way. The sisters of Lazarus sent a message to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick&rdquo; (v. 3). But the Lord purposely remained where He was for two more days. His remaining where He was for an extended time was similar to His word to His mother in chapter 2. The Lord rejected and did not answer Mary or Martha&rsquo;s request, because in the matter of the divine life, man is not the lord and cannot give orders. Rather, man must let the Lord of life be the Lord. If we want the Lord Jesus to be our life, we must acknowledge His lordship and give Him that position.</p>
<p>Many people are in death. Within they are full of water, not wine, because they do not know how to stop themselves and are not willing to let the Lord have ground in them. Their prayers seem to be petitions but actually they are commands; that is, they usurp the Lord&rsquo;s position and annul His lordship. If we want the Lord to be our life, we must step down and give place to His authority. We must see that He is the Lord. Instead of answering our prayer, the Lord often allows us to fail because He wants us to learn to stop ourselves. He wants us to learn to say, &ldquo;Lord, I want You to be my life and my Lord. It is a small matter for me to fail, but it is a great matter for You to be my Lord. If You want to let me fail in this matter, I am also willing to fail. I give You full authority over me.&rdquo; When we pray in this way, the Lord will be our life. Once He gains the ground in us by our giving Him the place of authority in us, He will be our life.</p>
<p>When the wine at the wedding feast ran out, Jesus&rsquo; mother should have been full of faith, because the Lord knows everything; time is in His hand, and He cannot be wrong. She did not need to petition or give a command. She needed only to stay in her position and yield to the Lord so that He could bear the responsibility. In order for the Lord to be our life, we must give Him the ground in our being by yielding to Him. If we do not give Him the ground, our prayers will be of no avail. The only thing that avails is to say, &ldquo;Lord, You are the Lord. I give You all the ground in me, and I give You all authority over me so that You can be my life.&rdquo; This is what Mary indicated when she told the servants to do whatever the Lord said. When we pray in such a way, the Lord will do something in us related to life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life and Building in the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 45</div><br></body></html>
