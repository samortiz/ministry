Blessed Being the Fruit<br>of Their Womb, of Their Ground,<br>and of Their Animals, the Offspring<br>of Their Cattle and the Young of Their Flock</H2><P>In speaking of the blessing coming upon the people, Moses was very detailed. In verses 4 and 5 he said that blessed would be the fruit of their womb, the fruit of their ground, and the fruit of their cattle and also the offspring of their cattle and the young of their flock. Moses said that even their basket and kneading bowl would be blessed.</P>
