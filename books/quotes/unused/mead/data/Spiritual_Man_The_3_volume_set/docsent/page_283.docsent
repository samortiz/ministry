   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OPENING OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Besides revealing the truth directly to us, God often in fact most of the time conveys the truth to us through His other children.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This kind of truth is first accepted by our mind, and then it reaches our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We use our mind to contact the speaking and writing of others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we did not have a mind, it would be impossible for the truth to reach our life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, an opened mind is very crucial to our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If our mind is fully occupied with opinions, whether they are about the truth or about the person who preaches the truth, there will be no way for the truth to enter into our mind or life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If believers have determined beforehand what kind of teaching they are going to read or listen to, it is no wonder that they do not get much help.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Believers have to know the process through which the truth is translated into life before they see the importance of an opened mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The truth is first realized in our mind, then it enters into our spirit and touches our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Finally, it is manifested in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A closed mind hinders the truth from reaching the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A closed mind means a mind occupied with opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whatever disagrees with its thoughts is opposed and criticized.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Its opinion becomes the standard for all truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anything that does not agree with its concept is not regarded as the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This kind of mind gives no chance for many of God's truths to come in. As a result, the believers cannot help but suffer loss in the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Experienced believers can all testify to the importance of an opened mind with regard to the revelation of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times we do not have understanding because we do not have an opened mind, not because the truth is not preached to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes God has to wait for many years before He can cause us to remove all the hindrances and receive His truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An opened mind in conjunction with an opened spirit is very helpful for believers to grow in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though the truth may seem foggy in the mind at times, as long as it remains open, the believer will see the preciousness of the truth when the light of the spirit comes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many times a believer receives a truth which seems meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But after a while, the light of the spirit comes in, and the believer seems to understand everything, and sees the intrinsic content of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Outwardly he may not be able to put it in words, yet inwardly, there is an unspeakable understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>An opened mind opens the way for the truth to enter in. Yet without the enlightening of the spirit, it will remain useless.</S>
