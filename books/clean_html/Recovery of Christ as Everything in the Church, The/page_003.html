<h2 class="head1">MANY THINGS CREEPING IN<br />
TO REPLACE CHRIST IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the latter part of the first century, while the apostles were still on the earth, two main things crept into the church to replace Christ&mdash;Judaism and Greek philosophy. Galatians was written to deal with Judaism, and Colossians was written to deal with Greek philosophy. Since the first century, many other things have crept into the church to replace Christ. First, different doctrines came in to replace Christ. Many doctrines, including scriptural doctrines, have replaced Christ. Second, various practices, such as foot-washing, leg-lengthening, and different forms of baptism, have come in to replace Christ. Many Pentecostals may care for speaking in tongues rather than Christ. Thus, speaking in tongues has also replaced Christ. The subtlest thing that has crept in among Christians is opinions. There are endless opinions about what musical instruments to use in meetings and many other such things. Besides doctrines, practices, and opinions, there are various kinds of activities and movements that have also come in to replace Christ. Another item that has replaced Christ is organizations. Every denomination is an organization. Some denominations are organized according to certain practices or doctrines; others are organized according to a nation, such as the Church of England. These organizations replace Christ. Even Judaism and philosophy are still replacing Christ. The robes of the Catholic clergy were designed according to the Old Testament priests&rsquo; robes. This indicates a mixture with Judaism. Those in so-called modern Christianity believe in their philosophy rather than the Bible. Philosophy has replaced Christ among these groups. Judaism, philosophy, doctrines, practices, opinions, activities, movements, and organizations have altogether replaced Christ among countless believers today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY BEING<br />
TO RECOVER CHRIST AS EVERYTHING TO US</h2>
<p>Because many things have replaced Christ, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover Christ in a full way, to recover Christ as everything to us. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we should not care for doctrines, practices, opinions, activities, movements, or organizations but only for Christ.</p>
<p>For example, our way to preach the gospel should be Christ. In John 15:5 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches.&rdquo; The proper way for the branches to bear fruit is simply to live the vine, to grow the vine, and to produce the vine. There is no need for gimmicks or worldly activities to contact people for the gospel. The Lord also said, &ldquo;I am the way&rdquo; (14:6). The way to preach the gospel is Christ. As branches in the vine, we need only to love the Lord, live Him, grow Him, and produce Him in our daily life. If we do, we will be a living testimony to our relatives, neighbors, colleagues, and classmates. When one of them becomes sick, loses his job, or experiences some other difficult situation, he may remember us and ask us to visit him. After we speak only a few words of the gospel, he may be willing to pray to receive the Lord. In this way we live the gospel by living Christ. We do not need movements, activities, or gimmicks to try to bring people to the Lord. The proper way to preach the gospel is by living Christ. This is the original way that needs to be recovered today.</p>
<p>In Acts 1:8 the Lord charges us to be His witnesses. Our commission is not merely to preach but to be witnesses. We need to be witnesses of Christ by daily living Christ. To be a witness by living Christ is to take Christ as the way to preach the gospel. We will see a wonderful result if we are a living testimony. Our relatives and acquaintances may outwardly criticize and even despise us, but their conscience will inwardly testify on our behalf. When the time comes according to the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement, one by one they will gradually turn to Him.</p>
<p>Christ is everything in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We do not care for doctrines, practices, opinions, activities, movements, or organizations. We care for Christ and Christ alone. He is our life, our reality, and our way in everything. This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
