   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TEXT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s covenant of promise is for God s chosen people to inherit the inheritance promised by God, and God s covenant of circumcision is a confirmation of His covenant of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who inherit the promised inheritance according to this covenant should live for God as His burnt offering to satisfy God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, God s chosen people cannot be the burnt offering to satisfy God s desire by themselves; they must take Christ as their Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God wanted Abraham to offer his son Isaac, who would inherit God s promised inheritance, as a burnt offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Abraham acted according to God s command and offered Isaac on the altar as a burnt offering, he saw a ram which God had provided as a burnt offering for his son Isaac, and he went and took it as a substitute for his son Gen 22:1-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This typifies that Christ replaces God s chosen people, who would inherit God s promised inheritance, as the burnt offering to satisfy God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I. A RAM A MALE SHEEP A. A Male Signifying Christ as the Strong One</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the God-created nature, a male signifies one who is strong, and a female signifies one who is weak and yet has the ability to reproduce.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First Peter speaks of the female as the weaker vessel 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, the ram, the male sheep, which is a type of Christ as the burnt offering, signifies Christ as the strong One.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. A Sheep Signifying Christ</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>as the Meek, Gentle, and Perfect One</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A sheep signifies that Christ is One who is meek, gentle, and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted, / Yet He did not open His mouth; / Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter / And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, / So He did not open His mouth Isa 53:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He being reviled did not revile in return; suffering, He did not threaten 1 Pet 2:23a .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He will not cry out, nor lift up His voice, / Nor make His voice heard in the street.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>/ A bruised reed He will not break; / And a dimly burning flax He will not extinguish Isa 42:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This shows Christ s meekness and gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He said, I am meek...in heart Matt 11:29a .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not resist opposition, nor did He want to do anything for Himself or expect to gain something for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The lamb for the burnt offering had to be without blemish Lev 1:10 , that is, without any defect or problem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This also shows Christ s perfection and blamelessness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>TYPIFYING CHRIST AS THE ONE PROVIDED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The ram that replaced Isaac on the altar was provided by Jehovah God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Abraham called the name of the place where he offered the sacrifice Jehovah-jireh, which means Jehovah will provide.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The ram provided by God typifies Christ as the One provided by God to replace God s chosen people, those who would inherit God s promised inheritance, as the burnt offering for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A. Leaving the Freedom of His Divinity</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the Lamb provided by God, Christ was sent by God to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He left the freedom of His divinity and was confined in the flesh of humanity which He put on in His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was the infinite God in eternity, yet He was willing to become a finite man in time to be limited by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He even suffered hunger, thirst, and weariness, and was tempted in all respects like us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is His leaving the freedom of His divinity to be restricted in His humanity as the Lamb of God to be offered to God as a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>B. His Fighting Power</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Being Caught in His Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The ram was caught in a thicket by his horns Gen 22:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Bible horns signify fighting power.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The thicket signifies humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be caught in a thicket is to be caught by humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ as the Lamb of God was willing to have His fighting power caught in His humanity that He might be offered as our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is in His humanity that we met Him and received Him as our Substitute.</S>
