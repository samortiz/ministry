   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST IN RESURRECTION The Christ Who Is Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regarding our experience of Christ in resurrection, we may use the term the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although we do not like to speak of the spiritual Christ, we like the expression the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This expression indicates that Christ is the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The pneumatic Christ is actually the life-giving Spirit Himself, not in a doctrinal way but in an experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Throughout the centuries, a number of Christian teachers have said that in our experience Christ is identical to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Doctrinally this is difficult to explain; however, experientially we know that Christ is the Spirit living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the New Testament, both Christ and the Spirit live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do we, then, have two living in us or one?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The best answer to this question is to say that the One who lives in us is the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christians often say, Our Christ is living; we have a living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But many believers do not realize that this living Christ is the Christ in resurrection and the Christ who is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus said, I am the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here we see that Christ Himself is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The very Christ who is now in resurrection is the resurrection itself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Walking in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The New Testament charges us to walk by the Spirit Gal 5:16, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To walk by the Spirit simply means to walk in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to experience this, we need to deny ourselves so that Christ may live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we die, Christ lives.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ lives in us by our dying.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Dying That Christ May Live in Us</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now that Christ lives within us, we are intimately involved with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may say that He and the believer become one seed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You are the shell, and He is the life within the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The shell needs to die so that the life within it may live.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, when we die, Christ lives.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We die to live Him, and He lives by our dying.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This word about Christ s living in us as a result of our dying may be called a heavenly logic or a spiritual philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This kind of philosophy is much better than any natural, human philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our philosophy is that we die so that Christ may live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to this heavenly logic, Christ lives through our dying.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ living in us through our dying is a matter of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul says, To know Him and the power of His resurrection Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot know Christ without knowing the power of His resurrection, because the very Christ we live today is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Resurrection is the pneumatic Christ who is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Walking According to the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>as the Reality of Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>More than forty years ago, Brother Nee told us that the reality of resurrection is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although he did not explain much what it means to say that the Spirit is the reality of resurrection, I was deeply impressed by his word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I was also troubled by it and said to myself, How can we say that the Spirit is the reality of resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After years of study and experience, I can testify that resurrection, the pneumatic Christ, and the life-giving Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This Christ is the resurrection, and this resurrection is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because the Spirit is the reality of resurrection, we need to walk according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we walk according to the Spirit, we walk in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we walk by the life-giving Spirit, we walk with the living Christ, and this living Christ is the Christ in resurrection.</S>
