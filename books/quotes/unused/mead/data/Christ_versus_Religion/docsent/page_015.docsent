   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE WAY TO REST Scripture Reading: Matt 11:18-19, 25-30; 12:1-14, 38-42</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen the matter of the Bridegroom with four new things in Matthew chapter 9.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to chapters 11 and 12.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The bridegroom is the most pleasant person that anyone could deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How pleasant it is to deal with our Bridegroom!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That is our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapter 9 tells us how to be pleasant, while here in chapters 11 and 12 we learn how to obtain genuine rest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the passages in Matthew chapters 11 and 12 are closely connected.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Notice the words "At that time" in chapter 11, verse 25 King James Version .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Throughout the entire Bible, little words like these are very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's Word is very economical there are no wasted words.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us consider the words in chapter 11, verse 25, "At that time."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At what time?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the time Jesus said that John came neither eating nor drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The religious people said that John had a demon, and that the Son of man, because He came both eating and drinking, was a glutton and a winebibber Matt 11:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then "at that time" Christ sounded out His call: "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" v. 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Following chapter 11, in the first verse of chapter 12, we again encounter the same three words, "At that time."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At what time?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the time Jesus sounded His call, at the time Jesus invited people to come unto Him and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Following this passage at the beginning of chapter 12, we come to verse 38, which opens with a little word, "Then."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All these little words join all the portions in these two chapters together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may say, therefore, that these two chapters are one whole, showing us one thing how to find rest.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Would you find full enjoyment?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Would you be pleasant?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then be in the presence of the pleasant One; be in the presence of the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as we have our Lord Jesus, our Bridegroom, with us, we cannot but rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now from all these portions in chapters 11 and 12, we see something more we see how to find rest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christians are accustomed to quoting Matthew 11:28, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden...," but they usually quote and use these verses in an isolated way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to put all the passages of these two chapters together in order to find the way to rest.</S>
