   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The condition of the assembly is really good now.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There were more than seventy in one table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, the point is not how many people there are, but the godliness displayed in the worship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By this we know that God is among us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I left Hsieh-Ho Hospital on July 1 of last year.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am clear that it was God's will for me to leave.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thank the Lord for preserving us and gracing us to this day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before we received The Open Door, the Lord had given us some light concerning how the localities should meet by themselves and how the local brothers and sisters should bear the spiritual and practical responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the only way to have real growth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thank the Lord that His light shined more clearly on us when we received this issue of The Open Door.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can only rely on Him and ask Him to lead the localities into His grace.</S>
