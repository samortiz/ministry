This is the reason the Lord requires His church to forsake everything for the gospel (cf. Mark 8:34-35; 10:29). Our primary occupation is preaching the gospel; we do not preach the gospel "on the side." Perhaps some among us had great ambitions to be prominent, to be famous industrialists, musicians, engineers, or doctors before they were saved and before they handed themselves over. Now that they have handed themselves over, their ambition has to change. From now on they have to strive to please the Lord (2 Cor. 5:9). This does not mean that they can no longer be a doctor, engineer, or musician, but it does mean that they should be satisfied with just food, clothing, and a dwelling. The gospel is our proper occupation. All other works are sidelines. We do not seek promotions in this world as far as our position or profession is concerned. We are here to promote the gospel. We should have an occupation on the side because both the Bible and the government say that we should work.</p><p>Nevertheless, the gospel should always remain our primary occupation. Everything should be for the gospel. The first thing we should consider when we interview for a job is not how much it pays, but whether or not this work will profit the gospel. If it does, we should take it even if it means accepting a lower position. If we work in a place and can only make a hundred dollars a month, other families will make up any lack. The gospel is not an individual enterprise. We must work in coordination. In the future the responsible brothers have to take the initiative to fellowship with the brothers and sisters about their schools and occupations. In the past we paid attention to what profited the individual the most. We paid attention to remuneration; now we must pay attention to coordination. The brothers and sisters have to fellowship with the church about all their moves. We should make the gospel our primary occupation. We should not preach the gospel haphazardly. Instead, we should preach resolutely, systematically, and deliberately. Wherever we are, we have to make the gospel our top priority.</p><p>I must repeat that consecration is not a matter of handing over some material possessions. We expect all the brothers and sisters to put their occupation, time, future, schooling, and place of residence under the direction of the gospel. We should pay any price to do what is profitable for the gospel.</p><p>Presently, Shanghai is preparing to send a hundred brothers to Nanchang. About two hundred families have already moved to Yi-Yang. This is like moving a whole church to a new place for the gospel. It is easy to speak of, but once one gets into the matter, he will discover all the difficulties that must be faced. How many people should be moved? How much do they need? How many dwellings should be prepared? All of these require careful consideration. This is not a work that eight or ten people can accomplish. In Yi-Yang the gospel has spread to over ten counties. If some can migrate to Nanchang, I believe God will greatly bless us and will add groups of people to us.</p><p>We have been in Hong Kong for decades. What is our condition compared to Yi-Yang? The brothers and sisters in Hong Kong may be more eloquent in preaching, but the brothers and sisters in Yi-Yang have the increase; they know what they are doing. All who have migrated to Yi-Yang have uprooted themselves from their background; they have handed over everything and have relocated in an absolute way. I hope that none will misunderstand us. When we say that we should hand our possessions over, we are only touching the negative side of the matter. This is just a basic and fundamental requirement. Our real goal is to coordinate with others. If we have no heart to hand ourselves over for the coordination, we can continue to be rich while others remain poor. May the Lord grant the church in Hong Kong the grace to give itself to the gospel in an absolute way. This is the meaning of Philippians 1:27, which speaks of striving together with one soul with the faith of the gospel. This is what many other places have done. If we are desperate every day, a great part of China will be evangelized within a year. In a few years, we can spread the gospel to other parts of the world.</p><p>The situation in Nanking is very good at present. The opportunity for the gospel is unprecedented. Although many people have left, many others have been added. Not only have the original ones handed themselves over; even the new ones have handed themselves over. They are asking for the regions outside and around Nanking be given to them as well. I know you receive news here: The number of attendants in every locality is increasing in multiples, not simply percentages. When some move away, more are added.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY BEING TO HAND ONESELF OVER ABSOLUTELY</h2><p>I hope that Hong Kong can be absolute in this matter this time. Once it becomes absolute, it can spread the gospel to the southern part of China and move out to southeast Asia. We hope that everyone would be for the gospel, including those who have a job, who are in school, and who are working at home as housewives. No brother or sister should be a spectator or a bystander. Everyone should jump off the diving board. If the more mature and advanced ones take the absolute way, the ones who have a heart to serve will follow. The deeper we prepare the channel, the more the water will flow. The more violent, absolute, and strict we are, the more others will want to serve the Lord in sincerity. The more convenience we give others, the less they will come. Either we should not do this at all, or we should do it in an absolute way. The most foolish thing to be is a halfhearted Christian. The Lord's intention is different from our thoughts. We care for our money; our eyes are always on our money. This is the reason we cannot be happy Christians.</p><p>May the Lord make us clear concerning the truth that is being released here. May this burden increase more and more. The Lord came to cast a fire upon the earth. At that time He could not say that the fire was cast. I hope that He can say that the fire has been cast today. This is the only way to have an unhindered and unimpeded future. This is the only way to take the fire to the uttermost part of the earth. Today many places have caught fire. I hope that Hong Kong will catch fire as well.</p><p>The Lord will gain His way only when we have handed ourselves over in an absolute way. I hope that we will offer ourselves to God in an absolute way. We should consecrate ourselves to Him and offer up everything for the gospel's sake. If the church does not exist for the gospel, what is it here for? Is it wrong for the whole Body to offer itself up to the Lord? The Lord will have a way only when the whole Body has offered itself up. Only then will the gospel have a way, and only then will the church have a way to go on.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_075.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_077.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 76</div><br></body></html>
