 <h2 class="head3">It Enables Man to Labor and Strive</h2>
<p>The Apostle Paul said: &ldquo;His grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:10). We know this was true because he labored more abundantly than all the other apostles. Yet he says, &ldquo;Not I, but the grace of God which was with me.&rdquo; He could labor more abundantly than others, not because his body was stronger, nor because he was more diligent than others, but because the grace of God was with him. He says further, &ldquo;Whom we announce, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full grown in Christ; for which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power&rdquo; (Col. 1:28-29). The word &ldquo;power&rdquo; in verse 29 can also be translated &ldquo;exploding power.&rdquo; In other words, what God was operating inwardly was an exploding power; hence, what Paul was working outwardly was also an exploding power. The Apostle Paul worked, not because he was energetic in himself, but because within him there was an exploding power. This exploding power exploded continually within him, enabling him to labor diligently and to struggle to bring all men before God perfect in Christ. This exploding power is the power of the working of God&rsquo;s life! It is the power of this life which enables us to labor diligently and to strive in our work.</p>
<p>To labor more abundantly and to strive or struggle prove both the inner grace and the power of the inner life. This indicates that God gives us grace, not to make us those who appreciate spirituality, nor that we might enjoy our own spirituality, but that we may be more diligent, laboring and striving more than others. If anyone says that he is the Lord&rsquo;s servant, and yet continues to love himself, to be lazy, and not to work, then he is not only slothful, he is also surely evil (Matt. 25:26). This kind of servant is condemned by the Lord. Therefore, we must not talk about empty doctrines. We must look to God that we may live out His grace and manifest His power.</p>
<h2 class="head3">It Enables Man to Have<br />
a Living and Fresh Service</h2>
<p>Before considering how this life enables us to have a living and fresh service, let us read three passages. The first is 2 Corinthians 3:5-6: &ldquo;Not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God; who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second is Romans 7:6: &ldquo;But now we are discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, that we should serve as slaves in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third passage is Romans 2:28-29: &ldquo;For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither the circumcision which is outward in the flesh: but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter, whose praise is not from men, but from God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These three passages of Scripture show that there is a great difference between the service of the new covenant and that of the old. Service in the old covenant was of the letter, but service in the new covenant is of the spirit. The service of the old covenant was old, but the service of the new covenant is fresh. The service of the old covenant killed, but the service of the new covenant gives life. In other words, the service in the old covenant was according to the written letter, commandment after commandment. It was a service according to form. But the service in the new covenant is according to the Spirit. In the new covenant the Spirit dictates how man should act, and he acts accordingly; the Spirit dictates how man should speak, and he speaks accordingly; the Spirit tells man how to pray, and he prays in that way.</p>
<p>We may say that the service of the old covenant was outward, while the service of the new covenant is inward. The service of &ldquo;the letter&rdquo; in the old covenant resulted only in death, while the service of &ldquo;the spirit&rdquo; in the new covenant results in giving man life. In other words, the service which is by &ldquo;the letter&rdquo; is dead, while the service which is by &ldquo;the letter&rdquo; is old, but service which is based on living &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo; is alive. Service which is according to &ldquo;the letter&rdquo; is old, but service which is the result of living &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo; is fresh. Service which is according to &ldquo;the letter&rdquo; is only in letters, but service which comes from living &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo; is spiritual.</p>
<p>We can say then that any kind of service which is outward, according to the letter, and in oldness, is the service of the old covenant. But any service which is inward, according to the spirit, and in newness, is the service of the new covenant. Any service which comes from copying or imitating something outward is not the service of the new covenant. The service of the new covenant is something which is the result of having a relationship with Christ and is worked out from within. The service of the new covenant is spiritual, of revelation, and in newness. The service of the new covenant is of God, through God, and to God (Rom. 11:36). The strength of service is of Him, the course of service is through Him, and the result of service is unto Him. This is spiritual service. This is living service, and this is the new covenant service.</p>
<p>Paul says, &ldquo;Not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God; who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:5-6). God was working in them to such an extent that they were enabled to become ministers of the new covenant, that is, they became the serving ones under the new covenant. Paul also said, &ldquo;Of which I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God, which was given to me according to the operation of His power&rdquo; (Eph. 3:7). Paul said clearly that his becoming a minister of the gospel was according to the gift of God&rsquo;s grace. This gift was not tongues, nor was it visions, miracles, wonders, healing, or casting out of demons&mdash;although Paul had all of these gifts (see 1 Cor. 14:18; Acts 13:9-11; 14:8-10; 16:9, 16-18; 18:9). Neither was this gift excellency of speech or of wisdom (1 Cor. 2:1). This gift was not something which came down suddenly out of heaven. Paul says very clearly that this gift was given to him according to the operation of God&rsquo;s power. It was not a miraculous gift, but a gift of grace. It came through the power of God&rsquo;s operation in Paul. This gift enabled Paul to &ldquo;preach to the nations the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel, and to bring to light what is the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, Who created all things&rdquo; (Eph. 3:8-9). This gift is marvelous! This marvelous gift was given to him according to the power of God&rsquo;s operation.</p>
