   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SHINING AS LUMINARIES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 15 Paul says that we shine as lights in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Greek word rendered lights denotes luminaries which reflect the light of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As children of God with the divine life and nature, we have a special function the function of shining.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because we have the divine life and nature, we have become luminaries reflecting Christ as the real sun.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever we cooperate with God s inward operation according to the divine life and nature, we shine with the light of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the fourth aspect of the divine and rich provision for constant salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE WORD OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fifth aspect is found in the phrase holding forth the word of life v. 16 . In 1:19 we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and in 2:16 we have the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Between them we have the pattern of salvation with the standard, the operating God, the divine life with the divine nature, and the function of reflecting the light of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What a tremendous provision!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With such a rich provision we can be saved constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We thank the Lord for two great gifts the Spirit and the Word, the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every child of God must learn how to get into the Word of God by the divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is to contact the Scripture by exercising our spirit to touch the indwelling God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such contact, based on the divine life and nature, is very different from reading the Bible merely with the exercise of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some Christians analyze the Bible purely in a mental way, others emphasize the memorization of Bible verses, and still others, especially those with seminary training, expound the Word in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we approach the Bible only in these ways, we shall not touch the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, to us the Bible will be a book of knowledge, doctrine, teaching, and theology.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because we have been regenerated of the Spirit, we have the divine life, the divine nature, and even the divine Person, God Himself, dwelling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we need to exercise our spirit whenever we come to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do this, every line, phrase, and word of the Bible will become life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because everything related to God is living, God s words must be living words, words of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we come to the Bible with a living spirit, spontaneously we shall enjoy the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we shall be supplied, strengthened, quickened, enlightened, refreshed, nourished, and washed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we experience the word of life in this way, we should hold forth the word to others, presenting it, offering it, and applying it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is to speak the word of life to those around us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Far from being subdued by opposers, we should in love speak the word of life to them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By speaking the word of life, we present the word of life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should be a speaking people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever we have opportunity, we should speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Preaching is not our profession; it is our living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to enter into the word of life in such a living way that we live by this word and speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By holding forth the word of life in this way we enjoy constant salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this message we have covered five aspects of the divine and rich provision for our constant salvation: the pattern with its standard, the inward operation of God, the children of God, the luminaries, and the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we enjoy all these aspects, we shall experience constant salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The One who set up the pattern and who Himself is the pattern now operates in us as the indwelling God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through regeneration, we have become children of God with the divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This makes us luminaries with the function of reflecting Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, we have the word of life, and we may enter into this word, enjoy its riches, and declare it to those around us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this way the negative things are defeated, and we enjoy the victory of constant salvation.</S>
