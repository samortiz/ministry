[1]  The Mystery of God and the Mystery of Christ CONTENTS
[2]  The Body of Christ Being the Increase of Christ and the Genuine Church Life Being the Manifestation of Christ Himself
[3]  At the opening of this message we would like to consider several key verses from the New Testament.
[4]  Ephesians 1:9-10 says, Making known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself, unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.
[5]  Chapter three verses 9 through 11 say, And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[6]  To our limited human knowledge, understanding, and senses, God is a mystery.
[7]  We believe in God, but we have never seen Him.
[8]  All the riches, all the divine nature, and all the fullness of the Godhead dwell bodily in Christ v. 9 . Christ embodies everything that God is and everything that God has.
[9]  The Gospel of John begins with Christ as the Word and proceeds to reveal that Christ is the Lamb, the way, the reality, the life, the resurrection, the Spirit, the bread of life, the living water, the good Shepherd, the door, the vine tree, another Comforter, the Bridegroom, our habitation, the light, the love, the Son of God, the Son of Man, and many other items.
[10]  We can know who God is because He is manifested in Christ, with Christ, and through Christ.
[11]  In this message we would like to consider several of the major verses found in the four chapters of the book of Colossians.
[12]  Colossians 1:13-19 says, Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins; who is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation, because in Him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him.
[13]  All things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ.
[14]  Moreover, this life, which is hidden with Christ in God, is Christ, and this Christ, with whom our life is hidden in God, is our life.
[15]  Not only should we express Christ in common words and ordinary speech, but we should have psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs that are full of the expression of Christ, full of the language of Christ and the word of Christ.
[16]  If we consider all these passages from the book of Colossians we can see that there is a sequence and a particular line of thought throughout the book from chapter one to chapter four.
[17]  What is unable to be understood in God, can be understood in Christ; what cannot be seen in God, can be seen in Christ; and what cannot be apprehended and realized in God, can be apprehended and realized in Christ.
[18]  The fourth point in the apostle Paul s line of thought is that Christ is our life.
[19]  In the past we may have realized that Christ is our life, but did we realize that the Christ who is our life is such a Christ?
[20]  This Christ, who is so much to God, to the old creation, and to the new creation, is our life.
[21]  This is why we must walk in Him, live in Him, take hold of Him, and beware of being captured away from Christ by anything else.
[22]  AS THE MYSTERY OF GOD IN COLOSSIANS 2 Scripture Reading: Col 1:9-13; 2:6-7 FILLED WITH THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF HIS WILL IN ALL SPIRITUAL WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING
[23]  In this message we will base our fellowship on Colossians 1:9-13.
[24]  These verses say, Therefore we also, since the day we heard of it, do not cease praying and asking on your behalf that you may be filled with the full knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, to walk worthily of the Lord to please Him in all things, bearing fruit in every good work and growing by the full knowledge of God, being empowered with all power, according to the might of His glory, unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy, giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light; who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.
[25]  First we know and then we walk, but in order to walk we also need to be strengthened.
[26]  He prayed that the saints would be filled with the knowledge of God s eternal plan, that is, that they would have the revelation of the mystery of God, which is Christ Himself, so that they would walk according to this revelation by being strengthened.
[27]  In this message we will consider the experience of Christ as the mystery of God in Colossians 2:6-7: As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him, and being established in the faith even as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.
[28]  These two verses contain four very important expressions received the Christ, walk in Him, having been rooted, and being built up.
[29]  One day, however, I read a book written by Brother Watchman Nee which equated believing in Christ with receiving Christ John 1:12 .
[30]  I saw that to believe in Christ is to receive Christ as the Spirit into our spirit.
[31]  Colossians 2:6 tells us that we have received Christ and that we should walk in Him; verse 7 reveals that we also have been rooted in Him.
[32]  The fact that we have been rooted in Christ reveals that we have a very particular kind of unity and identification with Him.
[33]  We have been planted in Him in the way of life, and as such, we draw all our nourishment and supply from Him, just as a plant draws all its nourishment and supply from the soil.
[34]  Do we realize that we have been rooted in Christ?
[35]  All these items mentioned in Colossians receiving Christ, walking in Christ, and being rooted in Christ reveal Christ to us.
[36]  The fact that we have received Christ reveals that Christ to us is our life; the fact that we must walk in Christ unveils that Christ is also our kingdom He is the realm in which we live and walk; the fact that we have been rooted in Christ indicates that Christ is our soil the source from which we draw all of our nourishment and supply.
[37]  In our natural state we are not the material with which the church is built.
[38]  In our natural state we are not stones, we are merely clay.
[39]  The more we live Christ and experience Christ, the more Christ grows within us; and the more Christ grows within us, the more we are transformed from clay into stone.
[40]  As those who have received Christ, we must learn to take Christ as our life and allow the life of Christ to increase within us day by day.
[41]  Our experience of Christ, the growth of the life of Christ within us, and the mingling of Christ Himself with us cause us to become material that is suitable for God s building.
[42]  Since we have received Christ as our life and all, we must walk in Him as our kingdom, our spiritual sphere, and since we have been rooted in Christ, we must grow up in Him in order to be built together with others to be the house of God.
[43]  CHAPTER FIVE REALIZING THAT WE ARE NOTHING AND EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS EVERYTHING
[44]  BY BEING BROUGHT THROUGH SUFFERINGS Scripture Reading: Col 2:11-12, 20; 3:1-5, 9-11 GOD S PLAN THAT CHRIST BE EVERYTHING TO US
[45]  In eternity past God made a plan concerning what He would do in the times and generations of the ages.
[46]  He planned to make Christ the center and Head of all creation.
[47]  As such, He is the faithful image of the invisible God and the Firstborn of all creation 1:15 , the Firstborn from the dead and the Head of the Body, which is the church v. 18 , the portion from God to us v. 12 , and even the kingdom v. 13 . We can share Christ, receive Christ, and walk in Christ.
[48]  Not only has God planned that Christ would be our life and everything, but He has also made Christ to be the reality of all positive things in the universe.
[49]  To apply Christ in everything we do and to experience Christ as everything to us we need not only the revelation of who Christ is, we also need to be brought to our end. In Paul s short Epistle to the Colossians, he refers to this numerous times.
[50]  He says that we are dead 2:20; 3:3 , that we have been buried 2:12 , that we have to put off the old man 3:9 , and that we have been circumcised 2:11 .
[51]  We have to be out, so that Christ can come in; we have to be dethroned, so that Christ can be crowned; and we have to be brought to our end, so that Christ can be everything to us.
[52]  Thus, as vessels made for the purpose of containing Christ, we must be emptied of everything that is not Christ before we can be filled with Christ.
[53]  We may realize that God s intention is to make Christ everything to us and that we have been crucified with Christ, yet we must admit that we are still very living.
[54]  What must God do to bring us to the point where we are able to be filled with Christ, to apply Christ in everything we do, and to take Christ as our life and everything?
[55]  CHAPTER SIX EXPERIENCING CHRIST PROGRESSIVELY, CONTACTING CHRIST AS THE SPIRIT,
[56]  AND APPLYING CHRIST AS THE SENSE OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Gal 1:16; 2:20; 4:19; Eph 3:17-19; 4:13; John 6:63; Rom 8:2, 9-11; 2 Cor 3:17-18; 1 Cor 12:3 CHRIST AS THE MYSTERY OF GOD
[57]  IN GOD S ETERNAL PLAN Christ Being Our Life and Everything
[58]  Christ is God the Creator, the Firstborn of creation, the means of creation, and the center and Head of all that has been created.
[59]  This is the Christ whom God intends would be our life and everything, and this is the Christ whom we have received.
[60]  Galatians 1:16a says, To reveal His Son in me, and 2:20a states, I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.
[61]  The first verse speaks of Christ being revealed in us, and the second verse speaks of Christ living in us.
[62]  Ephesians 3:17a speaks of Christ making His home in our hearts: That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.
[63]  Together these verses reveal five stages of our progressive experience of Christ Christ is revealed in us, Christ lives in us, Christ is formed in us, Christ makes His home in us, and Christ s measure becomes our measure.
[64]  God s desire is that Christ would be revealed in us, live in us, and increase and expand within us to the extent that Christ would be formed within us.
[65]  Since Christ is the image of the invisible God, and man was created according to the image of God, we can say that man was created according to Christ.
[66]  Only when Christ is formed within us by expanding and increasing into every part of our being, can He make His home in our hearts; and only when Christ has made His home in our hearts, will we have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[67]  The Lord who lives within us is the Spirit.
[68]  This Spirit is the Spirit of the Lord, the Lord Spirit, and the Spirit of Christ.
[69]  Christ is life, and the Spirit is the Spirit of life in our spirit in order to make Christ real to us as life.
[70]  IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE REALITY Scripture Reading: Col 2:11-12, 20; 3:1-5a, 9-11 SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE DEPENDING ON REVELATION
[71]  When we love the Lord with our heart, something happens in our spirit.
[72]  If we do not have the full knowledge and revelation of Christ in God s plan, we will never be able to have the real experience of Christ being our life in our daily living.
[73]  After seeing that Christ is our life, the second aspect of the revelation that we must see is that we are dead, buried, and finished.
[74]  We died with Christ on the cross on the day that Christ died, and we were buried on the day that we were baptized Rom 6:6; Col 2:12 .
[75]  If you want to know God and contact God, you have to be in Christ, because everything of God is embodied in Christ and Christ is the mystery of God.
[76]  Thus, if you would like to meet Christ, know Christ, and receive something of Christ, you must contact the Body of Christ, the church.
[77]  The Body of Christ, which is the Body of this universal man, is the increase of Christ.
[78]  The Body of Christ is simply the enlargement of Christ, Christ increased.
[79]  In Genesis 2, after Adam had been created, God said, It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper as his counterpart v. 18 . Then God brought all the animals and birds before him.
[80]  The only way for us to have the real church life is for us to be transformed from the natural man into the new man, the spiritual man.
[81]  When there are a group of believers who know how to experience the cross of Christ and the resurrection of Christ, they are the real church life, a functioning church, and the living Body of Christ.
[82]  CHAPTER NINE THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST AND THE RELATEDNESS OF
[83]  We all must realize that God s heart s desire is the Body of Christ.
[84]  Now I wish to ask you, why has the Lord regenerated you?
[85]  How much we are related to the other members is not only a proof of how much we have been built up, but it is also a test of how much we have been transformed, because the more we are transformed, the more we will be united with and related to others.
[86]  For example, suppose that an American brother and a Chinese brother are placed together.
[87]  They are both already in Christ, but one is in Christ with a Chinese mind, and the other is in Christ with an American mind.
