<p>God&rsquo;s intention in His creation of man was that man would take Him in and express Him. Taking in God and expressing God should be man&rsquo;s joy and amusement. Man&rsquo;s happiness and entertainment must be God Himself, and this is not an objective God, but a subjective God. To take God in and to live God out is man&rsquo;s joy. We should not blame people for desiring amusement, for God created man with the need for enjoyment. The reason we hunger for food day by day is that we were created with the need to eat. It is impossible to be filled up once with food and never to be hungry again. No, we must eat afresh every day. God created us in this way. In the same principle, God created man with the need for amusement. But our amusement must be God Himself. Because people have lost God, they seek entertainment by going to the movies, theater, and various sporting events. They have not found the fulfillment of their need for entertainment in God Himself. God Himself is the unique fulfillment of our need for entertainment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LOSING AND SAVING OF THE SOUL</h2>
<p>All the amusements people seek outside of God are for the satisfaction of the soul. When they listen to music or enjoy certain sports, they are happy. Many in Hong Kong like to play Mah-Jongg. To them, that is the best entertainment and enjoyment. Any Christian who still plays Mah-Jongg is one who is saving his soul. Anyone who has been regenerated in his spirit but still plays Mah-Jongg will eventually lose his soul at the Lord&rsquo;s coming. For him to refrain from playing Mah-Jongg is to cause his soul to suffer. Nevertheless, such a Christian needs to lose his soul in the matter of playing Mah-Jongg. If he does not lose it now, he will lose it when the Lord comes back. The Lord will say to him, &ldquo;Because you saved your soul so much, now you must lose it.&rdquo; Now we can understand that what the Bible means by losing the soul is for the soul to lose its enjoyment. Moreover, to save the soul is to preserve the soul in its enjoyment.</p>
<p>If man had expressed God on earth, God would have been able to recover the earth. Then both man and God would have enjoyed the earth. God would have been happy, and we would have been happy also. However, man did not cooperate with God. Thus, God did not have a way to recover the earth. Rather, He Himself has even been rejected by the earth. When He came in the flesh, He was rejected. This present age, the age of the church, is the age of the world&rsquo;s rejection of Christ. Because Christ has been rejected, at present He has no joy on this earth. As His followers, we share His destiny. Our destiny as followers of the Lord Jesus is not to be welcomed by this world; instead, it is to be rejected. Therefore, this age is not the time for us to have enjoyment for our soul; it is the time for us to lose this enjoyment. When the Lord Jesus comes back, that will be the time for Him to enjoy the earth. Satan will be bound, Christ will recover the earth, and the entire earth will be under His reign. At that time Christ will enjoy the earth, and all His followers will participate in this enjoyment. This is the meaning of Matthew 25:21 and 23, both of which say, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your lord.&rdquo; This will take place during the millennium when the Lord Jesus will reclaim the earth and enjoy it. By repossessing the earth, the Lord will have enjoyment. Then He will ask His followers, His partners, to enter into His joy. This will be the saving of our soul. In order to have the enjoyment in the coming age, we need to pay the price in this age by losing our soul. We need to say, &ldquo;Lord, for Your sake I don&rsquo;t want to have so much pleasure or amusement.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LOVE OF THE WORLD</h2>
<p>After speaking of denying the self, taking up the cross, and losing the soul, the Lord referred to the world, saying, &ldquo;For what shall a man be profited if he should gain the whole world, but forfeit his soul-life? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?&rdquo; (Matt. 16:26). People love the world simply because it gives amusement to their soul. They love good clothing, fine cars, and worldly amusements because they bring enjoyment to the soul. But for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, for the gospel&rsquo;s sake, and for His testimony&rsquo;s sake, we need to be willing to lose the enjoyment of the soul in this age. Are you willing to lose your soulish enjoyment for the Lord&rsquo;s sake? The reason people love the world is that they want to maintain the enjoyment of the soul. Throughout the world there is the enjoyment of the soul. The reason people study to earn a degree is to have a better life, and a better life means more enjoyment. Others work to earn a promotion in their job that they may have more money for more enjoyment of the soul. When the Lord Jesus came, He lost His soul, that is, He gave up all His soulish enjoyment. He lost the enjoyment of His soul in this age so that He might gain His soul in the coming age. As we have seen, in the coming age the Lord Jesus will enjoy the whole earth. At that time He will invite us, His partners, to share in this enjoyment. We need to wait patiently for the coming enjoyment. If you keep the enjoyment in your soul today, you will lose the enjoyment to come. When some hear this, they may say, &ldquo;My economy is practical. I care for the present, not for the future.&rdquo; The choice is yours. If you prefer to have your enjoyment today, you are free to do so. But if you save your soul in this age, be assured that you will lose it when the Lord comes back. He will tell you that because you have enjoyed your soul so much, now is the time for you to lose it. Which do you choose&mdash;to lose your soul today and gain it tomorrow, or to gain it today and lose it tomorrow? If we could gain the whole world, it would still not be worthwhile to gain it at the cost of losing our soul.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
