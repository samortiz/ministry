   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>IN THE WORSHIP OF GOD Scripture Reading: Dan 6</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Daniel 6 is very crucial because it shows us how God carries out His economy with His elect for Christ's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God desires to carry out His economy, but man is needed to pray for His economy on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God carries out His economy on the earth through His faithful channels of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Satan's strategy is to frustrate the prayer which is for God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, the center of this chapter is man's prayer for the carrying out of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's move is like a train which must have rails for its move.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man's prayers are like the rails which pave the way for God's move to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no other way to bring God's economy into fullness and into fulfillment except by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the inner secret of this chapter.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OF GOD'S ELECT IN MEDO-PERSIA</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Daniel 5:31 says, "Darius the Mede received the kingdom at about the age of sixty-two."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It pleased him to set up over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps a Persian loan- word meaning "protectors of the kingdom" , who would be throughout the whole kingdom 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Daniel was set by King Darius to be one of the three chief ministers over these one hundred and twenty satraps v. 2 . Daniel distinguished himself among the chief ministers and satraps, and the king considered setting him over the whole kingdom v. 3 . By this time, Daniel was no longer a young overcomer but had become an older overcomer; he may have been close to one hundred years of age.</S>
