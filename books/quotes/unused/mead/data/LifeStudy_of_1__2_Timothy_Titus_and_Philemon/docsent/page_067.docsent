   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY MESSAGE EIGHT THE ISSUE OF THE DECLINE Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 4:9-22</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider from 4:9-22 the issue of the decline of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. LOVING THE PRESENT AGE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 4:9 Paul says to Timothy, "Be diligent to come to me quickly."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a loving and intimate word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul could write such a word only to one who was very close to him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Timothy was close to Paul and intimate with him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 10 we find the reason Paul charged Timothy to come to him quickly: "For Demas has forsaken me, having loved the present age, and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Loving the present age, the world now before our eyes, is in contrast to loving the Lord's appearing, mentioned in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The world, the cosmos, is composed of many ages.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It seems that every decade is a different age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The present age is the world which surrounds us, attracts us, and tempts us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Demas was one who loved the present age.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some believe that Demas came from Thessalonica and that this was the reason he went to Thessalonica after forsaking Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But whether or not he was a native of that city, it is certain that he went there because he loved the world and forsook the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 10 is difficult to understand because the predicate "has gone" governs not only Demas, but also Crescens and Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that Demas had gone to Thessalonica, Crescens had gone to Galatia, and Titus had gone to Dalmatia.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Does this indicate that Titus, like Demas, left Paul in a negative way?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If it were not for the fact that the name of Titus is presented positively in the New Testament, I would understand this verse to say that Demas, Crescens, and Titus all left Paul in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At least, I would take it to mean that Crescens and Titus took their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, I find it difficult to believe that Titus would leave Paul in a negative way, especially after he had received from Paul an epistle addressed to him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After Paul had been arrested and imprisoned the second time, Titus visited him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although I find it hard to believe that he forsook Paul, it is nonetheless a fact that he is categorized with Demas in verse 10.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Did Paul send Crescens to Galatia and Titus to Dalmatia?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not know for sure if they were sent by Paul or if they went on their own initiative.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 11 Paul says, "Luke alone is with me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for the ministry."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fact that Paul says that Luke alone is with him may indicate that Titus left either in a negative way or in a neutral way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Demas forsook Paul because he loved the present age; Titus may have left him for some other reason.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because Paul was suffering as a prisoner in Rome, none of his co-workers should have left him for any reason unless they were sent by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They should have remained there with Paul to strengthen him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul's word about bringing Mark also indicates that he needed helpers to strengthen him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ultimately we must leave to the Lord the question of whether Titus was sent by Paul to Dalmatia or went there on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 12 says, "Now Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is difficult to decide how to translate the first word in this sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We could use now, but, yet, or and.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I prefer to use either but or yet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It seems that Paul is saying, "Although I need helpers and although I need you to come quickly and bring Mark with you, yet I have still sent Tychicus to Ephesus."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although we may have difficulty deciding how to render the Greek word at the beginning of this sentence, we can still praise the Lord that there was a church in Ephesus, that Paul could send a brother there, and that there was a brother willing to be sent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thank the Lord for such a sending!</S>
