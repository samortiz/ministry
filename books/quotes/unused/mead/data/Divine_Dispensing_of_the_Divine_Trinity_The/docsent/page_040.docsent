   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AS THE SOURCE, THE INITIATOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Father is the very source, the initiator, because the Son came out from Him John 7:29; 16:27b .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 16:27 the Lord Jesus said, You have loved Me and have believed that I came out from God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It does not only say that I came from Him, but that I came out from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Son came out of a source, and that source was the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So the Father is the source, and He is the initiator.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is even the initiation, the origination.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The entire universe was initiated in this initiation, who is a divine Person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>SENDING THE SON</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This source, this initiator, sent the Son John 5:24, 30, 36-38; 13:20; 14:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are two Greek words used for the English word sent, one of which means to be sent with a special commission.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that the source, the Father, sent the Son as an envoy with a special commission.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Son was sent by the Father with a particular commission to do three main categories of things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To Condemn Sin in the Likeness</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>of the Flesh of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First of all, the Father sent the Son to take away sin, to condemn sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And in order to do this, according to 2 Corinthians 5:21, the Son, who knew no sin, even became sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, He became only the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not have the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is clearly illustrated by the brass serpent in John 3:14.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The brass serpent did bear the form and appearance and likeness of a real serpent, but it did not have the poisonous nature of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 8:3 says that the law was impossible in that it was weak through the flesh, so God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is just like the brass serpent being in the likeness of a poisonous serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Son was sent in the likeness of the flesh of sin to condemn sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sin has been condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sin is something which is in the universe among the human race, but it has been condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The divine government has condemned sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You don t need to be bothered by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the law became a failure, God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin to condemn sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the meaning of John 1:29: Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sin in this verse is in the singular number, and the world here means mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Son of God was sent by the Father to accomplish such a commission, that is, to solve the problem of sin, to take away sin, to condemn sin through His death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To Be a Propitiation Concerning Our Sins</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only do we have sin in our nature, but we also have a lot of sins in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>So God sent His Son to be a propitiation for our sins 1 John 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He has condemned sin in our nature; He has become the propitiation to deal with all our sins, offenses, and trespasses.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every sin, every offense, and every trespass makes a problem between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So between us and God there is a lot of turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the dear Son of God died on the cross for our sins and became the propitiation to calm down every turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To propitiate simply means to make peace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have a problem with God, and you have no way to make peace, but the Son of God became the propitiation to appease God and calm every turmoil between you and God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>So He has condemned sin and calmed down the turmoil caused by our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we have peace with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To Impart the Divine Life into Us</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Son of God was also sent by the Father to impart life into us 1 John 4:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In his one Gospel, John uses three illustrations concerning the death of Christ: the Lamb of God 1:29 , the brass serpent 3:14 , and a grain of wheat 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lamb of God and the brass serpent are for dealing with sin and our sinful nature, but the grain of wheat is for life imparting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The grain of wheat dies in order to produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It dies to impart its life into many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Son has been sent by the Father with such a threefold commission: to take away our sin, to propitiate concerning our sins, and then to impart the divine life into all His believers that they may be born of God.</S>
