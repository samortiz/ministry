   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE ANNULLING OF ETHNIC DISTINCTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Bible there is another distinction between Greeks and Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Jews are a very religious race, whereas the Greeks are a race that embraces philosophy and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Historically, when one speaks of religion, he thinks of the Jews, and when one speaks of philosophy, he thinks of the Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All branches of sciences and philosophy in their primitive form come from the Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today, all scientific terms have their root in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, the Greeks symbolize wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If one wants to talk about science and philosophy, he has to go to the Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If one wants to talk about religion, he has to go to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These are distinctions in ethnicity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>People living in various parts of the world often have their own ethnic characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, those who grow up in the south are more affectionate, while those who grow up in the north are more reserved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Southerners are generally more easygoing, while Northerners are generally more serious.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>People living in tropical regions like to dance and sing all day long, while Northerners, especially the northern Europeans, do not like to even jump.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead they appear reserved and conservative.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the Southerners can be Christians as much as the Northerners can.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jews can be Christians, and Greeks also can be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The wise can be Christians, and the religious can be Christians also.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Christ, there is no distinction between Jew and Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some people like to reason; they want to explain everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Other people like to talk about the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Does that mean that these are two different types of Christians?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the flesh, these two are totally different.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One walks by the intellect and the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Another walks impulsively by feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But in Christ, there is no distinction between the Greeks and the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only are national distinctions gone; even ethnic distinctions are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A reserved person can be just as good a Christian as a warm person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who walk according to the mind can be Christians, and those who walk according to feelings can also be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All kinds of people can be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since all kinds of people can be Christians, one must learn to drop ethnic characteristics when he comes into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no such thing in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many problems arise in the church today because people bring their ethnic flavor into the church; they try to bring in their own distinctive characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the non-talkative people meet, they become a non-talkative group.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the talkative people meet, they become a talkative group.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When those who are reserved come together, they become a reserved group.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When those who are affectionate come together, they become an affectionate group.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this way, many distinctions are built up among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Please remember that ethnicity does not exist in the church, in Christ, or in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not condemn a person just because he has a different temperament than yours.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have to realize that others may not appreciate you that much either.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You may feel that you always speak affectionately and wonder why others are so cold.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But others may think you are talking too much; they may find your disposition intolerable.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whether you are quick or quiet, cold or warm, intellectual or sentimental, as soon as you become a brother and enter the church life, you have to drop your disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such things do not belong to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As soon as you introduce these natural elements into the church, they become standards for judgment and separation, and brothers will be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You will become the standard, and all those who are up to your standard will be considered good Christians, while all those who are not up to your standard will be considered poor Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You will become the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You will introduce your own nature, character, and temperament into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All confusion in the church issues from different human temperaments.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Your silence is not necessarily good, nor is your talkativeness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Your reservation is not necessarily good, nor is your warmth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your strong intellect may not necessarily be good, nor are your intense emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All these are distinctions outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They are represented by the Greeks and the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>None of these natural dispositions can be brought into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A new believer must learn from the beginning to reject anything that comes from the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He should not say, "This is the way I was."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many brothers shamelessly speak this way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must tell them that we do not want their old person.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They should not bring in their old person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>That is not something in Christ, and we cannot create distinctions based on that.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Such distinctions have to be totally abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Christ, in the Body, and in the new man, these distinctions are totally annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>No brother or sister should carry his or her natural disposition into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As soon as you are saved, you have to leave these things behind.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you come to the church and contact the brothers and sisters, approving only those who agree with you and are up to your standard and disapproving those who disagree with you or are not up to your standard, you will bring confusion and division into the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Throughout the years, the church has suffered damage through differences in dispositions.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Never bring your dispositional differences into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some people have a quick disposition, and they may say, "I am quick, and I do not like anyone who is slow.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God does not like those who are slow."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some people are slow by nature, and they may say, "I am steady by nature, and I do not like anyone who is quick."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But neither quickness nor slowness should be in the church life to divide God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The moment you bring these things in, you make yourself the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Greeks want the Jews to repent, and the Jews want the Greeks to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But God wants to set both aside.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is nothing else but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If a new believer upholds this principle from the very beginning, the church will be spared much hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must never discriminate according to our character.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must reject the things that belong to the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We should walk in the same footsteps as all the other children of God.</S>
