   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CROSS IN PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord wants us to take up our cross daily because He wants to cut off our soul-life with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How does the Lord do this?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He allows man's misunderstandings to come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are misunderstood, we always try to reason.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not a sin to try to reason, and the natural life always likes to reason.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But a Christian has to learn a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He has to say to the Lord, "I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When others misunderstand me, I am eager to justify myself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But ven-geance is Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I will not try to justify myself."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we ignore ourselves and allow others to misunderstand us, and if we do not justify ourselves even when we have the chance, our capacity will be increased and God's life will become manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The daily cross is something that eliminates us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all want others to understand what we are doing and appreciate us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet God allows frustrations to come upon us so that He can eliminate us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some people wish that their children would not make noise so they could read their Bible quietly; this would be wonderful for them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But those who genuinely bear the cross endure their children's distractions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once a father and son came and told me that they had countless grievances and that they needed someone to sympathize with them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I said, "There is nothing wrong with what you have just said; saying these things is not a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In fact, you are quite justified in saying these things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the question is whether or not you are bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Please remember that the day you stop bearing the cross is the day that you stop growing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you reject God's word, you stop growing in the eyes of God, even though you may still have a good appearance before men and may still maintain certain kinds of works."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man's greatest suffering is finding his desires unfulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When a person cannot satisfy his desires, he may rebel, disagree, or complain in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if he would lift up his head at that very moment and say to the Lord, "I thank You because this is Your will," his capacity would be increased.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without the cross, all spiritual blessings will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When harsh words, unkind expressions, or unhappy incidents happen at home, a person may weep.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet if he would say to the Lord in tears, "I accept and am satisfied with the things You have permitted to come upon me," he would grow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Madam Guyon said, "Lord, even if You chastise me with a whip, I will still kiss that whip with my mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Miss Barber wrote in one of her hymns: "Let the spirit praise Thee,/Though the heart be riven" Hymns, #377 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was spoken by one who truly knew God and who truly knew the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord has to dig away many unnecessary things in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once the cross stops its work in us, growth and victory will also stop.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man is prone to preserve himself, but the cross is here to strip us of our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The way to be a blessing to others is not by preserving our soul-life, but by losing our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more we lose our soul-life, the more we will become a blessing to others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Mr. Cowman was a person who had deep spiritual experiences in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While he was working in India, the Lord opened his eyes to see that he should be a servant to others, a "heel" to the Body, and that he should happily accept the ugly things that were heaped upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The suffering of the cross is not a suffering of wine mingled with gall.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is a suffering that refuses to avoid pain.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rumors were once circulated about me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At first my natural life could not stand it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I said, "Lord, if I remain silent and do not fight back, I will not be able to do anything."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the Lord showed me Matthew 5:12.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His intention is not only that we should not fight back, but that we should accept these things with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE TONE OF VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Victory has a certain tone.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The tone of victory is thanksgiving and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you cannot give thanks and praise, you have been defeated already.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you are genuinely bearing the cross, you will be able to praise and thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are two kinds of thanksgiving and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One is cheap; it thanks and praises the Lord for His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The other is expensive; it thanks and praises even when the cross is present.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The second kind is better; it is the real offering of thanksgiving and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>An offering is a sacrifice, and a sacrifice is something that brings about a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many times, we have to learn to agree with other brothers and to deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We often have to learn to agree with our enemy and to oppose ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The crucial things about the cross are the dealing with our individual opinions and ideas on the one hand, and the denial of our preferences and desires on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we can overcome our animal life, we will gain God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more we lose, the more we will gain.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we lose our soul-life day after day, we will be on the way to glory day after day, and we will realize that chastisement is a joy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>THE RESULT OF VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>THE ABILITY TO BEAR THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Please remember that victory results in our ability to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we do not have any opinion of our own, if others find it easy to take advantage of us, and if we do not fret while we are being taken advantage of, thanking and praising the Lord instead, we are bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As a wife, husband, teacher, student, servant, or master, there are countless numbers of things that bother and disturb us every day.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to realize that nothing that comes upon us comes by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All these things are crosses that the Lord has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Blessed are those who see God's hand in their environment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Those who avoid the cross are only lovers of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They have not seen God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As a result they miss many blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the past we might not have been able to face the cross, because we were short of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But thank the Lord that we have the strength now, and we can face the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we want to know ourselves, if we want to know sin, and if we want to go on in the way of God's will, we have to learn to stand on the side of those who take advantage of us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have to learn to love our enemies, to pray for those who curse us, and to have our self broken.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have to learn faith, learn to trust and obey, learn to cease fighting against our environment, and learn to submit to all of God's arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Others may find a certain environment frustrating, but for us, everything is working for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Eight or nine years ago, I read a story which rendered me much help.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The story happened in one of the kingdoms in western Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The general of the kingdom staged a rebellion to usurp the throne, and the king led his personal guards to confront the rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He only had three thousand soldiers, while the rebellious army had a hundred thousand men.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When the king saw the general, he called for him to surrender.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The general asked how many soldiers were on the king's side, and whether the king knew how many men were on his side.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The king did not answer, instead he asked one of his guards to jump off from a cliff.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The guard obeyed immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The king asked a second one to jump into the ocean, and he did so accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He then asked a third to draw a sword and kill himself, and this guard also obeyed without question.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When the rebellious general saw this, he was terrified, and he asked how many such men did the king have.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The king answered that every one of his men were this way.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>At that word, the general decided to drop his rebellion and surrendered to the king.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Our God demands that we be those who want nothing for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He wants us to be those who would allow ourselves to be destroyed and trampled under the feet of others.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He wants us to be the obedient ones.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If we are such persons, we are bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We will be those who accept God's arrangements and who do not fight back; our capacity will increase, and God's life will flow out of us in an unhindered way.</S>
