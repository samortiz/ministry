An unworthy child as myself has surprisingly begun caring for adult matters. How can I avoid being in fear and trembling! I can only ask God to provide special care for His leading.</p><p>I have decided to take care of the arrangements in Kueixi. I ask the brothers and sisters who will be coming to be assured.</p><p>From Shanghai I took a detour through Shadi before returning to Yiyang. Because of pressure from many matters, I am very weak physically, and my body temperature has dropped. Although I feel that there will be difficulties in the future, I am not in the least disappointed. I do not lose hope. God will teach me and deal with me through these difficulties.</p><p>God sent us out in the migration first for the purpose of serving brothers and sisters who will migrate later. This is really grace to us. It is a responsibility we should bear. This vision has been seen by most of the brothers and sisters in our group.</p><p>Thank God! In the region of Shadi and Tangnei this fire (of migration) is burning brightly. The brothers and sisters are prepared to submit. They dare not be as slow as they were before.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Feng He-ren<br />January 14, 1950</p><h2 class="head1">NEW GRACE</h2><p>I feel that God is among us. He is leading us step by step. I only want to learn how to serve like Martha and how to fellowship with the Lord like Mary. The day will come when I will spontaneously live out the testimony of resurrection like Lazarus.</p><p>I recently spoke according to the burden of my heart and said some words concerning the consecration of material possessions. Thank the Lord! The brothers and sisters offered up even their prized clothing.</p><p>Yesterday, the responsible brothers and sisters in our group decided that we will eliminate all inequality in our houses. In the matters of food, clothing, and work all will be arranged according to the Body principle. Thank the Lord! He has given us new grace and has caused us to take a way that amazes the world!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Feng He-ren<br />February 7, 1950</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministers & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 51</div><br></body></html>
