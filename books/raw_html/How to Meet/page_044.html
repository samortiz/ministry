 <h2 class="head1">THE ENEMIES REBUKED FROM HIS TEMPLE</h2>
<p>At the end of the Psalm God rebukes His enemies from His temple (vv. 29, 30). In verses 21, 22, and 23, God says that He will smite the head of the enemies and bring them again from the depth of the Red Sea that we may dip our feet in their blood. Not only may we share this victory, but even our dogs may partake of it. O what a victory! Today in the church He has already won the victory. We must enjoy it. If we don&rsquo;t believe He has defeated the Egyptian army and buried them in the depths of the sea, He will bring them again to us and let us crush them to demonstrate His victory. This is poetry for our experience and praise.</p>
<p>Oh, may the Lord revolutionize our praises! May He give our praises the content of such a Psalm as this&mdash;praises for such a glorious victory and praises for such a glorious Christ in all His Person and accomplishments. Then we will have a proper meeting.</p>
<p class="hbody">God shall rise, His foes be scattered,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that hate Him flee away.<br />
As the wax before the fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the wicked He shall slay.<br />
But the righteous shall rejoice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a loud, triumphant voice,<br />
Singing praises, singing praises,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing praises unto God!</p>
<p class="hbody">He is riding through the deserts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing in His saints in need.<br />
He&rsquo;s a Father to the orphans<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a refuge tried indeed.<br />
In His holy habitation&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a wonderful salvation!<br />
Hallelujah, hallelujah,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hallelujah, Amen!</p>
<p class="hbody">Here the lone have found a family,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the desolate a home;<br />
Prisoners are brought from bondage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prosperity unknown.<br />
For the flock&mdash;what wondrous grace&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God prepared this dwelling place:<br />
Hallelujah, hallelujah,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hallelujah, Amen!</p>
<p class="hbody">Now the Lord in mighty triumph<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sends the news of victory;<br />
We the &ldquo;women&rdquo; spread the tidings&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Kings of armies flee, they flee!&rdquo;<br />
No more sweat and dreary toil;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We at home divide the spoil!<br />
Hallelujah, hallelujah,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hallelujah, Amen!</p>
<p class="hbody">Lo, on high Christ hath ascended,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading captives in His train;<br />
These as gifts He has perfected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Lord may dwell with them.<br />
Brothers, sisters, we are those,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;re those transformed, vanquished foes!<br />
Hallelujah, hallelujah,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hallelujah, Amen!</p>
<p class="hbody">Blessed be the Lord forever:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day by day He loads with good,<br />
E&rsquo;en the God of our salvation&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread His worthy praise abroad,<br />
His the goings forth from death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every foe He conquereth!<br />
Hallelujah, hallelujah,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hallelujah, Amen!</p>
<p class="hbody">They have seen, O God, Thy goings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Thy holy dwelling place,<br />
Thy triumphal, high processions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midst a mighty voice of praise.<br />
See the singers go before,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praising, praising o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er:<br />
Hallelujah, hallelujah,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hallelujah, Amen!</p>
<p class="hbody">Little Benjamin is leading,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then great Judah&rsquo;s company:<br />
Son of sorrow at God&rsquo;s right hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lion with the scepter see.<br />
Zebulun and Naphtali<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make the joyful tidings fly:<br />
Hallelujah, hallelujah,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hallelujah, Amen!</p>
<p class="hbody">Saints, thy strength has been commanded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the temple glorious;<br />
Still we pray that God may strengthen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that He has wrought for us.<br />
Higher yet our praise shall rise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the utmost earth replies:<br />
Hallelujah, hallelujah,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hallelujah, Amen!</p>
