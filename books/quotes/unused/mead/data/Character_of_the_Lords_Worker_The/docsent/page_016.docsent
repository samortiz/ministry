   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to realize that suffering and having a mind to suffer are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Having a mind to suffer implies that we have a desire to willingly suffer for Christ's sake; it means that we have a heart and a willingness to endure affliction on His behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the meaning of having a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who have a mind to suffer may not necessarily be suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in their mind they are prepared to meet all sufferings with fortitude.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For instance, the Lord may put you in circumstances where you are provided with food and clothing and a nicely furnished home.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It does not mean that you cannot continue to enjoy all the provisions He has given you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the Lord has made such provisions, you can accept them from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But within, you still have a mind to suffer for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although you are not suffering physically, you must have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not a question of whether you have encountered something outwardly, but whether you have a mind to suffer inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do you have a mind to suffer even when circumstances are smooth and easy?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord may not arrange for you to suffer every day, but every worker of the Lord must not be short of a mind to suffer, not even for a single day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suffering may not come to us daily, but a mind to suffer must be with us daily.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The problem is that many brothers and sisters, and many families of Christian workers too, seem to shrink back the minute affliction comes to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They do not have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord provides smooth circumstances, abundance in material supply, and good health to them, they can serve Him happily.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But as soon as they experience a little setback or affliction, their whole being collapses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that they do not have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without a mind to suffer, you cannot withstand any trial.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Having a mind to suffer means that we are prepared before the Lord to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It means that we are ready to suffer and that we choose the way of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the Lord does not allow suffering to come our way, that is His business.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On our side, however, we are always ready for suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the Lord changes His course circumstantially and trials come upon us, we will accept them fortuitously, not counting them as strange.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we can only accept the good provisions of the Lord, but cannot take any trial, instead backsliding at any change and ceasing from our work, we do not have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must remember that our work does not sit and wait on us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to work when there is food, and we have to work when there is no food.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to work when we are adequately clothed, and we have to work when we are not adequately clothed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to work when we feel happy, and we have to work when we feel uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to work whether we are in good health or in ill health.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Scripture shows us that we should arm ourselves with a mind to suffer; that is, our mind should be an armory, a weapon, to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a sharp weapon, something Satan cannot prevail against.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without this kind of mind, our work will cease as soon as we experience setbacks and afflictions.</S>
