<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO TAKE DEFINITE STEPS TO PROMOTE<br />
THE NEW WAY IN ITS VARIOUS ASPECTS</h2>
<p>We need to promote the home meetings with all our strength. The saints should first have home meetings in their homes; then they should go out to lead others and establish home meetings in the homes of the ones they are leading. Of course, there is also the need to lead the group meetings. In short, every aspect of the new way needs our promoting and leading. The elders need to look to the Lord&rsquo;s leading. If possible, they can call a mini-conference in order to fellowship with the saints regarding this particular burden. It may not do any harm to have a set practice of sending twenty-five out of one hundred saints door-knocking. This does not mean that the same twenty-five saints should go out every time but that one-fourth of our manpower will be visiting people by door-knocking. We need to encourage the brothers and sisters to consecrate themselves and set apart their time for this matter. We also need to continually pray and fellowship with them and make arrangements for them. We must perfect these ones and direct this matter along the right path. Gradually the practice of the new way will become a kind of atmosphere and will be established as a habit. If we merely make a few announcements and provide the saints with a little encouragement to go door-knocking, those who hear our encouragement will not think that they need to carry it out; in the end, less than ten percent of our manpower will participate. Hence, we need to lead the saints practically and strongly promote the burden of using one-fourth of our manpower to go door-knocking.</p>
<p>In order to perfect the saints in door-knocking, we need to have some training. The main point is not to knock on many doors or expect a quick result. If there are one hundred saints meeting in a certain church and twenty-five saints go door-knocking, at most they will gain four hundred people a year; do not expect too many. Even out of these four hundred new believers, three hundred may not remain in the church life due to various reasons; nevertheless, as long as one-fourth remain, we will have a twofold harvest. Of course, these four hundred new ones will require continual visitation and care from the brothers and sisters in the church. If these ones are well cared for and become stable, we can continue to go door-knocking. In this way, the one hundred saints who meet regularly will always have at least four hundred new ones as fruit for them to visit and take care of.</p>
<p>The church definitely needs leading. Most brothers and sisters will not take care of the new ones simply because the elders have spoken about it and made a few announcements; rather, we need to find a way to lead the saints and make arrangements for them. There is a need for some administration, regardless of the situation. Even in regard to cleaning the meeting hall, we must arrange chairs for the meeting in an orderly way and not simply pile them up haphazardly. In addition, we also need to keep the things for public use in prearranged places. Even in a small district, there is the need for a proper arrangement; this is what is involved in leading. With this kind of leading, the church life will have a pathway upon which it can advance steadily and sequentially in every aspect and according to every step. Both the individual saints and the church will be able to advance.</p>
<p>The majority of the saints love the Lord, and as long as the elders lead them, some will surely be willing to knock on doors. However, they do not need to knock on doors every week. A team of three may only need to go out every other week for two hours. After a year, they will more or less be able to gain the number we have estimated. At the beginning, they will need to nourish the newly saved ones gradually. Eventually, everyone should receive the burden to take care of the home meetings. Moreover, during the week there should be group meetings. While the home meetings are for stabilizing the new ones, the group meetings are for joining them to the saints and caring for them mutually. Finally, we will take them to the district meetings. We should not expect quick results. It may take as many as six months or even a year. As long as we are serious about our participation&mdash;knocking on doors and taking care of the home meetings, group meetings, and the various aspects in the district meetings&mdash;the entire operation will be like a machine, and everything will be on the right track; then there will surely be a rich result within a year.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN ADDITIONAL WORD ON PROPHESYING</h2>
<p>In not only 1 Corinthians 14:1 does Paul say, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy,&rdquo; but also in verse 39 he says, &ldquo;Desire earnestly the prophesying.&rdquo; In addition, in verse 12 he says, &ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.&rdquo; This means that in terms of spiritual gifts, we should seek to excel; we should not desire the inferior gifts but the excelling gift, that is, to prophesy. Verses 3 through 5 also speak of prophesying: &ldquo;He who prophesies speaks building up and encouragement and consolation to men. He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but he who prophesies builds up the church. I desire that you all speak in tongues, but especially that you would prophesy; and greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, that the church may receive building up.&rdquo; Verses 29 through 31 say, &ldquo;As to prophets, two or three should speak, and the others discern. But if something is revealed to another sitting by, the first should be silent. For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged.&rdquo; From the beginning to the end of chapter 14, Paul simply charges everyone to prophesy. He had a deep realization that without prophesying, the church would not be rich or strong; thus, he paid much attention to prophesying. In order to be able to prophesy, we need to be constituted through exercise every day so that when we come to the meetings, we can truly speak for the Lord.</p>
