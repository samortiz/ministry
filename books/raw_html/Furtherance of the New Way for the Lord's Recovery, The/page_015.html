<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE PROPER CHRISTIAN SERVICE</h1><h2 class=head1>THE SERVICE ACCORDING TO GOD’S WILL MAKING THE BELIEVERS INWARDLY SATISFIED</h2><p>By the Lord’s mercy I was saved before I was twenty years old. After I was saved, I really loved the Lord, and I especially loved His Word, to such an extent that the Bible never left my hands. However, I had no place to meet because there was no meeting that could help me. Later I met with the Brethren Assembly and felt that it was not bad because they devoted themselves exclusively to expounding the Bible. I was very interested in this, so I followed them in their constant study. In those days, because I loved the Lord, it seemed that there was so much energy within me. Yet there was no outlet. At that time there was not the practical service. Nevertheless, every week I attended five meetings regularly and was not stopped by wind or rain. Sometimes it was very cold and snowing heavily, but I went to the meetings as usual. On one hand, such an experience was truly enjoyable. On the other hand, I did not have the slightest opportunity to function, nor was I involved in any service.<p>Thus, when I look back on my past experience, I have the deep realization that if a person is saved and loves the Lord but does not have the place or opportunity to serve the Lord and to function, then he will feel depressed and miserable. I believe that we have all had this experience. Although we may have shared something in the meetings, the more we continued with simply sharing, the more it seemed that all we could do was just this little bit, and inwardly we always felt unfulfilled and dissatisfied.<p>In John 4 the disciples went to buy food, and the Lord Jesus sat alone beside a well. Eventually, He led a Samaritan woman to salvation. When the disciples returned, they said, “Rabbi, eat.” The Lord said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.” The disciples were surprised and said to one another, “Has anyone brought Him anything to eat?” The Lord answered them, saying, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work” (vv. 31-34). I believe that many of us have a feeling of this kind: We go to meeting after meeting, listening to message after message, yet we feel as if a bowl of rice has been set before us but we have not eaten any of it. It was not until twenty years ago, when the Lord led us to begin the practice of pray-reading and to have the saints share at the end of the meetings, that we were able to have some enjoyment. At that time, the brothers and sisters felt it was truly enjoyable to stand up to share, and they would race to be the first. Gradually, however, we have been losing this taste.<p>I believe that most of us in the churches love the Lord, but we always feel as if something is missing. In our church life it seems as if there is a hole which we are unable to fill up. If I asked you whether or not you love the Lord, you would all certainly say that you do love Him. However, if I ask you if you feel satisfied, I am afraid you would all say that despite the fact that you meet frequently, have heard many messages, and share or testify regularly, you are still not satisfied inwardly. It seems there is so much energy within you, but there is no place in which you can use it, and there is so much vitality, but there is no outlet for it. You have no way to describe or explain these feelings. Now the church is changing the system to take the new way particularly for the sake of affording a way for that strong, inward impulse of love for the Lord to come out and so that we can be satisfied daily.<h2 class=head1>THE PROPER PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</h2><p>Whoever has experienced this can testify that it is not good enough just to stand by and watch others go out door-knocking, visiting people, and leading them to be saved and baptized. Once you have led someone to be saved and baptized, however, you will jump for joy and be very satisfied. There is an elderly sister in the church in Anaheim who is more than seventy years old. After hearing about the practice of door-knocking, she tried it once and immediately gained one person for baptism. As a result, she has become “addicted” and feels as if she is floating on air. Whenever she meets people, she does not speak about anything else but how satisfied she is that she has gained a person through door-knocking.<p>Two weeks ago, an elder who came from a certain locality in America heard the messages about door-knocking and went out to knock on doors for two days; however, he did not gain a single person. Inwardly, he could not take it, and he went to the Lord to ask for the reason. Surprisingly, as soon as he prayed, he felt that he had to immediately make a thorough confession of his sins. So he did just that; he made a thorough confession of his sins. Afterward he went out door-knocking and gained two people. Now he also has become “addicted” and does not plan to return to America. He wants to stay to continue door-knocking.<p>Prayer along with a thorough confession of sins is a crucial point. Door-knocking is not a light matter. If you want to be effective, you must confess your sins. You should not do this in a superficial way; rather, you must thoroughly and completely confess your sins and totally empty yourselves so that you may be filled with the Holy Spirit. In this way your going out for door-knocking will certainly be effective.
