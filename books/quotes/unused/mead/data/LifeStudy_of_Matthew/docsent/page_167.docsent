   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Heavenly King Walking on the Sea</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Coming to the Disciples</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea v. 25 . According to the Roman guards, there were four night watches, each of three hours, from sunset to sunrise.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first watch was the evening watch; the second, the midnight watch; the third, the cock-crowing watch; and the fourth, the morning watch Mark 13:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fourth watch was probably from three to six o clock in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 25 says that the Lord came to His disciples, walking on the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While His disciples were distressed by the waves, the Lord walked on them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This testifies that He is the Creator and the Ruler of the universe Job 9:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>E. The Heavenly King Bringing Courage</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>to the Disciples by His Presence</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thinking that the Lord was a phantom, the disciples cried out for fear v. 26 . But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Have courage; It is I; do not fear v. 27 . The heavenly King brought courage to the disciples by His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When they mistook Him for a phantom, a ghost, He encouraged them by saying, It is I.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>F. The Disciples Learning to Walk in the Storm</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>by Faith and Not by Sight</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 28 says, And Peter answered Him and said, Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Lord said, Come, Peter stepped out of the boat, walked on the waters and came toward Jesus v. 29 . Only Peter was bold enough to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I doubt that any of us would have been as bold as Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was a miracle that Peter could walk on the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He walked on the waves by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Faith is our action upon the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To have faith does not mean that we are able to do things; neither does it mean that we make up our mind to go in a certain direction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Faith simply means that, although we may be very weak, we dare to act upon the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord said to Peter, Come, and Peter took that word, acted upon it, and walked on the waves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not examine whether or not you have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you examine yourself, your faith will disappear immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not ask yourself, Am I strong in faith?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Is my faith adequate?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you question yourself like this, you will immediately sink beneath the waves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 30 says of Peter: But seeing the strong wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Peter came down from the boat and walked on the waves by faith in the Lord s word v. 29 ; however, when he saw the strong wind, his faith vanished.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He should have walked only by faith in the Lord s word, not by the sight of the circumstances 2 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Peter cried out for help, Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him and said to him, You of little faith, why did you doubt? v. 31 . Since the Lord said to Peter, Come v. 29 , Peter should have stood on that word and not doubted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the Lord rebuked him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Faith comes from the Lord s word and stands on the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as we have the Lord s word, we should simply believe in His word and not doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not be troubled by any storms, for we are in the boat, the Lord s church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even if we cannot see the Lord or feel that He is with us, we may be assured that He is on the mountain interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps He is even on the way to the boat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whether He is on the mountain interceding or on the waves walking toward us, we should not be disturbed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At times we may not only have peace inwardly, but even receive a word from Him to walk on the waves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we receive such a word, we should simply walk on the stormy sea.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not be bothered by the opposition and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>With the Lord s word we may walk to meet Him, even walking through all the opposition and upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not blame Peter for having little faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Among all the disciples in the boat, Peter was the first to enjoy the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some of us are too slow and too timid.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not criticize others for being too quick.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You need to be quick yourself sometimes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Which do you prefer to be like Peter or to be like Thomas?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Peter was bold, but Thomas was timid and cautious.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the churches there are many careful, cautious ones.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But Peter was not cautious.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As soon as he heard a word from the Lord, he stepped out of the boat and onto the water.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, the cautious ones may say, But Peter had to cry out to the Lord to save him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no need for us to cry for help.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are safe here in the boat.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yes, you are safe in the boat, but you are not in the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You are not like Peter who was the first to get back into the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Peter caused a great deal of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The quick ones always make trouble, whereas the timid ones never cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The timid ones do not cause trouble, but neither do they bring in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>With the cautious ones, nothing seems to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Year after year goes by, and everything remains calm.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But those who are like Peter are always stirring things up.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They may cause trouble, but they are rescued by the Lord and thereby are brought into His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some of you cautious ones need to stir up a little trouble, then cry out to the Lord to be saved, and get into His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Who do you think enjoys the Lord more the cautious ones or the quick ones?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The answer certainly is the quick ones.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Nevertheless, the timid ones may say, Let us sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Sooner or later, the Lord Jesus will come.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We don t need to jump in the water, cause trouble, and then cry out for rescue.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We don t need to be so quick to get into the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we take it easy and be calm, the Lord will come.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In one sense, the cautious ones are right and those like Peter are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But the bold ones have more enjoyment of the Lord than the timid ones.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Eventually, however, the Lord s presence is not just with Peter, but with all the disciples in the boat.</S>
