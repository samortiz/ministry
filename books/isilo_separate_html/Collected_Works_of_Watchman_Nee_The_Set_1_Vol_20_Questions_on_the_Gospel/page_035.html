Acts 2:23 and 36 and 3:15 speak of being crucified by men, while Isaiah 53:6 and 10 speak of being crucified by God. Which part of Christ's crucifixion was done by man and which part was done by God?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>When we read the Bible, we can clearly see that the crucifixion of Christ involves the matters of man crucifying Him and God crucifying Him. From the seven sentences spoken by the Lord on the cross, we can understand which part of the crucifixion was done by man and which part was done by God. According to human time, the crucifixion lasted for six hours. During the first three hours, the Lord spoke three sentences, and during the last three hours, He spoke four sentences. Why did He not speak more or less during the first three hours? If we read carefully, we realize that the first three hours of the crucifixion were the work of man, while the last three hours were the work of God.</P><P>During the first three hours, lasting from nine in the morning until noon (Mark 15:25), man was mocking, scourging, reproaching, crucifying, and railing at the Lord on the cross. All this was heaped upon Him by man.</P><P>In the last three hours, lasting from noon until three in the afternoon, the crucifixion was the work of God. We know this because from noon until three there was darkness over all the land. This was definitely beyond man's capacity. The veil of the temple was also suddenly split in two from top to bottom. This was also beyond man's capability. Furthermore, the earth was shaken, rocks were split, and even tombs were opened (Matt. 27:45, 51-52). All of these could not be the work of man. They were altogether the work of God.</P><P>During the first part of the Lord Jesus' crucifixion on the cross, man did everything that he could do. During the last part, God also did all that He could do. The first part of the crucifixion expressed all the hatred of man toward God. The last part revealed all the love of God toward man. Therefore, one might say that the cross is the meeting point of love and hatred.</P><P>Now let us look at the three sentences spoken by the Lord during the first three hours.</P><P>First, He said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (Luke 23:34). How could God forgive those who murdered an innocent person? How could the Lord even pray in such a way? If God answered this prayer, would He not become unrighteous? In order to answer this, we must be clear that the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross in order to bear the sin of the world. The righteous God could forgive our sins only by the cross because "without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness" (Heb. 9:22). Furthermore, only from His position on the cross could the Lord Jesus pray such a prayer. Otherwise, the Lord Jesus' prayer as well as God's forgiveness would have been unrighteous.</P><P>Second, He said, "Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" (Luke 23:43). How could such a thief enter into Paradise? If all the thieves were permitted to enter into Paradise, would it still be a Paradise? These, however are only man's considerations. In the eyes of God, not only are thieves barred from Paradise, but even the so-called good people are unqualified to enter because, in Adam, all have sinned (Rom. 5:12). The Lord Jesus was able to speak to the repentant thief in this way because He is the only Mediator between God and man (1 Tim. 2:5) and because He is the Lamb of God (John 1:29). Through the eternal Spirit, He offered Himself to God without spot or blemish. Therefore, His blood can purge man's conscience from dead works (Heb. 9:14). The thief in Paradise is no longer a thief, but one whose conscience has been purged from dead works. Today all who receive Him, that is, all who believe in His name, will have the same experience.</P><P>Third, He said, "Woman, behold, your son....Behold, your mother" (John 19:26-27). This verse shows us that because of the Lord's accomplishment on the cross, we have a new relationship with God and with man. We are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God. We have fellowship not only with God but also with one another. John was not the only one who could receive Mary as his mother according to the word of the Lord. Later, even Paul (Rom. 16:13) and all the saints throughout the ages also shared this kind of feeling. How marvelous it is that by having the same life, a new relationship is produced among all the saints.</P><P>After the Lord Jesus had spoken these three sentences, there was darkness over all the land. God heard the prayer of the Lord, and He laid all the sins of the world upon the Lord Jesus. God made Him who knew no sin become sin on our behalf. God not only saves us according to His grace; He also saves us according to His righteousness. God not only has mercy on us; He also paid the price for us and repaid everything we ever owed.</P><P>At about three in the afternoon, the Lord spoke four more sentences. Fourth, He said, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Matt. 27:46). Many martyrs, who experience man's persecution and severe punishment, do not show any sign of sorrow or self-pity. Rather, they feel that God is very near to them. Our Lord was obedient to God all His life. Therefore, if He was only crucified on the cross through the persecution of man, God should have been much nearer to Him! How could God ever forsake Him when man forsook Him? Thank and praise God! On the cross our Lord did not die a martyr's death; rather, He died bearing the sins of all mankind. God put our sins upon Him, and God crucified Him. After the Lord spoke the first three sentences, God heard the Lord Jesus' prayer and put all the sins of mankind upon Him. Then the Lord knew that God had forsaken Him.</P><P>Fifth, He said, "I thirst" (John 19:28). Thirstiness is a condition of hell, a characteristic of the suffering of hell. The rich man in Luke 16 was in the fire of Hades without a drop of water. There is no other place that causes more thirst than hell. At that moment the Lord suffered the punishment of hell on man's behalf and tasted death for every man because He bore our sins (Heb. 2:9).</P><P>Sixth, He said, "It is finished!" (John 19:30). This indicates that the work of redemption was finished. The Lord had borne the sins of man and received the penalty of sin for man.</P><P>Seventh, He said, "Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit" (Luke 23:46). Earlier the Lord had said, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" He said this because He was standing on the ground of bearing man's sins. But here He was able to say, "Father," because after the redemptive work was accomplished, His fellowship with the Father was instantly restored. The Lord laid down His life voluntarily, and He committed His life to God. He said, "No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again" (John 10:18). If He had not done so, not even a hundred crosses could have taken the Lord's life away.</P><P>Our sins have been taken away by the most righteous Lord. According to His righteousness, God can no longer choose to forgive or not forgive us; He must forgive us because Christ has already died and become the sin offering.</P><P>Since the Lord did not accomplish the work of redemption until His death on the cross, perhaps some will ask how He could have forgiven man's sins before His death. This is possible because God reckoned the cross as an accomplished fact even before Christ's death. John 3:15 says, "That every one who believes into Him may have eternal life." John 6:54 says, "He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life." These passages show us that even when the Lord was on the earth, everyone who believed in Him could have eternal life. Revelation 13:8 says, "The Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world." The Lord is the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world. Therefore, the church is not limited by space (for the Body of Christ is one), while the cross is not limited by time (for even in the Old Testament, God could forgive people). In the Old Testament, anyone who killed another person accidentally could flee to a city of refuge where no one could seize his life, and he would be free when the high priest died (Num. 35:25-28). This signifies that even before Christ's death, if anyone hid in Christ, he would be safe and free upon the death of Christ.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> </body></html>
