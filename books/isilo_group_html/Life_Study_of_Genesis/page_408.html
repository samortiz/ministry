The Bible is surely written by God. In no other book do we find a portion such as 28:10-22. This passage is short, but it is crucial, deep, and meaningful, including the whole Bible in its scope. In verse 11 we see the stone which Jacob used for a pillow. As everyone knows, a pillow is something upon which to rest. In verse 18 this pillow-stone becomes a pillar. A pillow is for rest, but a pillar is used for support in a building. In the temple built by Solomon, there were two main pillars (1 Kings 7:21). Galatians 2:9 says that James, Peter, and John were pillars in the church. Furthermore, Revelation 3:12 says that the overcomers will be pillars in the temple of God. In Genesis 28 we have the stone, the pillow, and the pillar. But this is not all. Eventually, this pillar becomes Bethel, the house of God. Moreover, in this short portion of the Word we see a ladder set up on the earth, the top of which reached to heaven (v. 12). It is impossible for any man to have written this record. How could Jacob have dreamed such a dream? According to human history, no one has ever had such a dream. But Jacob saw a ladder on which the angels of God were ascending and descending. This indicates that the angels were already there waiting for the time to ascend. When Jacob saw the ladder in his dream, the angels might have immediately ascended to heaven to report the news that Jacob had come and had seen the ladder. After Jacob had awakened out of his sleep, he realized that this place was not only the house of God but also the gate of heaven (v. 17).</P><P>In addition to all these wonderful items, there is another important item in this chapter&#151;the matter of our living. Many times when we preach the gospel, the sinners ask, "If I believe in Jesus, will He take care of my living?" Some saints ask a similar question: "If I love the Lord and live for Him, what will happen to my living? Don't I need to take care of this?" We all have the problem of making a living. But in this short record we see that God takes care of our living. As we shall see, taking care of our living is secondary. In verse 15 the Lord said to Jacob, "Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest." Here the Lord seemed to be saying, "Jacob, I will be with you and I will take care of your living. I'll give you bread to eat and raiment to put on." This corresponds to the Lord's word in Matthew 6:33: "Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you." If we seek His kingdom, God will surely take care of our living.</P><P>Although God had promised to be with Jacob and to keep him, Jacob still made a deal with Him, saying, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God" (vv. 20-21). Notice the word "then" in verse 21. If God would do so many things for Jacob, then Jacob would take Him as his God. But if God would not do these things for him, then there would be no deal. Jacob seemed to be saying, "If You give me food and clothing and take care of my living, then I'll take You as my God, this pillar shall be Your house, and I will return to You the tenth of what You have given to me." This was a very profitable business arrangement. Jacob was saying, "Lord, You must first give to me, and then I'll give to You. If You give me a dollar, then I will return a dime to You." God says that if we seek His kingdom, then He will give us bread. But we say that God must first give us bread and then we shall seek His kingdom. There is no need for you to make such a deal with the Lord. Simply be a lump of clay and allow the Lord to work on you, and He will add to you everything you need. The word add in Matthew 6:33 implies that something basic has already been given and that other things are simply added to us. As we shall see, God will give us the land, the seed, and the blessing. To all this, He adds food, clothing, and the other things we need for our living.</P><P>I love this portion of the Word because its span is so wide, covering the whole Bible from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22. This is why I say that it is such a crucial portion. It covers everything from the dust to the stone, from the creation to the building of God's house. It covers the matters of bread, clothing, the house of God, the ladder, and the heavenly things.</P><P>In this passage, Jacob firstly found rest and ultimately he received the promise that there would be no problem regarding food and clothing. Everyone is looking for rest. Rest always includes satisfaction. If we are not satisfied, we can never be at rest. Whenever we come to the Lord, the first thing we receive is rest. As lonesome, disappointed people who do not know where we are going, we need rest. As those who seem to be hopeless, who have no future, and who have lost almost everything, we long for rest. Praise the Lord for His rest! This rest is upon the stone, and this stone is in the very place where God's house is. Here is our place of rest.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_407.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_409.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Genesis &nbsp; pg 408</div><br></body></html>
