<h1 class="title">THE PROPER ONE ACCORD<br />
IN THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:4-6; Matt. 18:19; Acts 1:14; Phil. 1:27; 1 Cor. 1:10; Rev. 1:4a, 11-12, 20; 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14; 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17; Col. 4:16; 1 Cor. 11:16; 14:33-34; Acts 15:1-31; 1 Thes. 2:14; 1 Cor. 1:11-13; Phil. 1:15, 17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONE ACCORD<br />
BEING THE PRACTICE OF THE ONENESS</h2>
<p>In this series of messages I have put the genuine oneness first and the proper one accord second. Strictly speaking, the genuine oneness is not of the church but of the Body; it is the Body&rsquo;s own organic oneness. In Ephesians 4:4, after telling us to keep the oneness of the Spirit, Paul did not say, &ldquo;One church and one Spirit...&rdquo;; rather, he said, &ldquo;One Body and one Spirit....&rdquo; The church may be plural as the churches in different localities, but the Body could never be plural. Whether it is viewed locally or universally, the Body is one. In contrast, the church is universally one but locally many.</p>
<p>In the Body we need oneness; in the churches and among the churches, we need the one accord. The one accord is for our practice; the oneness is primarily for the actuality, for the fact. In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed for such a fact, and on the day of Pentecost, by pouring out Himself as the consummated Spirit, He accomplished His prayer. That was the actuality of the oneness. After the accomplishment of the actuality of the oneness, there is the need for the practice of the oneness. When the oneness is practiced, it becomes the one accord. The one accord is the practice of the oneness.</p>
<p>If we have only the oneness as an actuality, and do not have the present, practical one accord, the oneness that we have will be objective and abstract; it will not be real to us. If we would apply the oneness accomplished by the outpouring of the Spirit, we must practice the one accord. If among us there is no one accord, how could we say that there is oneness? If in a prayer meeting we each pray in our own way, without any accord among us, how could we say that we are practicing the oneness? As long as we have differences existing among us, the oneness is not applied. We must have the one accord to swallow up all the differences; then oneness will be present.</p>
<p>The practice of the proper one accord in the church is the application of the oneness. Although oneness and one accord seem to be synonymous, there is a difference between them. The Lord did not teach us concerning oneness. In John 17 He prayed for oneness, but in Matthew 18 He led us to practice the one accord. In Matthew 18:19 the Lord spoke of two praying together on earth in one accord. That was His leading, His training, and His directing us to pray in one accord. As a test of whether we are practicing the oneness or not, we may check to see whether there is one accord in our prayer meeting. When certain ones pray, we may shake our head as an indication of our displeasure, and when others pray, we may nod our head as an expression of our agreement. Such a shaking and nodding of our head is strong evidence that we do not practice oneness, because we do not have the one accord.</p>
<p>To say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; in response to others&rsquo; prayer is a practice taught by Paul in 1 Corinthians. In 14:16 Paul said that we need to pray in such a way that others can say &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; If there are no Amens to indicate our one accord, we should not expect that our prayer will be heard. If only two on earth pray in one accord, their prayer will be answered. The one accord is the practice, the application, of the oneness, and the oneness is the basis on which we practice the one accord. This is very meaningful.</p>
<p>In a church meeting there may be people of different races and colors. Our one accord could never be based on the different races and colors. We practice one accord based on the fact that we all have a common life. We may be different in race and in the color of our skin, but when we come together to pray, we must forget about the different races and colors. We do have a base for our oneness; thus, we can practice the one accord.</p>
<p>Not only so, if we do not have the same understanding, the same intention, the same purpose, the same goal, it will be impossible to pray together in one accord. There will be no base for such prayer. If we each have our own opinion, our own intention, and our own goal, there will be no base on which we can pray in one accord. But when we who are saved and who love the Lord and mean business for the Lord&rsquo;s purpose come together, we surely have the base to pray in one accord.</p>
<p>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed for the oneness of His believers. That oneness was only in His aspiration. A little more than fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, the oneness in the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration was accomplished. The oneness in the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration became the oneness in actuality. This oneness is called &ldquo;the oneness of the Spirit&rdquo; (Eph. 4:3), the Spirit here being the consummated Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, as the consummation of the entire Triune God. We, the saved ones, possess this oneness as our heritage. We possess this oneness, we enjoy it, and we apply it. To apply this oneness is to keep it, and to keep it is to practice one accord.</p>
<p>If in our Christian life and our church life we do not practice one accord, we conduct ourselves as if we are unlearned people who do not know that there is such a thing as the oneness of the Spirit. Suppose you have one billion dollars in your checking account. If you never write checks, it will seem as if you do not have a checking account at all, or that your account has a zero balance. Your writing of checks is the practice of your realization that there is one billion dollars in your checking account. The one billion dollars in your checking account is your possession. We may liken the oneness of the Spirit to a one billion dollar deposit in our heavenly bank account. Therefore, every day and in every meeting we need to &ldquo;write checks&rdquo;; that is, we need to exercise to apply the oneness of the Spirit to the present situation.</p>
<p>The oneness that we possess in all the churches is not merely the oneness in the Lord&rsquo;s aspiration and prayer. The oneness in John 17 may be likened to a promissory note. We do not have merely a promissory note; we possess a real bank deposit, for the promised &ldquo;cash&rdquo; has actually been &ldquo;deposited into the bank&rdquo; and has become our possession. We may consider this possession as our inheritance. The oneness that we have is the accomplished oneness, the oneness of the Spirit. We all have the Spirit in our &ldquo;bank account,&rdquo; that is, in our spirit (Rom. 8:9, 16). This Spirit who is in our spirit is the equivalent of the oneness. We have the oneness as a deposit in our account, but we may not write &ldquo;checks of oneness&rdquo; because we may not remain in the spirit. Instead, we may remain in our mind. When a certain brother prays, we may be in our mind discerning whether that brother&rsquo;s prayer is genuine, or whether there is hidden intention in his prayer. Thus, we may not say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to his prayer. In such a situation, there is no practice of oneness. The one accord actually is the using of the oneness, which is the using of our possession. We all need to realize and to learn that not to be one with the saints, not to have one accord with others in the church, is serious. This indicates that the oneness is not applied.</p>
<p>To keep the oneness, to apply the oneness, to use the oneness, to enjoy the oneness, to spend the oneness, we need to practice the one accord. However, we should practice the one accord not only among the saints in our particular locality; we must practice the one accord among all the churches universally. During the past two and a half years, the teaching of the absolute autonomy of the local churches was promoted among us. This teaching was based mainly on the book <em>The Churches of God</em> by G. H. Lang. This kind of teaching encourages and even promotes differences among the churches. It is serious to say that all the churches should be different. We are not for uniformity among the churches, but we are for oneness.</p>
<p>Uniformity and oneness are not the same thing. In a family there may be a grandfather and a grandmother who are over eighty years of age, a father and a mother who are about fifty years of age, and a number of children ranging from eighteen down to four years of age. They all are different in age, different in the degree of maturity. In such a family it would be impossible to make all the members uniformly the same age. However, although the members of a family can never be the same age, they can still be one. Likewise, in the church we do not practice uniformity because in the household of God, a large household, there are many degrees of maturity among the children. To eliminate the degrees of maturity would be absolutely wrong and would be impossible. However, this does not mean that we do not need oneness. In the practicality of the church life, as in the family life, there is the need of oneness; but in the degree of the growth in life, it is impossible to have uniformity. To make all the children the same in the growth in life is not to practice oneness; it is to practice uniformity. To have a clear vision of the proper one accord as the practice of the genuine oneness also is a part of the scriptural remedy for the intrinsic problem in the present rebellion among us.</p>
