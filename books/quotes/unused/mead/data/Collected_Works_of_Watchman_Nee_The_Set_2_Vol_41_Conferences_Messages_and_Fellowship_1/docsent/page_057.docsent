   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE THE TONE OF AN OVERCOMING LIVING Date: November 19, 1935, evening</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Chuenchow</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Rom 8:37; Psa 20:5</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to see another thing tonight the tone of an overcoming living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before we come to this matter, we have to review what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We first saw that the human method to attain victory is suppression, struggles, and prayers, etc. Actually none of these methods work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second, we saw that Christ is our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Victory is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The overcoming life that God has given us is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Third, the most important characteristic of the overcoming life is that it is an exchange rather than a change.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Fourth, we saw that there are two things we have to do let go and believe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Fifth, we saw that there are also two things we have to do after overcoming terminate all sins and fully consecrate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sixth, we saw that the Lord is the One who guards us in living an overcoming life; the Lord continually overcomes for us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to commit ourselves into the Lord's hand daily.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to trust in Him and hand ourselves over to Him day by day and moment by moment, allowing His victory to be manifested in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If anyone has not done this yet, I hope that you will do it today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now let us consider the tone of an overcomer's daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we sing a hymn, we have the words and the tune.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many people sing with the right words but with the wrong tune.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please remember that the overcoming life also has its tune.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After a man has passed the gate of victory, he cannot overcome every day if he does not carry a tone of victory with him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the tone is wrong, everything else is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Fukienese and the Amoyese all speak with different tones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But there is only one tone for the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The kind of victory in the Bible is one which makes us more than conquerors Rom 8:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not one which barely allows us to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word barely is my own word; the Bible never uses such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, the fact is that many Christians only barely overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their victory is not one that makes them more than conquerors.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such victory is not genuine victory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>SHOUTING IN VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Salvation and victory are the same word in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Shouting and rejoicing are also the same word in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, Psalm 20:5 says, "May we shout victoriously in Your salvation," which can be translated as "May we rejoice in Your victory."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is the difference between victory and shouting for victory?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose two groups of students are engaged in a ball game and one team wins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is victory; the team has won.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Shouting for victory is for the cheering ones to shout loudly for the winning team.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The students who actually play the game are the ones who won.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The other classmates have not won, yet they can shout in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the same way, victory is Christ; this has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are not responsible for His victory, but we are responsible for one thing to shout in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord has won the victory, and we are shouting in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the tone of an overcoming living.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every one of us should have this kind of overcoming tone in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have an overcoming tone, we have the overcoming living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Without an overcoming tone, our daily life is still one of failure.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Being more than conquerors is being victorious continuously and having a tone of victory all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The victory of many people is a reluctant one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a bare victory and a silent one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, when others revile, you may not react; instead, you keep your mouth shut.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may think that by keeping quiet in this way you are being victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is true that this is victory, but it is a victory that is barely attained.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not one which makes you more than conqueror, nor is it a shout of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The shout of victory which comes after a victory is one which rejoices, thanks, and praises continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not a reluctant effort, nor is it an act of repression or endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Shouting for victory is praising under any circumstance and for any reason.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is more than conquering.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Most people think that keeping silent when they are being reviled is overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But this is not real victory.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Real victory is thanking and praising the Lord under all kinds of difficulties and hardships.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is not just victory, but the shout of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have to remember that the cup that God has given us is a cup that runs over Psa 23:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is not a cup that only has a few drops of water.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For our cup to run over is for us to shout for victory.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If others ask me to go a mile, and I go a mile, this is not victory.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>More than conquering is for others to ask me to go a mile, and instead, I go two miles.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If others ask for my tunic, and I give them my tunic, this is not victory.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But if others ask for the tunic, and I yield the cloak as well, this is real victory.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When others revile me, I do not merely try to suppress myself or try to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Instead, I say to God, "I thank You," and I say it without any reluctance or misgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the victory that makes us more than conquerors.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should say to the Lord, "All the hardships that have come upon me are Your gracious dealings with me.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I thank You that I am able to suffer for You."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord gives you the victory in order that you will thank and praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Many people have seemingly overcome, but they do not have the tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>For example, a man may be in difficulties and say to the Lord, "I am suffering."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This means that he has lost the tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Those who cannot thank and praise in their sufferings are barely making it; they are not more than conquerors.</S>
