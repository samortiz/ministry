   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The wayside heart The first heart is the heart of the wayside.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord said that some seed fell on the wayside.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The wayside is the shoulder of the way where man walks.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although you may say that it is the way, and perhaps it even looks like the way, yet it is not really the way, it is beside the way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although it is not the real way, because it is the soil beside the way, it is trodden by man.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The stony heart The stony heart is the ground with soil on the surface and rocks underneath.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some listen to the word of the Lord, but they only hear it superficially; deep inside of them are the hidden rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The rocks are sins, the world, friendship, fame, etc. They are not willing to give up these things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who have believed only superficially stumble when the trials come.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are like seedlings in shallow soil that withered away by the scorching of the sun.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The earthly cares, the deceitfulness of riches, and other lusts are the thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today there are also some who accept the words of the Lord, yet their hearts have not been freed from the cares of this life, the deceitfulness of riches, and other lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After a man has heard the word, the word of God inside him does not result in much growth when it encounters the thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The heart with the good soil The good soil is not the wayside soil, nor the rocky soil, nor the soil with thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This soil does not have the traffic of people and worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not shallow, does not have hidden sins and love of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not thorny, does not have the anxiety of the world, the deceitfulness of riches and the desire for other lusts.</S>
