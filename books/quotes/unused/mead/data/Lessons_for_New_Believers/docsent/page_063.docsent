   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Considering Doctrinal Views as the Faith</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The basic Christian faith consists only of the seven ones spoken of in Ephesians 4:4-6.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Apart from these seven ones, nothing should be considered as basic to the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our fundamental faith can have only this one faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we consider the many possible different doctrinal views as being part of the one faith, the fundamental faith, there will surely be many divisions among God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This should not be so.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Practicing Differently and Being Divided</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>from Others Based on Doctrine Being Fleshly</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Galatians 5:19-21 speaks concerning the works of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One of the items is sects or heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Greek word for heresies in the Chinese Union Version means divisions due to different doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, any act of causing division because of different doctrines is the work of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Receiving Those Who Are Weak in Faith</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 14 speaks of not passing judgment on others considerations but rather of receiving one another: One believes that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He who eats, let him not despise him who does not eat; and he who does not eat, let him not judge him who eats, for God has received him...One judges one day above another; another judges every day alike vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2-3, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This portion of the Word makes it clear that none of us should pass judgment on others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even if a person is a vegetarian and keeps the Sabbath, the Bible says that we should still receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being a vegetarian and keeping the Sabbath are not according to New Testament truths.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nevertheless, the Bible tells us to receive one who is a vegetarian and keeps the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should receive one who has different views and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, God does not allow any division based on differences in doctrinal views.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Scriptures Acknowledging</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Doctrinal Differences but Not Permitting Division</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Based on These Differences</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although the Bible acknowledges that man has different views with respect to doctrines, it absolutely forbids man from being sectarian and divisive based on different doctrinal views.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First Corinthians 1:10-13 and Titus 3:10 show that the Bible forbids people from being factious.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even more, the Bible condemns those who form parties and cause divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as there is the oneness on the seven points of the fundamental faith spoken of in Ephesians 4, the Bible does not forbid different doctrinal views if they do not hinder the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, the Bible absolutely prohibits people from forming parties and causing divisions based on these doctrinal views.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible condemns any kind of sectarianism and denominationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Being Divided Because of Racial Differences</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First Corinthians 12:13 and Colossians 3:11 say there cannot be Jew or Greek in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jews are a certain race, and Greeks are another race.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Division because of racial differences is not permitted in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, a church based on an ethnic group should not be established.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Being Divided Because of Differences</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>in Nationality</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fact that 1 Corinthians 12 and Colossians 3 say there cannot be Greeks or Jews means that there cannot be divisions based on race or nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Divisions according to nationality, such as the Anglican Church in England, which is either the Church of England or the Episcopalian Church, and the Church of Christ in China, are neither right nor permitted in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Being Divided Because of Differences</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>in Social Rank</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First Corinthians 12:13 and Colossians 3:11 also say that there cannot be slave or free in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, it is not permissible to have divisions based on social rank.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There cannot be a church of university professors, just as there cannot be a church of rickshaw pullers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the past there was a church of the rickshaw pullers in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should bear in mind that although there are different social classes in society, there cannot be such a thing in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A university professor must be able to sit beside a brother who is a rickshaw puller in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a lovely matter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Being Divided Because of</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Spiritual Weakness or Mistakes</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In five of the seven epistles written to the seven local churches in Asia, the Lord rebuked the churches because of their weaknesses and mistakes Rev 2 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, because those five were local churches, the Lord did not ask anyone to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although the spiritual condition of those churches was weak, and there were even serious mistakes among them, the Lord still wanted the believers to be overcomers in these churches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All of the above points show that the church is one; therefore, it should never be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is absolutely no reason for the church to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Any reason for division that goes against the seven points of the fundamental faith spoken of in Ephesians 4 is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once the church is divided, it is no longer one, and the result is confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This confusion is spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May the Lord preserve us to continually live in the oneness of the church.</S>
