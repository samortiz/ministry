<h1 class="title">Taking Christ as Our Pattern</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 2:5-11</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In order to experience Christ and live Christ, we must know Him as our pattern and take Him as our pattern:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In 2:5-11 Paul presents Christ as the pattern; we need to have this pattern infused into us.</li>
	<li>The pattern of the Christian life is the God-man Savior who emptied Himself and humbled Himself and who has been exalted and glorified by God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Although the Lord was equal with God, He did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped and retained; He emptied Himself, laying aside what He possessed&mdash;the form of God&mdash; vv. 6-7a.</li>
		<li>In His incarnation the Lord did not alter His divine nature; He changed only His outward expression from the form of God to the form of a slave.</li>
		<li>The Lord became &ldquo;in the likeness of men&rdquo;&mdash; vv. 7b-8a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The form of God implies the inward reality of Christ&rsquo;s deity; the likeness of men denotes the outward appearance of His humanity.</li>
			<li>He appeared to men as a man outwardly, but as God He had the reality of deity inwardly.</li>
			<li>Christ entered into the condition of humanity, and He was found in fashion as a man.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Christ humbled Himself by becoming obedient even unto death&mdash;the death of a cross&mdash;v. 8b:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Humbling Himself was a further step in emptying Himself.</li>
			<li>Christ&rsquo;s self-humbling manifested His self-emptying.</li>
			<li>The death of a cross was the climax of Christ&rsquo;s humiliation.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Lord humbled Himself to the uttermost, but God exalted Him to the highest peak and bestowed on Him &ldquo;the name which is above every name&rdquo;&mdash; v. 9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God has exalted Jesus, a real man, to be the Lord of all&mdash;Acts 2:32-33; 5:31.</li>
			<li>This exaltation of Christ was the manifestation of resurrection power.</li>
			<li>The highest name in the universe, the greatest name, is the name of Jesus:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) The name is the expression of the sum total of what the Lord Jesus is in His person and work.</li>
				<li>2) <em>In the name of Jesus</em> means in the sphere and element of all that the Lord is&mdash;Phil. 2:10.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>The result of our confessing that Jesus is Lord is that God the Father is glorified; this is the great end of all that Christ is and has done in His person and work&mdash;v. 11; 1 Cor. 15:24-28.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The principle of this pattern is that someone with the highest life and position would be willing to live in a lowly way.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ as our pattern is not only objective but also subjective and experiential&mdash;Phil. 2:5, 12-13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The One who set up the pattern and who Himself is the pattern is now operating within us as the indwelling God&mdash;v. 13.</li>
	<li>The principle of Christ as the inward pattern for our living is that even if we have the highest standard or the highest position, we should not grasp it.</li>
	<li>We need to be partners with Christ in His human living, especially in His emptying and humbling Himself and in His not grasping equality with God as a treasure&mdash;vv. 6-7.</li>
	<li>The Christ who is our pattern is now the life within us&mdash;Col. 3:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We have a life in us that is a self-emptying and self-humbling life; this life never grasps at something as a treasure but is always willing to lay aside position and title.</li>
		<li>We have Christ crucified as our pattern, and this pattern is the crucified life within us&mdash;Gal. 2:20:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The steps of Christ&rsquo;s humiliation in Philippians 2:5-8 are all aspects of the crucified life lived out in a full way.</li>
			<li>When we live Christ, we live the One who is the pattern of a crucified life&mdash;1:21a.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Taking the crucified life as our pattern opens the gate of resurrection and brings us into the power of resurrection&mdash;3:10:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>By living a crucified life, we can experience the power of resurrection which exalted Christ to the highest peak in the universe&mdash;Eph. 1:19-22.</li>
			<li>The highest life on earth is a crucified life; whenever we live a crucified life, God will bring us into resurrection.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Christ should be exalted not only objectively in the universe but also subjectively in our daily life&mdash; Phil. 2:9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ is exalted in us as we take Him as the crucified life to be the pattern of our daily life.</li>
			<li>The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the power that exalts Christ&mdash;1:19.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>If we would take Christ as our pattern, we need to take Christ&rsquo;s mind as our mind&mdash;2:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul not only took Christ as his living and expression outwardly but also took the mind of Christ as his mind inwardly.</li>
	<li>For the mind of Christ to be in us means that this mind is something living; actually, the mind of Christ is Christ Himself, for the person of Christ is manifested in His mind.</li>
	<li>We need to open ourselves and let &ldquo;this mind&rdquo; be in us&mdash;v. 5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>This</em> refers to the considering in verse 3 and to the regarding in verse 4.</li>
		<li>This kind of thinking was in Christ when He emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, and humbled Himself, being found in fashion as a man&mdash;vv. 7-8.</li>
		<li>To have such a mind requires us to be one with Christ in His inward parts&mdash;1:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
