   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ELIPHAZ'S LOGIC CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE RECOMPENSE OF GOOD AND EVIL</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter twenty-two we see Eliphaz's logic concerning the recompense of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. His Wrong Word of Accusations</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>against Job</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In his wrong word of accusations against Job vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1-11 , Eliphaz asked him, "Can a man of might be of any use to God?/No, a man of insight is of use only to himself./Is it a matter of delight to the Almighty that you are righteous?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>/Or is it a gain to Him that you make your ways perfect?/Is it because of your fear of Him that He reproves you,/That He enters into judgment with you?/Is not your wickedness great,/And is there no end to your iniquities?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then Eliphaz accused Job of taking pledges from his brothers without cause, stripping the naked of their clothing, not giving water to the weary, withholding bread from the hungry, and sending widows away empty.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, according to Eliphaz's logic, snares were around Job, dread and darkness troubled him, and an abundance of waters covered him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>6-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. Saying That the God-forsaking Wicked</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Were Snatched Away before They Died</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verses 12 through 20 the main point of Eliphaz's speaking is that the God-forsaking wicked were snatched away before they died and that the remnant of them was devoured by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>C. Saying That the God-seeking Righteous Man</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Will Be Blessed and Delivered by God</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eliphaz continued by charging Job to be well disposed to God, to be at peace with Him, to receive instruction from Him, and lay up His words in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The main point in verses 21 through 30 is that, according to Eliphaz's logic, the God-seeking righteous man will be blessed and delivered by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The teaching of Eliphaz may seem to be very good; however, its source is not divine revelation but human logic.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, this teaching is based upon the principle of good and evil, which principle is the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
