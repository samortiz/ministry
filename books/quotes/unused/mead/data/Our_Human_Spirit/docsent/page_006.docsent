   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO OUR HUMAN SPIRIT 2 Scripture Reading: John 3:6; 4:24; 2 Tim 4:22; Matt 28:20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Scriptures clearly reveal that we have a human spirit and that God created our human spirit for us to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 3:6 the Lord Jesus said, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this verse there are two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is easy for us to understand that the first Spirit must be God's Spirit, but what about the second spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second spirit in this verse is our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our human spirit is born of God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>BORN AGAIN</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many of us were taught that because we are so sinful, so evil, and so bad, we need to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let's suppose that you are not evil or sinful, but that you are so good, even better than the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Would you still need to be born again?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The angels are good, but they don't have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It doesn't matter whether you are good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You still need the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if you weren't sinful, you would still need to be regenerated, to be reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before the fall Adam was perfect, pure, and clean; in him there was nothing wrong, nothing short, nothing too much, nothing damaged, nothing ruined, and nothing corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Adam was so perfect, so pure, and so clean.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such a pure, perfect, clean, original man needed to be born again in order to have God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How could Adam have gotten God's life?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By taking the tree of life into him Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the life of the tree of life had gotten into him, he would have been born again!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He would have gotten another life, the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be born again simply means to get another life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>ANOTHER LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even though Adam was so perfect, so pure, so clean, and so good, with nothing changed, nothing damaged, nothing corrupted, or nothing ruined, he still needed the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Adam at the beginning just had one life, but if he had received the life of God he would have had two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Another life would have been added into him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is rebirth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be born again, strictly speaking, has nothing to do with our fall.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even if we are genuine, perfect, complete, pure, and clean, we still need God's life to come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When God's life gets in, we are regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE SOUL-LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible tells us that before we were regenerated we had our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This human life is in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Bible this is called the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The New Testament sometimes uses the word soul for this life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why in the King James Version of the New Testament, a number of times the word soul has been translated into life Matt 16:25; Luke 9:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This word for life in the original Greek text is the very word psuche or soul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE PHYSICAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We also have another kind of life the biological life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the life of the body, which in the Greek text is known as bios.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the root of the word biology.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Bios is in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When a person is dead physically, that doesn't mean his human life in the soul is dead, but it means his physical life, the bios, is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the soul you have the soulish life; in the body you have the physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a person is dead physically, he is dead bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That means his bios is dead but his psuche, his soul-life, is still existing.</S>
