<p class="bold">WEEK 8 — DAY 5</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 12:22, 24-26, 28-29</h2><p class="bold">22 &nbsp;Then there was brought to Him one possessed by a demon, blind and dumb, and He healed him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw.</p><p>24 &nbsp;But the Pharisees, hearing this, said, This man does not cast out the demons except by Beelzebul, ruler of the demons.</p><p>25 &nbsp;But knowing their thoughts, He said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself becomes desolate, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.</p><p>26 &nbsp;And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?</p><p class="bold">28 &nbsp;But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</p> <p class="bold">29 &nbsp;Or how can anyone enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will thoroughly plunder his house.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>In his Gospel Matthew does not give us a record of history; he takes the facts of history and puts them together to reveal the doctrine of the kingdom.…Now we must see that in order for the kingdom of the heavens to be established, there is the need of a spiritual battle, of spiritual fighting. This fighting is implied in 12:22-37.</p><p>Although the crowds were amazed [at the Lord’s healing of the blind and dumb man], the Pharisees were offended, unable to tolerate the fact that through an extraordinary miracle the Lord Jesus had gained all the crowds. Hence, these Pharisees had to say something to deal with the situation. According to verse 24, they said, “This man does not cast out the demons except by Beelzebul, ruler of the demons.” This was the greatest blasphemy heaped upon the heavenly King by the opposing Pharisees.</p><p>The Lord seemed to be saying to the Pharisees [vv. 25-26], “How could I cast out a demon by Satan? If I did this, then Satan would be fighting against Satan, and his kingdom could not stand.” Verse 26 is unique in the whole Bible in that no other verse opens the secret that Satan has his kingdom. Satan is the ruler of this world (John 12:31) and the ruler of the authority of the air (Eph. 2:2). He has his authority (Acts 26:18) and his angels (Matt. 25:41), who are his subordinates as rulers, authorities, and worldrulers of the darkness of this world (Eph. 6:12). Hence, he has his kingdom, the authority of darkness (Col. 1:13).</p><p>The Spirit of God is the power of the kingdom of God [v. 28]. Where the Spirit of God is in power, there the kingdom of God is, and there the demons have no ground. By the Lord’s word here we see that the battle fought for the kingdom is not fought by just a man himself, but by a man with the Spirit of God.</p><p>Verse 29 reveals that before the Lord cast out the demon, He firstly fought against Satan.…The “house” here signifies the kingdom of Satan, and “the strong man” is Satan, the evil one. The Greek word translated “vessels” also means instruments, apparatus; hence, goods, stuff. The fallen people, who are under Satan are his vessels, his instruments, and are for his use. They are his goods, kept in his house, his kingdom. The word about binding the strong man indicates that when the Lord cast out demons, He first bound Satan.…The way to bind the strong man is to pray.…The Lord’s word [in 17:21] to His disciples indicates that before He cast out a demon, He surely fasted and prayed. In order to bind the strong man, we must fast and pray. The Lord fasted and prayed secretly. The disciples did not see this. We must learn of the Lord to fast in secret and to pray in secret.…We all must be in the same spirit today. Every day our spirit must be a fasting spirit and a praying spirit so that we may daily bind the strong man, who is Satan, the king of the kingdom of darkness.
