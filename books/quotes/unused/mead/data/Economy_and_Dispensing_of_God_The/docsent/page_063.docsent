   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Learning Christ in the Divine Dispensing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>as the Truth Reality versus Vanity Is in Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The fourth principle is that we need to learn Christ as the truth is in Jesus Eph 4:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible is not a book of vain teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It teaches us something real.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In particular, it teaches us a person, Jesus Christ, who is divine as well as human.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is the complete God and the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Him we can see the wonderful, excellent, divine attributes, such as the divine love, light, and patience, lived out through the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to learn of this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus is humble, kind, and patient.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the truth in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To have the truth that is in Jesus is just to have God the Father as the reality living through our own humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our love is like a glove, and Christ's love is like the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without the hand, the glove is empty and has no reality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when the hand with the fingers enters into and fills the glove, the glove is filled with reality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to learn of this truth in Jesus, we need to adjust our own humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not remain in our Chinese or American disposition, taking it as an excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should adjust our humanity to that of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jesus lived the Father's life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the same way, we need to live His life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some brothers may be slow, whereas their wives may be quick.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both need to adjust themselves according to the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we live out our old humanity, there will always be arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Among couples today, divorce does not come mainly from big things, but from an accumulation of small things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we live a life according to the truth as it is in Jesus, there will be no divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Putting Off, as Regards</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>the Former Manner of Life,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>the Old Man, Which Is Being Corrupted</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>according to the Lusts of the Deceit</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>the Personification of Satan , and,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Being Renewed in the Spirit of the Mind,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Putting on, in the Divine Dispensing,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>the New Man, Which according to God</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Was Created in Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>and Holiness of the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>the Personification of God</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fifth principle is that we must put off, in regard to our former manner of life, the old man v. 22 . We have lived in our former manner of life for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today we must cease and put it off.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To put off the old man is just to put off our old habits.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to put off this old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul refers to deceit here as a personified thing, which is just Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Satan is the totality of deceit in the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whatever he proposes is a deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus said that Satan is the father of lies John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is the aggregate of deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This deceit is fully related to the old manner of life, which in its totality is a deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, to put off the old man is to put off Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After this, we need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind Eph 4:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that our mind should be filled with, saturated by, and under the control and direction of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this way, our spirit will become the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is by this spirit, which controls our mind, that we are being renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Finally, we need to put on the new man v. 24 . The way to put on the new man is in the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We do not live according to the old habits and the old manner of life, but live according to the present, up-to-date divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is to put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This new man is created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Truth here also is personified.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Deceit is Satan, and truth is the Triune God.</S>
