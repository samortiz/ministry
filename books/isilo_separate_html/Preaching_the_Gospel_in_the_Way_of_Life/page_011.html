We have to tell people that Christ today is all-inclusive. God is in Him, and man is in Him. We should not be afraid that they cannot understand this. Sometimes they can understand it better than we do. Recently some brothers went out to preach the gospel, telling people about the Body of Christ, God&#8217;s economy, and the spirit, soul, and body. Those that they spoke to were able to receive it. This is our gospel. We must have the assurance that we are ministering Christ to people, and this Christ whom we minister to others is the all-inclusive One. Not only is He the Savior and the Redeemer, but He is also the Head, the Lord, and the One on the throne with glory and authority.<p>In a living way we must tell people about Christ. We should not preach the old gospel. If we preach a living Christ, the Holy Spirit will honor our preaching, and the word that we speak will become the Spirit and life to others. Our word will become the word in their heart and in their mouth. Then we can point out to them that Christ is now in their heart and in their mouth because today Christ is in the Spirit and He is the Spirit. We may give them the illustration of electricity and radio waves. When the word is spoken at the radio station, it becomes radio waves that bring the word to every part of the earth. In this sense it becomes a living word. We may tell people, &#8220;Now I am speaking in the Spirit, and the Spirit is like electricity. My word is in the Spirit, so it is in you, in your heart, as the living Spirit who also is Christ. What you need now is simply to believe in Him and say to Him, &#8216;Lord Jesus.&#8217; If you will open your mouth to call Jesus the Lord, that means you are saved.&#8221; Then we can read them 1 Corinthians 12:3, which says, &#8220;Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; If a person says, &#8220;O Lord Jesus!&#8221;, this means that the Holy Spirit is moving within him.<p>There is no need to go out to teach people. We simply should go to make people genuine Christians in this way. We can do it very quickly. In one minute a person can be converted. We can say, &#8220;I am speaking for Christ, and I am speaking in Christ. Now Christ is in you. Would you say, &#8216;Lord Jesus&#8217;?&#8221; If the person does this, he will be saved. This depends on the faith that we exercise. If we go to a person and exercise our faith to such an extent, the Holy Spirit will honor it. Then we will see a real conversion, a real change in life in this man. There will be a real moving within him. That is the start of the work of the Holy Spirit. He will love the Lord, he will love the Scriptures, he will love to contact genuine Christians, and he will love to come to the meetings. This will prove that he has been saved. That he does not know much doctrine does not mean anything. We should not give him too much doctrine. Rather, we should help him in a living way.<p>Moreover, we should try not to argue with people, saying, &#8220;Sir, do you believe there is a God?&#8221; This opens the door for the enemy to come in to argue. It opens the door for argument and closes the door for believing. There is the fact, so there is no need to argue. There is God; there is no doubt about this. Whether or not someone acknowledges that there is a God, everyone believes deep within there is a God. Therefore, we should simply speak something in a living way about Christ. Just a few words are sufficient. Then the person we speak with will pray, &#8220;O Lord Jesus.&#8221; That is good enough. Once a person calls Jesus the Lord, he is saved. We should simply tell people to call Him the Lord.<p>We should also help the person to realize that Christ is everywhere. Christ is omnipresent, because He is in the Spirit and He is the Spirit today. He is like electricity and like the air. Wherever we are, electricity is there and the air is there. The way to receive Him is simply by saying &#8220;Lord Jesus.&#8221; Whenever a person would open his or her mouth to say &#8220;Lord Jesus,&#8221; we have to say, &#8220;Hallelujah, praise the Lord! Here is a soul gained through me.&#8221;<p>As a second step, we must tell this person that we are sinful and that we have to confess our sins. Then he will say, &#8220;Lord Jesus, I am sinful,&#8221; and we can help him to see that all his sins were put on Jesus when He was crucified. We can give him the gospel in this way. Many times we have to give someone the gospel after they call on the Lord Jesus. This can be compared to bringing him to America and then showing him the things in America. We need not tell him the things about America while he is still outside of it. We can bring him to America and say, &#8220;Look, here is Los Angeles; you are right here.&#8221; We must bring him into Christ and then tell him the things in Christ. Brothers, go and try to do this. These are some shortcuts for the preaching of the gospel.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
