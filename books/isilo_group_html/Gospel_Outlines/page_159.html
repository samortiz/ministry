<h1 class="title">WHOSOEVER CALLS UPON THE NAME<br />
OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rom. 10:13-14</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Lord is the Savior
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord is Jesus, the very Son of God who came as a man to redeem us.</li>
	<li>By His death and resurrection, He accomplished this redemption and became our Savior.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Call upon the name of the Lord
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>According to our thought, because we have neither seen Him nor touched Him it is difficult to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name.</li>
	<li>In reality it is easy. We do not need to see or touch Him; once we have heard of His name, we can just call.</li>
	<li>To call on the name of the Lord is just to call on the Lord Himself.</li>
	<li>To call on the name of the Lord is also to believe in the Lord. Romans 10:14 says, &ldquo;How then shall they call upon Him in Whom they have not believed?&rdquo; Therefore, calling includes believing.</li>
	<li>Believing includes repentance. &ldquo;Repentance&rdquo; means to turn our minds to God, confessing our sins.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Whosoever calls shall be saved
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To call is to believe; therefore, calling results in immediate salvation.</li>
	<li>When we call upon the Lord, the Holy Spirit brings God and His salvation to us. This proves that once we call, we are saved.</li>
	<li>The fact of our receiving this salvation is not based upon our feeling. If it seems that you have not received after calling, this is simply your feeling. In reality you have received because the Word says, &ldquo;Whosoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo;</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The meaning of being saved
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To be saved means to receive forgiveness of sins.</li>
	<li>To be saved also means to receive the life of God.</li>
	</ol></li>
