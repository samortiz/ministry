   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Peter had some experience by the time he wrote his first Epistle, and he could say, "Whom having not seen, you love."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>That is a marvelous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Where would you find a man who could love a fellow man he had never seen?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But Peter says that, though you have never seen the Lord, you love Him; and he goes on to say, "In whom though not seeing Him at present, yet believing, you exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory" 1 Pet 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Faith and love are in an unseen One.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>May the Lord show us how different He is from our conception of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If there is great exhilaration in our meetings we say, "Oh, the Lord is truly in the midst!"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But such a condition is no evidence of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the other hand, when the atmosphere is heavy and you find yourself thinking thoughts like these: "Alas!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I don't love the Lord as I ought.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How reluctant I've been to pay the price!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How I've failed to honor Him in my life!" then the God who hides Himself is positively at work in your life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes when you are out on the street or in your room, thoughts such as these come to you "What is the purpose of my life?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is the Lord getting out of it?" and it does not dawn upon you that that is the Lord at work within you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let me tell you: Those faint registrations in the depths of your being, those slight suggestions you thought were wholly your own because they were so natural those were the Lord's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The God who hides Himself is at work within your life, but He has hidden Himself so effectively that you have been quite unconscious of His activity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And He is working outwardly as well as inwardly in your home, in your business, in all your circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is creating many situations and is active in many directions, though He lets you sense nothing of it, until you imagine these things have just come about naturally; but both the inner and outer conditions of your life are under His control.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The very fact that the church has continued on this earth for nearly two thousand years is the result of the working of Him who is a God who hides Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is often true that the greater the display accompanying any work, the less the divine content; and the more silent the work and the less our awareness of it, the greater the divine content.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since all the work we do is done unto Him who hides Himself, it must be based on faith, not on sight.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I trust these words will help some of us to realize that when we are most conscious of impotence, God is often most powerfully present.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Don't look for greater things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Don't look for things other than they are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Don't set your expectation on some great vision or on some great experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And don't expect anything outward, for the God who hides Himself is at work within your life, and He is working mightily.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Your responsibility is to cooperate with Him by responding to His voice within that "still small voice," that voice that seems so much a part of your own feelings that you scarcely recognize it as a voice at all.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To that voice, registered in the deepest depths of your being, you must say, "Amen," for there, secretly and ceaselessly, the God who hides Himself is working.</S>
