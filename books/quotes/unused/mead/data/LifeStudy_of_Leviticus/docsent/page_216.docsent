   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. On the First Level the Appointing of Sudden Terror</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 26:14-17 we have the chastisement on the first level.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the appointing of sudden terror.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This refers to a threat that comes in suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A Consuming Disease and a Fever Causing the Eyesight to Fail and the Life to Waste Away, and the Enemy Eating What They Have Sown in Vain</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"I also will do this to you: I will appoint over you sudden terror, a consuming disease and a fever that will cause your eyesight to fail and your life to waste away; you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies will eat it" v. 16 . This signifies that we will be sick in the spirit and even in the body so that we lose our eyesight and our life, and the enemy will enjoy what we have done in emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Being Struck Down before the Ruling Enemies and Fleeing When No One Pursues</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"I will set My face against you, and you will be struck down before your enemies; those who hate you shall rule over you, and you will flee when no one pursues" v. 17 . This signifies that we will become so weak that we will not be able to stand before the enemies but will flee from them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a description of a church that is weak because of disobedience to God's warning.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. On the Second Level Being Disciplined Sevenfold</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verses 18 through 20 we have the chastisements on the second level.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here God's people are disciplined sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"And if after all this you will not listen to Me, then I will go on to discipline you sevenfold for your sins" v. 18 . Such a discipline is much more severe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Heavens Being Made like Iron, Giving No Rain</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"And I will break the pride of your power; I will make your heavens like iron and your earth like brass" v. 19 . This signifies that the Spirit will not come to us from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This word about the heavens being made like iron was fulfilled in the land of Palestine until World War I. History tells us that since this word was spoken and the children of Israel became disobedient to God's warning, the heaven above the holy land became hard as iron, giving no rain.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Also, because of the dryness, the soil was blown away.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This situation is a fulfillment of God's foretelling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Earth Being Made like Brass, Yielding No Produce</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Leviticus 26:19b tells us that the earth would be made like brass.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 20 continues, "Your strength shall be spent in vain, for your land shall not yield its produce, and the trees of the land shall not yield their fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This signifies that we will have no spiritual produce for our spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without satisfaction in food, it is hard to live securely.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not having food or security is the result of disregarding God's warning.</S>
