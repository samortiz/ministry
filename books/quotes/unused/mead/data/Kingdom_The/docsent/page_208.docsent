   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE JUDGE OF THE LIVING AND THE DEAD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Both Acts 10:42 and 2 Timothy 4:1 tell us that the Lord Jesus was appointed by God to judge the living and the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before the millennium the Lord Jesus will judge the living unbelievers on the throne of glory Matt 25:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the thousand years all the dead people of the nations will be resurrected, and the Lord Jesus will judge them at the great white throne Rev 20:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>So the Lord will be the judge of the living unbelievers before the millennium, and He will be the judge of the dead unbelievers after the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By these two judgments the Lord Jesus will fully clear up the situation among all the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From among the Christians the Lord Jesus desires to get a group of kings to rule over the earth with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From among the Jews the Lord Jesus desires to get a group of priests to teach people how to serve Him during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then from the Gentile world He desires to get a group of people who will be the nations during the millennium and also during the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, there are the kings, the priests, and the people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything works together for the kingdom!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must realize that the Gentiles at that time will only be preserved, not regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They will be preserved from being condemned and lost, but they will not be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>CREATION RESTORED</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Acts 3:21 says that heaven must receive the Lord Jesus until the times of restitution of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From the time of the fall of man, the whole of creation became degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since that time everything has been under decay and corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to Romans 8 all of creation is groaning under the bondage of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every new item soon becomes old because it is under the law of decay and corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A little baby looks so fresh, but an old man does not look fresh because he is under the process of decaying.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more we grow, the more we are decaying.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our physical body is under the principle of the bondage of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Lord Jesus comes back He will bring the restitution.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Restitution will be versus the corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything will be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Restitution is a kind of restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Speaking of the time of restitution, Isaiah 65:20 says, "There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die a hundred years old; but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During that time one who is a hundred years old will be considered as a child.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everyone will live hundreds of years.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Isaiah 11:6 further says, "The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the time of the restitution, or restoration, all the beasts will be meek and gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The lions and leopards and wild beasts will not hurt people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The children can play with the lions, the vipers, and the poisonous serpents.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Neither shall there be any more war.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The spears shall be made into plows.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There will be no more fighting; instead there will be farming.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That will be the time of real peace upon the earth, because everything will be restored and restituted.</S>
