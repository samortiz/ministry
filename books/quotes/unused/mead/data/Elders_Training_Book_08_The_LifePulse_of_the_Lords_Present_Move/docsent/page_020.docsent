   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord s Table</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For the Lord s table meeting it would be good to select some good messages on life and on the life supply according to your study and memory.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I call these nourishing messages to bring in a certain amount of nourishment to all the dear saints who come to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the remembrance rendered to the Lord, a half an hour can be spared in the meeting to speak that short, nourishing message.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I believe that everyone will receive the nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have gone to some Lord s table meetings where this was practiced, and I must testify that I received much nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, I have the assurance that this can nourish people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I did not speak anything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I sat there and listened to the speaking of those two or three pages and I got fully nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I have the assurance that no one who speaks something could render such a good, brief, crucial, and important word to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This message is composed of selected excerpts from our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the line of nourishment for the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Prayer Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then you should also select some spiritual messages from our publications on another line the spiritual principles of the Lord s service.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the end of each prayer meeting take half an hour to speak a short article on the spiritual principles of the Lord s service.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not despise small things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For the long run this will be very profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The saints will receive enlightenment through the speaking of some messages on the spiritual principles of the Lord s service every week.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who attend the Lord s table will also receive some nourishing messages week by week throughout the year.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Feeding the Saints Patiently and Regularly</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To raise up children, you cannot feed them with all the food they need for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have to feed them a little bit at a time, meal after meal, day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It takes a long time to raise up a child.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the elders should learn this way with patience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not expect to get things done once for all or overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are not the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Creator can say, Let there be light, but we cannot do that.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For us it takes time, especially in the matter of building up the church, which is altogether a matter in life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to take time to feed the saints with these messages in a proper way and to do it patiently and regularly year after year, always with some fresh prayer, seeking the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The principles are right and the application may be fresh if you have much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord will lead you to have a fresh way to apply all these principles, and what you do will be quite living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is what the elders should do.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not hard because you have a very rich store of groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Writing the Ministry Office for Permission</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have fellowshipped that for the prayer meeting, the home meeting, and the Lord s table, we need to cook a living message.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This can be done by taking excerpts from different books and messages of our publications to make one short message.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everyone who wants to use the materials from Living Stream Ministry in such a way should write to the ministry office for permission.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Your application should make it clear that you want to use the material for the purpose of the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The office will then give you a written answer with directions on how to give the proper credit for the material.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Laboring in the Word</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The elders need to labor in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I cannot eat for you, and there is no shortcut way to get the spiritual food into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The elders need to come together with some helpers and some full-timers to get into all the publications and prepare material for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you are a teacher, you must spend much time to prepare your own materials.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then you can teach the students in the most effective way because you first got into the material.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You must labor.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not try to save any time in your labor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you save one minute, you lose one percent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Saving ten minutes is to lose ten percent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The saving of time in your labor is actually a real loss.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I spent hours and hours writing the notes for the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I spent approximately one week composing note 6 6 in 1 John 1 concerning the word truth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You cannot put a big piece of salmon on the table for people to eat without cooking it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I digested what Kittel had to say concerning the word truth and then I composed the note on truth with eight items.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To take care of the church the elders need to labor in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no shortcut way or no convenience you can take.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The more you work on something, the better product you get.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You need to get into all the messages and digest all the portions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Out of your digestion you can make a message.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the best and most prevailing way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Use your time and do your best to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You may not have that much time, but use what time you have, trying your best to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is much more prevailing if you digest portions of the written ministry and then put these excerpts together to make a message.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When I say digest, this does not mean that you have to change.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not recompose.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Just put the excerpts together.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When I say for you to digest, that means that you really get into the real meaning of that portion.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then you know which portions to choose.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I do not mean to digest and recompose.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I do not agree with that.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I do not have the confidence that you can do something better.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I believe that after your recomposing, all the good flavor in my writings will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Note 26 1 in 1 Corinthians 14 tastes so sweet; the color is beautiful and the material is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You could not get anything to compare with that, so please do not recompose my writings.</S>
