   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN HAVING REAL SATISFACTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ONLY WHEN GOD AS THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ENTERS INTO MAN S SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God loves us and has created a stomach for us in our body that we may take in food.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Outside of us, God has prepared for us all kinds of food, including the supply from plants, the supply from animals, and the supply from minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God supplies man not only with food but also with drink.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Besides these provisions that are necessary for man s physical existence, something that is more precious within man is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God created man with a spirit for man to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The gospel we preach today is not merely to tell people that they are sinful and must therefore believe in Jesus to avoid perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, we tell people that the universe is a sphere created by God for Himself, that in it He could create man as a vessel in which He can put Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every human being, whoever he is, whether male or female, old or young, as soon as he approaches twenty years of age, deep in him there is an inexplicable question, What is the purpose of my life?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the meaning of the human life?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Where do the heavens and the earth come from?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is the universe all about?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, not only is this universe a mystery, but God also is a mystery, and even we ourselves are a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once I was invited to have supper with a group of doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One of them, a non-Christian, said to me, We who are students of medical science, after dissecting a corpse, cannot help but bow down our heads to confess that there is a Creator in this universe, because the human body is structured so wonderfully.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This word is true.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even for one like me who does not know medical science or any other science, I am amazed whenever I look at myself in the mirror.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The ears are facing the front and are shaped like an arc, resembling receivers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the ears faced the back and were not shaped like an arc, we would find it difficult to hear any sound.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, our nose facing down meets our exact need.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If our nose faced up, dust and rain water would get into the nostrils.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who has arranged and designed this for man?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only so, but man is truly a wonderful living creature with thoughts and wisdom, being able to produce a spacecraft to land on the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Are all these coincidences?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without a doubt, all these have been designed and created by the Supreme Being in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All those who study science, physics, and medicine ultimately say that there must be a Sovereign One in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Concerning this point, the Bible says clearly what heaven is, what the earth is, and what man is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible even tells us what God Himself is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 4:24 says, God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man has a spirit, and God is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man is God s vessel, and the pneumatic God wants to enter into man to be his content to satisfy him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In other words, since man is a vessel created by God, without God, man can never be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the same as the human stomach, which is for containing food.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without food, the stomach will definitely feel hungry, uncomfortable, and unsatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Take the example of one from a humble origin who finally becomes successful after many years of hard work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is successful in his career and is respected by others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He does not have to worry about his daily necessities, and you may say that he has enjoyed all honor and fame.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both in his physical and psychological needs, he has a way to attain to the highest and best level.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet at this juncture he discovers that he has a lack in the depth of his being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Within him he has a very deep thirst which cannot be satisfied by material things and amusements.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the real situation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even though there is a difference in degree concerning our outward material life, there rises up in the deepest part of every man s heart an inexplicable sigh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without God, man is in a state of emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>MAN NEEDING GOD TO BE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE STABILIZING POWER IN HIS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Human beings, regardless of race or skin color, have the need to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Of all the living creatures, only man feels the need of worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have never seen a cow or a horse erect a small temple to worship God; neither have we seen a cat or a dove setting up something as a symbol of God for worship.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, the concept of worshipping God is very common among the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even the least civilized aborigines set up a bonfire to worship as god.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From this we can see that the human heart desperately desires to find the true God who created the universe and all things in it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is a story of someone whose heart was hardened and who did not believe in God, yet at his deathbed, when he was asked if he needed anything, he replied that he wanted a Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Though man may deny the existence of God in broad daylight, in the deep of the night, in solitude and quietness, when he examines himself, he worries as to what he should do if there really is God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This tells us that man was created by God and that he was even created for God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, man needs God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hundreds of thousands of Christians can bear the same testimony that their human life had been empty for more than half of their life until they met Jesus and called on His name and that they became satisfied within because of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many friends who have not yet believed in the Lord wonder why Christians seem to have something extra, something as a motor in them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some Christians previously spoke little, yet after they believed in Jesus, they try their best to preach Jesus to others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Not just one or two but nearly all of them are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is because the believers of Jesus have tasted the sweetness of the Lord, and they have obtained real satisfaction and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Previously their human life was like a big boat tossing in the sea, without any stabilizing power within.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But now that they have gained Jesus as their Savior and therefore have a stabilizing power, how can they refrain from preaching to others?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our human life is like a boat in the sea, and there is the real need of a stabilizing power.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This stabilizing power is the God who has created us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is waiting to enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once God enters into us, He can satisfy our heart and remove our sense of vanity and despair.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May the Spirit of God operate in each one of us that we may gain Him as the Savior of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A message given on December 6, 1985 at a gospel meeting in Taipei.</S>
