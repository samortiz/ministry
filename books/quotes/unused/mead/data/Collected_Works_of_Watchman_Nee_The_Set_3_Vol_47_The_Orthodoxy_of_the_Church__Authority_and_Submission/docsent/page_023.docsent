   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I have already brought forth much Scripture as a basis for showing that we are all priests.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But now there is an argument between God and men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since God says that everyone in the church is qualified to be a priest, why do men say that spiritual authority is only in the hands of the mediatorial class such as the fathers?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I repeat, as many as are redeemed with the precious blood are priests.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why does the Lord not rebuke Philadelphia, but rather praise her?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Remember that the beginning of the mediatorial class was at Pergamos and the practice of the mediatorial class was in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They have the popes who exercise dominion over them, they have the high officials exercising authority over them, and they have the Vatican the church-palace high officials, etc. But the Lord says, "You all are brothers.'' Hold fast to Matthew 23:8 and 20:26.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible does not have the system of pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord said, "Do not call anyone on earth your father, for One is your Father....Neither be called instructors, because One is your Instructor'' 23:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the Roman Catholic Church uses the term father, and the Protestant churches use the term pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the nineteenth century there was a great revival which abolished the mediatorial class.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A great recovery transpired after Sardis: The brothers loved one another, and the mediatorial class was abolished in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1825 in Dublin, the capital of Ireland, there were several believers whose hearts were moved by God to love all the children of the Lord, regardless of their denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This kind of love was not to be frustrated by the walls of denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They began to see that in the Scriptures God says there is but one Body of Christ, regardless of how many sects men may divide her into.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They further read the Scriptures and saw that the system of one man administering the church and one man preaching was not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So they began to meet every Lord's Day to break bread and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1825 after more than a thousand years of the Roman Catholic Church and several hundred years of the Protestant churches there was the first return to the simple, free, and spiritual worship in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the beginning there were but two persons; later, there were four or five.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the world's eyes these believers were lowly and unknown.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But they had the Lord in their midst and the consolation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They stood on the ground of two clear truths: First, the church is the Body of Christ and the Body is one, and second, there is no clergy system in the New Testament, that is, all the ministers of the Word set up by men are not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They believed that all true believers were the members of this one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They warmly welcomed all who came into their midst, regardless of their denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They did not have the consciousness of any sect.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They believed that all true believers had the office of the priest and could freely enter into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They also believed the ascended Lord had given various gifts to the church for the perfecting of the saints, for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, they were able to depart from the two sins of the clergy system offering sacrifices and one man preaching the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These principles enabled them to welcome all who were in Christ as their brothers and to be open to all the ministers of the Word who were ordained by the Holy Spirit to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During this time there was a clergyman in the Anglican Church by the name of John Nelson Darby who was very dissatisfied with the position of his own church, believing that it was not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He also met frequently with the brothers, although at that time he still wore the uniform of the Anglican clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was a man of God, a man of great power, and a man willing to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was also a spiritual man who knew God and the Bible and judged the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1827 he officially left the Anglican Church, put off the uniform of the clergy, and became a simple brother meeting together with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Originally what the brothers saw was rather limited, but when Darby joined, the light of heaven poured down like a torrent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In many aspects the work of Darby was similar to that of Wesley, but his attitude toward the Anglican Church was entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the previous century Wesley felt he could not leave the state church with peace; a century later Darby felt he could not continue in the Anglican Church with peace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But as to zealousness, wholeheartedness, and faithfulness, they were alike in many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was in that same year that J. G. Bellett also attended the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He also was an exceedingly deep and spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This kind of meeting, which was simple yet scriptural, moved him greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Concerning the condition at that time, he had this to say:</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A brother has just been telling me that it appeared to him from Scripture that believers, meeting together as disciples of Christ, were free to break bread together as their Lord had admonished them; and that, in as far as the practice of the apostles could be a guide, every Lord's day should be set apart for thus remembering the Lord's death and obeying his parting command.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At another time J. G. Bellett said:</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Walking one day with a brother as we were passing down Lower Pembroke Street, he said to me: "This I doubt not is the mind of God concerning us we should come together in all simplicity as disciples, not waiting on any pulpit or ministry, but trusting that the Lord would edify us together by ministering as He pleased and saw good from the midst of ourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the moment he spoke these words, I was assured my soul had got the right idea, and that moment I remember as if it were but yesterday, and could point you out the place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It was the birthday of my mind, may I so speak, as a brother.</S>
