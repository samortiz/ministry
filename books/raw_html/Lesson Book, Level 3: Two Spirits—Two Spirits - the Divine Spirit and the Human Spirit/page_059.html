<h1 class="msg">Lesson Seventeen</h1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE MINGLED SPIRIT</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Scripture Reading</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>1 Cor. 6:17; Rom. 8:4; 2 Tim. 4:22; 2 Cor. 3:17; Rom. 8:16.</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Outline</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>One spirit with the Lord	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Two spirits mingled as one</li>	<li>No third nature produced</li>	</ol></li><li>The Spirit witnessing with our spirit</li><li>Walking according to the mingled spirit</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Text</H2><P>[Physically we were born of our parents, but when we were regenerated, we were "born of the Spirit" (John 3:6). By believing in the Lord Jesus, our spirit was born of the Spirit. The all-inclusive Spirit came into our spirit to regenerate it with the divine life.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</H2><P>[One of the greatest verses in the Bible, 1 Corinthians 6:17, says, "He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit." The implications of this verse are marvelous and far-reaching. We, the believers, are one spirit with the Lord. How tremendous! This implies that we are in Him and that He is in us. It also implies that we and He have been mingled, blended organically, to become one in life. To be one spirit with the Lord implies that we and He are a living entity. We simply do not have words to explain the significance of this verse. To say that we are one spirit with the Lord definitely does not mean that we are deified. However, it certainly does imply the mingling of divinity with humanity. In the words of #501 in Hymns, "God mingled with humanity lives in me my all to be." To be one spirit with the Lord means that we are blended with Him organically and mingled with Him in life.]</P><P>[The word translated spirit in Romans 8:4, and in several other verses in Romans 8, presents a problem to translators. It is hard to decide whether to regard spirit as referring to the Holy Spirit and capitalize it, or to consider that it is the human spirit and not capitalize it. The spirit here refers to the mingled spirit, our spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit. We need another size letter to denote this, neither a capital letter nor a small one! These two spirits, the divine and the human, have become one (1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22; 2 Cor. 3:17).]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Two Spirits Mingled as One</H2><P>[The Lord today is the life-giving Spirit, and we have a human spirit purposely created by God that we may take Christ as the life-giving Spirit into us. Now these two spirits have become one. This is wonderful! Our spirit is one with the Lord, because as the life-giving Spirit He indwells our spirit. But the Lord in our spirit is not like a drop of oil in water, never mingling with the water. He mingles with us in our spirit as tea mingles with water. This is why many times it is difficult to distinguish whether it is we or the Lord doing things. We have some burden, yet it seems the Lord wants to do it. It is because we are one with the Lord in our spirit. After tea is put into water, it is difficult to separate the tea from the water. That is why I call it tea-water. It is both tea and water. The two mingle as one. In the same way, the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit mingles with our spirit as one. He is in us, and we are in Him. It seems that a brother is speaking, but while he is speaking, the Lord is also speaking. He speaks within that brother. His speaking is the brother's speaking, and the brother's speaking is His speaking. Eventually, a mingled one is speaking. Praise the Lord! We are really one spirit with the Lord.]</P>
