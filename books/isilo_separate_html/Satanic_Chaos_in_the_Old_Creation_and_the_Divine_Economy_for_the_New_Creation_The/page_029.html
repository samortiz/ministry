Gnostics Coming In<br>to Carry the Believers Off through Their Philosophy<br>according to the Tradition of Men<br>and the Elements of the World<br>and Not according to Christ</H2><P>Gnostics, people of Greek philosophy, came in to carry the believers off through their philosophy according to the tradition of men and the elements of the world and not according to Christ (Col. 2:8). The activity of the Gnostics caused much dissension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>k. The Teaching of Different Things<br>Other Than God's Economy in Faith Being Carried On</H2><P>The teaching of different things other than God's economy in faith was carried on (1 Tim. 1:3-4). Both at Paul's time and today, there were different teachings, teachings other than the divine economy taught by Paul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>l. The Winds of Teaching in the Sleight of Men,<br>in Craftiness, Invading the Churches</H2><P>The winds of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness, invaded the churches (Eph. 4:14). We know what the winds of teaching are, for we have seen them and experienced them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>m. Division-makers Rising Up</H2><P>In Romans 16:17 Paul says, "I exhort you, brothers, to mark those who make divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them." This indicates that division-makers had risen up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>n. Factious (Sectarian) Men Existing in the Churches</H2><P>In Titus 3:10 Paul says, "A factious man, after a first and second admonition, refuse." This tells us that factious (sectarian) men existed in the churches. Such sectarian men cause divisions by forming parties in the church according to their own opinions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>o. The Two Sister Co-workers,<br>Euodias and Syntyche, Being in Discord</H2><P>The two sister co-workers, Euodias and Syntyche, were in discord (Phil. 4:2-3a). It is easy for sisters to be in discord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>p. James and the Elders in Jerusalem Exhorting Paul<br>to Keep the Ordinances of the Jewish Law</H2><P>James and the elders in Jerusalem exhorted Paul to keep the ordinances of the Jewish law (Acts 21:18-26). It is hard to believe that the leading elders in Jerusalem exhorted Paul to go back to the temple and, under the priests in Judaism, to keep the ordinance of their law. But this is what they did, and Paul followed their exhortation. However, the Lord did not allow Paul to complete the ceremony. On the last day of the ceremony, there was a turmoil, and Paul was put into prison. Eventually, Paul was transferred to a prison in Rome. He was released, but within a year he was arrested again and martyred.</P><P>What would you say about Paul's situation? Some might say that Paul made a mistake and was not faithful in his ministry, and that was the reason he was put into prison and was eventually brought to Rome to be judged directly by Caesar. No doubt, in Acts 21 there was great chaos. However, without this chaos we would not have the books of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus. Deep truths concerning the church life, the Christian life, and God's economy with the divine dispensing are in these books. If these books were not in the New Testament, there would be a great lack. While Paul was in prison, he wrote epistles that are filled with wonderful, high revelation. This indicates that the chaos eventually enabled something most excellent to be produced. Furthermore, Paul's martyrdom has been an encouragement to saints throughout the centuries. Thus, what the enemy did in that chaotic situation became a profit to God's interests.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
