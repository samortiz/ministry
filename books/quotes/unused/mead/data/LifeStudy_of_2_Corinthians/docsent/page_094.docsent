   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX A NEW CREATION IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BECOMING GOD S RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE SECOND STEP</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF RECONCILIATION 1 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 5:1-21</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 2 Corinthians 5 Paul covers a number of important points.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us briefly enumerate these points and then go on to consider them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>SIX IMPORTANT MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First in this chapter Paul covers the longing to be clothed upon with a transfigured body 5:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is related to the redemption of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul desired to be clothed upon with a transfigured body, with a body in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verses 1 and 2 he says, For we know that if our earthly tabernacle house is taken down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For indeed in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our dwelling place from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The second matter covered by Paul in this chapter is the ambition to please the Lord: Wherefore also we are ambitious, whether at home or away from home, to be well-pleasing to Him v. 9 . Here to be ambitious is to be zealous with a strong aim, to strive earnestly to be well-pleasing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all should have the ambition to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not be ambitious to have some kind of position in the church life, but we should be ambitious to be well-pleasing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The third point is being constrained to live to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verses 14 and 15 Paul says, For the love of Christ constrains us, having judged this, that One died on behalf of all; therefore all died; and He died on behalf of all, that those who live may no longer live to themselves, but to Him Who died for them and has been raised.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In these verses Paul speaks of being constrained to live not for the Lord, but to live to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verses 16 and 17 Paul goes on to mention a fourth matter, the new creation: So that we, from now on, know no one according to flesh; even if we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So that if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Fifth, in verses 18 through 20 Paul speaks regarding the ministry of reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 18 he says, But all things are of God, Who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 19 he speaks of the word of reconciliation, and in verse 20 he entreats the saints on behalf of Christ to be reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Finally, in verse 21 we have the crucial matter of God s righteousness: Him Who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God s righteousness in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Apparently these six matters are of different categories and are not related to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, it is possible to read this chapter without seeing any continuation between one point and another.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, there is a continuation, and it is not difficult to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not only do the important points in chapter five continue one another, but chapter five is itself a continuation of chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is indicated by the fact that 5:1 begins with the word for.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For indicates that what is to be covered in this chapter is an explanation of what is spoken in 4:13-18.</S>
