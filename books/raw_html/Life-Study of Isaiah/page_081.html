<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Afflicted Increasing Their Joy in Jehovah</H2><P>The afflicted will increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor of mankind will exult in the Holy One of Israel (v. 19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. He Who Terrorizes Ceasing to Be</H2><P>He who terrorizes will cease to be, and the scorner will be consumed, and all who watch for iniquity will be cut off (v. 20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Those Who Have Erred<br>in Spirit Coming to Understand</H2><P>Those who have erred in spirit will come to understand, and the murmurers will learn teaching (v. 24). This means that they will acquire wisdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The House of Jacob Not Being Ashamed</H2><P>The house of Jacob will not be ashamed, nor will his face turn pale (v. 22). They will sanctify the name of Jehovah, the Holy One of Jacob (v. 23). This means that they will point to, in the distance, the coming Christ as the wisdom and reality to God's redeemed people (1 Cor. 1:24, 30; John 1:17b) that they may be the true worshippers of God (John 4:23-24).</P><P>If we are clean, clear, and full of understanding, we will realize that the situation among humankind today is of two aspects. First, everyone is drunk. People are drunk with today's modern fashion and style. They do not love the Lord but love other things. Second, people are not genuine, not true, but false. This is the situation of fallen humankind. Even among God's elect drunkenness and hypocrisy may be present. If we do not pray with a watchful spirit, these two things may enter into the church life. God's people may become drunken by loving things other than the Lord, and they may be hypocritical in their praying and testifying. Whenever this kind of situation invades God's elect, He must come in to exercise His judgment upon the drunkards and upon hypocrisy in worship.</P>
