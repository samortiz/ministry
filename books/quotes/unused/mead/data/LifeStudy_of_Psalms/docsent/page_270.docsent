   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. CHRIST EXECUTING HIS JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OVER THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 94 reveals that Christ will execute His judgment over the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 1 says, "O God of vengeance, O Jehovah, /O God of vengeance, shine forth!"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because there is a great deal of injustice on earth today, there is the need for the God of vengeance to shine forth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Christ reigns He will shine, and this shining will be His vengeance executed over the unjust world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 10 says, "He who disciplines the nations,/He who teaches man knowledge, does He not reprove?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When Christ reigns He will discipline the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Apparently this is not happening today, for it may seem that God is not doing anything regarding world affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, God is reigning and, at least to some extent, He has been disciplining the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For instance, in World War II He dealt with Hitler, Mussolini, and Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the coming kingdom age, Christ will discipline every nation much like a father disciplines his children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time, the judgment in this world will return unto righteousness v. 15a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>CHRIST AS A GREAT KING</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>POSSESSING THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In these psalms the earth, the world, the peoples, and the nations are mentioned again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Psalm 95 unveils Christ as a great King possessing the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jehovah as Christ is a great King above all gods v. 3 . In His hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are His also v. 4 . The sea is His.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He made it, and His hands formed the dry land v. 5 . Therefore, the psalmist says, "Come, let us worship and bow down;/Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker" v. 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>CHRIST COMING TO JUDGE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE EARTH, THE WORLD, AND THE PEOPLES</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS AND TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>AND REIGNING OVER THE NATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 96:3-13 we see that Christ will come to judge the earth, the world, and the peoples with righteousness and truth and that He will reign over the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word "peoples" in verses 3, 5, 7, 10, and 13 indicates that people of every race and color will be judged by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 13 the psalmist concludes by saying that Jehovah "is coming to judge the earth;/He will judge the world with righteousness,/And the peoples with His truth."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This surely reveals that God will recover His title and right over the earth through the reign of Christ.</S>
