        <h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND OVERCOMING SATAN</h2>
<p>Overcoming Satan is another experience that a believer should have after being saved. God&rsquo;s plan includes our overcoming of Satan, who is God&rsquo;s unique enemy in the universe. The world and the flesh are at enmity with God, but they are out of Satan and belong to Satan. The world and the flesh are instruments and puppets used by Satan to resist God. Everything in the universe that is contrary to God and that opposes God is out of Satan and belongs to Satan. Satan is the aggregate of all resistance to God in the universe, and thus, he is God&rsquo;s greatest problem. Ever since Satan rebelled, everything that God has done in the universe has included the purpose of dealing with and destroying Satan.</p>
<p>In order to express His wisdom, God determined that man should deal with Satan through the cross (Eph. 3:10). As the Creator, God would not deal with a rebellious creature, Satan. Instead, God determined that created man would deal with Satan, a created archangel who rebelled (Isa. 14:12; Heb. 2:14). Satan knew that God created man to deal with him, so he came to the garden of Eden to ruin and deceive man shortly after man had been created (Gen. 3:1-13). At that time God judged Satan and said that the seed of the woman would bruise Satan on the head (v. 15). The seed of the woman is the incarnated Son of God, Jesus the Nazarene, who was born of a virgin (John 1:14; Matt. 1:22-25).</p>
<p>After Satan ruined the first man&mdash;Adam, whom God created to deal with Satan&mdash;God was incarnated to be the second man&mdash;Christ&mdash;in order to deal with Satan (1 Cor. 15:47). God sent His Son to deal with and destroy Satan (1 John 3:8). The Lord Jesus, however, did not deal with Satan as the Son of God; He dealt with Satan as the Son of Man. One reason for His becoming a man was to deal with Satan as a man in humanity. The Lord Jesus did not take the position of the Son of God when He dealt with Satan; rather, He took the position of the Son of Man (Matt. 4:3-4; Luke 4:3-4). He put on blood and flesh in order to be crucified as a man in the flesh so that through His crucifixion in the flesh, He might destroy Satan, who was joined to man&rsquo;s flesh. Thus, the Lord Jesus dealt a fatal blow to Satan (Heb. 2:14).</p>
<p>Through His death on the cross as a man, God destroyed the man-corrupting Satan. As the seed of the woman, He bruised the serpent on the head and gave Satan a deathblow. Only Christ&rsquo;s death as a man in the flesh on the cross was able to fatally deal with Satan. In order for us to deal with Satan, we must experience the death of His cross. The cross of Christ is our means to deal with Satan and overcome him.</p>
<p>When Satan corrupted man by enticing man to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he joined himself to man (Gen. 3:1-6). Thus, Satan is joined to fallen man in man&rsquo;s flesh. When the Lord Jesus, who was clothed in the flesh, was crucified, He crucified man&rsquo;s flesh and also destroyed Satan, who was joined to man&rsquo;s flesh. Therefore, when the flesh was crucified on the cross, Satan was also destroyed on the cross. When a person&rsquo;s flesh is put to death through the cross, Satan is destroyed as well. Just as dealing with the flesh and putting the flesh to death are through the cross, overcoming Satan and destroying Satan are also through the cross.</p>
<p>Through the cross Christ destroyed Satan. We should believe this fact, accept it, and apply it. By the Spirit we must apply the death of Christ that crucified the flesh and destroyed Satan so that Satan may be destroyed and annihilated in us. By applying the death of the cross and standing in His death, we can triumph over Satan and his authority of darkness (Col. 2:15). We cannot overcome Satan in ourselves, nor do we need to overcome him in ourselves. The Lord has already overcome Satan on the cross. Satan is an enemy who has already been defeated and destroyed on the cross. We only need to stand in our co-crucifixion with the Lord and hold fast the victory that the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion has won for us in order to triumph over Satan and his angels. When we stand in the death of the cross and triumph over Satan by the cross, we will overcome Satan. The experience of overcoming Satan is through the cross of Christ and depends on the cross of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND CHRIST BEING LIVED OUT OF US</h2>
<p>Christ being lived out of us is the center of our spiritual experience. It is the most precious aspect of our spiritual experience, and it is the sweetest aspect of our spiritual experience. God saved us so that we would deal with Satan, on the negative side, and so that Christ would be lived out of us, on the positive side. We live Christ through the cross. When we received Christ as our Savior, He entered into us to be our life and to be lived out of us. However, He can be lived out of us only to the extent that we have been broken by the cross. If the cross has not dealt with our flesh, put our self to death, or broken our natural life, there is no way for Christ to be lived out of us.</p>
<p>Christ can be lived out of us only when we accept the breaking of the cross, letting the cross work on us and put our self and natural life to death. Christ can be lived out of us only if we can say, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). When His cross operates in us, the power of His life can be manifested from within us (2 Cor. 4:10). If we accept the dealing of the cross in every situation, Christ will be magnified in our body. Furthermore, if we accept the breaking of His cross, we will reach the point where we say that for us, &ldquo;to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21). Christ is lived out of us and magnified in our body through the breaking of the cross (v. 20). The experience of living out Christ is always through the cross. There is no way for us to live out Christ apart from the cross.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
