   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RIGHTEOUSNESS, LOVE, AND GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Righteousness, or justice, is a judicial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Love, on the contrary, is a matter of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If I love you, I may choose to pay attention to you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if I do not love you, I may simply forget about you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many Christians like to quote John 3:16, the verse that says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yes, God has so loved the world, but His love is not as firm as His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God, of course, will not change in His love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But suppose His love did change.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has the right to change in His love, but He does not have the right to change in His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether God loves us or gives us up, He is not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He also would not be wrong in showing grace to us or in not showing grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Grace is a matter of God s wish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Matthew 20 the Lord told Peter that He wanted to give the same reward to the last as to the first.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a matter of the Lord s wish, and there is nothing wrong with it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But righteousness is a matter neither of emotion nor of wish; it is a judicial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A judicial matter is related to the execution of the law, to legislation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God s gospel is altogether a judicial matter, a matter of divine legislation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has saved us judicially.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of course, God s salvation is initiated by His love and accomplished through His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, however, it issues in His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the salvation we have received today is not merely a matter of love or of grace, but also a judicial matter of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our salvation has been sealed and confirmed by God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now not even God Himself can change our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE KINGDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>BUILT UPON RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is upon this righteousness that the kingdom of God is built.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Have you seen the contrast between man s unrighteousness and God s righteousness, between man s kingdom and God s kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man s kingdom is not built upon righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This fact was fully exposed in the way Pilate, the Roman governor, dealt with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In chapter twenty-six Matthew fully exposed the weakness of Peter s natural life, and in chapter twenty-seven he exposed man s unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man s unrighteousness is even seen after the burial of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together to Pilate and said to him, Sir, we remembered that that deceiver said, while he was still living, After three days I will arise.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Command therefore that the grave be secured until the third day, lest the disciples come and steal him away and say to the people, He was raised from the dead; and the last deception will be worse than the first 27:63-64 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Pilate replied, You have a guard; go, make it as secure as you know how v. 65 . Pilate s answer to the chief priests and Pharisees was unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Later, in 28:11-15, the chief priests and the elders bribed the soldiers, paying them to lie about the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This shows that the Roman soldiers also were unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, regarding man s government, the record is filled with unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This exposes the fact that man s government is built upon unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But God s government is built upon righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Righteousness is the solid foundation of God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are saved under God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the foundation of our salvation is solid.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In chapter twenty-seven we have seen man s unrighteousness and God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Praise the Lord that eventually man s unrighteousness turned into God s righteousness!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We used to be in man s unrighteousness, but now we are under God s righteousness and in God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God s kingdom is the kingdom of righteousness, and we are the righteous people in His kingdom.</S>
