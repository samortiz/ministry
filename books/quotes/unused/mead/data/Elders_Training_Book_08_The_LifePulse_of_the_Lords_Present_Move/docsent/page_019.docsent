   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE TRUTH LESSONS 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:4; 3:15; 2 Tim 2:2, 15 BEING IN ONE ACCORD WITH NO OPINIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The victories we have enjoyed in the past were one hundred percent due to the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I say this as an encouragement to all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all have to be in one accord with no opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To carry on the Lord s recovery we do not need to have any opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should have the confidence in the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may be a little smarter than the ones who are taking the lead or who made the decision.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet if you express your opinion, that will only delay the time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your way may take twenty-five minutes, while the way decided upon may take thirty-five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This ten minute difference is not worth your opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By discussing your opinion, what we want to do may take half an hour or even two hours longer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It may even create dissension or division.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is what we are suffering from today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the leadership in the recovery proposes to build an idol temple, I will take the lead to oppose it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I believe that we realize that the leading in the Lord s recovery is absolutely according to the entire revelation of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Based upon the fellowship in Book 7 in this series of the Elders Training, we have a clear view, a definite vision, a definite leadership, and a definite way for us to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>PREPARING MESSAGES FOR THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We saw in the previous chapter that materials should be prepared for all the different meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By the Lord s mercy, He has given us many messages and has opened up the entire New Testament to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do not mean that He has opened up the New Testament to us in the fullest way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I still believe that the Lord will show us more and more in the future, but thank Him that He has really opened up His word in the New Testament to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many publications are here for you to labor on.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is easy for you to pick up the groceries which you feel fit your present need.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You can select some groceries to cook a proper meal for your church at any time according to the condition or situation of the church in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you would do this and if you know how to do it, you will surely have a success.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Home Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am quite concerned for our meetings, especially for the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not have a bit of confidence in someone s speaking in each of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just for one gathering of every local church, the speaking has already been a hard problem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For your church to take care of one gathering with a proper message given has been and still is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you could not handle the speaking for one group so well, how will you be able to handle the speaking for many groups?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why I do not have the confidence in this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I do have the confidence, however, in your laboring in the Word to learn how to prepare the messages, using all the groceries in our present, existing publications.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you are willing to do this and learn how to do this, you will enjoy a success.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For the small gatherings it is better to prepare some living messages consecutively, week after week.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These messages should be according to the present need of your local church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You need to consider what the best word would be to take care of the present need in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Also, the ones who are going to take care of the home meetings should be trained and should learn how to be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We expect that all the home meetings would do their best to bring their neighbors, relatives, friends, colleagues, and schoolmates.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The home meetings should be very flexible since we should always expect to have some new ones there and some unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even if you have something printed for the whole meeting to read, to speak, you must be flexible to take care of the new ones and the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This all depends upon the elders training the saints in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to put out a message every week for one home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You could use the crucial points we pointed out from Paul s fourteen Epistles see Book 6 in this series on the Elders Training .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But you still need to work on these points, to cook them, and to shorten them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You have to train the saints and let them know that there is no need or requirement that in every meeting they must finish the printed matter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes the situation does not allow them to finish it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You do not need to be that legal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You do not need to rescue that message.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You have to rescue the meeting, rescue the need.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose that one evening in the home gathering over fifteen new ones come.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You have to be flexible enough to forget about the message.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Just take care of the fifteen new ones to give them a good message of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Immediately turn that meeting into a gospel-preaching meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why the saints need to be trained in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the attendants of the church in that home meeting have to be on the alert to turn that meeting into a gospel preaching meeting in order to take care of the fifteen new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not be legal.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The message that was prepared can be postponed for next week s home meeting.</S>
