<p>Satan, the evil spirits, and the demons know that God&rsquo;s intention is to destroy them through the man Jesus Christ; hence, they will not confess that &ldquo;Jesus Christ has come in the flesh&rdquo; (4:2-3). They know that the Lord Jesus came in His status as the Son of Man, not as the Son of God, in order to destroy them. Therefore, when the Lord Jesus came forth to work for God, Satan tempted Him to forsake His position as the Son of Man (Matt. 4:1-7). Twice Satan said to Him, &ldquo;If You are the Son of God&rdquo; (vv. 3, 6). His intention was to tempt the Lord to stand in His position as the Son of God and thus abandon His position as the Son of Man. Therefore, in verse 4 the Lord replied, &ldquo;Man shall...live.&rdquo; The Lord emphasized <em>man</em>. He knew that Satan&rsquo;s subtle intention was for Him to leave His position as the Son of Man; hence, He said, &ldquo;Man shall... live.&rdquo; In His answers the Lord proved that He was a man living before God. He was a man through whom God could deal with Satan. Satan could not carry out his subtle intention and had to depart because the Lord stood firmly in His position as a man.</p>
<p>Even though the Lord repeatedly said that He was the Son of Man, Satan&rsquo;s subordinates, the demons, repeatedly cried out that He was the Son of God (8:29). They would not confess that the Lord was the Son of Man, because they knew that He had come in His status as the Son of Man in order to deal with them.</p>
<p>When the Lord&rsquo;s ministry on earth was coming to an end, Satan used the high priest to tempt the Lord in the same way that he had tempted the Lord in the wilderness. This was Satan&rsquo;s final effort to tempt the Lord to leave His position as the Son of Man. The high priest asked, &ldquo;Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God&rdquo; (26:63). Although the Lord answered, &ldquo;You have said rightly,&rdquo; He added emphatically, &ldquo;You will see the Son of Man&rdquo; (v. 64). Satan constantly tried to tempt the Lord to leave His position as the Son of Man, but the Lord remained in His position as the Son of Man in order to deal with Satan.</p>
<p>Today the evil spirits are not willing to confess that the Lord has come in the flesh (1 John 4:2-3). They will not confess that He is a man. The evil spirits know that the Lord became flesh in order to accomplish redemption and to deal with them.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Satan is unwilling to confess that the Lord Jesus is the Son of Man. On the other hand, he does not want people to confess that the Lord Jesus is God, the Son of God. Satan knows that once he confesses that the Lord is the Son of Man, he will be destroyed, and he also knows that any person who confesses that the Lord is the Son of God will receive eternal life and be saved. Therefore, Satan confesses that the Lord is the Son of God but not the Son of Man, and he causes people to confess that the Lord is the Son of Man but not the Son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOING BEYOND THE TEACHING OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>There are some who go beyond the teaching of Christ and reject the truth that Christ has two natures&mdash;divinity and humanity (2 John 9). Some people confess that Jesus was only a noble man, a religionist, a reformer, a person of universal love who served humanity and sacrificed for others, a model for human society, a teacher, and a philosopher. But they do not confess that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God, who is one with God and is God. The Bible refers to such persons as antichrists (1 John 2:22). Such persons say that they believe in Christ, but they do not believe or confess that Jesus is the Christ. They may call themselves Christians, but they oppose and blaspheme Christ.</p>
<p>This kind of speaking concerning Christ is an invention of evil spirits that comes out of man&rsquo;s rebellious mind; it is not the revelation given to man by the Holy Spirit and the Word of God. Such speaking goes beyond the teaching of Christ and does not confess that Christ is both God and man, possessing both divinity and humanity. Hence, those who have been saved by grace should reject persons who go beyond the teaching of Christ. God&rsquo;s children should not receive or even greet such ones in order to avoid sharing in their evil works of opposing and blaspheming Christ (2 John 10-11). We must neither associate with such ones nor fellowship with them, because their teaching and speaking deny the person of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OTHER ERRONEOUS CONCEPTS</h2>
<p>There are other erroneous concepts concerning the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. Some people say that the Lord Jesus was the Son of God but that He was not one with God. They teach that the Father and the Son are separate persons in the Godhead. According to this concept, They are separate &ldquo;Gods&rdquo; who are merely related to each other. According to the truth, however, the Father and the Son are distinct, but They are not separate persons in the Godhead. They are one. The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father (John 14:10). Only the Father knows the Son, and only the Son knows the Father (Matt. 11:27). Therefore, the Lord Jesus is God. We cannot see God or gain Him apart from the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Some people have the concept that the Lord Jesus was merely a man when He was on earth but that He became God after His ascension and was no longer a man. Such a concept comes from the imagination of an unenlightened mind. According to the Bible, in eternity past the Lord Jesus was God. In His incarnation He became flesh with genuine humanity, but He was still God. In His resurrection from the dead, the body of His humiliation was transfigured into a body of glory (Phil. 3:21). His resurrected body still possesses its human nature; He is still a man. He ascended into heaven with His resurrected body, and He is still a man with the human nature. He is also still God. In His second coming He will be the God of glory, but He will be manifested as a man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FINAL WORD</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is God, who created all things, becoming a man. He is God putting on humanity. He is God entering into man to be joined to man. He is God in life, nature, position, person, authority, glory, power, and wisdom. When He became a man, He put on the image and likeness of a man, possessing the human life and nature, living a human life on earth, and having the flavor of man. God in Christ became a man in order to accomplish redemption, thus solving God&rsquo;s problems and attaining His goal. In order for man to have God&rsquo;s life and become His expression, God became a man; He came in the likeness of man. In order for man to be joined to Him, God came to be joined to man. The Lord Jesus is God becoming a man. Even though He is a man, He is still God. He is God yet man and man yet God. This is our Savior!</p>
<p>Prayer: Lord Jesus, how glorious and how precious You are! We can draw near to You and contact You because You are the glorious God who became a lowly man, and You are the mighty Creator who became a small creature. You came out of unapproachable light and concealed Your matchless glory in the humble likeness of a man; hence, sinners can approach You, and tax collectors can be Your friends. Sinners can kiss Your feet, and those whom You love can recline on Your bosom. You touched the leper with Your hand, and You shed tears with those in sorrow. You have God&rsquo;s inward affections and the human nature. In You we see a genuine man and touch the true God. Only You are the complete God and the perfect man. You brought God to the earth, and You also brought man to the heavens. You were both God and man while You were on the earth, and You are still both God and man in the heavens. When You walked in the land of Judea, You were a man, and You were the incarnated Word. Today on the throne You are still God with the human nature. When You lived on earth, God was humbled in man, but today man is glorified in God. Lord, how glorious and precious this revelation is! We worship and praise You!</p>
<p>O glorious Lord, as we consider the coming day of glory, our heart leaps, and our mouth is filled with praise. Then Your human nature will be manifested in the glory of God for the universe and all creation to see that You are the incarnated God and the glorified man. You are God yet man and man yet God. Then all creation will see that You are the glorious mystery. We worship and praise You even now because we see and know You today. We desire to receive more revelation and to know You in a deeper way. We give You all honor and love. We praise Your lovely name forever and ever! Amen.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
