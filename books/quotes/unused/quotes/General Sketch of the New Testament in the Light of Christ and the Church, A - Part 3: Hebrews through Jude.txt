In these messages we will continue to see a general sketch of the New Testament in the light of Christ and the church
The first section is composed of the first five books, from Matthew through Acts, showing us the history of this universal man
The entire New Testament deals with the universal man and the history, definition, and consummation of this man
The first item of the supplement is the book of Hebrews, which is an explanation of the difference between Christ and Judaism
The thirteen Epistles from Romans through Philemon do not address the problem of Judaism and the difference between Christ and Judaism
They do not give us a clear understanding about the relationship of works and faith, so again there is the need of a supplement
The last item, Jude, deals with apostasy, the drifting away of the church from the right track of God's economy
Before Christ was incarnated as a man, God gave the people of Israel a number of items, all comprising Judaism
The last item is the old covenant, including all the sacrifices, the offerings, the tabernacle, and the temple
Altogether, Judaism is very good, even wonderful, because in it we have God, the angels, the leaders, the priests, and the old covenant
Christ is better than Judaism because Judaism gives us God in name but not in reality while Christ is the very embodiment and reality of God
From Hebrews 4:14 through 7:28, Paul tells us that Christ is also superior to Aaron and all the priests of the order of Aaron
On the one hand, this book is hard to understand, but on the other hand, no other book is so clearly divided as Hebrews
The first four sections tell us that Christ is superior to everything else, and the last section shows us the way to go on and follow Christ
Hebrews 2:1-4, for example, is the first exhortation and warning, found in the middle of the first section of this book
In the Old Testament time God spoke through many prophets, but now in the New Testament age God speaks in the Son
The first section of Hebrews, from 1:4 to the end of chapter two, reveals to us that Christ is superior to the angels because of two things
In the first two chapters Christ is superior to the angels because according to chapter one He is God and according to chapter two He is man
Chapter one quotes the prophecies in the Old Testament to tell us that the Son, through whom God speaks, is God Himself
Chapter two tells us that this very Christ, who is the Son of God and who is God Himself, one day became a man
By Christ's incarnation He put on the human nature, and through His resurrection and ascension we have His divine nature
In the first section of this book, the writer helped the Hebrew believers to drop Judaism by taking Christ as the superior One
The opening verses of this book are a short introduction giving an allinclusive description and definition of the person and work of Christ
In the ancient times God spoke in the prophets but at the last of these times God speaks in the Son the person of Christ who is God Himself
The universe includes space and time, all the physical, material things, and all the systems, orders, laws, and principles
Christ is the very glory of God outwardly and the impress, the image, of God's substance, God's being, what God is
After accomplishing this, He went to the third heaven to sit down on the right hand of the Majesty on high, and that is where He now is
The writer of Hebrews argues in this way: 'For it was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth, concerning which we speak'
Such a salvation is the great salvation mentioned in 2:3, which asks, 'How shall we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation'?
By Christ's incarnation God was brought into man, and through His resurrection, ascension, and glorification man was brought into God
After the first two chapters describe and define the person of Christ, chapter three begins to tell us what Christ is doing for us now
He is not only the one who accomplished redemption for us in the past; He is also the One who was sent to us by God to work for us
Hebrews 3:1 says, 'Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus'
Verses 2 through 4 of chapter three say, 'Who was faithful to Him who constituted Him, as also Moses was in all His house
For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by as much as He who built the house has more honor than the house
It is by caring for all the needs of His people, as Moses did, and to bring us to pass through the wilderness into the rest of the good land
Christ builds up the church by bringing us through the soulish life into our spirit where He abides as the rest, the good land
Our concept may be that God sent Christ to us as an Apostle greater than Moses in order only to take care of our needs
Verses 11 through 13 continue, 'Let us therefore be diligent to enter into that rest lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience
It was only after the people of Israel entered into the land of rest that the house of God was built up among them
There is a great need for us to be brought by the Lord through our soulish life into our spirit to enjoy Christ as the good land
The third section of the book of Hebrews, from 4:14 to 7:28, is a comparison between Christ and the high priest in Judaism
It tells us that Christ Himself is the very God, the Son of God; He is the effulgence of God's glory and the impress of His substance
As the High Priest typified by Aaron He goes to God from us and with us to take care of our case in the presence of God
Because of the transmission of electricity, although the lamp is in our home, it is still connected to the power plant far away
Hebrews 416 says Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help
The throne of grace is in the heavens, but this heavenly throne is continually transmitted into us in our spirit
On the one hand, the Holy of Holies is in the heavens, but on the other hand, Hebrews 10:19 tells us that we must enter the Holy of Holies
In a similar way, Christ is in the heavens acting and doing things as our High Priest, but this 'scenery' is transmitted into our spirit
Christ is living, acting, and doing His job as the High Priest, and this scenery is being transmitted into our spirit
We simply come with boldness to this throne of grace in our spirit to receive mercy and find grace for timely help
Aaron and all the priests according to the order of Aaron served according to the outward rules and regulations
He works not according to the regulations of letter but according to the power of an indestructible life, a life which cannot be destroyed
According to the type in the Old Testament, God's people were weak and sinful, under the conviction that they could do nothing to please God
The power of an indestructible life is the eternal Spirit, and the eternal Spirit is the reality of resurrection
Something is transmitted into us from the third heaven, just as a television picture is transmitted from far away
We will have peace in our heart with God and the assurance that the problem between us and the brother is gone
We must come simply and boldly to the throne of grace to contact Him, to look to Him, to receive mercy, and to find grace for timely help
With every section of this book there is an exhortation and warning, either at the end or in the middle of each section
When children are taught in kindergarten, a teacher often displays pictures and drawings to help them see what they are being taught
Judaism is a set of pictures, shadows, and types set up by God to illustrate the heavenly, eternal, spiritual, and mysterious things
On the negative side, God ordained Christ to be the very One to take away all our sins and redeem us back to God
On the positive side, this very Redeemer by His death, resurrection, and ascension has been wrought into us as our life
By Him in Him and with Him we sinners are not only forgiven and redeemed but also related to God by being joined to God and mingled with Him
All the things of Judaism are the shadows, pictures, and types of this, while Christ Himself is the very reality of all these things
He is the expression of God, the mouthpiece of God, the effulgence of God's glory, and the impress of His substance
With the high priest there are two aspects because there are two different orders of priests the order of Aaron and the order of Melchisedec
Before His resurrection and ascension, Christ is typified by Aaron the high priest, taking care of our case on the earth
Aaron was the type of Christ as our High Priest to offer sacrifices for us, redeem us from sins, and reconcile us to God
Rather, he came in a positive way with bread and wine to minister something eternal, heavenly, spiritual, living, and refreshing
We should not talk only about how the Lord loves us, how He died for us on the cross, how He bore our sins and shed His blood
We must know Christ according to the order of Melchisedec, the One who comes out to meet us to minister the heavenly bread and wine
The fourth main section of Hebrews, from 8:1 to 10:39, tells us that the new covenant enacted by Christ is much better than the old
The items of the covenant are things Christ has already accomplished, and there are no conditions or terms for their completion
By shedding His blood, Christ enacted this deed, the covenant, and through His death He left this title deed to us as a will, a testament
Hebrews 9:16-17 says, 'For where there is a testament, the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established
For a testament is confirmed in the case of the dead, since it never has force when he who made the testament is living'
A covenant is an agreement made by the giver, which is in effect while he is alive, while a testament is a will
Hebrews 8:2 says, 'A Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man'
Christ is also the Minister, ministering to us all the divine, heavenly, spiritual, and eternal things mentioned in the will
All the things we have seen from the first ten chapters of Hebrews are transmitted into our heavenly 'television,' which is our spirit
After dealing with the matters of the truth in a full way the writer goes on to tell us that we have to follow Jesus on the pathway of faith
For compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary, fainting in your souls'
The blood of the offering was brought into the sanctuary, but the bodies of the offerings were burned outside the camp
These verses say, 'Therefore also Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate
Although we may know what the Holy of Holies within the veil is, we may not know what the significance of the camp is
The people of Israel had committed the serious sin of worshipping the golden calf , so the camp was polluted and corrupted by idol worship
When Moses came down from the mountain, he called for the overcomers to stand with him to slay the idol worshippers
At the time the Lord Jesus was on earth, Judaism had become a fully-established religious organization, a real camp
In its outward appearance it was an organization of God's people, but within this camp there was corruption and idol worship
On the one hand, those Hebrew believers were enjoying the heavenly Christ, but on the other hand, they tried to remain in the camp
They enjoyed the resurrected and ascended Christ in their spirit, in the heavens, but they would not give up Judaism
We who enjoy the heavenly Christ in the Holy of Holies within the veil need to follow Him in our walk on this earth
Years later John Bunyan, the author of The Pilgrim's Progress, went outside the camp of the state church of England
Our spirit must be in the heavens with Christ, and our steps must be with Jesus outside the camp of organized Christianity
Many dear Christians cannot say boldly that their steps are outside the camp of organized religion to follow Jesus
The more we enjoy Him as the heavenly Melchisedec in our spirit, the more we will step outside the camp and give up organized Christianity
The more we contact the heavenly Christ, the more we may be considered a 'pest' by the people in organized religion
Originally Judaism was established by God, but later the ground given to God was lost, and no ground was given to Christ
Originally it was something living, but gradually even within the church the ground for God and Christ was lost
As a pastor in a large denomination in America, he observed that there is no room for Jesus Christ in the denominational churches
On the one hand, we have to give up the camp, but on the other hand, we must be careful not to become another camp
Whatever we form, no matter how much it seems to be according to the pattern of the New Testament, is still a camp
Even this book, which deals with the truth, tells us that God must work within us subjectively through Jesus Christ
We may now consider some verses from the short book of James not according to their order in the chapters but according to a spiritual order
God has regenerated us with this living word, His word of truth, that we may be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures
If we endure the trials, we will receive not only the birth of life and the gift of life but the crown of life
By believing in the Lord we have the divine birth, but we must go on to love the Lord so that we will receive the crown of life
James 4:5-6 says, 'Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: 'The Spirit, whom He has caused to dwell in us, longs to envy'?
Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord'
Behold the farmer eagerly awaits the precious fruit of the earth exercising longsuffering over it until it receives the early and late rain
From this portion of Acts we can see that even James and perhaps the elders with him were still zealous for Judaism
In principle, the teaching in this book is the same as the New Testament teaching; it is still in the line of life
When reading this book, however, many Christians are distracted by the background and do not see that this is also a book concerning life
Living faith causes us to be separated from the world, to be unspotted from the world and to not have any friendship with the world
If we believe that God is living and can care for this needy one, we should share what we have with him and let God care for us
If we have living faith we should take out all we have in our pocket in order to care for the needy one and then we can let God care for us
The more faith we have, the more we will pray and not gossip, but to have gossip and vain talk means that we lack living faith
Rather, we rescue the fallen ones who are led astray from the truth, and we take care of them to bring them back to the Lord
As a supplement to the teaching of the previous Epistles, Hebrews tells us the difference between Christ and Judaism
It is not easy to understand this passage because we may consider that the judgment mentioned here is in the future
The judgment spoken of here is not the judgment in the future, at the coming back of the Lord Jesus Christ and at the end of the millennium
While we pass the time of our sojourning here on earth, God as the Father has apportioned a certain amount of dealing for His people
Again, the judgment mentioned here is not the ultimate judgment in the future, but a temporary judgment during the course of this age
Peter 29 says The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of trial and how to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment
These verses also speak concerning the government of God in this present time, showing us the subject of these two books
It is due to the judgment and dealing of God in the present time, as revealed in the two books of Peter, that many of God's people suffer
A policeman does not regard whether we violate the law consciously or unconsciously; he still will issue us a ticket
Even before God's final and ultimate judgment comes upon man, He still exercises His government over His children
God's dealing with His own children is for their profit, but God's dealing with the unbelievers, the unrighteous, is for their punishment
The Father chose us in eternity past, the Holy Spirit sanctified and separated us, and Christ redeemed us by shedding His blood
Whereas the holy priests are according to the order of Aaron, the royal, kingly priests are according to the order of Melchisedec
Before we go out to preach the gospel, we should go to God in prayer, praying day and night, representing the sinners before God
When we go to the sinners to proclaim the gospel to them, representing God to minister grace and life, we are royal priests
The holy priesthood in 1 Peter 2:5 offers spiritual sacrifices to God, while the kingly priesthood in verse 9 tells out the virtues of God
The holy priests offer something to God for the sake of the people, while the royal priests declare the things of God to people
Even in such a book as 1 Peter, which speaks about the government of God, there is the content of the divine life for the church life
In the church we must all submit one to another that we may have a good order, so that the Lord may be glorified among us
If we have these six itemsprecious faith divine power life godliness precious promises and the divine naturewhat else could we desire
Because there is something living within us, which is precious faith, the more we try to drop the Lord, the more He lays hold of us
Toward ourselves we exercise self-control, toward others we have endurance, and toward God we have a life of godliness
In this way, the divine life and the church life are the content even of the two Epistles of Peter, which deal with the government of God
Although the Epistles of Paul cover many matters, they do not adequately deal with the fellowship of God's family
The Word of life is the Son of God, Christ Himself, as in John 1:1, and the fellowship in 1 John 1:3 comes out of this eternal life
The fellowship of God's children is not only a fellowship between themselves but also one between the children and the Father
In the same way, when Christ constantly lives, works, and flows within us, we have the fellowship of the divine life
Although sin interrupts, frustrates, and damages the fellowship, the blood of Christ deals with sin to maintain and sustain our fellowship
The sprinkling typifies the cleansing of the blood of Christ, and the anointing typifies the moving and working of the Holy Spirit
The fellowship of the divine life between us and God is always maintained by the cleansing blood and by the moving, anointing Holy Spirit
By the cleansing of the blood our conscience is void of offense; we have a pure conscience without any accusations
Our conscience is always kept pure and without any offense not by our own self-perfection but by the cleansing of the blood of Christ
On the positive side, the Holy Spirit is always moving, working, and anointing within us based upon the sprinkling of the blood
We are kept in this fellowship, this abiding, by the anointing, which is the moving of the Holy Spirit as the ointment within
John 4:13 continues, 'In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit'
In the same principle, the more the Holy Spirit anoints us, the more God Himself as our very essence is anointed into us
The portion, the essence, the very element of God within us increases continuously by the anointing of the Holy Spirit
The divine fellowship is maintained by the anointing of the Holy Spirit with God Himself as the very essence anointed into us
It is by the sprinkling of the blood and by the anointing of the Holy Spirit that the fellowship in Christ as the divine life is maintained
We should always apply the blood to counter all the accusations, and we should take care of the inner anointing
On the positive side, if we remain in the fellowship, we spontaneously carry out the Lord's will, fulfill His purpose, and love the brothers
John 7 says, 'For many deceivers went out into the world, those who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh
Verses 8 through 11 continue, 'Look to yourselves that you do not lose the things which we wrought, but that you may receive a full reward
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!
These persons went beyond the teaching concerning Christ, as today's modernists do, inventing something beyond the truth
Some there may have been real brothers and sisters, but among them, even among the leading ones, there were modernists
John tells us that we should receive the saints into our home, extending hospitality to them, because we are all in the one fellowship
Verses 9 and 10 say, 'I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us
Among the worldly people, to gain things is glorious, but among Christians, to lose things and suffer is more glorious
If we put the three Epistles of John together, we will see a clear picture of the proper fellowship among the members of God's divine family
The faith denotes the contents of the New Testament as our faith , in which we believe for our common salvation
On the foundation of this holy faith and in the sphere of it, through praying in the Holy Spirit, we build ourselves up
To pray in the Holy Spirit to keep ourselves in the love of God and to await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ is to live in the Triune God
Finally Jude speaks of caring for others with mercy in fear and he praises Him who is able to guard and set the believers before His glory
