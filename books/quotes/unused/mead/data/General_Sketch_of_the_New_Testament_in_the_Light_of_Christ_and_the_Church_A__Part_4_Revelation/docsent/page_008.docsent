   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The seventh stage of the church is symbolized by the church in Laodicea 3:14-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today some wrongly teach that the church in Laodicea represents the fallen, cold reformed churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, if we thoroughly study the history of the church, we will see that Laodicea represents the degraded Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this epistle the Lord did not rebuke them for anything except spiritual pride.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is no mention of sinfulness or the teaching of Balaam, the teaching of the Nicolaitans, or the teaching of Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was no problem with them except their pride.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They claimed to be wealthy and rich and to have need of nothing, but in actuality they were neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>15-17a .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Brethren had a very good start over a century ago, but after about twenty-five years, many of them fell into degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we attend their meetings in Europe, England, or America, we can sense the fulfillment of this epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We thank the Lord that some of them are still in the condition of Philadelphia, but not many are.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are spiritually proud and rich in knowledge, but they do not have much spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They do not have much living faith or the eyesalve for their eyes that they may see the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They have even lost the presence of the Lord; the Lord is outside their door v. 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the reformed churches there is still the teaching of Balaam, the teaching of the Nicolaitans, and even to some extent the teaching of Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Laodicea, however, we cannot find these things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, Laodicea represents not the reformed churches but the degraded Brethren, who are fallen not due to sin but due to pride.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They say, We know what is taught in Genesis, and we know what is taught in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have a great teacher who gave an exposition of Daniel and other teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who can know more than we do?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way they have become proud, being rich in knowledge and right in doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, the Lord says that they are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked v. 17b . They do not have much experience of the Lord, they do not have much living faith, and their eyes are not truly opened but are blinded by doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They have the mental knowledge and the doctrines, but they do not have light in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, they need to pay the price v. 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we read the epistle to Laodicea again, and if we visit the Brethren assemblies, we will have to admit that this is the exact fulfillment of the Lord s prophecy in the seventh epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the real Laodicea, with lukewarmness, the blindness of knowledge in the mentality, and the lack of anything living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we will say, Lord, be merciful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>CHOOSING TO BE THE CHURCH IN PHILADELPHIA</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Please refer to the systematic chart of church history at the beginning of this chapter, taken from The Orthodoxy of the Church by Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As this chart indicates, the stages of the church represented by Ephesus, Smyrna, and Pergamos have all concluded.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>None of these three churches exists today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, the church in Thyatira, the fourth stage of the course of the church, exists today and will remain until the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the epistle to Thyatira the Lord clearly indicates that this church will remain until He comes 2:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today the Roman Catholic Church not only exists but is flourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In addition, the church in Sardis, the reformed church, will also exist until the Lord s coming 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Likewise, Philadelphia and Laodicea will also remain until the Lord s return v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today, before the Lord s return, four kinds of churches remain before us the Roman Catholic Church, the Protestant churches, the church of brotherly love, and the degraded Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we were born five hundred years ago, there would have been no choice before us; there was only one kind of church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After the Reformation, however, there were two kinds of churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then as of about one hundred forty years ago, there were three kinds.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today in this century there are four choices related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Of course, we may all agree that we can have nothing to do with Thyatira, but some people still argue for Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Strictly speaking, though, Sardis should not be a choice.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Can you be satisfied to be a part of Sardis?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I left Sardis in 1927.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In actuality, only two kinds of churches remain before us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Will we be the church in brotherly love, or will we be Laodicea?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once we become Philadelphia, we can never again be Sardis, but we must be careful that we do not become Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although Ephesus lost its first love, it remained at the level of normality, as indicated by the first part of the systematic chart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the church in Ephesus was still good, desirable, and lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After this, Smyrna, the suffering church, also continued at the level of normality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, at the time of Pergamos, the church became abnormal, and Thyatira continued the same trend.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sardis turned back to the normal level but came only halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The writings of Luther tell us that Luther himself was not satisfied with the Reformation, although regrettably many of his followers were satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We praise the Lord that Philadelphia came all the way back to the level of normality.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, not long afterwards it degraded and fell below the level of normality.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This systematic chart is a clear diagram showing us the real situation of Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All four kinds of churches before us will remain until the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now we must ask ourselves which of the four we will choose.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I believe we are all clear as to which is the one that will satisfy the Lord.</S>
