   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IT BEING MOST SPONTANEOUS AND HARMONIOUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE BODY TO SUBMIT TO THE HEAD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today God has made everything ready.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Body and the Head already have the same life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, submission is very spontaneous, while not being submissive is rather strange.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, if the hand is raised up according to the desire of the head, there is nothing strange about it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if the hand cannot move, then it is a strange thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps the hand is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit of life that God gave to us is the same as that which is in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The life and the nature that He gave us is likewise the same as that in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here again there is no possibility of disharmony and disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some of our bodily movements are conscious, while others are unconscious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The oneness of the body with the head does not depend only on a conscious submission, but on an unconscious submission.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is like breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There can be conscious deep breathing or there can be unconscious and spontaneous ordinary breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is like the heart which beats without consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no need to give it an order; it keeps on beating by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is submission in life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For the body to submit to the head, there is no noise, no imposition, and no friction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everything is in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not enough for some to just submit to commands.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the commands is the will, and in the will is the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only when one submits to the law of life is his submission perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the submission is not like that of the body submitting to the head, it is not called submission.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The submission of some is with such reluctance that it cannot be considered as submission.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord has put us into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here the union is perfect and the submission is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a wonder that even the mind of the Holy Spirit can be guided by the members.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no possibility of separating two members from the other to make them distinct wholes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A harmony spontaneously exists between the members.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no need to even think about this submission.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Its harmony is beyond the description of human words, and its submission to authority is the most perfect that can be found.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this reason we cannot be a sick member, one that makes noise and causes friction.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are living in the operation of God's authority; there should be a very spontaneous submission.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is not only the place of fellowship for the brothers and sisters; it is also the place for the manifestation of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>REJECTING THE AUTHORITY IN THE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>BEING TO REJECT THE HEAD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The authority in the Body is sometimes not manifested directly, but indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only does the body submit to the head; its members submit to and help one another also.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The left and the right hands do not have direct fellowship with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The head moves the right hand, and the head moves the left hand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The left hand does not control the right hand, nor the right hand the left.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The hand does not order the eyes to see.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It only informs the head.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The head then directs the eyes to see.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No matter how far the members are from the head, their relationship with the head is the same, and all their works relate back to the head.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If my eyes see, my hands work, or my feet move, then I say that I see, I work, or I move.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, many times the decision of the members is the decision of the head.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The authority of the members is the authority of the head.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The hand cannot see by itself; it needs the decision of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is wrong for the hand either to ask the head to see or to ask itself to see.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Both are impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But this is often the problem with God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, we must take other members as the deputy authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The function of the hand is just that of a hand, the function of the foot is only that of a foot, and the function of the eyes is only that of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must accept others' function as our function.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We cannot reject the function of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the foot rejects the hand, it is rejecting the head.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Consequently, when we accept the authority of the members, we are accepting the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every member is my authority in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although the function of the hand is great, it has to accept the function of the foot in the matter of walking.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The hand cannot feel color; it needs the authority of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The function of the members is the authority of the members.</S>
