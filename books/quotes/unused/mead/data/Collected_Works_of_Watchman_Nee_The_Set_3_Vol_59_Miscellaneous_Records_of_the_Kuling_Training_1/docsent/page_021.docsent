   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN HOW TO DISPOSE OF ONE'S PROCEEDS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AFTER HE HAS SOLD HIS ALL Date:June 2, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Customs Lane, Foochow</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today's meeting is a special one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are here to speak about the ways to dispose of the proceeds of the consecrated ones who have sold their all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I believe that we are beginning to see a tide of selling all in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such a tide is of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This tide will rise higher and higher.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Acts 4 says that all the people sold their houses and possessions and placed the proceeds at the feet of the apostles, distributing to each according to need.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today believers should hand over their all and place it at the feet of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Concerning the management of the proceeds received from the saints after they have sold their all, we have to take care of a few points.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>CRUCIAL POINTS IN DISPOSING OF</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE SAINTS' PROCEEDS The Proceeds from Selling the Goods</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Having Nothing to Do with the Co-workers</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, every cent that is received from such a move should not be linked in any way to us; we cannot use any of this money.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Any work that belongs to us or is related to us personally cannot touch this money.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If anyone uses this money in this way, we should mark him and not communicate with him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a worker tries to put his hands on it, we have to consider such a person to be a great failure in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is a great shame to the Lord to be unchaste in the matter of money.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a great mistake, an inexcusable mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Letting the Church Deal with the Excess</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>of the Consecrated Ones</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second, all the brothers and sisters have to offer everything to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Acts 4 says that the believers sold all that they had.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We hope that all the brothers and sisters will prepare a list of all the things they offer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During the apostles' time, the church not only had the truth, but the experience of revival as well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During Pentecost there was the work of the Holy Spirit, and there was revival.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At that time there was the apostles' teaching, and hence, there was the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The practice of selling one's all is in line with the teaching and practice of that time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the time of Timothy, Paul spoke of the believers themselves assisting the widows in their household 1 Tim 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church would only step in if the households were not able to handle the widows themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we find an improvement; there is an improvement from the book of Acts to 1 Timothy in the care of the widows.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The seven deacons in Acts 6 were appointed because there was a need among the widows.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Complaints arose because of a neglect in the care of the widows.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time the whole church bore this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Epistles to Timothy, however, were written about thirty years after the incidents in Acts 5 and 6.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They were the last books that Paul wrote.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Widows here represent poor people; they did not have anyone to care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the care for such ones was neglected, criticism arose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is easy to criticize, but it is hard to manage.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Oversight is unavoidable when only a hundred twenty people are involved in church affairs that cover over twenty thousand believers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was not an easy thing for a hundred twenty to serve such a big family.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By the time of Timothy, Paul charged those who had widows in their household to take care of the widows themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From the twelve apostles to the seven deacons, there was an improvement in the bearing of church responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the whole church taking care of a burden to the individual families bearing the responsibility, there was further improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The matter was made less and less complicated, and there was a marked improvement in management.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are responsibilities which the church should bear, and there are responsibilities which individuals should bear.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By distributing the responsibilities this way, it becomes easy for the church to manage its affairs, and business is expedited.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the part of the saints, they should voluntarily sell all their possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the part of the church, it should not impose this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whatever is done at the time of revival should be improved upon at a later stage.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There cannot be any improvement in the truth, but there can be improvement in the way of handling business.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the time of the apostles, there was revival and there was truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The practical care of the church, however, improved, from management by twelve apostles to management by seven deacons, and later it moved from the hand of the church to the hand of individual households.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By the time of Timothy, the widows were taken care of by the members of their own households.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The way of handling things changed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There was no longer a wholesale giving away of one's entire possessions to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If that were the case in Timothy, there would have been no need for individuals to care for the widows.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At the present moment, we are asking the saints to write down their consecrated items on a list.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The purpose of this list is to spare the saints from disposing of all they have.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, they should dispose of things according to a careful consideration of practical needs.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Second Corinthians 8:15 says, "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul did not say that he who gathered much should be in lack.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God takes away the "excess" so that no one has any "excess."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Yet He has no intention for anyone to have lack.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Based on this we can say that the church only deals with the "excess."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When a man hands over all of his possessions, the church should return a part back to the consecrated one so that he can take care of the needs of his own household.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Why should the church do this?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This will save the church many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For example, if five hundred brothers and sisters in the church sell all of their possessions and give the money to the church, the church will have to care for the needs of five hundred poor saints.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is better for three hundred who have excess to take care of themselves and to dispose of their excess, which will fill the lack of the other two hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This equalizes the wealth, and the church is spared many headaches.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The church is not commissioned to manage the supply of food; it should give itself to the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, we should try our best to ask the brothers and sisters to take care of their own needs.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This does not mean that the church is returning or rebating the offerings that the saints have offered.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is not a rebate.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is not like an overpayment of taxes followed by a rebate.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is a gift from the church to the giver.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some may ask, "Does this not mean that everyone is caring for his own again?"</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>No, we are saying that your livelihood is now rationed to you by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The returned goods are now the church's possession deposited in your house and entrusted to your care.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They still belong to God and to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The church has not returned them to you.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We are here to live the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Every brother and sister is a servant of the Lord, and everyone is at the same time a financial supporter.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the reason the Bible speaks of stewards.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Formerly, everything belonged to you alone.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Now it is the church's possession left in your care; you are assigned to this work as a steward.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The tone is completely changed.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Formerly you were the master; now you are the steward.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We have to learn to live in the Body and to serve our God in this way.</S>
