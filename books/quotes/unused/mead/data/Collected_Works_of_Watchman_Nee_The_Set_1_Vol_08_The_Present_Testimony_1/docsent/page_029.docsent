   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LETTER ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR By Ruth Lee Issue No. 9</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is again by God's grace that we can send out this issue of The Present Testimony in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us thank the Lord together.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>None of the articles in this issue is vain theory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we will humble ourselves and give diligence, we will see the truth of Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How real, how significant, and how glorious!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We shall also see how much prayer we need in order to be fellow workers with God, and what attitude we need in order to cause Satan to be cast out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Oh readers, now is really the time that we need the Lord to revive us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, we must discern the difference between a revival of human works and a revival of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If it is an artificial revival, even though grandiose and noisy, it is but the flesh in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we learn to put ourselves aside and only exercise our faith to identify with Christ in His fullness, how restful it is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We already have too many ways, and we already have too many failures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God does not want us to save the situation, nor does He want us to be discouraged and shrink back.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, He wants us to admit that we have come to the end of our road and that the goodness of our flesh is but vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, we must turn to Him to seek His will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our greatest dangers are that we are not willing to ask God to examine all our lives and works, that we are not willing to lay aside our natural ability and opinions and wholly trust in God, and that we are not willing to stop struggling in our failures and weaknesses and look to God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We really have to pray to the Lord to grant us the light of revelation that we might know ourselves and the salvation of God, in order that we may obtain the revival of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To my readers who are expecting to be raptured, I would say that we all must be watchful!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A little thought for the flesh is enmity with God; a little care for this life is sufficient to make our hearts entangled.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are not yet ready, then let us not be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our brother Watchman Nee says, "I tremble at the thought that the lamps of the foolish virgins will not burn long enough."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Readers, how do you feel?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some brothers and sisters are always concerned about whether or not we are working and other details concerning our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We would take this opportunity to thank you for your care!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And we would like to tell you that we are neither working, nor are we not working.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although it is entirely possible that we can misunderstand God's will, our hearts are seeking after His will and are satisfied with His will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The God we serve is full of grace and full of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We thank Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>June 20, 1929</S>
