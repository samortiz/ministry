The Bible says that God seeks after man. However, we began to seek after the Lord after we were saved. God gave us Christ in order that we might have eternal life; this is a work that was completed once for all. But after a man is saved, he will be of little use in God's hands if he is still the same after a month or a year. If a man comes to the meeting today and he is the same way that he was before, he will not be of much use to the Lord. Why do some Christians advance while others always seem to remain the same? All spiritual progress depends on man's hunger. Luke 1:53 says that God has filled the hungry with good things. The Lord also said, "Ask and it shall be given to you" (11:9). The heavenly Father gives the Spirit to those who ask. In order for a Christian to advance spiritually, he must be hungry inwardly and constantly seeking.</p><p>The first condition for spiritual growth in a Christian is hunger. I have already spoken about this last year in Chuenchow, but today I will say the same thing again. God's principle is to fill the hungry with good things and to send the rich away empty. Today if you come to the Lord empty and go away empty, it means that you are already too full and too rich. Tonight many co-workers have come from faraway places. I will ask the same question that I asked when we were in Chuenchow: "What are you coming here for?" A man can experience grace by chance, but spiritual progress does not come by accident. It is not something that one picks up along the way. Salvation may come by chance, but the power of the Spirit, a holy life, the power of God, and the overcoming life are not things that are obtained by chance. God will only give these things to those who seek for them; He will only give them to the hungry ones.</p><h2 class="head1">PAYING THE PRICE</h2><p>I have met many people who deal with spiritual matters the same way that they deal with their salvation. They think that all they need to do is to hear about it. Actually there is a big difference between salvation and spiritual progress. The ten virgins in Matthew 25 do not have to buy oil for their lamps, but they have to buy oil for their vessels, which are not the same as their lamps. Regeneration is free, but spiritual progress comes with a price. In Revelation the Lord told the church in Laodicea to buy white garments and eyesalve from Him (3:18). In order to buy white garments and eyesalve, there is the need to pay a price. A holy living is something that is bought with a price; it does not come to us free. A proven faith is also something that is bought with a price. If you see a Christian making progress, you know that he must have paid a price. Let me ask a question tonight: What do you want before God, and have you ever paid a price in order to attain more? We must pay a great price before we can live in Christ, receive answers to our prayer, trust God for our living, and possess spiritual insight to see what others cannot see!</p><p>What does it mean for God to fill the hungry with good things? It means that the riches are reserved for those who want them. Suppose I give this hymnal to you. You may take it even though you may not care for it. In that case, you are not very concerned for the gift. But if I give you a sum of money, your response may be different; you may take it immediately. What does it mean to be hungry? Being hungry is being empty in your stomach. If you do not have anything in your stomach, you will surely crave something. I am not afraid of people committing sins. I am not afraid of the co-workers being too weak to save souls or having too hot a temper or too difficult a disposition. What I am afraid of is self-contentment, selfsatisfaction, and satisfaction with the things of the past. When you feel that you cannot make it, or when you are faced with great difficulties, that is the time you experience great turns. That is the time you make spiritual progress. However, I have not met many who are truly hungry. Let me ask one question: Since January of this year, how many of your prayers have been answered? You may find it difficult to answer my question. If a man is truly seeking for God and praying to God, yet does not receive any answer to his prayers, there must be something wrong with this person. He must have a problem somewhere.</p><p>A brother may have a terrible temper. But as long as he will deal with God, God will give him grace and work on him to the point that he can live out the Lord's life. A person may know that he has some problem, but unless he asks in a hungry way, he will not be delivered from his problem. In order to have sustained progress before the Lord, we need a sustained hunger. The degree of our hunger determines the amount that we eat. Our experience of eating tells us that we eat when we are hungry; the hungrier we are, the more we eat. The same principle applies to the spiritual realm; one does not eat when he is full. Let me ask again: What do you want today? Are you hungry? If we are hungry and seeking, God will fill our hunger.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
