   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ENTERING INTO THE FACTS RECORDED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT A. The Impression from the Facts</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When reading the Bible, the Holy Spirit next requires that we capture an impression from the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible is not all teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A great part of it is facts, history, and stories.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Holy Spirit desires that the facts, history, and stories produce a certain impression within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once we have an impression of these facts from the Holy Spirit, it will be easy for Him to convey God's word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If these facts do not produce an impression in us, God's word will not take hold in us and will not produce the proper effect in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The impression that we are speaking of here does not refer to a general familiarity with the stories.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It refers to a view concerning certain characteristic points that make a lasting impression in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Bible every incident has its characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without understanding these characteristics, we cannot understand God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In reading a contract, it is not enough to check whether or not there is a signature on it; we must check whose signature is on it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The impression that we are speaking of here is not a general impression but an impression of its special character.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once we discover the special character, we can learn what God wants to say through them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is possible that a person can remember and even relate a biblical incident to others but not be able to point out its special character.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that he does not understand God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The New Testament contains the four Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For the Epistles, we have to get into the thought of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For the four Gospels and Acts, however, our heart has to be open to God's Spirit, and we have to allow Him to impress us with the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to realize the difference between these facts and other facts, and we have to sense the special characteristics that lie behind these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>An impression works like a photograph.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The film in a camera is a slide of glass or a thin piece of plastic coated with a chemical silver bromide.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Decades ago, one square inch of film could only hold tens of thousands of silver bromide particles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the reason the photographs produced at that time were not very sharp; they were granular in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Later, film improved, and the granular look disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The image is now much clearer because each square inch of film holds millions of silver bromide particles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the same way, the finer our inner constitution is, the more impression we will retain.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The coarser we are, the less impression we will retain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If our heart and spirit are open to God, and if our feelings are refined, the flashing of the facts of the Holy Spirit before us will generate a strong impression within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are fine and tender, we will see two things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, we will locate the emphasis in God's Word and the focus of His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second, we will know what God wants to say behind the facts, and we will be able to tell the difference between these facts and other facts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A coarse person will never see the fine points in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A man must be tender, and his feelings must be very sensitive before God's word can stamp a clear image within him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He will not only catch a glimpse of the general contour, but he will have an accurate impression of the fine points and lines.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He will be clear about every delicate and intricate point behind the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>B. Tender Feelings</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many people seek to know the fine and tender aspects of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet without fine and tender feelings, they cannot grasp these tender points.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Consider the four Gospels and Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All five books are records of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>More facts are revealed about the Lord Jesus through these five books than through all the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to have fine and tender impressions of these facts related to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us consider some examples.</S>
