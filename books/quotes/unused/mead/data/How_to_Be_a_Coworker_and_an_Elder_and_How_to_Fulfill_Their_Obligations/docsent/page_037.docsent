   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes when you go to restore a certain one, who you are aware has committed a sin, you do not have an attitude of humility and gentleness; rather, you are proud secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Consequently, after a few days, you may be tempted also to commit the same sin which he committed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, to restore a brother, overtaken in some offense, with meekness a gentle expression of humility protects us from being tempted also Gal 6:1 .</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The third thing which the co-workers and elders need to beware of is self-justification, the justifying of oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Self-justification Indicates Condemning of Others and Exalting of Yourself</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the self-justified ones always condemn others and exalt themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Came Not to Condemn Men but to Save Men by Forgiving Forgetting Their Sins</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In John 3:17 the Lord said, "For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord came not to condemn men but to save men by forgiving forgetting their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Church Is Neither a Police Station Arresting People nor a Law Court Judging People, but a Home Raising Up Believers, a Hospital Healing and Recovering Believers, and a School Teaching and Edifying Believers</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church is not a police station arresting people in order to find out their wrongdoings.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, the church is a home raising up believers that they may become grown-ups.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, the church is a hospital healing and recovering believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Lord was on the earth, He ate with tax collectors and sinners, and for this He was criticized by the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord told the Pharisees, "Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill" Matt 9:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord seemed to be saying to them, "You Pharisees don't need Me. I came as a Physician to open a hospital to receive and heal those who are sick." Moreover, the church is a school teaching and edifying believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We co-workers and elders need to carefully consider the above items so that we may avoid these common errors.</S>
