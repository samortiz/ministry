   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FAITH AND LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we have a bird's-eye view of 1 Thessalonians, we shall see that the first three chapters make up one section, and the last two chapters make up another.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that this Epistle has a basic structure containing three elements: the work of faith, the labor of love, and the endurance of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul speaks of this in 1:3: "Remembering unceasingly your work of faith, and labor of love, and endurance of hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With this structure as a basis, Paul says in 1:9 and 10 that the believers turned from idols to serve a living and true God and to wait for His Son from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In chapter two we have the fostering of a holy life for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This fostering is the work of a cherishing mother and exhorting father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The result of the proper fostering is that we walk worthily of God, who calls us into His own kingdom and glory 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to have such a walk, we need to be perfected in our faith, and we need to increase and abound in our love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In chapter three Paul is deeply concerned about the Thessalonians' faith and love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to 3:10, his desire was to perfect anything that was lacking in their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yes, the Thessalonians had faith, yet it needed perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul longed to see them in order to perfect what was lacking in their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 3:12 he goes on to say, "And the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love to one another and to all, even as we also to you."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As believers, we all need to be perfected in faith and to increase and abound in love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verse 13 of chapter three we see the specific reason we need to be perfected in faith and to increase and abound in love: it is that the Lord may establish our hearts blameless in holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The establishing of our heart is the issue, the result, of the perfecting of our faith and of the increase and abounding of our love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord is doing a work of building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This building work is to establish our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our heart needs to be built up, to be established blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Later we shall seek to explain what the word blameless in verse 13 means.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 3:13 Paul says that the Lord will establish our hearts blameless in holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He does not say that our heart will be established blameless in purity or in cleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Testament emphasizes the matter of a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus said, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God" Matt 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul exhorted Timothy to be with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart 2 Tim 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, in Psalm 51:10 David prayed that the Lord would create in him a clean heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why, then, does Paul not say blameless in purity or in cleanness, but instead says blameless in holiness?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reason is that the book of 1 Thessalonians is on a holy life for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The conclusion of the first section of this Epistle, composed of chapters one, two, and three, is that the Lord will establish our heart blameless in holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I believe that we all have faith, love, and hope.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have turned to God from idols, we are serving the living God, and we are waiting for the coming back of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we have faith, love, and hope, and we have the turning, the serving, and the waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we still need to be perfected in our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1 Thessalonians faith refers to our believing ability and also to what we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Faith, therefore, is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The aspect of objective faith, the things we believe in, is a vast field including many things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The messages we have put out over the years have covered different matters in this field of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These messages show us how much the Christian faith, Christian belief, comprises.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It even includes the matter of the mingling of the Triune God with saved and regenerated human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through the preaching of Paul, the Thessalonians heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that they heard the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only did the Thessalonians hear the faith they received it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, because Paul was with them such a short time, approximately three weeks, he could not have presented all the contents of the New Testament faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No wonder he was eager to visit them and see them face to face in order to speak further to them concerning the faith and to perfect them in the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Like the Thessalonians, we also need to have our faith perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Thessalonians had faith and also had love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As believers in Christ, we also love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The divine love is without measure; it is immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, we need to increase and abound in our love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are perfected in our faith and if we increase and abound in our love, we shall have a living, a daily walk, that is worthy of God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we would have this kind of living, the Lord must set our heart on a fixed foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is to establish, to build up, our heart.</S>
