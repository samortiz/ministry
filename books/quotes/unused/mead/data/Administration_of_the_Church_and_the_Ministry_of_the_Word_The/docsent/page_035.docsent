   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REQUIRING KNOWLEDGE OF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>DIFFERENT MATTERS THE IMPORTANCE OF KNOWING MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we will consider different matters that we should know.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the building up of the church, we must know people and different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we simply want to be zealous ones who preach the gospel to save sinners and speak the truth to perfect the saints, there is no need for us to have a knowledge concerning various matters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, in order to build up the church, we should know people and matters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to know those whom we contact and those who desire to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to know their motives, whether their flesh has been dealt with, and their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We also need to know the nature, outcome, relationship, and impact of these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are many aspects of the things we need to know.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, a brother who loves the Lord may say that the Lord has moved him to give ten thousand dollars to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand, we should thank the Lord and rejoice that this brother is willing to be used in this way by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the other hand, we should realize that this is not a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to have some understanding related to the matter of giving.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that we should understand the motive, nature, method, and purpose of the brother s giving.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We also need to know the possible results and influence of his offering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we simply thank the Lord and accept the offering, our work is not for the building up of the church; rather, it will tear down the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must seek to be enlightened by the Lord through prayer and consideration in order to examine the history and background of the person who is giving the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should consider his reputation and standing in society and the source of the money he is offering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should also consider his intentions before the Lord and the spirit of his giving.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the elders receive a large sum of money as a gift to the church, they must take the time to understand how such a large sum of money was obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moreover, they must seriously consider the potential effect, directly or indirectly, of the offering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, the elders need a basic knowledge concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose another brother says that he wants to offer fifty thousand dollars to help the brothers in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although this is good, it is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not simply thank the Lord for this brother, thinking that this is a timely offering to help the saints in need.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not think that simply by distributing the fifty thousand dollars to the poor the church will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the contrary, we need to consider whether the offering can cause the church to be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This can be compared to a surgery that causes a person to lose his life instead of healing him or to food that causes a person to become sick rather than nourishing him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to build up the church, we should not be simple persons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to learn to fully understand the situation we are facing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we can determine what we should do and how we should do it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Discerning matters is related not only to the administration of the church but even to the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may give a message to discourage instead of a message to encourage if we lack knowledge concerning a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, if we want to learn to build up the church, we must learn to discern matters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must learn to know every matter that is directly or indirectly related to the church, as long as it is something we can inquire into and something we can touch.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our ability to administrate the church depends on whether we are able to know people and matters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our ability to preach the word and work for the Lord depends on whether we know people and matters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even our ability to visit and help people depends on such knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some responsible brothers act inappropriately in the administration of the church because they are short of knowledge concerning different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some messages may edify the saints but result in tearing down rather than building up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the result of an inadequate knowledge concerning matters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A lack of knowledge can also cause us to tear down the church while we are building it up.</S>
