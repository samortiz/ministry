   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RESTRICTED BY GOD'S CHOICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we had been there at the time, we might have taken sides with those who sacrificed at the "high places."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who went to the "high places" might have argued that it was inconvenient to travel the long distance to Jerusalem three times a year.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christians still use this kind of excuse today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It seems that for every division in Christianity an excuse is offered to justify it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nevertheless, in Old Testament times the Lord would not accept anything offered to Him at the "high places."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He regarded any sacrifice offered there as an abomination in His sight, for it was presented in a place of division, in a place that opened the door for the indulgence of lust and gave opportunity for the pursuit of ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only the worship, the offerings, and the incense at the place of God's unique choice were regarded as genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That place killed lust and gave no opportunity for ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even to present a genuine offering in a place other than the unique place of God's choice creates an opportunity for the indulgence of selfish desire.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Any "high place," even those at which genuine sacrifices are offered, causes damage to the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those "high places" are used by people in their lust and ambition for the fulfillment of their own purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From my experience in the Lord's recovery on the mainland of China, I can testify that the unique place of God's choice leaves no opportunity for the indulgence of lust or for the exercise of our ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During all the years in China, I was under the direction of Brother Nee's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In all my preaching I was the same as he.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the "high places" were torn down, and therefore there was no room for the indulgence of lust or the carrying out of selfish ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The same is true among us today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We care only to exalt Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we maintain the ground of oneness, God's unique choice, without elevating anything other than Christ, it will not be possible to have division.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Lord's recovery we elevate Christ and Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may talk a great deal about life, but we do not even elevate life to the point of making it a "high place."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Certain brothers among us are very keen and have a good deal of natural ability.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But their keenness and ability must be restricted by the ground of God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This restriction will keep them from elevating something in place of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We in the Lord's recovery can testify that, in contrast to today's Christianity, we have no "high places."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Christianity "high places" are found everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Each denomination and independent group is an elevation, a "high place."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we have pointed out repeatedly, these elevations are all related to lust or ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>CARRIED AWAY INTO CAPTIVITY</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the Old Testament record, after the ground of oneness was damaged, it was actually lost.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Israel, the northern kingdom, was conquered by the Assyrians, and Judah, the southern kingdom, was conquered by the Babylonians.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because of the sin of Jeroboam in setting up the high places, the nation of Israel was led into captivity by the Assyrians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In His wrath, God chose to cast them out of the holy land.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second Kings 17:22 and 23 say, "For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them; until the Lord removed Israel out of His sight."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Israelites were in the holy land, they were in the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when they were carried away to Assyria, they were cast out of the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Israel's captivity should have been a warning to Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The kingdom of Judah, however, did not heed this warning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As 2 Kings 17:19 says, "Also Judah kept not the commandments of the Lord their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those in Judah built up more high places and gave more opportunity for evil to come in. This forced the Lord to send in Pharaoh-nechoh 2 Kings 23:29-35 . Pharaoh-nechoh removed Jehoahaz from the kingship and made Eliakim king, changing his name to Jehoiakim 2 Kings 23:34 . Jehoahaz was taken to Egypt, where he died.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because Judah would not remove the high places, the Lord eventually sent in the Babylonian army under Nebuchadnezzar.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, the temple was destroyed, and a great many of the people were carried away into captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Formerly, all the children of Israel were in the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They were one people with a unique center of worship in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Firstly, they damaged this oneness by setting up high places throughout the land.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But eventually they went on to lose this oneness through the invasion of the Assyrians and the Babylonians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Having been cast out of the good land, God's people became Egyptian Jews, Assyrian Jews, or Babylonian Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The ground of oneness had been lost absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Psalm 137:1-6 is a description of their plight in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God's people were in a strange land, and they could not sing the Lord's song.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Instead, by the rivers of Babylon they sat down and wept when they remembered Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What a picture of the situation of Christians today!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The vast majority of Christians have been carried away into captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The ground of oneness has not only been damaged it has been fully lost.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Very few Christians have any realization of what the ground of oneness is.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As a result of their captivity, many of the children of Israel even forgot their language.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They eventually became Egyptians, Assyrians, and Babylonians.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a vivid portrait of today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>May the Holy Spirit speak more to us concerning the damage and loss of the ground of oneness.</S>
