   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-TWO THE DISCOVERY OF A LAW Date: November 10, 1940</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Rom 7:21-25a PAUL'S DISCOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Romans 7:21 Paul said, "I find then the law with me."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was a great discovery, which Paul discovered through much experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this world statistics are useful because we can use them to find out the facts and the true nature of things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul's spiritual experience has something to do with statistics.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through his many years of experience, he discovered that whenever he tried to do good, evil was present with him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If, out of the thousands and thousands of times that he tried to do good, evil was present every time, it meant that he was experiencing a law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If something repeatedly happens, the phenomenon constitutes a law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul discovered that sin was not something accidental or incidental, nor was it a careless mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He discovered that sin was abiding in him; there was a constant repetition of it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through this he discovered sin as a law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a great discovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The amazing thing is that many Christians have never discovered such a law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This does not mean that this law does not exist in them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It merely means that they have not discovered it yet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sin is not just an act, but a law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since sin is a law, it does not matter how many different kinds of sin one commits.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This, of course, does not mean that I am telling you to sin more.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The fact is that a man never commits many different kinds of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may be susceptible to a few sins, and I may be susceptible to a few other sins, but the number is never big.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every person commits, at most, a few major sins; these sins are especially powerful in him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is these special sins that he frequently commits.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sin is a law, and since it is a law and not just an act, victory over sin cannot be accomplished through an act, but through another law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul was defeated by one sin greed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This refers not only to the coveting of others' possessions as prohibited by the Ten Commandments, but to a lust in one's heart as well.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many people think that the sin of covetousness is what a thief commits when he enters into another person's house to steal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, sin is something that dwells within man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether such a sin is turned into an action or not, the fact is that it is still sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, if one has a temper within him, whether or not this temper is manifested, it is still temper.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who are talkative are always talking whether or not they open their mouth, and whether they are standing or sitting down.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who are proud are, of course, arrogant when they accomplish something, but they are also arrogant when they cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are proud before those who are inferior to them, and they are also proud before those who are superior to them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The only time when they are not proud is when they are no longer themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One young man is very talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever others see him, they find him talking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether or not you want to listen to him, he still wants to talk to you, and he always insists that you listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One day I met this man with another sister and a host.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I thought that he was going to talk, and I was preparing to listen, but he did not speak that day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everyone was silent for about ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Later, I learned that the reason he did not speak was that he was sick.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Talkativeness is a law in this person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He only stopped speaking when he was sick and too weak to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many people only know of sin as a kind of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They do not see that sin is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If something remains the same way all the time and in every place, it is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One man was very proud.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whenever he sat down, others around him could sense his arrogance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was arrogant even when he tried to speak in a humble way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>While he was speaking, his words may have sounded humble, but his person remained proud.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His humility was forced.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This kind of arrogance and false humility is actually worse than pride.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>With many people their sacrifice is worse than their parsimony, their love is worse than their hatred, and their humility is worse than their pride.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is because their sacrifice, love, and humility are all artificial.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Before I was saved, it was easy for me to lose my temper, and it was easy for me to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After I believed in the Lord, I discovered that I still yielded easily to temper and pride, and I tried my best to deal with these sins and to overcome them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet I discovered that patience was something bound by time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I could temporarily put off my temper, but I could never be free of my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is foolish to try to fight a law.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In order to be free from sin, the prerequisite is understanding that sin is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As long as a man continues to consider sins as isolated and incidental weaknesses, he cannot be free from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul experienced deliverance when he discovered sin as a law.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The turning point for Paul was in verse 21, not in verse 25.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Verse 21 is like a bridge with a stretch of road on both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In Romans 7:7-20 Paul gave a testimony of his own history.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He was continually defeated, and he found it useless to try to overcome by his will.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Verse 21 is a grand conclusion to his failures in verses 7 through 20.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It was also the beginning of a great discovery of a law.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He said, "I find...."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Such a discovery was an inward discovery; it was not a mental discovery.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The law in Romans 7:7-20 refers to the outward Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After verse 21 the law becomes something spiritual and inward.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many people are familiar only with the law at Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They try their best to do good and satisfy the demands of the law, but they fail again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God's demand comes as a law.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Man's failure to answer to such a law is also a law.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Moses gave the law to the Israelites at Mount Sinai, and Paul also passed on a law to us in Romans 7.</S>
