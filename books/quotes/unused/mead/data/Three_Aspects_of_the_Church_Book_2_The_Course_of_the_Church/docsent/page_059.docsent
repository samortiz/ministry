   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECOVERY OF LIVING BY FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Formerly, almost no one among the believers in China lived by faith before God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sister Dora Yu had this experience to some extent, but there was not a solid testimony of living by faith until we were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the past, people first agreed upon a salary and then began to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We saw this problem with many people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Harbin, a congregation was recently raised up; they offered to hire Pastor Ting Li-mei for two hundred silver dollars a month.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, Ting Li-mei would not agree to it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>My sister graduated from a theological seminary, and in her letters to the family she used to tell us which places paid more and which places paid less.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time, the matter of living by faith had not been recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Lord raised us up in China, the brothers were an anti-testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They said that the servants of God should live by trusting in God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the beginning it was very difficult for the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The beginning of anything is not easy, but the brothers fought the good fight.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever I heard their testimonies, I felt that God was working in them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Regrettably, some people soon damaged this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some spiritually gifted persons began to travel to preach the Word, receiving support from many places.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>May the Lord have mercy on us not to take this way; it is wrong to take a salary from a church organization, and it is wrong to take money for itinerant preaching, taking advantage of a spiritual gift.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, some traveling preachers have a special announcement at the beginning and end of every meeting that there will be a collection for the speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kind of situation existed here in Taipei just a few years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a deformed practice of living by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some people have asked why we do not go out more often to hold conferences, because if we held more conferences, we would probably get more money.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We cannot hold conferences if it seems that we are holding them just for money.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are pitiful people without faith, but because the Lord has had mercy on us, there are some kinds of support that we can receive and some that we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is especially true for the young brothers and sisters; if they do not take care of monetary matters properly, it is better for them to take jobs instead of serving the Lord full time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first time I went to Manila, I stayed there for five and a half months, and before I returned to Taiwan, the elders in Manila discussed the needs of Taiwan behind my back.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I knew about it; they discussed it in the elders meeting on at least two occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I solemnly beseeched the brothers not to make any announcements to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord does not send us out to ask for money; that kind of thing is low and despicable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are forced by the environment to speak such foolish things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The recovery of living by faith is the seventh recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE RECOVERY OF FELLOWSHIP IN MUTUAL LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many among us were members in a denomination; therefore, we are aware of the general situation in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1922 a few brothers were raised up, and they began to love one another and have fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They had the condition of Philadelphia to a much greater degree than we have it today.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, thank the Lord that the mutual love is still here today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This, too, is one of the important early recoveries among us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE RECOVERY OF BEING CALLED</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before we were raised up by the Lord, being a preacher was considered a profession; it did not matter if a person had been called by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I know of a mother who educated her brightest child in medicine, her second-brightest child in business, and consecrated her least intelligent child to the church to study theology.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I had an irresponsible classmate who began working in the news media but was not very successful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Less than six months after I was saved, he came to me one day and said, I heard that you have believed in Jesus and that you are very zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Could you give me an introduction to your church?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I would like to go to your church and be a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These two examples show that most people have the impression that being a preacher is low and base.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Western missionaries came to China they had a difficult time finding proper helpers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Preachers had such a low status that many of them were false and were not raised up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only when we were raised up in China was the matter of being called by the Lord recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We saw that being a servant of the Lord is a matter of being called.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When someone is called by God, God commissions that person to do His work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The truth that all the saints should serve God and that all the believers are priests has been recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The matter of being called, however, applies to those who work solely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a person has not been called, he should remain at his job.</S>
