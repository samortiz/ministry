   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PREFACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Watchman Nee gave a series of studies on the characters of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the early part of 1940.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These messages were published in Chinese in 1955 by the Taiwan Gospel Book Room under the title, The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Volume 35 is a translation of this Chinese publication.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Notes from this same series were later used as the basis for another book, Changed into His Likeness, which was published in English in 1967 by Christian Literature Crusade.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the contents of the two books are essentially the same, we have not included Changed into His Likeness in The Collected Works.</S>
