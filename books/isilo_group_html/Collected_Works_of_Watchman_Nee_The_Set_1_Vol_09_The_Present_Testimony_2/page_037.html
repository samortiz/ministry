Every time we read about God's grace-how God has worked for us-we have to ask if this is a promise or a fact. If it is a promise, we should meet its conditions and pray much until God gives to us the assurance within that the promise is for us. We will have the faith to believe that God has heard our prayers, and we will spontaneously praise God. Although God's promise may not be fulfilled immediately, we can say by faith that it is already in our hand.</P><P>What should we do if it is a fact? Should we ask God to accomplish it again? Should we ask God to make it a reality again? Should we ask God to give it to us again? If we pray to God, "God, make me resurrect with Christ and ascend with Christ," God will say, "You have already been raised and ascended with Christ." All the facts in the Bible have already been accomplished by God. All the facts of God have been done and cannot be done again. If we see a fact, we can immediately exercise faith to thank God, saying, "God, it is so. The matter is settled." We must believe that our life is according to the fact and should begin living according to the fact. We prove our faith by such a practice. God says that we have already resurrected and ascended. We do not have to ask God to cause us to resurrect or ascend anymore. We should believe that we are indeed resurrected and ascended and thank God that we have been resurrected and ascended. Towards the world and Satan, we should adopt the attitude that we have already resurrected and ascended. We should not adopt an attitude of hoping that we will resurrect or ascend, but that we have already resurrected and ascended.</P><P>When we read the Bible, we should be very careful to determine God's facts and exercise our faith over them one by one to believe that these facts have been accomplished according to the Bible. If we do this, our spiritual life will be many times richer. If we cannot believe, we have to honestly confess that our hearts are evil and that we have an evil heart of unbelief. We should ask God to have mercy on us and remove this heart of unbelief from us. It is unfortunate that, even though God has accomplished many facts for us, we do not have any experience of them because of our lack of faith.</P><P>We can take Romans 6:6 as another example. "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves." This verse speaks about three things: sin, the old man, and the body of sin. Sin is the master, the old man is the self that likes to go along with sin, and the body is the puppet of the old man, which practices sin outwardly. Sin is the master within us which directs the old man and causes the old man to direct the body to sin. Therefore, when a man sins, he should not only blame it on the devil or inward sin. He should blame the old man-himself. We have sin within us. This sin is what we commonly call the sinful nature. The old man represents everything that comes from Adam. This old man follows sin's direction and causes the body to sin. The body is merely the outward slave. Some have thought that the way to be delivered from sin is by inwardly eradicating the root of sin. Others have thought that the way is by outwardly suppressing the body of sin. But God's work is completely different from man's work. He deals with the old man. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, God crucified us there as well. "Our old man has been crucified with Him" (6:6). Just as the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, we were crucified on the cross. God has dealt with our old man. Many times, we want to deal with our old man by ourselves. But we find that our old man is still alive in our experience. Thank God, the Lord Jesus has already crucified our old man on the cross. God has put the resurrection life of Christ within us. This is our new man. Sin has not changed and the body of sin has not changed. God has crucified the old man on the cross and the new man is now within us. Since the old man is crucified and the new man is here, we can have new hopes, new desires, new inclinations, and new thoughts. Although sin remains powerful, it cannot direct the body anymore. It is as if the body has become unemployed. "Annulled" in the original language includes the sense of being unemployed. When God crucified our old man with the Lord Jesus on the cross, the body of sin became unemployed. Since the old man is gone, the boastful mouth, the hasty hand, and the wandering eyes have all become unemployed. As a result, we are no longer a slave to sin.</P><P>Some have said that the body has hurt us and hurt us seriously; therefore, we should suppress the body. Others have said that the root of sin has hurt us and hurt us seriously; therefore, we should eradicate the root of sin. But God does not say this. God did not deal with the root of sin nor the body of sin, but with our old man, crucifying it with the Lord Jesus on the cross. As a result, the body of sin is unemployed and sin is no longer the master. The root of sin and the body of sin still exist. Even though the root of sin still tries to tempt us, the fact that we have the new man and our old man has been crucified makes it possible for every one of us to have the experience of victory.</P><P>Many have asked, "Why can I not overcome sin?" I am afraid that the problem with many people is that they only know God's promises; they do not know God's facts. They try to handle God's facts the same way that they handle God's promises. Some have thought that, before there is the possibility for victory over sin, they have to receive a "second blessing" or "second work" to remove the root of sin. But the Lord Jesus has died and resurrected. Many think that even though Christ has been crucified, they have not yet been crucified. Many think that even though Christ has been resurrected, they have not yet been resurrected. Many people do not realize that the old man has been crucified, so they beseech God to crucify their old man. They do not realize that they have been resurrected, so they ask God to grant them the resurrection life. Little do they realize that they are asking for the impossible because God has already done these things. Once He has done them, they are done forever. He cannot do them a second time. There is a great difference between promises and facts. If we do not distinguish between them, we will not progress at all in our spiritual journey because the first step in our spiritual journey, the victory over sin, is missing. A promise will be done, while a fact has been done. God does not need nor can He accomplish the facts again.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 09: The Present Testimony (2) &nbsp; pg 37</div><br></body></html>
