<h1 class="title">PUTTING OFF THE INFLUENCE OF TRADITION<br />
AND SUPPLYING LIFE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE INFLUENCE OF TRADITIONAL CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>For many years we have been influenced by Christianity not only in our teachings but also in our practices. The study of education confirms that demonstrative patterns or practices are far more influential than words. Children copy what they see and hear. For example, when children see Western gunfights on television, they respond by playing with toy guns. Before we were saved or even joined a Christian denomination, we had some realization regarding Christian practices, and when we saw the situation with our own eyes, our understanding of these practices became governing concepts. For example, before we were saved, we may have had some realization that Christians should be zealous in their work for the Lord, and after we were saved, we made a determination to be zealous. When we saw other Christians being zealous, we responded in the same way. This shows that we have been under the influence of others, whether we love the Lord or not and whether we are zealous or not.</p>
<p>There are several aspects to the influence of traditional Christianity. First, being a Christian is commonly assumed to involve human effort. Consequently, it is assumed that in order to be a proper Christian, we only need to be taught or to listen to sermons. Whether a particular speaking is high or low, spiritual or unspiritual, or right or wrong, the purpose of a sermon is assumed to be to give us teachings to keep. Even matters such as prayer and the pursuit of holiness are associated with human effort. Thus, to many, being a Christian involves human effort.</p>
<p>Second, we are deeply influenced by the neglect of the exercise of the spirit in Christian worship. No Christian, even you or I, has put off this influence absolutely. There have been many movements in reaction to the neglect of the exercise of the spirit. For example, the Pentecostal movement rose up in reaction to the dull, traditional ways of worship; however, the Pentecostal movement reacted to the point of being completely without order. We must admit that we are still under the influence of the traditions of Christianity in our living and in our meetings. Our living depends on human effort, and our meetings depend on habitual modes of worship. Even in our prayer and in our exercise of the spirit, we follow a habitual mode that is not fully living, and it is easy for us to quickly turn a practice into an inflexible habit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN LIFE BEING A LIVING WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>According to the revelation in the Bible, especially in the New Testament, the Christian living is a living that is one with the Lord. Paul says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). He also says, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21). His living with the Lord was not the result of teaching or human effort; rather, it was the issue of his moment-by-moment and day-by-day contact with the Lord. We all know these verses, but we still do not have such a Christian living. Instead, we are accustomed to habits involving human effort, which do not have much element of the spirit. Although we know that we should live in the spirit, we follow methods in our actual practice. We are rarely in a condition of living in the spirit. Our human effort rather than our living with the Lord proves that we have been very much influenced by Christianity.</p>
<p>Breathing does not involve a conscious human effort; it is part of our spontaneous living. If someone needs to &ldquo;work&rdquo; in order to breathe, I am afraid that he will not be alive for very long. Our breathing is not worked out but lived out spontaneously. According to the revelation in the Bible, our Christian living should be as spontaneous as breathing; when we use our spirit to contact the Lord every moment, we are breathing spiritually. Our meetings should not be according to a set way; they should be an expression that comes out of our spiritual breathing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETINGS NOT HAVING A SET WAY<br />
BUT FOLLOWING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>People have spent considerable time studying the Bible concerning how Christians should meet, but it is difficult to find a set way. Many examples are given, and some even seem to be contradictory. For example, in 1 Corinthians 12:29 Paul asks, &ldquo;Are all apostles? Are all prophets?&rdquo; yet in 14:31 he says, &ldquo;You can all prophesy one by one.&rdquo; Verse 29 in chapter 12 suggests that not everyone is a prophet, but 14:31 says that all can prophesy one by one. Do these two verses contradict each other? There is no clear answer to this seeming contradiction. We can only say that the verse in chapter 12 refers to the person of the prophet, whereas the verse in chapter 14 refers to the speaking activity and action of prophesying.</p>
<p>There also seems to be a contradiction related to women speaking in the meeting. In verse 5 of chapter 11 Paul says, &ldquo;Every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head; for it is one and the same as she who is shaved.&rdquo; According to the context, a woman can speak in a meeting if her head is covered; however, in verse 34 of chapter 14 he says, &ldquo;Women should be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak.&rdquo; This verse clearly says that women should not speak in the church.</p>
<p>According to the truth, it is not fitting for sisters to teach in the meetings. However, it is too legal to forbid the sisters from speaking at all in a meeting. In the past we were influenced by the Brethren, and we felt that the sisters should not preach or even pray. Slowly, however, we began to allow the sisters to pray and testify. Because the gifts of Peace Wang and Ruth Lee were so evident, a place was arranged for them to speak to the sisters. But then the brothers complained that they could not listen; consequently, a folding screen was placed between the brothers and sisters so that the brothers could listen. This shows that there would be a shortage in the meetings if the sisters were not able to speak.</p>
<p>We should be in the spirit with all things. We should be flexible and not care too much for our views and rules. We should not intentionally overthrow our ways, but neither should we keep to rigid routines. We must learn not to follow our old methods in our gatherings, because the Spirit is always fresh. Even in pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s Word we should not keep to old forms. This requires that we have genuine contact with the Lord and a living relationship with Him. It is easy to follow our old ways, but it is not as easy to be new every day. No one likes to start things again and again, but in spiritual matters we need to have living contact with the Lord daily in order to take the Lord as our new beginning. We should never have an &ldquo;old&rdquo; day, and we should not rely on our former experiences or past teachings.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
