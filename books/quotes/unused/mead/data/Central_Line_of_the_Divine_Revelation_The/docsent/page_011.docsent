   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit Being the Flow of the Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit is the flow of the Trinity, the realization of the Son for His reaching and entering into His believers John 7:38-39; Rev 22:1; John 14:16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The source, the course, and the flow are according to the notion of our Triune God as the living water, which eventually becomes a river.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the end of the Bible, in the very last chapter, our Triune God is shown as a flowing river, the river of water of life Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such a flowing river has a source, a course, and a flow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The source, the course, and the flow are three aspects of the one river.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1977 I visited Israel with a group of brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One day we went to the source of the Jordan River at the foot of Mount Hermon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is a spring there with a fountain as the source.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The spring has a flow, and the flow is a stream, a river.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Such a river is a picture of our Triune God with the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the biblical illustration in Revelation 22.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Revelation 22:1 the Son is the Lamb, indicating that the Son is the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is one throne for both God and the Lamb, signifying that God and the Lamb are one the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, God the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Revelation says that the Lamb is the lamp 21:23 , and God is within Him as the light 22:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, God is in the Lamb on the throne, and out of His throne flows the river of water of life, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Spirit flows it carries the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then in the flow of the river, the Lamb becomes the tree of life Rev 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The tree of life growing on the two sides of the river signifies that the tree of life is a vine, spreading and proceeding along the flow of the water of life for God's people to receive and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The tree of life symbolizes the Triune God to be our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Triune God is the water of life for us to drink and the tree of life for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At this point I want us to realize that we should not study the person of God in an objective, theological way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not study the Divine Trinity as a mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible shows us that the Divine Trinity is for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This verse mentions three things: grace, love, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, however, this is one thing in three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The source is the divine love, the course is the divine grace, and the flow is the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Out of God the Father flows the grace through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then this grace flows in the fellowship of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second Corinthians 13:14 shows us three persons in three aspects: God the Father, Christ, and the Spirit; and love, grace, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God the Father as love is the source, Christ as grace is the course, and the Spirit as fellowship is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the end of the Bible, we see our Triune God flowing forever.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His flowing is for the purpose of supplying His redeemed with Himself as drink and food so that we may enjoy Him as the bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the beginning of my Christian life I did not realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But today I fully realize that we need to experience, enjoy, and express the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
