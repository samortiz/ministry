   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Reformation until Now</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the recovery already mentioned, God raised up another group of people, men like J. N. Darby, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They saw something concerning the heavenly vision, the removal of the flesh, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There were also men like Pearson Smith, who recovered sanctification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There was Madame Guyon, and there was George M ller, who saw the matter of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then there was Evan Roberts, and then in recent times there was T. Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can say that there has never been a time when the church was as clear and as rich as it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Continuation of the Recovery of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are sixty-six books in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of these, only one book has no ending, and that is the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This book only has a beginning; it has no ending.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the other books have a proper conclusion and an ending.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After Acts 28, there are still many untold stories.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John, Peter, Barnabas, and Paul all went to Rome and were judged there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The whereabouts of many other brothers and sisters are not mentioned in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why does Acts not have an ending?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is because we are still continuing the book of Acts today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The gospel has not been thoroughly preached, and the Lord has not come back yet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today we are still writing Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ephesians 2 speaks of the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ephesians 4 speaks of the perfecting of the saints by the gifts, for the arriving at the oneness of the faith and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ unto the building up of the Body in love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ephesians 5 speaks of the church being without spot, wrinkle, blame, and reproach, and being fully glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These are conditions that have not been attained yet.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are still in the continuation of the recovery of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I was in England, Brother Austin-Sparks asked me what chapter in the Bible is the hardest to fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I told him that the hardest chapter should be Ephesians 4 on the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After reading that chapter, I am very concerned that this chapter will not be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am confident about the other chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But I do not as yet have the confidence about this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For the past two thousand years, Ephesians 4 has not yet been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the present condition, I am afraid that given two thousand more years, this chapter will still not be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If this is the case, humanly speaking, the Lord will not be able to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is true that outwardly the church is in desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the question today is whether or not there is a group of people who will stand on God's side to receive God's riches, and who will pay the price to appropriate these riches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>FLEEING DISHONORING THINGS,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>TAKING THE WAY OF THE RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is our position today?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are standing between two contradicting things today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Outwardly, we should learn to condemn the desolation around us, and we should be separated from it and be delivered from all degradations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this reason, we have to be clear about the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We cannot say that everything is all right; we have to separate the vessels of honor from the vessels of dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The vessels of honor are not born honorable; they become honorable through their separation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible says that if a man cleanses himself from the dishonorable things, he will be a vessel of honor 2 Tim 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Honor comes through separation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All those who will not separate themselves from dishonor, who are not serious about anything, will be vessels of dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is it to be a person of dishonor?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is to mingle oneself with the vessels of dishonor without realizing that there is anything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is one aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the same time, we have to learn to live in the Body, to learn to be the sons of God, and to learn to take the way of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In God's eyes, the church has come up to the full measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ already.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This matter was not realized in the past; it was not realized yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But today it is here.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What the Lord is doing today is much more than what He has done before.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today, Christians should come up to the standard of God's advanced work in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not enough to see just the outward desolations.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is the need to advance further to see the Lord's work today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We do not know when the Lord will stop His work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We only know that God is preparing the stones today.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One day, when all the stones are prepared, that will be the day when the temple is completed.</S>
