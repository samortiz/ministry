   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE THINGS TO UNDERSTAND IN GOD'S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us spend some time to consider some portions of the Scriptures that seem to speak of perdition after salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before this, we have to know a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, the Word of God has absolutely no conflict with itself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, God can never say that His sheep will never perish or lose their eternal life, and on the other hand, tell man that he will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man can say wrong things, but God's work is a work of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He can never say anything by mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If it is so clear on the positive side, it can never be contradicting on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The things on the negative side must be concerned with other matters related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second, we have taken the time to identify these passages.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Among them we see both genuinely saved ones as well as false ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus had a false disciple, Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Peter was baptizing people, there was a person named Simon who might not have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul also met many false brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Peter said that there were many false prophets, and John said that many had departed from them and proved to not be of them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, in the Bible, there are the genuinely saved ones and the nominally saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some are not saved at all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course they cannot pretend or cover up forever.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we can clearly differentiate between these few kinds of people, the problems will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if you mix these different kinds of people together, it is like mixing the tares with the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The result will be much confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Third, many places in the Bible speak of the discipline of Christians in this age and not of eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not think that because we are eternally saved, there is no such thing as discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Indeed, there is discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you fail and have become weak today, God will discipline you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is a difference between discipline and eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One cannot mix eternal perdition with discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many verses, which seem to speak of Christians being lost again, actually speak of Christians being disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only is there the question of discipline and the question of falsity, but also the question of the kingdom and of the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These few things are fundamentally different.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times, we apply words for the kingdom to the eternal age, and words concerning the reward to the subject of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Naturally, this will produce many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must realize that there is a difference between the kingdom and salvation, and there is a difference between eternal life and reward.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The way God will deal with us in the millennium is different from the way He will deal with us in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is a difference in the way God deals with man in the restored world and in the new world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The millennium is related to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is related to our works and our walk after we have become a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The millennial kingdom is for the purpose of judging our walk.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But in eternity, in the new heaven and new earth, everything is free grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All who are thirsty may come and drink freely Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This word is spoken after the new heaven and the new earth have come.</S>
