   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen the holiness and majesty of the Lord who resembles the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let us consider His position.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"He had in His right hand seven stars."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ holds them in His right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that Christ has authority over them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible, the right hand signifies authority and exaltation Psa 17:7; 18:35; Acts 2:33 .</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are safe in the Lord's hand, yet their responsibility is great.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, these messengers are only in the Lord's hand; they are not yet crowns on the Lord's head, because the time for them to be glorified has not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They must still press on faithfully before they will shine forever.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to fear the Lord because judgment begins from the house of God!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Revelation 2 and 3 show us that the Lord is walking in the midst of the seven lampstands.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He charged John to write to the messenger in the church in Pergamos, saying, "These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword....Repent therefore; but if not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth" Rev 2:12, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The sword of His mouth is simply the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart."</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Lord was tempted by the devil in the wilderness, He overcame with the words of Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's word is indeed sharp and powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we should treasure His word and put our trust in His word.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His appearing as the sun is to the world, and His appearing as the morning star is to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The morning star appears just before dawn.</S>
