   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For the church life in God's economy, we need to meet and serve in mutuality according to the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our meetings should be in mutuality with all the saints of different ages functioning for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A meeting in mutuality is "music."</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not gather them into our home.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead, we need to go to their homes and bring them "food to go."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we go to people's homes, we should not go in a formal, ritualistic, and religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do this, we spontaneously become the clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to start the home meetings in a rejoicing, singing way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we are approaching the door of the new ones' homes, we should be singing.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are going to care for the new believers, we cannot take our natural way.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In addition to feeding the new ones in their homes, we should gather them together for group meetings.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>and the Processed Triune God as the Manifestation</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To meet as a proper local church, we need to have the adequate and proper leadership for the keeping of a good order 1 Cor 14:40 with the all-inclusive Christ as the center and the processed Triune God as the manifestation Col 3:10-11; 1 Tim 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In every church, we should have the proper leadership, and this leadership is the deputy authority, the authority representing God in His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to the principles ordained in God's government, deputy authority is everywhere on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In a family there are the parents; in a school there are the teachers and the principal; and in a city there are the mayor and the police with the law courts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without the proper government and the police, a city would not be in the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It would become riotous without any deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the church life, we need to keep a good order by taking, receiving, and accepting the proper leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Among the saints there are always some who can take the leadership according to the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Actually, the proper leadership is the apostles' teaching Acts 2:42 , the teaching of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The apostles' teaching is our leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is similar to saying that the Constitution of the United States is our country's leadership, the highest authority.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The president takes the lead according to the Constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the president is mistaken in anything, he will be corrected by the Constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our constitution in the Lord's recovery is the apostles' teaching, the teaching of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The teaching of the New Testament is our leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we have the adequate and proper leadership in the churches, we can have a becoming and orderly church life to exhibit Christ and to glorify the Father.</S>
