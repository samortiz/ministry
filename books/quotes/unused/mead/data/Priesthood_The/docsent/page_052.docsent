   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SOME PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If the sisters want to pray about their husbands, they must first read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When they read the Word, they light the lamp, and they are enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This enlightening changes their concept of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without reading the Word, they may pray in one way for their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But after reading the Word, they will pray in the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The way is changed, but the subject remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose a sister is going to pray for her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before reading the Word she intends to pray in this way: Lord, You know my husband has a bad temper, and it is so easy for him to lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I just cannot do anything, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You must deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before reading the Word, this is the way she intends to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But, by reading the Word she realizes that it is not a matter of asking the Lord to deal with her husband, but that she herself needs to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After reading the Word, her prayer is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She prays: Lord, I do thank You for Your sovereignty in giving me such a good husband.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I do need Your grace that I may learn the lesson to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These are two ways of praying, but which way is acceptable to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first way is really not a prayer at all, but an accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A sister who prays in this way is not praying for her husband but is accusing him before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is only when we are in the light by reading the Word that we will pray in the second way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am afraid that when some of the brothers pray for the elders, they pray in an accusing way: Lord, You know the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I cannot help the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You must come in to vindicate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Is this a real prayer or an accusation?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One thing is sure: such a prayer by anyone is certain to be a prayer apart from dealing with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is burning the incense without lighting the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is burning the incense in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if we will first light the lamp by dealing with the Word, our concept will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We will pray, Lord, have mercy upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not my brother that needs Thy dealing, but I!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How we need the lighting of the lamp before the burning of the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must have the real dealing with the Word before we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The light from the Word will expose us, and this will enlighten us to have the right words to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So many intended prayers are simply canceled by reading the Word, and so many right prayers come out of the reading of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The proper prayer, the right prayer, must be the prayer issuing out of the light from reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE PURE, BEATEN OLIVE OIL</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we must see another practical matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Old Testament time, olive oil, pure and beaten, was used for the light of the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all know that oil in typology signifies the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Just as the oil was needed to light the lamp, we need the Spirit to enlighten the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Without the Holy Spirit the Word does not shine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Darby tells us that to light the lamp means to cause the lamp to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is quite interesting, for many times when we read the Word some of the words rise up and give light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How does the Word give this kind of light?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is only by the Spirit, the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And the oil today is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whenever we come to read the Word, we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then, in our spirit the pure olive oil will rise up to cause the Word to give us light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we read the Word by exercising only our mentality and understanding, it does not give light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But if we exercise our spirit to contact the Word, immediately we sense something enlightening and rising up within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then the Word becomes the living Word within us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is through the indwelling Spirit as the pure oil that we have the light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Word will be lightened and will give us light.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is the pure and beaten olive oil that gives the light.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Is not the Holy Spirit pure?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Yes, the Holy Spirit is pure, but our spirit is not so pure.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our spirit has to be purified and beaten.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In typology, Christ is the olive.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When He was beaten and pressed on the cross, the pure oil, that is, the Holy Spirit, came out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You and I need to be purified; we need to be beaten and pressed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many times when we read a verse from the Word, there is simply no light.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is no light until one day we are under a certain kind of pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Under this pressure we come back to the same Word again, and then it gives the light.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to be purified, and we need to be pressed and beaten.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need a certain kind of pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then the Spirit will come out and the Word will be lightened; the lamp will be lit for us to be under its enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the way we must pray and offer something to God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I must tell you again that whatever we utter to God as prayer in this way will be something purely of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It will not be a natural prayer, but a real, sweet savor to God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>So we have seen clearly that if we are going to contact the Lord, we must know how to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>And we must know how to deal with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then we will know what to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Every morning and every evening we must exercise our spirit to deal with the Word to light the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then we will be enlightened and know what to express to God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>By this kind of prayer, whatever we utter will be something of Christ as the sweet incense unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Psalmist says that he rose up early to pray, but he prayed by dealing with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Without the Word, which is the light, he could not pray to burn the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Lord Jesus said, If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you John 15:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This means that we must be enlightened and dealt with by the Word in order to know what to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must put all these principles into practice every time we come to the Lord to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must realize the blood, the consuming fire, and the satisfaction of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then we must learn how to exercise our spirit so that the Holy Spirit may have a free way to enlighten the Word of God that we may get the light.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Under this enlightening, we will have the utterance to express something which issues out of Christ as the sweet incense to God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Then not only will we be satisfied, but God also will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It will be a real satisfaction both to us and to God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we may meet God and fellowship with Him day by day, morning and evening, in this way.</S>
