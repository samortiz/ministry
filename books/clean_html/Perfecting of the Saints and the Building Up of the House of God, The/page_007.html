<h2 class="head1">THE PICTURE IN THE BIBLE<br />
CONCERNING GOD BEING MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>Hence, we need to be alert so that we do not become &ldquo;dropouts&rdquo; in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We need to catch up with God and see what He wants to recover. We should ask ourselves why God placed Adam and Eve in front of the tree of life after He created them. I have considered this matter many times. If I were God, after I made Adam and Eve, I would tell Adam why I created him. Then I would tell him what to do because I have a purpose in creating him. Finally, I would tell him what he should not do.</p>
<p>After God made Adam and Eve, He did not tell Adam why he was created or what he should do. Instead, God placed man in the garden that He had planted. In the middle of the garden, there was the tree of life. There was also a river that watered the garden, and there were gold, bdellium, and onyx stone (Gen. 2:8-12). Everything was wonderful, except one item. Therefore, God said to Adam, &ldquo;Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo; (v. 17).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISION OF GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE TO BE MAN&rsquo;S FOOD</h2>
<p>This simple description from Genesis 2 reveals God&rsquo;s mysterious intention. According to our natural concept, we think that God wants us to worship and serve Him, that is, to do things for Him. It is difficult for us to drop this concept. But the Bible reveals that God wants us to take Him as food. Genesis 2 presents the first vision in the entire Bible. This great vision controls all the visions in the Bible.</p>
<p>God wants us only to eat Him. He does not want us to do anything else. As long as we assimilate God into us, we have everything, and everything is accomplished. Nothing in the universe is more crucial than this. The Bible shows that after God created man, He placed man in front of Himself as the tree of life so that man would take Him as food. God presented Himself to man as food for man&rsquo;s enjoyment. God&rsquo;s unique intention, His desire, is for man to eat and drink Him daily.</p>
<p>We would never have this thought in our natural concept. We think about how to serve God and how to do things for Him. It is difficult for us to drop this concept. We do not know that God wants us to enjoy Him. Christianity needs to see this vision. All of God&rsquo;s children need to see this vision. During the time of Martin Luther, Christianity promoted the practice of asceticism and doing good in order to please God and be justified by Him. However, a hidden group of believers experienced justification by faith and not by good deeds, but the truth concerning justification by faith was not taught.</p>
<p>Today the atmosphere in Christianity is for man to zealously serve and worship God. Even people in the world have the natural concept that Christians are people who worship God and zealously serve Him. Almost every person has this concept. Even though some believers enjoy God as life in a hidden way, most believers do not have the concept that God can be enjoyed. When Luther was alive, he declared that man is justified, accepted, by God not by works but by faith. God needs some to stand up in these days and cry out, &ldquo;Brothers, God does not intend to ask us to do something for Him. God wants to be our food. He wants us to eat Him and enjoy Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God wants us to eat Him as food. God does not want us to worship Him or to be zealous for Him. God&rsquo;s desire is that we eat and enjoy Him. We need to speak this in order to turn the concept of Christianity. This is the purpose of Genesis 2. Moreover, the Bible ends with God&rsquo;s desire to be man&rsquo;s food. At the end of Revelation we see the tree of life and the river of water of life.</p>
<p>The first thing that God showed Adam was food. God wanted Adam to eat. This has been God&rsquo;s intention for the past six thousand years. God wants man to eat Him as the tree of life. God does not want man to do anything else. God&rsquo;s relationship with the children of Israel in the Old Testament reveals this matter of eating. The passover lamb and the unleavened bread were for God&rsquo;s people to eat. Manna was for them to eat, and the daily peace offering was also for them to eat. After the children of Israel entered the land of Canaan, all the produce of the land was for them to enjoy.</p>
<p>When God rescued the children of Israel out of Egypt, He did not ask them to do this or that. Instead, God wanted them to eat the passover lamb and unleavened bread. As the children of Israel journeyed through the wilderness, God wanted them to eat manna and to drink the water that flowed out of the smitten rock. God wanted the children of Israel to enter into the land of Canaan by faith. Canaan was a rich land flowing with milk and honey; it was a land where they could eat and drink. However, the Israelites did not understand God&rsquo;s desire. They wanted to do things for God. This forced God to give the law in order to show them that they could not do anything to please Him. It is difficult for the human mind to drop the concept of doing things. No matter what God says, man still wants to do something for God. Therefore, God gave the children of Israel the law for them to see that they could not please God. After God decreed the law, the children of Israel were unable to keep it.</p>
<p>When God became flesh and dwelt among men, the questions people asked Him were mainly concerning what work they should do (John 6:28). The people thought that the Lord came from God to be their teacher. Hence, their questions were related to doing and working. But the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life&rdquo; (v. 35), and &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever&rdquo; (v. 51). The Lord came to earth as the bread of life. He did not come to teach people what they should do; rather, He came for people to eat Him. He came that man may have life (10:10). The Lord came in the form of food to enter into people and give them life.</p>
<p>When we come to the Lord, should we ask what we should do, or should we eat Him as our food? We daily need to eat Him and enjoy Him. This must be our vision. Our living and work should be controlled by this vision. In the past our work was controlled by our natural concept. We constantly directed people to do things for God. We hardly ever dispensed God, that is, ministered God, into people for them to enjoy Him. We seldom led others to eat God.</p>
<p>At the end of Matthew 21 there is the parable of the vineyard, and in chapter 22 there is the parable of the wedding feast. The parable at the end of chapter 21 signifies the labor of people under the Old Testament law to plant, take care of, and prune the vineyard so that they can give the harvest to God. The parable at the beginning of chapter 22 is about a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son and invited people to the feast. The parable in chapter 21 is about people laboring, and the parable in chapter 22 is about a feast. The one parable refers to the Old Testament, which is under the law, and the other parable refers to the New Testament, which is under grace.</p>
<p>God did not originally intend to give the law; grace is His original intention. God&rsquo;s original intention is not for us to do things for Him but for us to enjoy Him by eating and drinking Him. In the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15, the son&rsquo;s work after he left the father was to feed hogs. When he returned to his father, he said, &ldquo;I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants&rdquo; (v. 19). To be a hired servant is a matter of working. But the father said, &ldquo;Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry, because this son of mine was dead and lives again; he was lost and has been found&rdquo; (vv. 23-24). The fattened calf signifies God in the Son for man to enjoy. The believers who serve God need to let this vision control their work.</p>
<p>We need to see this basic vision: God does not want us to do anything for Him. God has only one intention&mdash;He wants to give Himself to us as food in order to be our life. Let me repeat: God wants to give Himself as food to be our life. God wants us to enjoy Him. If we do not see this vision, we will not have a clear knowledge of life. If we want to know life, we need God to open our eyes so that we can see that God has come to be our food.</p>
