Amen.</p><p>The general subject of this series of messages is &ldquo;The Experience of God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation Equaling Reigning in Christ&rsquo;s Life.&rdquo; We may use the following statements as a summarized explanation of this subject:</p><p>God regenerates us that we may have His divine life and renews us that we may become His divine, new creation.</p><p>God sanctifies us that we may have His holy nature and transforms us that we may have His divine image.</p><p>God conforms us that we may have His divine element and glorifies us that we may have His divine image in full.</p><p>We reign in God&rsquo;s life by His organic salvation to accomplish His eternal economy and achieve His divine purpose.</p><p>In this message, the first message on God&rsquo;s organic salvation, we would like to see the matters of regeneration and renewing. It is not easy to speak such messages, but each message has an outline that can help us enter into the content of the message. Therefore, today I am not speaking to you in the way of delivering a message. Rather, I will speak item by item according to the message outline. I hope that you will try your best to follow me in each point. Every item mentioned in these outlines is a development, and the ultimate issue of this development is the New Jerusalem, which is an indescribable constitution of the processed and consummated Triune God with the regenerated and transformed tripartite man. Never consider that the New Jerusalem is a physical city. The New Jerusalem is an indescribable constitution of God and man. As such, it can be understood only according to the revelation of the Holy Spirit, and it cannot be expressed with human words.</p><h2 class="head1">I. GOD REGENERATES US<br />THAT WE MAY HAVE HIS DIVINE LIFE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. As the Base for Us to Grow in the Divine Life</h2><p>In God&rsquo;s organic salvation, God first regenerates us that we may have His divine life. We have said that regeneration is the center of God&rsquo;s entire salvation and the commencement of God&rsquo;s salvation in its organic aspect. Today we see further that regeneration is the base of God&rsquo;s organic salvation. This base is of two aspects: first, it is the base for us to grow in the divine life; second, it is the base for us to be built up in the divine life. Regeneration is the base both for our growth and for our building up.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Spirit of God Regenerates Us<br />in Our Spirit with the Divine Life</h2><p>In regeneration the Spirit of God regenerates us in our spirit with the divine life. Regeneration is not an outward matter. It is not &ldquo;to mend one&rsquo;s ways and turn over a new leaf&rdquo; as people generally say; nor is it, as the Chinese say, that &ldquo;everything in the past died yesterday and everything henceforth is born today.&rdquo; That is the common Chinese saying, not the biblical revelation. The reality of regeneration is related to the two spirits. One is the divine Spirit of God, the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ; the other is our created human spirit. On the day we received the Lord with repentance by believing into His name, He as the divine Spirit came into our spirit to enliven it; thus, we were regenerated in our created spirit. This is the real meaning of regeneration. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit (John 3:6). The Spirit begetting the spirit is the reality of regeneration. Our spirit has been regenerated and made alive; hence, we are a group of regenerated ones.</p><h2 class="head4">a. That We May Be Born of God as God&rsquo;s Species</h2><p>Regeneration is our being born of God as God&rsquo;s species (John 1:13), that is, that we may be of the same kind as God. Such a concept is exceedingly great, high, and profound. In the beginning, we human beings were created according to the image of God and were of God&rsquo;s kind. Yet we did not have God&rsquo;s life or His divine nature. However, when our spirit was made alive by His Spirit through regeneration, we were born to be children of God. John 1:12 says, &ldquo;But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s children are God&rsquo;s species. Goats beget goats, cows beget cows, and humans beget humans; likewise, God begets gods. We who have been born of God are God&rsquo;s species. We do not share in the divine Godhead, but we have God&rsquo;s life and nature. The heart&rsquo;s desire and good pleasure of God are to have a group of people who are exactly like Him, having His nature and His life to be His expression. This is why we need regeneration. We need to be regenerated not because we have sins but because God&rsquo;s desire is that we have His life and be exactly like Him.</p><h2 class="head4">b. That, in Addition to Our Natural Life,<br />We May Have the Divine, Eternal Life of God</h2><p>Furthermore, regeneration means that, in addition to our natural life, we have the divine, eternal life of God (John 3:16, 36a) as the basis and means of our spiritual life and living. Regeneration is not that we may improve our behavior, that we may have religious zeal and live a devout life, or that we may pay attention to ethics and morality. Rather, regeneration is for us to have God&rsquo;s eternal life in addition to our natural life; this is to have the uncreated life, which is God Himself, in addition to our original, created life. This divine, eternal life becomes the basis and means of our living. What God desires today is for all of our living to be based on this life and by this life.</p><h2 class="head3">2. We Not Only Receive the Divine Life<br />through Regeneration but Also Grow in<br />the Divine Life with Regeneration as the Base</h2><p>We not only receive the divine life through regeneration but also grow in the divine life with regeneration as the base.</p><h2 class="head4">a. By Being Nourished with the Supply<br />of the Milk of the Word of God<br />unto Our Daily, Gradual Salvation</h2><p>After being regenerated, we must be nourished with the supply of the milk of the word of God unto our daily, gradual salvation (1 Pet. 2:2). This gradual salvation is a daily salvation in which we are saved in the common situations of our daily living, both in big things and in small things. God&rsquo;s organic salvation has a long span&mdash;from regeneration to glorification. Our regeneration is the initiation. Then we need to grow by feeding on Christ as the nourishing milk in the word of God unto maturity for glorification, unto salvation in full.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Through Denying Our Natural Life<br />to Live by the Divine Life</h2><p>In order to experience this daily salvation, we need to live by the divine life through denying our natural life (Matt. 16:24). We have two lives within us: one is our natural life and the other is the divine life. We all must deny and reject the first life, our natural life, and live according to and by the second life, the divine life. We should live, walk, and conduct ourselves by another life&mdash;the divine life&mdash;as Paul said: &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). This is the proper living of a normal Christian.</p><h2 class="head2">B. As the Base for Us to Be Built Up<br />in the Divine Life</h2><p>Regeneration is not only the base for us to grow in the divine life but also the base for us to be built up in the divine life.</p><h2 class="head3">1. We Are Being Built Up in the Divine Life<br />by the Growth and Increase of the Divine Life in Us</h2><p>After our regeneration, we are being built up in the divine life by the growth and increase of the divine life in us (Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:15-16). Regeneration is for us not only to grow in the divine life but also to be built up as the universal Body of Christ. Colossians 2:19 says, &ldquo;...out from whom [the Head] all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God.&rdquo; We grow with the growth of God. The growth of God&rsquo;s life within us is the increase of God Himself, God&rsquo;s element, within us. As He increases in us, we grow. This growth is for us to be built up.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Being Constituted into the Body of Christ<br />as the Increase and Fullness of the Unlimited Christ</h2><p>In this divine building up, which is based on the growth of the divine life, the regenerated believers as Christ&rsquo;s brothers and members (Heb. 2:11; Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:27) are constituted into the Body of Christ as the increase and fullness of the unlimited Christ (John 3:30a; Eph. 1:23) for the achievement of the purpose of God&rsquo;s organic salvation.</p><p>Through regeneration we have become Christ&rsquo;s brothers and God&rsquo;s children, the members of Christ. As members of the Body and as Christ&rsquo;s brothers, we are being constituted and built up into the universal Body of Christ. With regeneration as the base, the divine life grows and increases in us. As a result, we will become the increase and the fullness of Christ and thereby attain the ultimate purpose of God&rsquo;s organic salvation&mdash;the New Jerusalem. This New Jerusalem as the constitution of God with man is indescribable.</p><h2 class="head1">II. GOD RENEWS US THAT WE MAY BECOME<br />HIS DIVINE, NEW CREATION</h2><p>Whereas regeneration is the base of God&rsquo;s organic salvation, renewing is the building up of God&rsquo;s organic salvation in order that we may become His divine, new creation.</p><h2 class="head2">A. That We May Be Built Up<br />in the Divine, New Creation</h2><p>Although we have been regenerated with the divine life and nature, we still need to be transformed by the renewing of the mind (Rom. 12:2). When our mind is renewed, our whole being is transformed. Then the Holy Spirit imparts something new, the divine essence of the new man, into our being. Thus, we pass from our old state into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation (Titus 3:5).</p><h2 class="head3">1. Through Regeneration We Have Been<br />Created in Christ into One New Man</h2><p>Through regeneration we have been created in Christ into one new man (Eph. 2:15; Col. 3:10) as God&rsquo;s new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15). Ephesians 2:15 tells us that Christ died on the cross that He might create us, the regenerated ones, both Jews and Gentiles, in Himself into one new man. Hence, in God&rsquo;s eyes we are the divine, new creation. Second Corinthians 5:17 says, &ldquo;So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.&rdquo; To be in Christ is to be one with Him in life and nature. We, the believers regenerated of God, are a new creation in Christ, having the divine life and nature.</p><h2 class="head3">2. This New Creation Is out of God&rsquo;s Old Creation,<br />of Which So Many Old Elements Should Be Renewed</h2><p>But this new creation is out of God&rsquo;s old creation, of which so many old elements should be renewed to become new. In order to build up the new creation, the old creation must be torn down. God&rsquo;s work in us daily is to tear down the old creation and build up the new creation. We should experience this throughout our entire Christian life.</p><h2 class="head3">3. We Need to Be Practically Renewed in Our Living</h2><p>In fact, the creation of the new man has been completed by Christ on the cross (Eph. 2:15); but in practicality, having been made the members of the new man, we should apply to ourselves what Christ has completed by being practically renewed in our living that we may be built up in the divine, new creation.</p><h2 class="head2">B. That We May Be Built Up<br />in God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation</h2><p>God renews us that we may be built up in God&rsquo;s organic salvation. This is to bring us into the practical experience, since God&rsquo;s organic salvation is altogether subjective and organic.</p><h2 class="head3">1. In God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation,<br />Renewing Is the Continuation<br />of the Washing of Regeneration</h2><p>In God&rsquo;s organic salvation, regeneration is a washing, and renewing is the continuation of the washing of regeneration (Titus 3:5). We need not only the judicial washing by the Lord&rsquo;s redeeming blood to cleanse us from every sin (Heb. 1:3; 1 John 1:7), but also the organic washing, the washing of regeneration, which begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>We receive an organic washing by daily experiencing God&rsquo;s organic salvation. The washing of regeneration washes away the old elements, the old nature, and the old things that are within us; the renewing of the Holy Spirit imparts new elements, a new essence, and new things into us. Both the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are working in us continually throughout our life until the completion of the new creation so that we may be built up in God&rsquo;s organic salvation.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Means of Renewing<br />in God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation</h2><p>Such a washing, such a renewing, in God&rsquo;s organic salvation is being carried out continually in us by means of the following matters.</p><h2 class="head4">a. By the Renewing Spirit Spreading into Our Mind</h2><p>The renewing in God&rsquo;s organic salvation is by the renewing Spirit (Titus 3:5) mingling with our regenerated spirit as one spirit to spread into our mind (Eph. 4:22-24) and infuse our inward parts with God&rsquo;s attributes, which are forever new and never become old, thereby renewing our entire being. Our God is newness itself. In the entire universe, God alone is new and everything else is old. This God, who is forever new and who never becomes old, infuses His ever-new essence into us to renew our entire being.</p><h2 class="head4">b. By Our Walking in Newness of the Divine Life</h2><p>The renewing in God&rsquo;s organic salvation is also by our walking in the newness of the divine life in the resurrection of Christ (Rom. 6:4).</p><p>In order to walk in newness of life, we need, on the one hand, to put off the old man, and on the other hand, to put on the new man. To put off the old man is to deny and renounce our old self and to apply the cross to the self. Furthermore, we need to put on the new man, that is, to apply what Christ has accomplished in creating the new man, by living and magnifying Christ through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This is what it means to walk in newness of life. All these matters are for the renewing Spirit to renew us by imparting the new essence and new element into us that we may be renewed day by day.</p><h2 class="head4">c. By Our Being Consumed<br />by the Environmental Sufferings</h2><p>The renewing in God&rsquo;s organic salvation is also by our being consumed by the environmental sufferings for the killing of our outer man and the renewing of our inner man day by day (2 Cor. 4:16).</p><p>God&rsquo;s renewing us is accomplished through the consuming by the outward environmental sufferings. Our sufferings are for us to be renewed. Although our outer man is decaying, our inner man is being renewed day by day. In order to renew us, God has arranged all kinds of environments to come to us for a positive purpose, that is, to dispense God&rsquo;s new essence and new element into us. We should have such a daily subjective experience of our outer man decaying and our inner man being renewed day by day.</p><h2 class="head3">3. That We May Ultimately Become as New<br />as the New Jerusalem</h2><p>Through such a renewing we are built up in God&rsquo;s organic salvation to ultimately become as new as the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2).</p><p>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate issue and goal of the sixty-six books of the Bible. Concerning the New Jerusalem, we have published dozens of messages and composed more than ten hymns. I hope that we would sing these hymns often. If in our singing of these hymns, we would follow each word and line with our spirit, we will receive a divine transfusion. Such a divine transfusion will issue in our becoming a part of the New Jerusalem. I repeat, do not consider that the New Jerusalem is something physical. The New Jerusalem is something divine, organic, and spiritual. It is the organic constitution of God and man, both having passed through a long process. It is the totality of the mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man, expressed in the universe for eternity.</p><p>I hope that this kind of message is not just for our listening and speaking. Rather, we should experience it subjectively day by day that we may really come out of the old creation and enter into the status of the new creation so that eventually we will become a group of people who are absolutely for God, a genuine new creation that is wholly of God and for God.</p><h1 class="series">THE EXPERIENCE OF<br />GOD&rsquo;S ORGANIC SALVATION EQUALING REIGNING IN CHRIST&rsquo;S LIFE</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO</h1><h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S ORGANIC SALVATION</h1><h1 class="msg">(2)</h1><h1 class="title">SANCTIFICATION AND TRANSFORMATION</h1><h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>God sanctifies us that we may have His holy nature&mdash; the establishing of God&rsquo;s organic salvation&mdash;Rom. 6:19, 22; 15:16; 2 Pet. 1:4:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>That we may be established in God&rsquo;s holy nature:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>We were created by God for Himself, but due to our fall and separation from God we were lost and became common in our position and disposition.

We continue to look to You that You will intensify Your work more than ever before. Gain every one of the attendants here. Amen.</p><p>In this message, the second message on God&rsquo;s organic salvation, we would like to see the matters of sanctification and transformation. The first four points of God&rsquo;s organic salvation are regeneration, renewing, sanctification, and transformation. Regeneration is for us to have God&rsquo;s divine life; renewing is for us to become His divine, new creation; sanctification is for us to have His holy nature; and transformation is for us to have His divine image. Hence, first, we have His divine life; second, we become the divine, new creation; third, we have the holy nature; and fourth, we have the divine  image.This is what God&rsquo;s organic salvation will accomplish in us.</p><p>God regenerates us that we may have His divine life; this is the base of God&rsquo;s organic salvation. God renews us that we may become His divine, new creation; this is the building up of God&rsquo;s organic salvation. God sanctifies us that we may have His holy nature; this is the establishing of God&rsquo;s organic salvation. God transforms us that we may have His divine image; this is the shaping of God&rsquo;s organic salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">I. GOD SANCTIFIES US<br />THAT WE MAY HAVE HIS HOLY NATURE</h2><p>God sanctifies us that we may have His holy nature; this is the establishing of God&rsquo;s organic salvation (Rom. 6:19, 22; 15:16; 2 Pet. 1:4).</p><h2 class="head2">A. That We May Be Established<br />in God&rsquo;s Holy Nature</h2><p>God sanctifies us that we may be established in God&rsquo;s holy nature. God&rsquo;s sanctifying us is a very important and particular item in God&rsquo;s organic salvation. Not only is God Himself holy, but He also wants to make us holy. Eventually, He wants to make us the holy city, New Jerusalem. In the universe God is holiness; whenever people touch God, they touch holiness (cf. Isa. 6:2-3; Rev. 4:8). Hence, in His organic salvation God&rsquo;s intention is to constitute us with His holy nature that we may become the Body of Christ and ultimately be manifested as an established, holy city, New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head3">1. In His Complete Salvation<br />God Sanctifies Us in Our Position Judicially<br />and in Our Disposition Organically</h2><p>We were created by God for Himself, but due to our fall and separation from God we were lost and became common in our position and disposition. Hence, in His complete salvation God sanctifies us in our position judicially and in our disposition organically.</p><p>The judicial, positional sanctification is accomplished through the redeeming blood of Christ (Heb. 13:12; 10:29; 1 Cor. 1:2; Rom. 1:7; cf. Matt. 23:17). The organic, dispositional sanctification is carried out by the Holy Spirit with the holy nature of God (Rom. 15:16; 6:19, 22; 2 Pet. 1:4).</p><h2 class="head3">2. This Causes Us to Be Established in God&rsquo;s<br />Holy Nature and Thereby Be Made Holy unto God</h2><p>God&rsquo;s sanctification is of two aspects: the judicial aspect and the organic aspect. This causes us to be established in God&rsquo;s holy nature and thereby be made holy unto God (Eph. 1:4). To thus be made holy unto God is to become the New Jerusalem, the holy city, which is absolutely sanctified unto God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. That We May Be Established<br />in God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation</h2><p>God not only regenerates and renews us but also sanctifies us that we may be established in His organic salvation.</p><h2 class="head3">1. With the Element of Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection Life</h2><p>The sanctification in God&rsquo;s organic salvation is carried out by the Holy Spirit with the element of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life to sanctify us in our disposition (Rom. 15:16) that our natural disposition, which is crooked, perverted, and full of peculiarities, may be sanctified by God&rsquo;s holy nature (2 Pet. 1:4).</p><h2 class="head3">2. For Our Entire Being to Be Wholly Sanctified</h2><p>Such a dispositional sanctification is from our spirit, through our soul, and unto our body, so that our entire being can be wholly sanctified (1 Thes. 5:23). This is not a partial sanctification. We human beings are of three parts: spirit, soul, and body. God sanctifies us, first, by taking possession of our spirit through regeneration; second, by spreading Himself as the life-giving Spirit from our spirit into our soul to saturate and transform our soul; and, last, by enlivening our mortal body through our soul and transfiguring our body by His life power, conforming it to the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory. Thus, our entire being, including our spirit, soul, and body, is wholly sanctified.</p><h2 class="head3">3. To Become as Holy<br />as the Holy City, New Jerusalem</h2><p>Such a sanctification causes us to be established in God&rsquo;s organic salvation so that we ultimately become as holy as the holy city, New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2, 10; 22:19).</p><h2 class="head1">II. GOD TRANSFORMS US<br />THAT WE MAY HAVE HIS DIVINE IMAGE</h2><p>God transforms us that we may have His divine image. To have His divine image is to be shaped in God&rsquo;s organic salvation (Rom. 12:2a; 2 Cor. 3:18). God&rsquo;s organic salvation is to produce something with a shape, something visible; hence, there is the shaping aspect in God&rsquo;s salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">A. That We May Be Shaped<br />in the Divine Image</h2><p>God&rsquo;s transformation is for us to be shaped in the divine image. We not only have received God&rsquo;s divine life at our regeneration, but we also are being renewed to become His divine, new creation. However, it is not enough to become the new creation; we still need to be sanctified that we may have His divine nature. Furthermore, we need to be transformed by God that we may be shaped in the divine image. Not only do we have God&rsquo;s nature inwardly, but we also bear His image outwardly, which is something concrete and visible.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Transformation Is a Metabolic Function</h2><p>Transformation is not an outward correction or adjustment but the metabolic function of the life of God in us, by the addition of the element of the divine life of Christ into our entire being, that we may express the image of Christ outwardly. To express the image of Christ is to express the New Jerusalem.</p><p>Transformation is a very crucial item in God&rsquo;s organic salvation. Paul used the word<i> transformed</i> in his Epistles at least twice. The first time was in Romans 12:2, which says that we should be transformed by the renewing of the mind. Another time was in 2 Corinthians 3:18, which says that we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image.</p><p>Unfortunately, most Christians do not pay attention to the word <i>transformed,</i> or we may say that they do not understand its true meaning even though they have read it. Neither can they tell the difference between transformation and what we commonly call change. Although what is manifested through transformation is seen in the outward, visible image, transformation is not an outward correction or adjustment but the metabolic function of God&rsquo;s life in us. A certain kind of life produces a certain kind of function. Suppose a person is undernourished and appears thin and sickly. He cannot improve his condition by merely applying some powder to his face. That is an outward correction and adjustment which has no genuine effect. His real need is to receive some nourishment into him. This nourishment activates the function of metabolism in him. As a result, after a period of time, when you see him again, you notice that his facial appearance has become healthy. But this was not by applying powder outwardly; it is the effect of the metabolism of the life in him.</p><p>This metabolic function, on the one hand, adds the element of the divine life of Christ into our entire being, and on the other hand, discharges the old and negative things from within us. Consequently, we have a change not only in our inward nature but also in our outward image so that we express the image of Christ. What is this image of Christ? Consummately this image of Christ is the New Jerusalem. Transformation results in our becoming the New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head3">2. God Transforms Us with the Life Element<br />of the Firstborn Son of God</h2><p>God transforms us with the life element of the firstborn Son of God, the first God-man, who passed through death and entered into resurrection, until we are transformed metabolically into His image from one degree of glory to a higher degree of glory and are raptured and transfigured to enter into His glory (2 Cor. 3:18; Phil. 3:21).</p><p>Since eternity past, God&rsquo;s intention has been to transform us. But if God had remained merely the God in eternity, He would have no way to transform us. In order to transform us, God had to be processed. The Triune God passed through some processes. He is no longer merely the God in His divinity in eternity past. But, according to His heart&rsquo;s desire and the counsel determined by the Divine Trinity in eternity, one day He sent the second of the Divine Trinity into humanity. He not only put on humanity to become a God-man but also passed through human living, death, and resurrection. Then in resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God. As such, He can transform us metabolically with His life element in resurrection.</p><p>This metabolic transformation is not something that can be carried out hurriedly. We are being transformed metabolically with the life element of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son and thereby will have His divine image. <i>Being transformed</i> indicates that we are in the process of transformation, which is a process in life, an organic process. Today in this process of metabolic transformation we are being transformed from one degree of glory to another, higher degree of glory until we are transfigured in our body and raptured into glory. That will be the consummation of our transformation.</p><h2 class="head3">3. For the Mass Reproduction<br />of the Firstborn Son of God as the Prototype</h2><p>This is for the mass reproduction of the firstborn Son of God as the prototype of a God-man, that we may be shaped in the divine image to be just like the firstborn Son of God, Christ as the God-man.</p><p>When we are shaped in the divine image, we become the New Jerusalem. Hence, the New Jerusalem is the mass reproduction of the firstborn Son of God. This is the highest purpose of God in His economy. On the one hand, He passed through the processes to become the firstborn Son of God with a view to become the prototype. On the other hand, He has brought us into the process of transformation that we may become the mass reproduction of Him as the prototype to consummately become the New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head2">B. That We May Be Shaped<br />in God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation</h2><p>God transforms us not only that we may be shaped in the divine image but also that we may be shaped in God&rsquo;s organic salvation.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Means of Transformation<br />in God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation</h2><h2 class="head4">a. By the Renewing of Our Mind</h2><p>In God&rsquo;s organic salvation transformation is by the renewing of our mind. Romans 12:2a says, &ldquo;Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; Transformation begins with the renewing of our mind. Our mind is the leading part of our soul, and as it is renewed, our will and emotion, the other parts of our soul, automatically follow to be renewed also. To be renewed means that a new element is wrought into our being. This produces an inward, metabolic transformation.</p><h2 class="head4">b. By the Lord Spirit in Us, Transforming Us<br />into the Image of the Glory of Christ</h2><p>In God&rsquo;s organic salvation transformation is also by the Lord Spirit (the pneumatic Christ) in us, transforming us into the image of the glory of Christ (2 Cor. 3:18b).</p><p>Here it does not say &ldquo;the Spirit of God&rdquo; but &ldquo;the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; We see the Spirit of God in God&rsquo;s creation (Gen. 1:2). However, He could not transform us if He were merely the Spirit of God. The Lord Spirit is the One who has been processed and consummated; He is the pneumatic Christ in resurrection. Hence, <i>the Lord Spirit</i> is a compound title; He is both the Lord and the Spirit. Today this Spirit is the processed Triune God, the One who was glorified in resurrection, the Lord Spirit. This Lord Spirit, the pneumatic Christ in resurrection, is no longer the Spirit of God merely with divinity. Rather, He has been processed and has become the all-inclusive One with all the elements of His process. Since the Lord Spirit possesses divinity, humanity, and all the elements of the processes through which He has passed, He can transform us into the glorious image of Christ. The elements which we need in the process of transformation come from the Lord Spirit. God was processed to become the Lord Spirit for our transformation.</p><h2 class="head4">c. By Our Having an Unveiled Face,<br />Beholding and Reflecting the Lord</h2><p>In practice we should have an unveiled face, beholding and reflecting the Lord like a mirror to express Him (2 Cor. 3:18a).</p><p>In order to have this kind of transformation, first we need to remove the veils of our old concepts. Often we have too many veils that prevent us from being transformed. However, whenever our heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. Then we, with an unveiled face, can behold the Lord and consequently reflect Him like a mirror. Thus, we are being transformed into the same image from one level of glory to another level of glory for His expression.</p><h2 class="head4">d. By Our Living and Walking by the Spirit<br />and Walking according to the Mingled Spirit</h2><p>In practice we should also live and walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25) and walk according to the mingled spirit (Rom. 8:4b) that the divine life of Christ may have the way to regulate us and transform us into the image of the Lord in glory.</p><p>In God&rsquo;s organic salvation the key to transformation is altogether in the mingled spirit&mdash;the Spirit with our spirit. The Triune God has been processed to become the Lord Spirit, and this Spirit in us is mingled with our regenerated spirit. Hence, we should practice walking according to the mingled spirit; then the divine life of Christ can regulate us to transform us into the same image of the Lord in glory.</p><h2 class="head3">2. That We May Be Conformed<br />to the Image of Christ, the Firstborn Son of God,<br />So That We Manifest God</h2><p>Such a transformation causes us to be shaped in God&rsquo;s organic salvation and conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God, so that we manifest God in life, in nature, in inward thinking, and in outward expression; this will consummate in the New Jerusalem, in which, due to our transformation, we will be exactly the same as God, who sits on the throne in the divine glory in eternity&mdash;both He and we will be like jasper (Rev. 4:3a; 21:11, 18a, 19b).</p><p>What the Bible presents at its conclusion is jasper. This jasper comes out of the union of the processed Triune God and the transformed believers through the transforming Spirit. God&rsquo;s purpose in creating the universe is to produce such jasper. Today all those who know God&rsquo;s economy care to have this jasper, and this is also what we care for. Paul paid the highest price in order to gain this treasure, this jasper; moreover, he even became a part of this jasper. What a mystery this is! This is the ultimate purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation, that is, to work on all those whom He chose in eternity to such an extent that they become wholly like Him in the divine glory to express the glorious image of God as jasper for His eternal enlargement and expression.</p><h1 class="series">THE EXPERIENCE OF<br />GOD&rsquo;S ORGANIC SALVATION EQUALING REIGNING IN CHRIST&rsquo;S LIFE</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE</h1><h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S ORGANIC SALVATION</h1><h1 class="msg">(3)</h1><h1 class="title">CONFORMATION AND GLORIFICATION</h1><h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>God conforms us that we may have His divine element&mdash;the solidifying of God&rsquo;s organic salvation&mdash;Rom. 8:29; 1 John 3:2:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God conforms us that we may be solidified in the possession of His divine element:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>God&rsquo;s intention is for us to have His divine element in His divine life, nature, and image as His expression, but not in His Godhead.</li>		<li>God regenerates us with His divine life that we may begin to participate in His divinity to have His divine element.</li>		<li>After being regenerated, we begin to grow by the divine renewing, sanctification, and transformation until we mature in the divine life to be a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Col. 1:28; Eph. 4:13), being conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29).</li>		<li>Hence, our conformation is our maturity in the divine life through which we participate in God&rsquo;s divinity in full and are solidified in the possession of His divine element.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>God conforms us that we may be solidified in the experience of His organic salvation:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In God&rsquo;s organic salvation, conformation is the consummation of our transformation in life (2 Cor. 3:18); it is also our preparation before the transfiguration and glorification of our body.</li>		<li>Conformation is to be conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>To be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death in all things through the power of His resurrection&mdash;Phil. 3:10.</li>			<li>To live Christ for magnifying Him through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:19-21a.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>Such a conformation makes us the reprints of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son that we may be exactly like Him and be exactly like God in His righteousness and holiness&mdash;1 John 3:2; Eph. 4:24.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>God glorifies us that we may have His divine image in full&mdash;the consummating of God&rsquo;s organic salvation&mdash;Rom. 8:30, 23; Eph. 4:30; Phil. 3:21; Col. 3:4b; 1 Pet. 5:10a; 2 Tim. 2:10; Heb. 2:10:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God glorifies us that we may arrive at the consummation of the possession of His divine image:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In regeneration God seals us with His Spirit (Eph. 1:13); this sealing Spirit, who is the Triune God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God&rsquo;s image, signified by the seal, thus making us like God.</li>		<li>This sealing of the sealing Spirit is like inking, saturating us from within with the glorious life element of God throughout our life, resulting in the redemption of our body (Eph. 4:30; Rom. 8:23) so that our entire being bears the divine image of God.</li>		<li>At the time of our rapture when we are matured in the divine life, we will be brought from without into the glory of God for our glorification&mdash;Rom. 8:30; Heb. 2:10.</li>		<li>Hence, we will be glorified from within through the lifelong saturation with the glory of God and from without through our being brought into God&rsquo;s glory.

In this message, the third message on God&rsquo;s organic salvation, we would go on to see the matters of conformation and glorification.</p><h2 class="head1">I. GOD CONFORMS US THAT WE<br />MAY HAVE HIS DIVINE ELEMENT</h2><p>God&rsquo;s regenerating us is the base of His organic salvation, His renewing us is the building up of His organic salvation, His sanctifying us is the establishing of His organic salvation, His transforming us is the shaping of His organic salvation, and His conforming us that we may have His divine element is the solidifying of His organic salvation (Rom. 8:29; 1 John 3:2).</p><p>In the past when we spoke about conformation, our stress was on the image. This time the Lord has shown us that God&rsquo;s conforming us is that we may have His divine element. Conformation is related not only to the divine image but also to the divine element. It is not enough merely to have an outward image. What God wants is for us to have His image outwardly and His element inwardly. A person&rsquo;s picture bears only the image of the person without his element. As those who have been regenerated by God with the divine life, we are not just photographs of God; rather, we are His reproduction. As such, we not only have His image outwardly, but we also have His life and nature with His divine element inwardly. Merely having the image without the element is vain. We must see that with the matter of conformation, the emphasis is not only on the divine image but also on the divine element.</p><h2 class="head2">A. God Conforms Us That We May Be Solidified<br />in the Possession of His Divine Element</h2><p>At our regeneration, God&rsquo;s divine life entered into us with His divine element. That was the beginning, but with only a small amount of the divine element; that is, we were short of being solidified in the possession of God&rsquo;s divine element. Following our regeneration, we have to go on further for the divine element to increase continually that we may be renewed, sanctified, and transformed so that the divine element may reach the extent of being solidified. This is conformation.</p><h2 class="head3">1. God&rsquo;s Intention Is for Us<br />to Have His Divine Element</h2><p>God&rsquo;s intention is for us to have His divine element in His divine life, nature, and image as His expression, but not in His Godhead. God&rsquo;s intention is for us not only to have His life and partake of His nature and image but also to have His divine element by having His life, nature, and image. When the first man, Adam, was created, he had the divine image (Gen. 1:26-27) but did not yet have the divine element. Therefore, God immediately brought this man who had the divine image to the tree of life (2:9). Man could receive God as his element by taking in God Himself, signified by the tree of life. Hence, we see that it is not enough merely to have the divine image outwardly. We still need to have God&rsquo;s divine element inwardly.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Through Regeneration We Begin to Participate<br />in His Divinity to Have His Divine Element</h2><p>God regenerates us with His divine life that we may begin to participate in His divinity to have His divine element. God regenerates us that we may have His divine life; this is the base of God&rsquo;s organic salvation. This is a beginning in which we begin to participate in God&rsquo;s divinity. After our regeneration, we still need to grow. Therefore, we need God&rsquo;s renewing, sanctification, and transformation until we mature in the divine life. Hence, the stage of conformation is necessary in God&rsquo;s organic salvation. Not only do we have regeneration, renewing, sanctification, and transformation, but we also have conformation. Without conformation, the divine life may have entered into us, but it has not reached the extent of being solidified and matured. Therefore, after regeneration, we must pursue the growth in life. Renewing, sanctification, and transformation are our growth in life.</p><h2 class="head3">3. We Grow by the Divine Renewing,<br />Sanctification, and Transformation Until We Mature,<br />Being Conformed to the Image of God&rsquo;s Firstborn Son</h2><p>After being regenerated, we begin to grow by the divine renewing, sanctification, and transformation until we mature in the divine life to be a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Col. 1:28; Eph. 4:13), being conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29).</p><p>The fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ. Christ&rsquo;s Body is not something empty or formless; rather, it is an organism with a measure of the stature of its fullness in its breadth, length, height, and depth. Thank the Lord that God has regenerated us that we may begin to have His divine element. Following this, we still need to be built up, established, and shaped in God&rsquo;s organic salvation. However, after we have been shaped through transformation, it is still not enough. We need to continue to grow until we are matured in the divine life to become a full-grown man. Then we can arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and be conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Through Conformation We Participate<br />in God&rsquo;s Divinity in Full</h2><p>Hence, our conformation is our maturity in the divine life through which we participate in God&rsquo;s divinity in full and are solidified in the possession of His divine element. Many Christians are satisfied superficially with merely being saved to go to heaven instead of going to hell. But today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we have seen that after regeneration, in which we have God&rsquo;s divine life and begin to have God&rsquo;s divine element, we still need to experience the growth in life unto a full-grown man.</p><h2 class="head2">B. God Conforms Us That We May Be Solidified<br />in the Experience of His Organic Salvation</h2><p>God conforms us not only that we may be solidified in the possession of His divine element but also that we may be solidified in the experience of His organic salvation. God&rsquo;s organic salvation is complete, but in our experience of His organic salvation we need to be solidified. We need conformation to help us in being solidified in the experience of such a salvation.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Conformation Is the Consummation<br />of Our Transformation in Life</h2><p>In God&rsquo;s organic salvation, conformation is the consummation of our transformation in life (2 Cor. 3:18); it is also our preparation before the transfiguration and glorification of our body. God&rsquo;s organic salvation begins with regeneration and passes through renewing, sanctification, transformation, and conformation; eventually He will glorify us that we may consummate in the New Jerusalem. In order to be glorified, we must first be conformed, that is, be matured in life. This becomes the preparation work before our glorification. God&rsquo;s desire is to glorify His people, but He cannot glorify a group of children; He can only glorify a group of grown-up people. Hence, conformation is to prepare us that God may carry out the work of glorification in us.</p><h2 class="head3">2. To Be Conformed to the Image<br />of God&rsquo;s Firstborn Son</h2><p>Romans 8:29 says, &ldquo;Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.&rdquo; We have been regenerated to become the sons of God, but we still need to be conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. God&rsquo;s only begotten Son had divinity but not humanity; Christ as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son has both divinity and humanity. We are to be conformed to God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, Christ as the first God-man, that we may be a group of God-men who are exactly like Him.</p><p>When God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, Christ as the first God-man, lived on earth, He lived in the shadow of the cross. His life was a crucified life. Such a crucified life became a mold. To experience being conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Firstborn, we must be conformed to His death daily. In Philippians 3:10 Paul said, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&rdquo; On the one hand, we are being conformed to His death in all things through the power of His resurrection, and on the other hand, we live Christ for magnifying Him through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19-21a).</p><h2 class="head3">3. To Make Us Reprints of God&rsquo;s Firstborn Son</h2><p>Such a conformation makes us the reprints of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son that we may be exactly like Him and be exactly like God in His righteousness and holiness (1 John 3:2; Eph. 4:24). We are reprints of God not only in His image but also in His righteousness and holiness. God&rsquo;s righteousness is His righteous procedure, and His holiness is His holy nature. We are not only like God in His outward image, but we are exactly like Him in His righteousness and holiness.</p><p>This is the work of conformation which God is doing in us to carry out His organic salvation to the uttermost. This is God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire and good pleasure in us; this is also the ultimate goal which God has concerning His chosen people, that is, to make us jasper stone and, consummately, the New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head1">II. GOD GLORIFIES US THAT WE<br />MAY HAVE HIS DIVINE IMAGE IN FULL</h2><p>God glorifies us that we may have His divine image in full; this is the consummating of God&rsquo;s organic salvation (Rom. 8:30, 23; Eph. 4:30; Phil. 3:21; Col. 3:4b; 1 Pet. 5:10a; 2 Tim. 2:10; Heb. 2:10).</p><p>Glorification, the final step in God&rsquo;s organic salvation, brings the conformed believers into the glory of God. Many Christians today have a wrong concept that our glorification will take place in the twinkling of an eye at the coming back of the Lord Jesus. Such a concept is altogether inaccurate. Glorification is accomplished through a gradual process, beginning with regeneration, continuing through renewing, sanctification, transformation, and conformation, and finally arriving at glorification by which we have His divine image in full.</p><h2 class="head2">A. God Glorifies Us That<br />We May Arrive at the Consummation<br />of the Possession of His Divine Image</h2><p>God&rsquo;s organic salvation has not only the base, the building up, the establishing, the shaping, and the solidifying, but also the consummating. God glorifies us that we may arrive at the consummation of the possession of His divine image.</p><h2 class="head3">1. In Regeneration God Seals Us with His Spirit</h2><p>In regeneration God seals us with His Spirit (Eph. 1:13); this sealing Spirit, who is the Triune God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God&rsquo;s image, signified by the seal, thus making us like God.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Sealing Spirit Saturates Us from Within with the Glorious Life Element of God</h2><p>This sealing of the sealing Spirit is like inking, saturating us from within with the glorious life element of God throughout our life, resulting in the redemption of our body (Eph. 4:30; Rom. 8:23) so that our entire being bears the divine image of God.</p><p>On the one hand, God&rsquo;s glorifying us is the glory of God saturating us from within. At our regeneration we received the sealing of the Spirit. This sealing Spirit within us saturates us daily, continually, unceasingly, and constantly. Eventually, the result will be the redemption of our body in our glorification.</p><h2 class="head3">3. At the Time of Our Rapture in Maturity,<br />We Will Be Brought from Without<br />into the Glory of God</h2><p>On the other hand, God&rsquo;s glorifying us has an outward aspect; that is, at the time of our rapture when we are matured in the divine life, we will be brought into God&rsquo;s glory outwardly for our glorification (Rom. 8:30; Heb. 2:10).</p><h2 class="head3">4. By Such Glorification<br />We Will Arrive at the Consummation<br />of the Possession of God&rsquo;s Divine Image</h2><p>Hence, we will be glorified from within through the lifelong saturation with the glory of God and from without through our being brought into God&rsquo;s glory. Whereas the inner saturation is a lifelong process, our being brought into God&rsquo;s glory outwardly will be instantaneous. By such a glorification we will arrive at the consummation of the possession of God&rsquo;s divine image.</p><h2 class="head2">B. God Glorifies Us That<br />We May Arrive at the Consummation<br />of the Experience of His Organic Salvation</h2><p>God glorifies us that we may arrive at the consummation of the possession of His divine image. Furthermore, He glorifies us that we may not only be built up, established, shaped, and solidified in the experience of God&rsquo;s organic salvation, but also arrive at the consummation of such experience.</p><h2 class="head3">1. God&rsquo;s Glorifying Work in Us<br />Begins with Regeneration</h2><p>In God&rsquo;s organic salvation His glorifying work in us begins with His regenerating us with His life of glory.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Then, through His Work of Renewing, Sanctification, Transformation, and Conformation,<br />His Glorifying Work in Us Reaches Its Consummation</h2><p>After regenerating us, God continues, step by step, with His work of renewing, sanctification, transformation, and conformation to transfuse us with Himself as glory until the glory of His life saturates our being and is manifested in our body; thus His work of glorification in us reaches its consummation.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Our Glorification Is the Top Portion<br />of Our Divine Sonship</h2><p>Our glorification is the top portion of our divine sonship in God&rsquo;s organic salvation (Gal. 4:5; Rom. 8:23). God&rsquo;s economy is that we may become sons of God to inherit all His riches. The day is coming when our body will be redeemed and we will enter into the top and full enjoyment of the divine sonship.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Consummation of God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation<br />Is the New Jerusalem&mdash;<br />the Universal Incorporation of the Union and Mingling of Divinity with Humanity</h2><p>The consummation of God&rsquo;s organic salvation is the New Jerusalem&mdash;the universal incorporation of the union and mingling of divinity with humanity&mdash;the processed and consummated Triune God incorporated with His regenerated, renewed, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite elect.</p><p>Dear brothers and sisters, our future is the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. We are not here miserably longing for His return so that our afflictions may be over quickly and we may be released from the bondage of slavery. Rather, we are awaiting the Lord&rsquo;s coming back by daily experiencing His organic salvation. We are waiting not by sitting passively but by being saved actively day by day. We cannot remain in the stage of regeneration; rather, we must cooperate with the Lord for Him to renew, sanctify, transform, conform, and glorify us so that God&rsquo;s organic salvation may be accomplished in us for the fulfillment of His eternal economy.</p><h1 class="series">THE EXPERIENCE OF<br />GOD&rsquo;S ORGANIC SALVATION EQUALING REIGNING IN CHRIST&rsquo;S LIFE</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">REIGNING IN LIFE</h1><h1 class="msg">(1)</h1><h1 class="title">IN DYING WITH ADAM AND LIVING WITH CHRIST,<br />IN BEING OVERCOMING IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES,<br />AND IN LIVING A GRAFTED LIFE WITH CHRIST</h1><h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>In dying with Adam:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Our natural life needing to be terminated with Adam in our co-death with Christ&mdash;Rom. 6:3, 4a, 5a, 6-8a; Gal. 2:20a; Eph. 4:22.</li>	<li>Our natural life needing to be annihilated with Adam in our co-death with Christ.</li>	</ol></li><li>In living with Christ&mdash;Rom. 6:4b, 5b, 8b; Gal. 2:20b:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Our natural life needing to be raised with Christ in His resurrection.</li>	<li>Our natural life needing to be renewed with Christ in His resurrection&mdash;Eph. 4:23-24; 2 Cor. 4:16; 5:17.</li>	</ol></li><li>In being overcoming in all circumstances&mdash;Rom. 8:31-39; cf. 1 Cor. 15:54-57:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Needing to be more than conquering in our overcoming with Christ in all circumstances:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The love of God (Rom. 8:39) is the source of His salvation.

With this message we begin to cover the matter of reigning in Christ&rsquo;s life.</p><p>The first four chapters of Romans show us the aspect of judicial redemption in God&rsquo;s complete salvation; the remaining twelve chapters show us the aspect of organic salvation in God&rsquo;s complete salvation. We were redeemed, justified, and reconciled to God through the death of Christ. This is on the judicial side. However, Romans shows us that God&rsquo;s salvation has not only the judicial aspect but also the organic aspect. The organic salvation is referred to in 5:10, which says, &ldquo;...much more we will be saved in His life.&rdquo; Today we are passing through the processes of God&rsquo;s organic salvation that we may be saved in His life. On the one hand, we have been saved; on the other hand, we are still being saved.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF GOD&rsquo;S ORGANIC SALVATION<br />EQUALING REIGNING IN CHRIST&rsquo;S LIFE</h2><p>However, there is a further revelation concerning our being saved in life. It is for us not only to be saved in God&rsquo;s organic salvation but also to reign in Christ&rsquo;s life. How much we are saved in God&rsquo;s organic salvation determines how much our reigning in life is manifested. Our reigning in life is proof of our experience of God&rsquo;s organic salvation. It means nothing for someone to claim that he is healthy. He needs to take a blood test, and if his red blood cells, white blood cells, cholesterol, etc., test normal, then this is proof that he is truly healthy. To know whether we are truly experiencing God&rsquo;s organic salvation, we must see if we are reigning in Christ&rsquo;s life.</p><p>Romans 5:17 says, &ldquo;For if by the offense of the one death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Here, the abundance of the gift of righteousness refers to judicial redemption, and the abundance of grace is the processed Triune God. This grace will accomplish God&rsquo;s organic salvation in us.</p><p>The life which we received not only saves us from certain things but also enables us to reign over all things. Such reigning far surpasses our being saved in life. We have received righteousness objectively, but we still need to receive continually the abundance of grace (the processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit) that we may reign in life subjectively. Romans 6&mdash;16 unveils the meaning of reigning in life. Our dying with Adam and living with Christ, our being overcoming in all circumstances, and our living a grafted life with Christ&mdash;all these matters show us the meaning of reigning. However, none of them is by our own striving but by our receiving the abundance of grace.</p><p>How do we know that we are reigning in life? If we have the living and experience portrayed in the revelations in Romans 6&mdash;16, this is evidence that we are definitely reigning in life. We will use three messages to look at the items covered in those chapters.</p><p>First, in this message we will see the following matters: in dying with Adam and living with Christ, in being overcoming in all circumstances, and in living a grafted life with Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">I. IN DYING WITH ADAM</h2><p>We reign in life first in dying with Adam. Dying with Adam is not a doctrine; rather, it is a matter of our being in an organic union with Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Our Natural Life Needing to Be Terminated<br />with Adam in Our Co-death with Christ</h2><p>Our natural life needs to be terminated with Adam in our co-death with Christ (Rom. 6:3, 4a, 5a, 6-8a; Gal. 2:20a; Eph. 4:22). We were created by God in His image and after His likeness. However, due to Adam&rsquo;s fall, our life became the natural life of the old creation in Adam.</p><p>There are two main elements in our natural life of the old creation. The first element is sin and the second is death. Romans 5&mdash;7 shows us that in Adam there are only sin and death. Through one man, Adam, sin entered into the world, and through sin, death (5:12). Thus, sin reigned in us through death (v. 21a; 6:12), and death reigned over us through the offense of the one, Adam (5:17a, 14). Therefore, in Adam we did not reign in life; rather, we were under the ruling of sin and death. However, as the last Adam, Christ died an all-inclusive death on the cross, and through such a death He brought everything of the adamic life to the cross and had a great ending there (6:6).</p><p>How can we be delivered out of the reigning of sin and death? It is not by our struggling and striving; rather, it is through the all-inclusive death of Christ that we allow the life of Christ to reign in us instead of sin and death. Thus, it is no longer sin and death that reign in us; rather, it is grace and life that reign in us (5:21).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Our Natural Life Needing to Be Annihilated<br />with Adam in Our Co-death with Christ</h2><p>Our natural life needs to be annihilated, completely destroyed, put out of existence, with Adam in our co-death with Christ. In our baptism we have been buried with Christ into His death, and thereby the natural life of our old man in Adam has been annihilated (6:3-4a).</p><h2 class="head1">II. IN LIVING WITH CHRIST</h2><p>We reign in life not only in our dying with Adam but also in our living with Christ (Rom. 6:4b, 5b, 8b; Gal. 2:20b). Romans 6:8 says, &ldquo;Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him.&rdquo; This shows our organic union with Christ in His death and resurrection. Such an organic union is best illustrated in grafting. Two separate branches are made one by grafting. We were grafted with Christ and have grown together with Him in His death and resurrection.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Our Natural Life Needing to Be Raised<br />with Christ in His Resurrection</h2><p>Our natural life needs to be raised with Christ in His resurrection. Although our natural life was defiled by sin and death through the fall, we have received the resurrection life of Christ into us through our death and resurrection with Him. This resurrection life of Christ is the life-giving Spirit, who enlivens us from within that we may be raised with Christ. In resurrection our God-created faculties are restored; moreover, they are enriched with, uplifted by, and saturated with Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life for us to experience and enjoy all that Christ is.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Our Natural Life Needing to Be Renewed<br /> with Christ in His Resurrection</h2><p>Our natural life needs to be renewed with Christ in His resurrection (Eph. 4:23-24; 2 Cor. 4:16; 5:17). Our natural life belongs to the realm of the old creation, the old man. In baptism we put off our old man; moreover, our old man was crucified with Christ. In our practical experience, however, we need to allow the Spirit, who indwells our regenerated spirit, to spread to our mind so that in such a mingled spirit we may be nourished and renewed by the fresh supply of the resurrection life of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">III. IN BEING OVERCOMING IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES</h2><p>When we reign in life, we can overcome in all circumstances (Rom. 8:31-39; cf. 1 Cor. 15:54-57).</p><h2 class="head2">A. Needing to Be More Than Conquering in Our Overcoming with Christ in All Circumstances</h2><p>We need to be more than conquering in our overcoming with Christ in all circumstances. We do not overcome in ourselves; rather, we are more than conquerors in Christ&rsquo;s victory.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Love of God<br />Being the Source of His Salvation</h2><p>The love of God (Rom. 8:39) is the source of His salvation. In His salvation this love to us has become the love of Christ (v. 35), which will accomplish God&rsquo;s complete salvation in us through the grace of Christ. This love of God is in Christ and has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit (5:5). Nothing can separate us from this love of God (8:38-39). In God&rsquo;s salvation this love has become the love of Christ, which does many marvelous things for us through the grace of Christ until God&rsquo;s complete salvation is accomplished in us. Ephesians 2:8 says that we are saved by grace. According to our natural understanding, we think that grace is freely given to us by God without any price. Actually, it is not so shallow. What is the grace of Christ? The grace of Christ is Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit through death and resurrection; it is also the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God who has passed through the various processes.</p><h2 class="head3">2. More Than Conquering in All the Sufferings and Calamities as the Attacks from God&rsquo;s Enemy</h2><p>The marvelous things which God does for us due to His love provoke God&rsquo;s enemy to attack us with all kinds of sufferings and calamities (Rom. 8:35-36). However, because of our response to the love of God in Christ, these attacks have become benefits to us (v. 28). Hence, we more than conquer in all our calamities (v. 37).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Needing to Be All-transcending in Our Overcoming with Christ in All Circumstances</h2><p>When we reign in life, we are all-transcending in Christ&rsquo;s victory in all circumstances. How can we be transcendent? According to the book of Ephesians, we are joined with Christ in His resurrection and ascension (2:5-6) so that we have transcended to the heavenlies. This is to be transcendent over all things. Ephesians 1 tells us that since we have resurrected and ascended with Christ, we are transcendent with Him not only above all that is under the earth but also above all that is on the earth, in the air, in the heavens, and even in the heaven that is above the heavens. We are also far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come (vv. 20-21).</p><p>It is when we arrive at such a transcendent position that we have truly received grace and are genuinely saved. I hope that all the believers can hear this word. Do not live a befuddled life day by day, imagining that you have been saved and are just waiting to go to heaven. This is a pagan thought. Today we are living an all-transcending life with Christ in His victory.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection Being His Victory</h2><p>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was His victory, which will accomplish the ultimate and complete victory in resurrection for us who believe in Him and participate in His resurrection (1 Cor. 15:54). Through resurrection Christ was victorious over Satan, God&rsquo;s enemy, over the world, over sin, and over death. We who believe in Christ will enjoy the consummation of resurrection through the redemption and salvation in Christ. This resurrection begins with the enlivening of our dead spirit and is completed with the transfiguration of our corruptible body. Between these two ends is the process in which our fallen soul is metabolically transformed by Christ Jesus as the life-giving Spirit, who is the reality of resurrection.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Christ&rsquo;s Victory Needing to Become<br />Our Daily Experience in Life</h2><p>Christ&rsquo;s victory should not only be an accomplished fact for us to receive; it should also become our daily experience in life through the union of the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) with our spirit as one spirit (6:17) that we may be all-transcending in our overcoming with Christ. Hence, we should live by and walk according to this mingled spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. IN LIVING A GRAFTED LIFE WITH CHRIST</h2><p>We reign in life not only in dying with Adam, living with Christ, and being overcoming in all circumstances but also in living a grafted life with Christ (Rom. 11:17-24).</p><h2 class="head2">A. To Live the Life of the New Creation<br />in Our Being Grafted with Christ</h2><p>We reign in life to live the life of the new creation in our being grafted with Christ. This means that we become a new creation in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17), walking by the Spirit according to the rule of being a new creation (Gal. 6:15-16; 5:25) that we may put on the new man (Eph. 2:15; 4:23-24) and experience the renewing of the new man (Col. 3:10).</p><h2 class="head2">B. To Reign in Eternity<br />in Our Being Grafted with Christ</h2><p>We reign in life not only to live the life of the new creation but also to reign in eternity in our being grafted with Christ (2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 20:4, 6; 22:5).</p><p>This word concerning our being grafted with Christ may be simple, yet what is involved includes the heaven, the earth, and many other things. Here it says that we have been grafted into Christ, yet this Christ is the God who dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16). Since we cannot touch Him, how can we be grafted into Him? This is why Christ needed to pass through various processes. The first process that He went through was His becoming flesh (John 1:14) to be the seed of David (Matt. 1:1), the branch of David (Zech. 3:8; Jer. 23:5; 33:15), that we might be grafted together with Him. As human beings we are branches, pieces of wood; in like manner, Christ came as the branch of David, as a piece of wood. He is exactly the same as we are; hence, He and we can be grafted together.</p><p>The process by which Christ became a piece of wood was not simple. And His becoming a piece of wood did not by itself mean that He could be grafted with us. A grafter knows that in order to have a successful grafting, both of the grafting parts need to be cut and die. First, the part to be grafted has to die, and second, the part to be grafted into has to die also. Only when both sides die can the grafting be accomplished. On Christ&rsquo;s side, one day, as the branch of David, He died on the cross; however, although He died in the flesh, He was resurrected in the Spirit (1 Pet. 3:18b). Through death and resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). By becoming such a Spirit, Christ was ready for the grafting. On our side, as sinners, we need to repent and receive the Lord. Once we repent and receive Him, He as the life-giving Spirit enters into our spirit and puts the divine life in us. This life is a life of death and resurrection. Hence, He brings the key to death and resurrection into us who have believed in Him and have died and resurrected with Him. Thus, in this death and resurrection we are grafted together with Christ.</p><p>After we have been grafted together with Christ, we should no longer live by ourselves; rather, we should allow the pneumatic Christ to live in us. Furthermore, we should no longer live by our flesh or our natural being; rather, we should live by our mingled spirit, a spirit grafted with Christ. Thus, first, we are united with Him; this is a union. Then we are mingled with Him; this is a mingling. Eventually, we are incorporated with Him into an incorporation. This incorporation is the New Jerusalem, the great universal incorporation of the mingling of God and man for us to reign in eternity.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, I hope that you not only get these words into you but also repeat them like tape recorders. I often pray for you at my home. I have been a slave of the Lord speaking for Him for over sixty years. I am like a tape recorder speaking for the Lord again and again. I truly hope that when I speak, others will be tape recorders. This is my prayer. The Lord answered my prayer, saying, &ldquo;With men it is impossible, but with Me everything is possible. With all these believers who are under your leading, I can make every one of them such a tape recorder.&rdquo; I hope that all the brothers and sisters can enter into such a word, be constituted with such a word, and clearly speak such a word.</p><h1 class="series">THE EXPERIENCE OF<br />GOD&rsquo;S ORGANIC SALVATION EQUALING<br />REIGNING IN CHRIST&rsquo;S LIFE</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">REIGNING IN LIFE</h1><h1 class="msg">(2)</h1><h1 class="title">IN ESTABLISHING NOT OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS BUT GOD&rsquo;S RIGHTEOUSNESS AND TAKING CHRIST AS<br />GOD&rsquo;S RIGHTEOUSNESS; IN PRESENTING OUR BODIES<br />TO LIVE THE BODY LIFE AND RECEIVING<br />THE BELIEVERS TO LIVE THE CHURCH LIFE</h1><h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>In establishing not our own righteousness but God&rsquo;s righteousness&mdash;Rom. 9:14&mdash;10:4:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Being exceptionally strengthened in establishing not our own righteousness but God&rsquo;s righteousness in our reigning with Christ.</li>	<li>Being exceptionally radiant in establishing not our own righteousness but God&rsquo;s righteousness in our reigning with Christ.</li>	</ol></li><li>In taking Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness&mdash;Rom. 10:4; Phil. 3:9; 1 Cor. 1:30:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Being exceptionally extolling in taking Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness.</li>	<li>Being exceptionally successful in taking Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness.		<ol class="decimal">		Notes:<br />		<li>God&rsquo;s righteousness is the way of His acts (Psa. 103:6-7); it is revealed in the gospel of God as its foundation, solid and steadfast as the foundation of God&rsquo;s throne&mdash;Rom. 1:17; Psa. 89:14.</li>		<li>The lawkeepers attempt to keep the law for the building up of their own righteousness (Rom. 9:31).

In these four main points we will refer to eight &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; matters: being exceptionally strengthened, being exceptionally radiant, being exceptionally extolling, being exceptionally successful, being exceptionally practical, being exceptionally abounding, being exceptionally general, and being exceptionally smooth and orderly. These eight &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; items comprise everything which we have covered in the preceding messages.</p><p><i>Hymns,</i> #248 (Chinese) adequately represents the eight &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; points covered in this message. This hymn concerning grace contains expressions that cannot be found in ordinary Christian books. What is grace? Grace is actually God Himself. Then what is God? God is the New Jerusalem. However, whether it is grace or God or the New Jerusalem, actually they are just one. The following is a literal translation of this hymn:</p><ol class="decimal"><li>Grace arises, replacing sin,<br />To reign in my spirit,<br />Saving me from the power of sin<br />And my corrupted nature.<p class="hbody">Grace is sufficient for me!<br />I&rsquo;ll never feel powerless!<br />Christ lives in my spirit<br />For me to receive grace upon grace.<br /><br /></li><li>Grace enables my feet<br />To tread the heavenly pathway;<br />His grace&mdash;timely and rich&mdash;<br />Has never failed me.<br /><br /></li><li>What can be greater than grace!<br />He is God coming to men,<br />He is God manifested in the flesh,<br />He is God in me.<p class="hbody">I am what I am,<br />It is by the grace of God!<br />God&rsquo;s grace is manifested in me<br />To be the eternal portion to me,<br />a God-man.</li></ol><p>Since we are speaking concerning God&rsquo;s righteousness, why do we refer to a hymn on God&rsquo;s grace? My intention, my burden, is to show you that the entire Bible speaks of only one thing&mdash;grace, which is God, who is the New Jerusalem. Grace is the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Regardless of what subject the Bible touches, it is concerned with the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;being manifested as grace consummating in the New Jerusalem. This is the highest and central revelation shown to us in the entire New Testament. Hence, we cannot touch the righteousness of God without touching grace. God&rsquo;s righteousness and God&rsquo;s grace are not two different things. Romans 5:17 refers to both the abundance of grace and the abundance of righteousness. Righteousness always accompanies grace and is its result.</p><h2 class="head1">I. IN ESTABLISHING NOT OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS<br />BUT GOD&rsquo;S RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>We reign in life in establishing not our own righteousness but God&rsquo;s righteousness (Rom. 9:14&mdash;10:4). The Israelites, being ignorant of God&rsquo;s righteousness, seek to establish their own righteousness by trying to keep the law, and have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God, which is Christ Himself. This is an insult to God, and it causes them to miss the way of God&rsquo;s salvation. We have believed in Christ and have therefore received God&rsquo;s righteousness. This is to establish God&rsquo;s righteousness, which is Christ Himself.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Being Exceptionally Strengthened<br />in Establishing Not Our Own Righteousness<br />but God&rsquo;s Righteousness in Our Reigning with Christ</h2><p>We are exceptionally strengthened in establishing not our own righteousness but God&rsquo;s righteousness in our reigning with Christ. To strengthen is to emphasize; this is with regard to the contents. In our work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery what we strongly emphasize is that &ldquo;grace is the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.&rdquo; This is representative of our speaking in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I hope that you all can be like &ldquo;tape recorders&rdquo; and have this word deeply impressed in you. Then when you go out to contact others, you can spontaneously speak, and only speak, this word. May such &ldquo;tape recorders&rdquo; increase more and more until no other speaking can be heard on the whole earth except this: &ldquo;Grace is the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being Exceptionally Radiant<br />in Establishing Not Our Own Righteousness<br />but God&rsquo;s Righteousness in Our Reigning with Christ</h2><p>We are exceptionally radiant in establishing not our own righteousness but God&rsquo;s righteousness in our reigning with Christ. To be radiant refers to the outward expression; it is regarding the result. In our work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we do not boast in anything except grace as the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. We consider this as our radiance, our boast. To be strengthened is something inward; to be radiant is something outward. Today the Lord has given these truths to us that we may strengthen them in their contents inwardly and radiate them in their reality outwardly.</p><p>Some may ask, &ldquo;Does this mean that among us we should not teach anything else?&rdquo; It is not a matter of whether or not to teach other things. Actually, it is that we do not have any spare time to teach anything other than the central revelation of the Bible. In the past we received Brother Nee&rsquo;s leading to meet according to 1 Corinthians 14&mdash;not to have one man speaking and all the rest listening, but to have everyone prophesying. From 1933 Brother Nee began to strongly promote this practice, but it was unsuccessful. It was not until the recent years when we restudied 1 Corinthians 14 that we discovered that the Lord&rsquo;s intention is not merely to have all the members taking turns to speak but to have all the members blended together as one Body to speak. In the past we did not dare to speak in the meetings, because we did not know what to speak. But now the whole situation has been changed; everyone is glad to prophesy and everyone speaks concerning the unique central revelation of the Bible. This is what we particularly emphasize and boast of.</p><h2 class="head1">II. IN TAKING CHRIST AS GOD&rsquo;S RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>We reign in life in establishing not our own righteousness but God&rsquo;s righteousness and also in taking Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness (Rom. 10:4; Phil. 3:9; 1 Cor. 1:30).</p><h2 class="head2">A. Being Exceptionally Extolling<br />in Taking Christ as God&rsquo;s Righteousness</h2><p>We are exceptionally extolling in taking Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness. How do we take Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness? The key is in living a grafted life with Christ. Such a grafted life includes dying with Christ, being raised with Christ, and being overcoming and transcending with Christ in our mingled spirit. This is the way for us to take Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness.</p><p>When we live the grafted life, not living by our natural life, but living by the Triune God, the result is that Christ becomes our subjective righteousness. When we enjoy the Triune God, Christ is constituted into us as God&rsquo;s righteousness subjectively. Hence, the objective righteousness is for grace to come to us that we may receive Christ as our subjective righteousness. Therefore, God&rsquo;s righteousness is the subjective Christ, the Christ whom we enjoy and experience and who is constituted into us.</p><p>This is something which we should particularly extol and designate. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we particularly extol and designate the truth concerning taking Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness, that is, living a grafted life with Christ. We do not establish our own righteousness but the righteousness of God, the subjective Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being Exceptionally Successful<br />in Taking Christ as God&rsquo;s Righteousness</h2><p>We are exceptionally successful in taking Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness. What does it mean to be successful? It means to have an accomplishment. In all our service and work, our particular accomplishment should be to take Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness, that is, to have the subjective Christ in us.</p><p>God&rsquo;s righteousness is the way of His acts (Psa. 103:6-7); it is revealed in the gospel of God as its foundation, solid and steadfast as the foundation of God&rsquo;s throne (Rom. 1:17; Psa. 89:14). The lawkeepers attempt to keep the law for the building up of their own righteousness (Rom. 9:31). But &ldquo;out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him [God]&rdquo; (3:20). Christ is the end of the law by fulfilling all the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory, and is made the righteousness from God to the believers (Rom. 10:4; 1 Cor. 1:30; Phil. 3:9).</p><p>Christ&rsquo;s becoming righteousness from God to the believers is of two aspects: the objective aspect and the subjective aspect. In the objective aspect, God has given Christ to us as our righteousness for us to put on as our outward covering that we may be justified before God outwardly and objectively. In the subjective aspect, God has given Christ to us as our righteousness that Christ may enter into us to be our life and life supply and live God out from us that we may be justified before God inwardly and subjectively. The parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15 implies these two aspects. On the one hand, he was clothed with the best robe, and on the other hand, he ate the fattened calf. Being clothed with the best robe is the objective, outward covering; eating the fattened calf is the subjective, inward life supply. God&rsquo;s salvation not only has an objective aspect in which we are justified by God positionally; this is our solid foundation. Based upon the objective justification, God&rsquo;s salvation also has a subjective aspect in which we enjoy Christ as grace. The objective justification is not the purpose but the procedure to fulfill God&rsquo;s judicial requirement so that the Triune God may become grace to us.</p><p>The objective righteousness is positional and judicial; it was fulfilled by Christ Himself and received by the believers once for all at the time of their salvation through justification by faith. The subjective righteousness is organic; it was not accomplished by Christ in His flesh but is carried out in the believers by the pneumatic Christ. The believers need to work out their own salvation by cooperating with the indwelling Christ (Phil. 2:12). This salvation which we are working out is our subjective righteousness and it requires our daily and moment-by-moment experience of the subjective Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">III. IN PRESENTING OUR BODIES<br />TO LIVE THE BODY LIFE</h2><p>By reigning in life in establishing not our own righteousness but God&rsquo;s righteousness and taking Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness, we are able to present our bodies to live the Body life (Rom. 12&mdash;13).</p><h2 class="head2">A. Being Exceptionally Practical<br />in Presenting Our Bodies to Live the Body Life</h2><p>In presenting our bodies to live the Body life, we need to be exceptionally practical. Living the Body life is something very practical; it is neither vain nor empty. All the other things that the worldly people are doing will eventually be vanity and emptiness. Only the work which we are carrying out in God&rsquo;s eternal economy is not a vain concept or an empty doctrine or belief; it is practical and substantial.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being Exceptionally Abounding<br />in Presenting Our Bodies to Live the Body Life</h2><p>In presenting our bodies to live the Body life, we need to be exceptionally abounding. The Body life is neither poor nor monotonous but rich in content and reality. The following seven items are ways for us to be abounding in the Body life.</p><h2 class="head3">1. To Present Our Bodies</h2><p>To live the Body life in a practical and abounding way, first, we need to present our bodies (12:1). We human beings exist in time. When we present our bodies, naturally we present our time and offer our entire being.</p><h2 class="head3">2. To Be Renewed in Our Mind</h2><p>After presenting our bodies, we need to have our mind renewed (vv. 2-3). The renewing of the mind is the base for the transformation of our soul; it makes us suitable for the building up of the Body of Christ, which is the practice of the Body life.</p><h2 class="head3">3. To Exercise Our Gifts</h2><p>Romans 12:4-8 shows us that in the Body of Christ we have received gifts different from one another; there are those who prophesy, those who serve, those who teach, those who exhort, those who give, those who lead, and those who show mercy. Although our gifts are different, we all function according to our respective gifts as normal, proper, rich, organic, functioning members. Thus, the Body life is exceptionally abounding and intensified.</p><h2 class="head3">4. To Live a Life of the Highest Virtues</h2><p>Romans 12:9-21 is a long section in which a life of the highest virtues is described. We need to live out the highest virtues of Christ in our dealings with others, with God, with ourselves, with the persecutor and enemy, and in general, before all men. Such a complete and proper life is a life of surpassing quality with an excellent issue.</p><h2 class="head3">5. To Be Subject to Authorities</h2><p>Romans 13:1-7 deals with subjection to authorities. Man is rebellious in his natural character, but a transformed person is submissive. Apparently, subjection to authorities is related only to the government, but as those who live the normal church life, we should have a proper relationship with the government that we may live the church life in peace and security.</p><h2 class="head3">6. To Practice Love</h2><p>We must also practice love in presenting our bodies to live the Body life (vv. 8-10). Only love prevails. We love, however, because God first loved us. The love of God is wrought into us that we may live it out (1 John 4:10-11).</p><h2 class="head3">7. To Live a Watchful Life</h2><p>We live a watchful life in the Body life (Rom. 13:11-14). We do not live a befuddled and confused life; rather, we have been raised from sleep to be those who are watching and waiting.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. IN RECEIVING THE BELIEVERS<br />TO LIVE THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>To practice what is revealed in Romans 12 concerning presenting our bodies to live the Body life, we must learn the practical lessons of receiving the believers, as revealed particularly in Romans 14:1&mdash;15:13, that the church life may be all-inclusive, able to include all kinds of genuine Christians.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Being Exceptionally General in Receiving<br />the Believers to Live the Church Life</h2><p>We need to be exceptionally general in receiving the believers to live the church life. To be general means that everyone is speaking and every home is doing the same thing; no one is particularly different.</p><h2 class="head3">1. According to God&rsquo;s Receiving</h2><p>This generality must be according to God&rsquo;s receiving (14:1-23). God is very general; the most general one in the universe is God. Those whom God has received, you must receive; otherwise, your receiving is not general. We receive the believers according to God, not according to doctrinal views or religious practices.</p><h2 class="head3">2. According to Christ&rsquo;s Receiving</h2><p>This generality must also be according to Christ&rsquo;s receiving (15:1-13). The most general ones in the universe are God and Christ. Therefore, remember these two statements: we must receive the believers according to God, and we must receive the believers according to Christ. As long as a person has God and Christ, we must receive him. If we do not receive him, our receiving is a special receiving; then we are sectarian and have become a denomination. Thus, we cannot maintain the oneness of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being Exceptionally Smooth and Orderly<br />in Receiving the Believers to Live the Church Life</h2><p>In receiving the believers to live the church life, we need to be exceptionally smooth and orderly. To be smooth and orderly is to not be quarrelsome but to be peaceful and easy. To some extent we can see this today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. There is no quarreling among us; everything is peaceful, smooth, and orderly. When we are not general, there is no peace, smoothness, or order, and the result is something particular and sectarian. If we receive others according to God and Christ, the church life will be smooth and orderly, and the whole church will be in harmony.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Living the Kingdom Life Not for Eating<br />and Drinking, But for Righteousness,<br />Peace, and Joy in the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Today our church life is the practical kingdom life. The kingdom life is not for eating and drinking, but for righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit; it is also for us to pursue peace and the building up of one another (14:17-19).</p><h2 class="head3">2. Being of the Same Mind toward One Another<br />according to Christ Jesus So That<br />with One Accord We May Glorify God</h2><p>We need to be of the same mind toward one another according to Christ Jesus so that with one accord we may glorify God in receiving the believers to live the church life (15:5-7). Whenever we are in one accord, we speak the same thing; we speak with one mouth. The only way to be with one accord and with one mouth is to allow Christ the room to be everything in our heart and in our mouth that God may be glorified. We have said that God is the New Jerusalem. When we glorify God, we take Him as the New Jerusalem and give all the glory to Him.</p><h1 class="series">THE EXPERIENCE OF<br />GOD&rsquo;S ORGANIC SALVATION EQUALING<br />REIGNING IN CHRIST&rsquo;S LIFE</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE SIX</h1><h1 class="title">REIGNING IN LIFE</h1><h1 class="msg">(3)</h1><h1 class="title">IN IMITATING THE APOSTLE TO BRING THE LOCAL CHURCHES INTO THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY<br />OF CHRIST; IN FOLLOWING IN THE APOSTLE&rsquo;S FOOTSTEPS TO BRING ALL THE SAINTS INTO THE BLENDING LIFE OF THE ENTIRE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>In imitating the apostle to bring the local churches into the fellowship of the Body of Christ&mdash;Rom. 14:3; 15:7-9, 25-33:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Not despising or judging others in their doctrines or practices according to doctrinal concepts, religious practices, and anything that is unrelated to our basic faith.</li>	<li>But receiving people according to God&rsquo;s receiving, not being more narrow than God, thereby demonstrating and maintaining the oneness of the Body of Christ, and receiving people according to the Son of God, according to God, not according to doctrine or practice, thus maintaining a condition of absolute peace, smoothness, and order, without any deviation and discord, in the fellowship of the Body of Christ to the glory of God (14:3; 15:7); Christ being a servant of the circumcision to fulfill and confirm all the promises God gave to their fathers and a servant of the Gentiles so that they may glorify God for His mercy (15:8-9).</li>	</ol></li><li>In following in the apostle&rsquo;s footsteps to bring all the saints into the blending life of the entire Body of Christ&mdash;Rom. 16:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Following in the apostle&rsquo;s footsteps to bring us into the blending life of the entire Body of Christ by recommendations and greetings that the God of peace may crush Satan under our feet and we may enjoy the rich grace of Christ&mdash;vv. 1-16, 21-24, 20.</li>	<li>Carrying out the mystery kept in silence in the times of the ages concerning the complete salvation of God in the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God for the Gentiles to have the obedience of faith unto glory to the only wise God through Jesus Christ&mdash;vv. 25-27.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>In this message, the third message on reigning in life, we want to see our reigning in life in imitating the apostle to bring the local churches into the fellowship of the Body of Christ and in following in the apostle&rsquo;s footsteps to bring all the saints into the blending life of the entire Body of Christ. In this message our particular stress is on the universal fellowship of the church, the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">I. IN IMITATING THE APOSTLE<br />TO BRING THE LOCAL CHURCHES INTO<br />THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>The last three chapters of Romans show us that we need to reign in life particularly in two crucial matters. The first thing is in imitating the apostle to bring the local churches into the fellowship of the Body of Christ (Rom. 14:3; 15:7-9, 25-33); the second thing is in following in the apostle&rsquo;s footsteps to bring all the saints into the blending life of the entire Body of Christ (ch. 16).</p><p>I hope that we all can see that reigning in life is not a matter of position; rather, it is a practical living. All the things mentioned in Romans 14 through 16 are related to reigning in life in our practical living. To experience reigning in life, first, we must imitate the apostle in bringing the local churches into the fellowship of the Body of Christ. It is only by practically entering into the fellowship of the Body of Christ that we can have the genuine experience of reigning in life.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Not Despising or Judging Others<br />according to Doctrinal Concepts,<br />Religious Practices, and Anything That<br />Is Unrelated to Our Basic Faith</h2><p>In imitating the apostle to bring the local churches into the fellowship of the Body of Christ, we must learn not to despise or judge others in their doctrines or practices according to doctrinal concepts, religious practices, and anything that is unrelated to our basic faith. Concerning this matter, our co-workers and serving ones in all the places must be willing to learn, and all the brothers and sisters must have clear insight.</p><p>&ldquo;Our basic faith&rdquo; refers to the most important and fundamental truths. These are the truths concerning Christ&rsquo;s person and work and those related to our salvation. All other matters, such as eating and the keeping of days mentioned in Romans 14, are secondary truths, not the basic faith. The Bible definitely gives us some clear principles concerning foods. First Timothy 4:1 and 3 tell us that forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from certain foods are teachings of demons. God permits us to eat meat, but if someone who is weak in faith eats only vegetables, he is still saved as long as he has believed in the Lord and has received Him as his Savior. His eating of vegetables does not make him an unsaved person. Therefore, eating is not a matter of our basic faith. The same is true concerning the keeping of days. We should not argue with people concerning whether we should meet on Saturday or on the Lord&rsquo;s Day; that is a secondary truth. We should not despise or judge others according to doctrinal concepts and religious practices, including the doctrinal concepts and practices we have in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Nor should we despise or judge others according to anything that is not related to our basic faith. As long as one is a genuine Christian, we should not exclude him, even though he may differ from us with respect to doctrine; rather, we should receive him in the same one Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">B. But Receiving People<br />according to God and His Son</h2><p>We should receive people according to God&rsquo;s receiving, not being more narrow than God, thereby demonstrating and maintaining the oneness of the Body of Christ. Furthermore, we should receive people according to the Son of God, according to God, not according to doctrine or practice, thus maintaining a condition of absolute peace, smoothness, and order, without any deviation and discord, in the fellowship of the Body of Christ to the glory of God (Rom. 14:3; 15:7); Christ is a servant of the circumcision to fulfill and confirm all the promises God gave to their fathers and a servant of the Gentiles so that they may glorify God for His mercy (15:8-9).</p><p>We have much to learn concerning receiving people according to God and according to His Son. Because of our negligence in this matter in the past, we have offended the Body of Christ and many brothers and sisters in the Lord. For this reason, I had a deep repentance before the Lord. Brothers and sisters, I hope that we can see our past mistakes by getting into this message through pray-reading, studying, reciting, and prophesying. Of course, sectarianism in the denominations is wrong; it is something very much condemned by God. Nevertheless, those who are genuinely saved in the denominations are children of God and have been received by God. Hence, we also should receive them, but we would never participate in the division in which they are.</p><p>Romans 14:3 tells us that we should receive people according to God; this is to receive all those whom God has received. Romans 15:7 says that we should receive one another, as Christ also received us. Those whom God has received and those whom Christ has received are actually the same group of people. It is not that God receives one group of people and Christ receives another group of people. God is very liberal and not narrow. When we receive people according to God and according to His Son, Christ, we demonstrate, show forth, and maintain the oneness of the Body of Christ. If we receive people according to doctrine and practice, there is no way for the oneness of the Body of Christ to be maintained and demonstrated.</p><p>We must receive people according to the Son of God. This is to receive others according to the Son of God in His being unbiased and balanced in taking care of both the Jews and the Gentiles. Our Lord is a Lord who is balanced, without any bias. On the one hand, He is a servant of the circumcision (the Jews); on the other hand, He is a servant of the God-chosen nations (the Gentiles). What the Lord does is always balanced and even. His balanced ministry, on the one hand, enables the fellowship of the Body of Christ to be kept in absolute peace and smoothness to the glory of God, and on the other hand, causes the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy. To glorify God is to participate in the New Jerusalem. If we do not participate in the New Jerusalem, whatever we do is not a glorifying of God but of ourselves, an expression of ourselves. It is only when we express God in the New Jerusalem that He is truly glorified in the universe.</p><h2 class="head1">II. IN FOLLOWING IN THE APOSTLE&rsquo;S FOOTSTEPS<br />TO BRING ALL THE SAINTS INTO THE BLENDING LIFE OF THE ENTIRE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>The last three chapters of Romans show us the blending and fellowship of the Body life brought forth through the apostle&rsquo;s receiving according to God and Christ; such an explanation was not seen by the Bible expositors throughout the generations. Romans 16 gives us an excellent pattern of the apostle in bringing all the saints into the blending life of the entire Body of Christ. It is in such a life that we can truly reign in life.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Apostle Bringing Us into the Blending Life of the Entire Body of Christ<br />by Recommendations and Greetings</h2><p>We must follow in the footsteps of the apostle. He brought us into the blending life of the entire Body of Christ by recommendations and greetings that the God of peace may crush Satan under our feet and that we may enjoy the rich grace of Christ (vv. 1-16, 21-24, 20). In Romans 16 the apostle Paul greeted the saints, one by one, mentioning at least twenty-seven names, including Phoebe, a deaconess of the church in Cenchrea, and Prisca and Aquila. Moreover, he greeted the saints generally. This shows us that he had a considerable amount of knowledge, understanding, and care with regard to every one of them. Such recommendations and greetings show both the mutual concern among the saints and the mutual fellowship among the churches. It is by the churches&rsquo; fellowship in the Body that the God of peace will crush Satan under our feet and we will be able to enjoy the rich grace of Christ. This grace is the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Carrying Out the Mystery<br />Kept in Silence in the Times of the Ages concerning God&rsquo;s Complete Salvation<br />in the Fulfillment of God&rsquo;s Eternal Economy</h2><p>Through the fellowship in the Body, the crushing of Satan, and the enjoyment of grace, we can carry out the mystery kept in silence in the times of the ages concerning the complete salvation of God in the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God for the Gentiles to have the obedience of faith unto glory to the only wise God through Jesus Christ (vv. 25-27).</p><p>We must have the reality of the fellowship and blending of the Body of Christ. Otherwise, regardless of how much we pursue and how simple and humble we are, sooner or later there will be problems, even divisions, among us. Hence, we must be governed by the vision of the Body and follow in the footsteps of the apostle by bringing all the saints in all the churches into the blending life of the entire Body of Christ. This is to reign in life, and by such reigning we give glory to God. This glory is the New Jerusalem, the universal incorporation of the union and mingling of divinity with humanity, in which God will be completely glorified and His economy will be fully accomplished.</p><p>In its conclusion Romans, which gives a general discussion of the Christian life, gives glory to the wise God. This unveils that all the matters discussed in this book are planned, managed, and accomplished by God&rsquo;s wisdom in order that He, the immeasurably rich Triune God, may be glorified, that is, that His incomparable glory may be completely and fully expressed through us who have been perfected eternally by Him and who have become His Body and have been joined to Him as one. The focus of God&rsquo;s wisdom is the working of His Divine Trinity into the three parts&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;of our redeemed being that in His redemption, sanctification, and transformation we may have a full union in the divine life with Him that His desire for the mingling of divinity and humanity, the joining of humanity to divinity, may be fulfilled in eternity. This truly is worthy of our appreciation and worship! This is worthy of our unceasing singing and praise for eternity! We should have this as the center and purpose of both our Christian life and our church life. May all of us who have been chosen and perfected by Him experience His organic salvation in full and reign in His life to be His consummate expression in eternity.</p></body></html>
