   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Some may say, "True, others cannot snatch us away, but I myself can go out."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For one to say this proves that his mind is fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He does not know God's Word, and he does not know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After a person is saved, if he were to perish, would it be because he himself wants to perish?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Or would it be because of the temptation of the world, the seduction of the enemy, and the attack of Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For a Christian to perish would mean that lust can snatch man from God's hand; it would mean that the devil and the world can snatch man from God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man does not go to hell because he wants to go to hell; even sinners themselves do not want to go to hell, not to mention Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is clear that man is dead in sin because of the evil spirits' binding work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everyone in the world is possessed by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the sinners have demons working in them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the believers can be snatched from the Father's hand, then the evil spirits are greater than the Father of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here is a sheep in the hand of the Father of all.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If nothing is greater than the Father of all, there is no possibility that this sheep can be snatched away.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, it is impossible even for us to escape ourselves, because even we are part of the all things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus said, "My Father is greater than all."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You cannot put yourself outside of the all things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thank God that verse 28 shows us the hand of the Lord Jesus and verse 29 shows us the hand of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 28 tells us about the hand of the Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not a matter of law, nor a matter of curse, nor a matter of mercy, but a matter of the keeping by the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 29 says that the Father's hand is greater and more powerful than all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should consider ourselves securely held by two hands: the Father's hand and the Shepherd's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not long after I believed in the Lord, Brother Leland Wang and I went to listen to a message in Jiang Wan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The preacher said that we Christians should be fervent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should preach the gospel and serve the Lord; otherwise, we would be dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After the message, I asked Brother Wang, "When do you think you will be dropped?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He said, "I am afraid that I will be dropped tonight."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I said, "Yes, I am afraid that I will also be dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If I am dropped, I will go to hell."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I further said, "If we can be dropped, what is the use of exhorting people to believe in Jesus any longer?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He agreed, saying, "I cannot even eat tonight."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I said that not only would we not be able to eat, but we would not even be able to sleep that night.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those in the world do not know the danger of eternal death; they can still eat and sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We know the peril of eternal death; we know that we are like chaff before the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can we not worry?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was my story before I knew about this aspect of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thank God that it is my Father who keeps the salvation for me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is my Lord who keeps my salvation for me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, I know that I am very secure.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Twelve years ago, I was in Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once I rode a bicycle through a big forest on my way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the forest, I saw a big mother monkey carrying many little monkeys stacked up one upon another on her back.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They were like the human pyramid seen in acrobatic shows.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The mother monkey carrying the little ones was running amid the trees.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every so often, she had to jump from one tree to another with a long distance in between.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The mother monkey would jump and grab onto a branch of another tree.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After swinging over a little, all the little monkeys on her back would fall onto the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The mother monkey would then jump down and let the little ones climb up and pile themselves onto her back again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On that day I watched them there for about two or three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They were very intriguing to me.</S>
