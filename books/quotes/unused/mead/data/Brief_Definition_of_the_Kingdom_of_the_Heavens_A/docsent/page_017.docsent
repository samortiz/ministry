   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXAMPLE OF THE APOSTLE PAUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Surely we have been saved eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But whether or not we will be able to share in the manifestation of the kingdom is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the conclusion of this chapter we need to consider the history of the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, let us read 1 Corinthians 9:24-27: Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Run in this way, that you may lay hold.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air; but I buffet my body and make it my slave, lest perhaps having preached to others, I myself may become disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Surely Paul had the assurance that he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet he emphatically told us that he was running the race.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During the time Paul was living, there were the Greek Olympic Games where people ran the race in order to receive a prize.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul used this as his example, saying that he too was running a race to receive a prize.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Philippians 3:13-15 says, Brothers, I do not account of myself to have laid hold; but one thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize to which God in Christ Jesus has called me upward.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let us therefore, as many as are full-grown, have this mind; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, this also God will reveal to you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the time Paul wrote Philippians, he had been a believer for many years, but he was still pursuing toward the goal for the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The prize is the uttermost enjoyment of Christ in the millennial kingdom as a reward to the victorious runners of the New Testament race.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1 Corinthians 9 the apostle was running the course v. 26 . In Philippians, one of his last Epistles, he was still running 3:14 . It was not until the last moment of his running, in 2 Timothy 4:6-8, that he had the assurance that he would be rewarded by the Lord at His appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Paul knew that his martyrdom was imminent, he had the assurance to tell us that he would be awarded the crown of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The crown is a symbol of glory given as a prize, in addition to the Lord s salvation, to the triumphant runner of the race 1 Cor 9:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This prize is not of grace nor by faith as salvation is Eph 2:5, 8-9 , but of righteousness through works Matt 16:27; Rev 22:12; 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a reward will be awarded to the believers, not according to the grace of the Lord but according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, it is the crown of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Awarder of this crown is the Lord as the righteous Judge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul was assured that such a prize was reserved for him and would be awarded to him at the day of the Lord s second appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is to be rewarded with the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must all be clear that to be saved eternally is one thing, and to be exercised to bear responsibility in the kingdom is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Based upon our exercise in the kingdom, we will either be rewarded with the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens or suffer loss in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must realize that as Christians today we are in the kingdom of the heavens today to be exercised and tomorrow to be rewarded.</S>
