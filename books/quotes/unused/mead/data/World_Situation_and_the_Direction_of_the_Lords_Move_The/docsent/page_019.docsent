   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING THE SUPPLY OF OUR NECESSITIES The Full-Timers Living a Life by Faith,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Trusting in the Lord for Their Necessities,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Receiving the Lord s Supply</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>through the Saints and the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The full-timers should live a life by faith, trusting in the Lord for their necessities and receiving the Lord s supply through the saints and the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we feel led and burdened by the Lord to go full-time, we should not worry about our necessities.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to believe in the Lord and put our trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not think that we will have a prosperous life in material things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must get ourselves prepared to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first suffering is poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to learn to serve the Lord in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some think that if they serve the Lord in poverty, that is a sign they have not been chosen and called by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the apostle Paul was in poverty 2 Cor 6:10; 11:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because the churches established by him did not adequately support him, he was forced to make tents Acts 18:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the same time, he ministered to the needs of his co-workers 20:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I was called by the Lord to serve Him full-time, I thought that He had just called me to preach the gospel to my countrymen in the villages.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I told the Lord that as long as I could have water to drink and food to eat, I would be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I never thought the Lord would bring me to the big cities of mainland China and eventually to Taiwan and the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1961 I came to the United States with the intention of staying here for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time I had just a little amount of cash on hand to meet my need.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the Lord supplied me with enough for my necessities.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord is faithful to meet all our needs when we follow Him and His calling.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By the Lord s mercy, I have learned how to be abased in poverty and how to abound Phil 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we have the money, we should learn to save some for others and for the needs of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To serve the Lord in this way is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the Lord has called us and sent us, He will surely take care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He has a way to supply us through the saints and the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not as Being Hired in Any Sense</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>by Anyone or by Any Church</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we serve the Lord, we should not have the thought that we are hired in any sense by anyone or by any church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the church supplies us, that does not mean that the church hires us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That is not a wage but the Lord s supply through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to fully realize that the Lord in supporting us needs His Body the church and the members of His Body the believers to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He does not supply us directly by Himself but indirectly through His Body and His members.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>AND MAINTAINING A GOOD ORDER</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ and maintain a good order in the Body of Christ so that the Lord s recovery can be kept to go on in the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Keeping the Unique Oneness of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Locally and Universally</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should always endeavor to keep the unique oneness of the Body of Christ locally and universally Eph 4:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This should be the prerequisite of our remaining in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Condemning Any Kind of Division</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to 1 Corinthians 1:10-13, we must condemn any kind of division.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Turning Away from Those Who Make Divisions</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We also must turn away from those who make divisions Rom 16:17; Titus 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why I published the book entitled The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because some are sick, full of the germs of division, they need to be quarantined.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is according to Romans 16:17, where Paul charges us to turn away from those who make divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we do not turn away from them, we will be infected with the same disease of division.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To turn away from such ones is for our preservation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to Titus 3:10, a factious, divisive person should be refused, rejected, after a first and second admonition in order to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
