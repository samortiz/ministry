   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR ASPECTS OF THE LAMPSTAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR OUR EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we consider Exodus 25, Zechariah 3 and 4, and the book of Revelation, we see four aspects of the lampstand that we must experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Firstly, we must participate in the essence, the golden element, of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Secondly, we must experience the forming of this golden substance into a definite form the stand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The gold in the lampstand is not a lump; rather, it is formed into a stand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thirdly, along with the form, we must experience the expression of the lampstand through the shining of the seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Fourthly, there is the matter of the reproduction of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, we must experience four aspects of the lampstand the element, the form, the expression, and the reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>EXPERIENCING THE GOLDEN ELEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all need to experience the golden element of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we only have an ounce of gold, how could we form a lampstand?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We might be able to make a ring, but certainly not a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to have a lampstand, there must be a talent of gold Exo 25:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A talent equals approximately one hundred pounds, or sixteen hundred ounces.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need more gold, more of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we would have the church as the lampstand, we must have something substantial the gold, which is the substance, the essence, the element, of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not have this substance, all our talk about the church is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How pitiful is the situation among so many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They have so little of the substance, of the divine gold; instead of acquiring the substance, they discuss vain doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even if our doctrine is sound, right, fundamental, and scriptural, it is not God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only God Himself is the element.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How we need God as the golden element!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus clearly said, God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Greek, there is no article before the word Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, we should not say that God is a Spirit, but that God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To say that God is Spirit is like saying that the table is wood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just as the element of the table is wood, so the element of God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to John 4:24 in order to worship God we must worship Him in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To worship God is not simply to bow down to Him; it is to reach Him, to contact Him, and to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the context of John 4, to worship God is to drink of Him as the living water v. 14 , which is the very Spirit flowing into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can we receive Him into us as this living water?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We receive Him by opening our whole being to Him and by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must receive God Himself as the golden element into the depths of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Day and night, we need to open ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Never close yourself to Him or shut any part of your being to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, tell Him, O God, I am absolutely open to You.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I exercise my spirit to contact You, the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>O divine Spirit, come into me and saturate me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the way to gain more gold.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we all gain more gold, among us there will not only be one talent but perhaps a hundred talents.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We shall be exceedingly rich in the divine element, in the material for the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the brothers and sisters will be full of God and wherever we go, we shall see gold.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we enter into the saints homes, we shall see nothing but gold.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I visit the brothers and sisters, I shall see gold.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When I come to the young ones, I shall see gold, and when I contact the older ones, I shall see even more gold.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The sisters should not be wooden or muddy; they should be golden.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I always feel shameful when I hear some sisters gossiping.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although I do not condemn them, I experience the sense of shame, for sisters in the church must be golden.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A gossiping sister is not truly in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Likewise, I also feel shameful whenever I see a brother exchanging words without love with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Where is the gold in this brother?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If he is a brother in the church, he should be full of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When I see such things, I turn away.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I do not like to see the muddy condition of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Rather, I enjoy seeing the gold in them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all need more gold.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church must be full of gold, full of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When I see this, I feel glorious and I am in the third heaven.</S>
