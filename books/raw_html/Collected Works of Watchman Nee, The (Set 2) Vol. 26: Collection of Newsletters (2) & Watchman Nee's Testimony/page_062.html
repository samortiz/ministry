<h2 class="head1">A REPLY TO A MEETING IN LONDON</h2><h2 class="head2">Preface</h2><p>Several years ago seven believers from England and America visited Shanghai and requested fellowship with us at the Lord's table. We immediately received them because they were brothers in the Lord. We received them in the same manner we usually received brothers from different denominations. Because they were of the "Closed Brethren," we made it clear to them that we received only their person, not the organization they represented. Later, they urged us to take the same attitude and stand of which they were persuaded. We brought it carefully to prayer, asking God to give us light and utterance to make this matter clear. Our reply is made in the following pages. When the brothers in different localities read our answer, they will know the kind of fellowship in which we believe and why we cannot join the "Closed Brethren." We desire that the brothers in every locality not presume that we fellowship merely with those who have left the divisions. We must realize that what we emphasize is the fellowship in the Holy Spirit.</p><p>[Translator's note: The following letter is a translation from the Chinese. The original letter (in English) to the Closed Brethren in England is not available.]</p><h2 class="head2">The Letter</h2><p>It has been some time since we received your letter touching the matter of fellowship. We should have replied earlier but have lacked clear light from God; thus, we delayed our definite answer until today. Your love and patience are required to bear with our delay, for we did not want to be hasty in our reply, thereby neglecting God's will. We beg your pardon, regretting the inconvenience we have caused through our tarrying. In addition, our brother Mr. Nee has had a heart ailment since last February and is only now gradually recovering. This was another factor which contributed to the delay in answering you.</p><p>We believe that those who have been taught of God should not trust themselves. "The flesh profits nothing," including the matter of understanding God's Word. It is very easy for one to acknowledge a certain truth in his mind. But the same person can be completely ignorant of everything, as if he has never heard the truth. The only condition for the realization of spiritual matters is for us to be in the Holy Spirit and in the life. It is exceedingly easy for one to stand upon others' revelation and light, while at the same time he himself falls into law. The New Testament dispensation is a spiritual dispensation; therefore, man can (or should) be taught of God from within and have the inner knowledge (Heb. 8). Every matter coming from without (including everything from the avenue of the mind), which stops short of reaching the inner depth, has no spiritual value, and those who acquire it have never actually known anything. By saying this, we do not mean that we are unwilling to be taught by our brothers. However, we are assured that we can do nothing when the Holy Spirit within does not make the truth alive. The situation of death and weakness among the saints today is due to the fact that they merely receive and obey the truth in their minds. This is the law. Although their words are accurate, they are absolutely independent of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>For this reason, we could only wait before God, trusting His Holy Spirit rather than depending upon our own minds. We say with thankful hearts that by His grace He has given us light and utterance. We have the assurance that this light is from Him, we desire to share it with you. We earnestly beseech Him that this letter may be entirely of Him, without the slightest element of our human opinion.</p><p>(1) God's original desire toward the church is that she be the increase or fullness of Christ. The Lord Jesus and the church are Christ (1 Cor. 12:12). When the individual Christ is joined with His church, they together become the corporate Christ. The church in her life and testimony should manifest Christ and express His life, His victory, and His glory. God's original intention for this generation is that every child of His should be in the real church and become the testimony of His only begotten Son.</p><p>(2) Notwithstanding, how the flesh has missed God's goal! Even before the apostles passed away, the church outwardly became desolate. Although man has had his sins forgiven and has become a child of God, he cannot manifest Christ or testify of His life, victory, and glory; only a minority can still fulfill God's original desire. The majority may have had a good beginning, but by their controversy with God, their life and testimony have been choked. Even to the present day, the church is divided into two groups, the overcomers and the defeated ones (Rev. 2&mdash;3). It is not that the overcomers are those who are above the standard of ordinary Christians but that the defeated ones are below the standard. The overcomers are those who can fulfill God's original desire.</p><p>(3) The matter of fellowship was not a difficult problem for the early church at Pentecost&mdash;all believers at that time were saved sinners and saints with a testimony (we will not speak of the exceptions). Today's difficulty is that these two matters have been separated among the saints. Although today's saints are saved, they do not live in the Holy Spirit. Should we then open our fellowship absolutely to all of God's children regardless of their condition? Or should we limit our fellowship only to those who are overcomers? Should we start a Christian laity movement? Or should we answer the call for overcomers and go forward towards God's perfect goal?</p><p>According to the letters to the seven churches, the Lord's call now is evidently for overcomers. Although the Lord did not reject the (ordinary) Christians, His eyes were on the overcomers who would fulfill His original desire.</p><p>Since we are meeting on the ground of the church in each locality as a local assembly, we ought to make such an assembly a vessel for the "testimony of Jesus" as the answer to God's desire. To have a people's movement consisting of many saved people is not enough. The assembly must be a special vessel for the testimony of Christ.</p><p>The overcomers are those who rise to fulfill the responsibility which the church herself has failed to fulfill. The overcomers are in God's sight just as the church is in His sight (we can compare them with the remnant in the former dispensation). Therefore, the meetings which stand on the ground of the church should have the character of the overcomer.</p>
