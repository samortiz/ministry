We shall begin with the believers&#8217; status, and in this message we shall cover the believers&#8217; status before they were saved.<h2 class=head1>A. BEFORE BEING SAVED</h2><p>Before the believers were saved, they had a sixfold status. They were sinners, sons of disobedience, children of wrath, children of the Devil, enemies of God, and sons of Gehenna.<h2 class=head2>1. Sinners</h2><p>Before we were saved we were sinners. In Matthew 9:13 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.&#8221; In 1 Timothy 1:15 Paul declares, &#8220;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.&#8221;<h2 class=head3>a. Having Sinned</h2><p>In our status as sinners we all have sinned. &#8220;All have sinned and come short of the glory of God&#8221; (Rom. 3:23). The word &#8220;all&#8221; refers to all human beings. First Kings 8:46 says, &#8220;There is no man that sinneth not.&#8221;<p>As those who have sinned, we have come short of the glory of God. God&#8217;s glory is God Himself expressed. Whenever God is expressed, His glory is seen. Man was made by God in His image that man may express Him for His glory. But man has sinned. Instead of expressing God, man expresses sin and his sinful self and thus is short of God&#8217;s glory. We sinners were not only under the requirements of God&#8217;s righteousness but also under the demand of God&#8217;s glory. We all have broken God&#8217;s righteous law, and we all have come short of God&#8217;s glory. Therefore, before we were saved we were under God&#8217;s condemnation.<h2 class=head3>b. Constituted of Sin</h2><p>As sinners we not only sinned but were constituted of sin. A sinner is one who is constituted of sin. Romans 5:19a says, &#8220;Through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners.&#8221; As a result of Adam&#8217;s disobedience, the many, including us, were not only made sinners but were constituted sinners. An element not created by God was injected into our being and constituted us sinners. We are sinners by constitution, not by accident, for sin has been wrought into us and constituted into our being. Therefore, sin is not merely an outward deed; sin is an inward, subjective element in our constitution. Before we were saved we were typical sinners by nature.<p>We were sinners not only because we had sinned, but because we were constituted of sin. We were constituted sinners in Adam long before we were born. As a result, when we were born, we were born sinners. We were born with a constitution of sin. From this we see that we do not become sinners after sinning. Rather, we were sinners even before we sinned. All unbelievers, being constituted of sin, are sinners by birth.<h2 class=head3>c. Enslaved under Sin</h2><p>As those constituted of sin, we were enslaved under sin. Romans 7:14b says, &#8220;I am fleshly, sold under sin.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;sold under sin&#8221; means sold to sin. Sin is the buying master, and we were sold to him to be his slaves.<p>In John 8:34 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.&#8221; A slave is always under bondage. Satan, the Devil, has brought all humankind under the bondage of sin by imparting himself into man as the sinful nature that compels man to sin. Although we were not taught to sin, we were born as those enslaved to sin and could not keep from sinning. Because we have a devilish nature, we are slaves of sin. It is impossible for anyone to free himself from this slavery.<h2 class=head3>d. Having Become Sin</h2><p>Before we were saved we were not only sinners constituted of sin-we were sin itself. We were born sin, and in our flesh we are nothing but sin (Rom. 8:3). This is the reason that, in order to save us, Christ was made sin on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21). Sin came from Satan as the rebel against God (Isa. 14:12-15), entered into man (Rom. 5:12), and made man not only a sinner but sin itself under God&#8217;s judgment. Hence, when Christ became a man in flesh (John 1:14), He was made sin (not sinful) on our behalf to be judged by God that we might become God&#8217;s righteousness in Him.<h2 class=head3>e. Condemned</h2><p>In John 3:18b the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;He who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.&#8221; This indicates that as sinners, those who were constituted of sin and enslaved to sin and who were even sin itself, we were condemned by God. Actually, we all were condemned in Adam through his sin. We were judged when Adam was judged. This means that we were condemned even before we were born. Our status was that of sinners under God&#8217;s condemnation.<h2 class=head3>f. To Perish in the Lake of Fire</h2><p>As sinners, our destiny was to perish in the lake of fire. John 3:16 indicates that those who do not believe in Christ will perish. Revelation 20:15 says, &#8220;If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.&#8221; The lake of fire is prepared for the Devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41). Because unbelievers follow the Devil, they will share the Devil&#8217;s judgment (John 16:11) and will become joint partakers of the Devil&#8217;s eternal torment. Unbelievers are condemned by the Lord because of their evil deeds, but they will perish because of their unbelief. Not believing in the Lord Jesus is the unique sin that causes people to perish (John 16:9).<h2 class=head2>2. Sons of Disobedience</h2><p>Before we were saved we were also sons of disobedience. This is emphatically revealed by Paul in Ephesians 2:2: &#8220;You once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit who now is operating in the sons of disobedience.&#8221;<h2 class=head3>a. Operated Within by the Aggregate Spirit of All the Evil Angelic Authorities with Satan as the Ruler</h2><p>Ephesians 2:2 speaks of the spirit who is now operating in the sons of disobedience. &#8220;The spirit,&#8221; in apposition with &#8220;the authority of the air,&#8221; refers to the aggregate power, a personal aggregate of all the evil angelic authorities, over which Satan is the ruler. The entire earth is under the domination of this spirit in the air. This evil spirit, this evil atmosphere, influences people to do evil things which, as humans, they would not normally do. The source of this evil is in the spirit, the atmosphere, that dominates them. This spirit is now operating in the sons of disobedience, in those who are disobedient to God.<h2 class=head3>b. Walking according to the Ruler (Satan) of the Authority of the Air</h2><p>Ephesians 2:2 also reveals that the sons of disobedience walk according to the ruler of the authority of the air. This ruler refers to Satan, the prince of the aerial authority mentioned in Ephesians 6:12.<h2 class=head3>c. Walking according to the Age of this World</h2><p>Furthermore, the sons of disobedience walk according to the age of this world. &#8220;This world&#8221; in 2:2 refers to the satanic system composed of many ages. The word &#8220;age&#8221; here refers to a part, a section, an aspect, of the system of Satan, particularly the present and modern appearance of that system, which is used by him to usurp and occupy people and keep them away from God and His purpose. Before we were saved we, as sons of disobedience, walked according to the age, the modern appearance, the present course of the world, the satanic system.<h2 class=head2>3. Children of Wrath</h2><h2 class=head3>a. By Nature</h2><p>Referring to the sons of disobedience, Ephesians 2:3 says, &#8220;Among whom also we all behaved ourselves once in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.&#8221; Here we see that, as sons of disobedience, we were also the children of wrath. God was angry with us. Because of our disobedience we were under God&#8217;s wrath.<h2 class=head3>b. Behaving Themselves in the Lust of Their Flesh</h2><p>The children of wrath behaved themselves in the lust of their flesh. Thus, three evil things dominate the life of the children of wrath: the age of this world outside them, the ruler of the aerial authority above and within them, and the lust of the flesh in their fallen nature. Before we were saved we, as children of wrath, all behaved ourselves in the lust of our flesh.<h2 class=head3>c. Doing the Desires of the Flesh and of the Thoughts</h2><p>As we behaved ourselves in the lust of our flesh, we did the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts. The word &#8220;desires&#8221; in Ephesians 2:3 refers to our likes. In the past we did certain things simply because we liked to do them. The likes of the flesh refer to evil things, and the likes of the thoughts refer to things that may be somewhat better. Both are a sign of being deadened in the spirit (Eph. 2:1), especially in the conscience. When someone is deadened in his spirit, he does whatever his flesh and his thoughts like to do. This is a picture of the children of wrath, which we were before we were saved.<h2 class=head2>4. Children of the Devil</h2><p>Even worse than being sinners, sons of disobedience, and children of wrath, as unbelievers we were children of the Devil (1 John 3:10). Being sinners and practicing sin are matters of life and nature. Men, as the fallen descendants of Adam, are born children of the Devil, the evil one (John 8:44), possessing his life, partaking of his nature, and living in sin automatically and habitually. Practicing sin is their life.<h2 class=head3>a. Serpents, Brood of Vipers, Brought Forth by the Old Serpent (the Devil)</h2><p>The children of the Devil, brought forth by him as the old serpent (Rev. 12:9), are &#8220;serpents, brood of vipers&#8221; (Matt. 23:33; 3:7). This means that the children of the Devil have a serpentine nature. Because our human nature was fully poisoned by the old serpent, before we were saved we were a brood of vipers. No matter how good or refined a person may seem to be, his sinful nature is serpentine. In the sight of God, all unbelievers are serpents, the offspring of the Devil, full of the poison of the old serpent.<h2 class=head3>b. Doing the Desire of Their Father the Devil</h2><p>The children of the Devil do the desire of their father the Devil. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;You are of your father the Devil, and it is your will to do the desires of your father&#8221; (John 8:44). The Devil, an evil father, has brought forth sinful children, who do his desires. Because we were born of the Devil, we have his evil nature. The sins we commit are the outward expression of this nature. Sin is an act that expresses the devilish nature; it is an issue of the devilish nature within us.<h2 class=head3>c. To Perish with the Devil in the Lake of Fire</h2><p>Eventually, the children of the Devil will perish with the Devil in the lake of fire. Revelation 20:10 says that the Devil &#8220;was cast into the lake of fire,&#8221; and verse 15 says that those not found written in the book of life are likewise cast into the lake of fire. Thus, the destination of the children of the Devil is to perish with the Devil.<h2 class=head2>5. Enemies of God</h2><p>Those who are sinners, sons of disobedience, children of wrath, and children of the Devil surely are enemies of God. Being an enemy of God is even more serious than being a sinner. Enmity is the greatest problem between man and God. Before we were saved we were God&#8217;s enemies (Rom. 5:10).<h2 class=head3>a. In Their Mind</h2><p>Colossians 1:21 says that we once were enemies in our mind by evil works. Our enmity toward God was mainly in our corrupted mind.<h2 class=head3>b. By Evil Works</h2><p>According to Colossians 1:21, we were enemies in our mind and by our evil works. We were rebellious against God and thereby were God&#8217;s enemies. Because we were sinners we needed redemption. Because we were also enemies to God we needed reconciliation.<h2 class=head2>6. Sons of Gehenna</h2><p>Finally, before we were saved we were sons of Gehenna. The Lord Jesus uses the expression &#8220;the son of Gehenna&#8221; in Matthew 23:15. &#8220;Gehenna&#8221; is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew Ge Hinnom, valley of Hinnom. This was a deep and narrow valley near Jerusalem, the refuse-place of the city where the bodies of criminals and all kinds of filth were cast. It was also called Tophet, or Topheth (2 Kings 23:10; Isa. 30:33; Jer. 19:13). Because of its continual fire, it became the symbol of the place of eternal punishment, the lake of fire.<p>All sinners, who are sons of disobedience, children of wrath, children of the Devil, and enemies of God, are also sons of Gehenna. Using today&#8217;s term, they are sons of hell. For unbelievers to be sons of Gehenna means that they will go to Gehenna, to the lake of fire. Our status before we were saved was that of sinners, sons of disobedience, children of wrath, children of the Devil, enemies of God, and sons of Gehenna.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR STATUS</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In this message we shall begin to consider the believers&#8217; status after they have been saved.<h2 class=head1>B. AFTER BEING SAVED</h2><p>We have seen that before the believers were saved they were sinners, sons of disobedience, children of wrath, children of the Devil, enemies of God, and sons of Gehenna. But after being saved they become different persons, experiencing a great change. Now the believers are children of God, sons of God, partakers of the divine nature, heirs of God, priests of God, slaves of God, brothers of Christ as the firstborn Son of God, members of Christ as the Head of the Body, partakers of Christ as God&#8217;s Anointed, slaves of Christ, priests of Christ, co-kings of Christ, partakers of the Holy Spirit, and heavenly citizens.<h2 class=head2>1. Children of God</h2><p>The believers in Christ are children of God. First John 3:1 says, &#8220;See what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and we are.&#8221; &#8220;Children of God&#8221; here corresponds to &#8220;begotten of Him&#8221; in 2:29. We have been begotten of the Father, the source of life, to be the children of God. Surely it is the greatest wonder in the universe that human beings could be begotten of God and sinners could be made children of God. Through such an amazing divine birth we have received the divine life, the eternal life. This life, obtained from God through regeneration, enables us to be God&#8217;s children. This life is the authority for us to be children of God (John 1:12-13). The Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we who once were children of the Devil are now the children of God (Rom. 8:16). Even at times when we are weak or backsliding we still have the deep conviction that we are children of God, for once we have been born of God we are His children forever.<h2 class=head3>a. Born of God, Not of Blood, Nor of the Will of Flesh, Nor of the Will of Man</h2><p>John 1:12 and 13 say, &#8220;As many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&#8221; Here we see that the children of God have been born of God, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man. &#8220;Blood&#8221; here signifies the physical life; the will of the flesh denotes the will of fallen man after man became flesh; and the will of man refers to the will of man created by God. When we became children of God, we were not born of our physical life, our fallen life, or our created life-we were born of God, the uncreated life. For human beings to become children of God is for them to be born of God to have the divine life and nature. Because regeneration causes us to be born of God, it automatically causes us to become children of God and to have a relationship of life with God.<p>It surely is a mystery that we have been born of God. That we have been created by God is commonly admitted. But to say that God is our Father and that we therefore have His life and nature is to make a great claim. Nevertheless, it is an amazing fact that God is really our Father. And He is not our adopted father or our father-in-law, but the One who has given us His life that we may be His genuine children in life.<h2 class=head3>b. Through Their Receiving of the Son of God by Believing in His Name</h2><p>The believers become children of God through their receiving of the Son of God by believing in His name. John 1:12 speaks of receiving the Lord and also of believing in His name. Believing in the Lord Jesus is equal to receiving Him. As long as we can say, &#8220;Lord Jesus,&#8221; from the depths of our being, this proves that we believe in Him. Furthermore, if we believe in Him by calling on His name, this is a proof that we have received Him. And since we have received Him, we have received the authority to become children of God. The authority to be God&#8217;s children is Christ Himself as life to us. Having received the Lord Jesus by believing in Him, we have been born of God and now are children of God.<h2 class=head3>c. To Have the Eternal Life- the Life of God with the Divine Nature</h2><p>As believers we have been born of God to have eternal life-the life of God with the divine nature (John 3:15-16; 2 Pet. 1:4). The life of God is the content of God and God Himself. All that is in God and all that God Himself is are in the life of God. All the fullness of the Godhead is hidden in the life of God. The nature of God is also contained in the life of God. All that He is-whether truth, holiness, light, or love-is derived from His life. Because the life of God is the content of God, in it is hidden the fullness of God, and in it is contained the nature of God Himself. Therefore, when we receive the life of God, we receive the fullness of God, and we have the nature of God.<p>John 3:15 and 16 speak of having eternal life by believing in the Lord Jesus. Eternal life is the divine life, the uncreated life of God, which is not only everlasting with respect to time but also divine and eternal in nature. For us today this life is actually the resurrected, indwelling Christ. Along with the divine life we also have the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). Thus, through our receiving of the Son of God by believing in His name we were born to have eternal life, which is the life of God with the divine nature. Now, as believers, we are children of God with the divine life and nature.<h2 class=head2>2. Sons of God</h2><p>First, the believers are children of God, and then they gradually grow up to become sons of God. In His salvation God makes sinners into sons. The central thought of the book of Romans is that in His salvation God is making sinners His sons with His life and nature so that they may become constituents of the Body of Christ for His expression. Romans 8, in particular, emphasizes sonship. Verse 14 says, &#8220;As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&#8221; This indicates that we may know that we are sons of God by the fact that we are led by the Spirit. The leading of the Spirit marks us out as being the sons of God in the growth of life. Verse 19 continues, &#8220;The anxious watching of the creation eagerly expects the revelation of the sons of God.&#8221; This verse speaks of the manifestation or the appearing of the sons of God.<p>Galatians 3:26 says, &#8220;You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.&#8221; Faith in Christ brings us into Christ and makes us one with Christ in whom is the sonship. We must be identified with Christ through faith so that in Him we may become sons of God.<p>When we believed in Christ, the processed Triune God entered into our being to be our life. This life is divine, spiritual, heavenly, and holy. Entering into us, it caused a spiritual birth to take place, and this birth brought about an organic union between us and the Triune God. Because God has been born into our being, we have become sons of God.<p>According to the Bible, it is a divine fact that human beings can become sons of God. When we believed in Christ, the divine life with the divine nature-in fact, the divine being of the Triune God Himself-entered into us, and we were born of God to become sons of God. Just as a man&#8217;s son partakes of his life and nature, so we as God&#8217;s sons partake of the divine life and nature. God&#8217;s offspring are His sons possessing the divine life and divine nature.<p>It is a matter of tremendous significance for the divine life to be imparted into us. This impartation of the divine life causes an organic union that makes us the sons of God. This organic union takes place exclusively in Christ. In Christ we enjoy the wonderful organic union with the Triune God. In this union we are the sons of God. Christ is the unique sphere in which this takes place. When we enter into this sphere, we become sons of God. Our true status is that in Christ and by the organic union we are sons of God.<p>Galatians 4:6 says, &#8220;Because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!&#8221; God&#8217;s Son is the embodiment of the divine life (1 John 5:12). Hence, the Spirit of God&#8217;s Son is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). God gives us His Spirit of life because we are His sons. As the sons of God, we have the position with the full right to participate in the Spirit of God, who has the bountiful supply of life.<p>According to the entire revelation of the New Testament, God&#8217;s economy is to produce sons. Sonship is the focal point of God&#8217;s economy, God&#8217;s dispensation. God&#8217;s economy is the dispensing of Himself into His chosen people to make them His sons. Christ&#8217;s redemption is to bring us into the sonship of God that we may enjoy the divine life. It is not God&#8217;s economy to make us keepers of law, which was given only for a temporary purpose. God&#8217;s economy is to make us sons of God, inheriting the blessing of God&#8217;s promise, which was given for His eternal purpose to have many sons for His corporate expression (Heb. 2:10; Rom. 8:29).<p>Revelation 21:7 says, &#8220;He who overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he shall be a son to Me.&#8221; Here to overcome means to overcome by believing, as in 1 John 5:4 and 5. This overcoming qualifies all believers for participation in the New Jerusalem with all its enjoyment as a common portion of God&#8217;s eternal salvation. &#8220;Son&#8221; in Revelation 21:7 refers to the believer who will dwell in the New Jerusalem. The sons of God in the New Jerusalem are the constituents of the New Jerusalem. They are the regenerated believers who have the divine life and nature and who are built together through transformation to be the corporate expression of the Triune God. The New Jerusalem is constituted of all these sons who have been born of God. Because the sons of God are the constituents of the New Jerusalem, they will also dwell in the New Jerusalem. Furthermore, the sons of God will participate in all the enjoyment of the New Jerusalem, especially the enjoyment of the water of life (Rev. 21:6).<h2 class=head3>a. Having Received the Spirit of Sonship with the Sonship</h2><p>As sons of God, we have received the spirit of sonship with the sonship (Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:5-6). Sonship is a matter of being a son. The sons of God have the life, the position, the right, the privilege, and the blessings of a son. The spirit of sonship is the spirit of being a son. If we did not have such a spirit but only a mind, there would not be a way for us to be the sons of God. It is possible for us to be sons of God only in our spirit, which has become a spirit of sonship. When we were regenerated, we received the spirit of sonship with the sonship. Therefore, now we have the being of a son of God.<p>Romans 8:15 tells us, &#8220;You have not received a spirit of slavery to fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father.&#8221; We received this spirit of sonship by the Spirit of the Son of God coming into our spirit. Because the Spirit of the Son of God has entered our spirit and we have been born of the Spirit in our spirit, our spirit has become a spirit of sonship. It is difficult to determine whether this spirit refers to the divine Spirit or to the human spirit. Actually, this spirit is a mingled spirit.<p>Galatians 4:5 reveals that God sent His Son that &#8220;He might redeem those under law, that we might receive the sonship.&#8221; Furthermore, God has sent forth the Spirit to impart His life into us that we might become His sons in reality. Basically sonship is a matter of life. The position and right of sons depend on the life. In order for us to enjoy God&#8217;s sonship, we need the Spirit. Apart from the Spirit, we cannot be born of God to have the divine life. After we have been born of the Spirit, we need the Spirit in order to grow in life. Without the Spirit we cannot have the position, right, or privilege of sonship. All the crucial points concerning sonship depend on the Spirit. By the Spirit we have the divine birth and the divine life. Through the Spirit we grow unto maturity. Because of the Spirit we have the position, right, and privilege of sonship. When the Spirit comes, the sonship is made real, and we fully realize God&#8217;s sonship in life, maturity, position, and right.<h2 class=head3>b. Destined unto Glory</h2><p>According to the New Testament, every son of God has a destiny, and this destiny is glory. We have been destined unto glory. Hebrews 2:10 reveals that God is &#8220;leading many sons into glory.&#8221; The last step of God&#8217;s great salvation is to bring His many sons into glory. We are sons of God, but we are not yet in glory. Therefore, the Triune God is still working to bring His many sons into glory.<p>Romans 8:21 speaks of &#8220;the freedom of the glory of the children of God.&#8221; One day the children of God will be glorified, brought into glory. With that glory there will be freedom, and that freedom will be a kingdom, sphere, realm, into which we shall be brought. When we are brought into this freedom, or kingdom, or glory, creation will be delivered from vanity, corruption, and slavery.<p>This glory is related to the redemption of our body, which is the full sonship (Rom. 8:23). Our body has not yet been redeemed, but one day it will be transfigured into a glorious body (Phil. 3:21). This full redemption of our body is the full sonship. Our spirit has been born of God, but our body has not yet been brought into sonship. The entire universe is eagerly expecting the final part of our redemption. The creation wants to see all the sons of God brought into glory to enjoy their full sonship.<p>All the sons of God will be brought into this glory. Then as the glorified sons of God, we shall shine with the glory of God. This is the full salvation for all who believe in Christ. Everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus will eventually become a glorified son of God bearing the righteousness of God outwardly, being saturated with the holiness of God inwardly, and shining in the realm of His full glory as one of His sons. The day of our glorification will be the time of the revelation of the sons of God (Rom. 8:19). At that time we shall enter into the freedom of the glory of God. We shall enjoy full liberation and shine with God&#8217;s glory. In this glory God will be expressed in a full way. This will be the ultimate issue of the dispensing of the Triune God.<h2 class=head2>3. Partakers of the Divine Nature</h2><p>After being saved, the believers are also partakers of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). A partaker is different from a receiver. We have not only received the divine nature-we also partake of the divine nature. To partake of God&#8217;s nature is to enjoy it and participate in it. As believers, we not only possess the divine nature but also partake of it, enjoy it, and participate in it. As we are partakers of the food we eat daily, we are also partakers of the divine nature. Through regeneration God has uplifted us to such a high level that we are now partakers of the divine nature.<p>To be a partaker of the divine nature is to be a partaker of the elements, the ingredients, of God&#8217;s being. When we partake of God, the aspects of what God is become our enjoyment. This is to enjoy the constituents of the divine nature.<h2 class=head3>a. Enjoying the Riches of the Divine Nature through God&#8217;s Precious and Exceedingly Great Promises</h2><p>As partakers of the divine nature, we are now enjoying the riches of God&#8217;s nature. The divine nature refers to the riches of what God is. The riches of divinity are wrapped up with the divine nature. Whatever God is, is in His nature. Therefore, when we partake of the divine nature, we partake of the divine riches. Having received the divine life at the time of our regeneration, we must now go on to enjoy what God is in His nature.<p>We enjoy the riches of the divine nature through God&#8217;s precious and exceedingly great promises. These promises usher us into the enjoyment of the divine nature. Second Peter 1:4 says, &#8220;He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises, that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust.&#8221; Through the precious and exceedingly great promises given by God, we, the believers in Christ, who is our God and Savior, have become partakers of His divine nature in an organic union with Him. We have entered into this union through faith and baptism (John 3:15; Gal. 3:27; Matt. 28:19).<p>To partake of the divine nature is to enjoy what God is. In order that we may enjoy all that He is, God will do many things for us according to His precious, exceedingly great promises. This will enable us to enjoy His nature, to enjoy what He is. One of God&#8217;s precious and exceedingly great promises is that His grace is sufficient for us (2 Cor. 12:9). God&#8217;s sufficient grace will work within us day by day so that we may enjoy His nature.<p>There is a difference between the divine life and the divine nature. The divine nature is what God is. We enjoy the divine nature by living the divine life, and we live the divine life by God&#8217;s promises. We need to live by the divine life so that we may be partakers of the divine nature. We receive the divine life simply by believing, and the divine nature is the substance of the divine life. Although we received the divine life at the time we believed, the divine nature must be continually enjoyed by us. To have eternal life is a matter once for all, but to partake of the divine nature is a continual matter. Although we have the divine life once for all, we cannot enjoy the divine nature once for all. During the entire course of our Christian life on earth and even in eternity, we shall be partaking of the divine nature.<h2 class=head3>b. Having Escaped the Corruption Which Is in the World by Lust</h2><p>In 2 Peter 1:4 we also see that becoming a partaker of the divine nature has a condition. This condition is that we escape the corruption which is in the world by lust. The corruption of today&#8217;s world is in conflict with our enjoying God&#8217;s nature. Lust is a barrier that keeps us from enjoying the divine nature. Christ died to redeem us from the vain manner of life (1 Pet. 1:18-19), and now we should abstain from fleshly lusts (1 Pet. 2:11) and no longer live in the flesh in the lusts of men (1 Pet. 4:2). As redeemed ones, we should abstain from lusts. This is to escape the corruption that is in the world through lust.<p>God has given us promises that He will work in us to enable us to partake of the divine nature. This is God&#8217;s operation. But God&#8217;s operation requires our cooperation, and our cooperation is to abstain from a lustful life and thereby escape the corruption which is in the world by lust. Having escaped this corruption, we are ready to become partakers of the divine nature. From this we see that escaping the corruption in the world qualifies us to partake of the divine nature.<p>The more we escape the corruption which is in the world by lust, the more we shall enjoy the divine nature. Likewise, the more we partake of the divine nature, the more we shall escape the corruption that is in the world by lust. This is a cycle-a cycle of escaping and partaking and of partaking and escaping. If this cycle works within us in a strong, rapid way, it will be difficult for us to take in any of the corruption of the world. The divine nature will strengthen us to stay away from corruption. Then the more we stay away from the corruption of the world, the more we shall enjoy the riches of the divine nature.<p>As we partake of the divine nature, enjoying all that God is, the riches of the divine nature will be fully developed, as described in 2 Peter 1:5-7. Having escaped the corruption of lust in the world, the barrier to the growth of the divine life in us, we are freed to become partakers of the divine nature, enjoying its riches in its development to the fullest extent by the virtue of God unto His glory (2 Pet. 1:3). This is the experience of God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED ONE</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR STATUS</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><p>We have seen that in their status after being saved the believers are children of God, sons of God, and partakers of the divine nature. In this message we shall consider the believers&#8217; status as heirs of God.<h2 class=head2>4. Heirs of God</h2><p>Galatians 4:7 says, &#8220;You are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, an heir also through God.&#8221; Here an heir is one who is of full age according to the law (the Roman law is used by Paul for illustration) and who is qualified to inherit the father&#8217;s estate. The New Testament believers become heirs of God not through the law or through their fleshly father but through God, even the Triune God-the Father who sent forth the Son and the Spirit (Gal. 4:4, 6), the Son who accomplished redemption for sonship (v. 5), and the Spirit who carries out the sonship within us (v. 6).<p>The New Testament speaks of the believers as children of God, sons of God, and heirs of God. Being children of God is our initial, or primary, relationship with God. We may be children without the growth of a son, or we may be sons without the qualification of an heir. Therefore, we need to grow in order to become sons of God. Then we need further growth, growth to maturity, in order to be heirs of God. As heirs we shall inherit the divine inheritance.<h2 class=head3>a. Joint Heirs of Christ</h2><p>Christ is the Heir of all things (Heb. 1:2), and the believers are destined to be joint heirs of Christ. Romans 8:17 says, &#8220;If children, heirs also; heirs of God and joint heirs of Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.&#8221; The thought in this verse progresses from children to heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs of Christ. However, we should not think that simply because we are children of God we are also joint heirs of Christ. Children cannot be legal heirs. In order to become legal heirs, children must grow into sons, and the sons must grow into heirs. When we reach the stage of growth of being joint heirs of Christ, we shall be glorified.<p>Apart from believing in Christ, there is no condition imposed for us to be the children of God. As long as the Spirit witnesses with our spirit (Rom. 8:16), we may have the assurance that we are children of God. However, for us to progress from children of God to joint heirs of Christ there is a condition, and this condition is that we suffer with Christ that we may be glorified with Him. Genuine growth in the divine life requires suffering. The more we suffer with Christ, the more we grow and the faster we are matured to be joint heirs of Christ.<h2 class=head3>b. According to the Promise</h2><p>Galatians 3:29 reveals that the believers are heirs according to the promise given by God to Abraham: &#8220;If you are Christ&#8217;s, then you are Abraham&#8217;s seed, heirs according to promise.&#8221; Abraham&#8217;s seed is only one, Christ (Gal. 3:16). Hence, to be Abraham&#8217;s seed we must be Christ&#8217;s, a part of Christ. Because we are one with Christ, we are also Abraham&#8217;s seed, heirs according to promise, inheriting God&#8217;s promised blessing, which is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God to be our portion. In God&#8217;s New Testament economy, the believers as God&#8217;s chosen people, being sons of God, are such heirs, not under law but in Christ. However, the Judaizers who remained under law and kept themselves apart from Christ were, like Ishmael (Gal. 4:23), Abraham&#8217;s descendants according to flesh, not, like Isaac (Gal. 4:28), his heirs according to promise. The believers in Christ are such heirs, inheriting the promised blessing.<p>Galatians 3 reveals that God intended to give the promise to Abraham according to His eternal purpose. Before this promise was accomplished, the law was given to serve as the custodian of God&#8217;s chosen people. Then, at the appointed time, Christ, the promised seed, came to fulfill God&#8217;s promise to Abraham. When Christ came, the fulfillment of God&#8217;s promised blessing also came. Now we are in Christ, the One who has fulfilled the promise, to inherit the fulfilled promise and to enjoy the blessing of the promise to Abraham. This blessing is the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head3>c. According to the Hope of Eternal Life</h2><p>Titus 3:7b says that the believers are &#8220;heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&#8221; In this verse we see that the believers are not only sons but also heirs who are qualified to inherit the Father&#8217;s estate (Rom. 4:14; 8:17; Gal. 3:29; 4:7). We were born of God (John 1:12-13) with His eternal life (John 3:16). This eternal life is for us not only to live and enjoy God in this age, but also to inherit all the riches of what He is to us in the coming age and in eternity. Moreover, eternal life implies hope. With temporal life there is no true hope, but with eternal life there is hope. Because eternal life is forever and cannot be terminated, it gives us hope. Hence, there is the hope of eternal life. God&#8217;s eternal life is our enjoyment today and our hope tomorrow.<p>We need to realize that our being heirs is according to the hope of eternal life. Eternal life is the divine life, the uncreated life of God. It is not only everlasting, lasting forever, with respect to time, but in its nature it is also eternal and divine. The eternal life of God is given to all believers in Christ (1 Tim. 1:16) and is the main element of the divine grace given to us (Rom. 5:17, 21). This life has conquered death (Acts 2:24) and will swallow up death (2 Cor. 5:4). Eternal life and its consequent incorruption have been brought to light and made visible to men through the preaching of the gospel (2 Tim. 1:10). Furthermore, eternal life is not only for us to partake of and enjoy today, but also for us to inherit (Matt. 19:29) in its full extent for eternity. Today&#8217;s experience of eternal life qualifies us to inherit it in the future. Its enjoyment today is a foretaste; the full taste will be the inheritance of it in the coming age and in eternity, which is the hope of eternal life. This is the blessed hope revealed in Titus 2:13, which is composed of the freedom of the glory of full sonship, the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:21-25), the salvation to be revealed in the last time (1 Pet. 1:5), and the living hope of the incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading inheritance reserved in heaven (1 Pet. 1:3-4). This is the full, spiritual, divine, and heavenly blessing and enjoyment of eternal life, both in the millennium and in the new heaven and new earth (2 Pet. 1:11; 3:13; Rev. 21:6-7), referred to in 1 Tim. 4:8. According to this hope, we become heirs of God to inherit all His riches for eternity. This is the climax as the eternal goal of God&#8217;s eternal salvation with His eternal life given to us by grace in Christ.<h2 class=head3>d. Through Justification by the Grace of Christ</h2><p>The believers are heirs of God through justification by the grace of Christ (Titus 3:7a). To be justified (Rom. 3:24; Gal. 2:16) is to be approved by God according to His standard of righteousness. God can approve us in this way because our justification is based on the redemption of Christ. Redemption is the basis of justification. When the redemption of Christ is applied to us, we are justified.<p>Titus 3:7a tells us that we are justified by the grace of Christ. The grace of Christ is not merely His unmerited favor. The grace of Christ is actually Christ Himself as life and everything dispensed into us for our enjoyment. This grace is the transmission of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ into us. This grace plays the most important role in the economy of God&#8217;s salvation. When we received the grace of Christ, we were justified to become heirs of God.<h2 class=head3>e. Through Regeneration in the Resurrection of Christ</h2><p>The believers have become heirs of God through regeneration in the resurrection of Christ. &#8220;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead&#8221; (1 Pet. 1:3). Regeneration, like redemption and justification, is an aspect of God&#8217;s full salvation. Redemption and justification solve our problem with God and reconcile us to God. Regeneration enlivens us with God&#8217;s life and brings us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with God. Hence, regeneration issues and results in a living hope. Such regeneration takes place through the resurrection of Christ from among the dead. When Christ was resurrected, we, His believers, were all included in Him. Thus, we were resurrected with Him (Eph. 2:6). In His resurrection He imparted the divine life into us and made us the same as He is in life and nature. This is the basic factor of our regeneration to become heirs of God.<p>To be regenerated is to receive another life, the divine life, in addition to the human life. We all received the human life from our parents. But because of God&#8217;s choosing, the Spirit&#8217;s sanctifying, and Christ&#8217;s redeeming (1 Pet. 1:2), God begets us, regenerates us. As a result, we have a second birth. Through regeneration God the Father imparts the divine life into us. Therefore, the first birth was the birth of our human life, and the second birth, the birth of the divine life. We all have been born of the divine life. This is what it means to be regenerated.<p>Once a person has been born on earth, he has the right to enjoy an earthly inheritance. In the same principle, once a person has been born again by God with His Spirit, that one is born unto a living hope, and this living hope is the inheritance (1 Pet. 1:4) of all the spiritual and heavenly blessings related to eternal life. Daily we need to take possession of this inheritance and enjoy it.<h2 class=head3>f. To Inherit the Triune God as Their Inheritance with the Holy Spirit as the Pledge</h2><p>Through regeneration in the resurrection of Christ we have become heirs to inherit the Triune God as our inheritance with the Holy Spirit as the pledge. The &#8220;Holy Spirit of the promise&#8221; is the &#8220;pledge of our inheritance, unto the redemption of the acquired possession&#8221; (Eph. 1:13b-14). God is our inheritance. We shall inherit all that God is and has. For such an inheritance the Holy Spirit is the pledge, the guarantee. The Greek word for &#8220;pledge&#8221; in verse 14 also means foretaste, guarantee, a partial payment in advance. God gives His Holy Spirit to us not only as a guarantee of our inheritance, securing our heritage, but also as a foretaste of what we shall inherit of God.<p>In ancient times the Greek word for pledge was used in the purchase of land. The seller gave the buyer a sample of the soil from the land being purchased. Hence, according to ancient Greek usage, a pledge was also a sample. As a pledge, the Holy Spirit is the sample of what we shall inherit of the Triune God.<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that our inheritance is the Triune God Himself, not a heavenly mansion in a city of golden streets and pearly gates. The pledge of our inheritance is the Holy Spirit. But God would not give the Spirit to us as a pledge for a heavenly mansion, for in such a case the pledge would not match the inheritance. A material mansion would not need the divine person of the Spirit as a pledge, sample, foretaste, and guarantee. Since the pledge of our inheritance is a divine person, the inheritance must also be a divine person-the Triune God Himself. The Triune God is the inheritance God intends to give to us, and the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God reaching us is the pledge of this inheritance. As the pledge of our inheritance, the Spirit guarantees that the Triune God will be our portion for our enjoyment. This is the Triune God as our inheritance.<p>Furthermore, Ephesians 1:14 says that the Spirit is the pledge of our inheritance unto the redemption of the acquired possession. We, God&#8217;s redeemed ones, the church, are God&#8217;s possession acquired by His purchase with the precious blood of Christ (Acts 20:28). In God&#8217;s economy God becomes our inheritance, and we become God&#8217;s possession. As God&#8217;s possession, we still need the redemption of our body, for our body is still in the old creation. One day we, God&#8217;s possession, will be redeemed in our body. The Triune God has put His Spirit into us as a pledge of Himself as our inheritance unto, or with a view to, the day when, as God&#8217;s acquired possession, we shall be redeemed into His glory for Him to enjoy us. On the one hand, the Triune God is our inheritance; on the other hand, we are His possession. The crucial matter in Ephesians 1:14 is that the Spirit is pledged into us as a guarantee that God will be our inheritance in full. Eventually, we shall be redeemed to be God&#8217;s possession in glory. Then, in the glory, we shall enjoy God as our inheritance, and He will enjoy us as His possession.<p>Our inheritance is not anything material. The divine Trinity is our inheritance, and His consummated Spirit has been imparted into our being as a pledge. Now this pledge is working within us to redeem God&#8217;s possession until the day we enjoy Him as our portion and He enjoys us as His possession.<h2 class=head3>g. To Share with All the Saints in the Light the Triune God Embodied in Christ as Their Portion</h2><p>In their status as heirs of God, the believers share with all the saints in the light the Triune God embodied in Christ as their portion. Acts 26:18 speaks of the forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Christ. We have not only the forgiveness of sins on the negative side but also an inheritance on the positive side. This divine inheritance is the Triune God with all He has, all He has done, and all He will do for His redeemed people. This Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ (Col. 2:9), who is the portion allotted to the saints as their inheritance (Col. 1:12). The Holy Spirit is the pledge, the guarantee, of this divine inheritance, which we are sharing and enjoying today as a foretaste and will share and enjoy in full in the coming age and for eternity (1 Pet. 1:4).<p>Believers are generally taught that the inheritance in Acts 26:18 is a heavenly mansion. But this inheritance is actually Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God. This Christ is the portion of the saints. In Colossians 1:12 Paul says that the Father has qualified us &#8220;for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.&#8221; This portion is the &#8220;lot,&#8221; the inheritance, of the saints. The inheritance is a lot, and this lot is a portion.<p>In the Old Testament the tribes of Israel each received an allotment, a portion, of the good land for an inheritance. The good land is a type of the all-inclusive Christ given to us as our inheritance. The Greek word rendered &#8220;portion&#8221; in Colossians 1:12 can also be rendered &#8220;lot,&#8221; referring to an allotment. When Paul was writing this verse, he no doubt had in mind the picture of the allotting of the good land to the children of Israel (Josh. 14:1) and used the word portion with the Old Testament record of the land as the background. God gave the children of Israel the good land for their inheritance. In Colossians Christ is revealed as our portion, our lot. Just as the land of Canaan was everything to the children of Israel, so Christ, the reality of the type of the good land, is everything to us. Therefore, Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, is our inheritance, which we share with all the saints in the light.<h2 class=head3>h. To Be Glorified with Christ</h2><p>As heirs of God, the believers will also be glorified with Christ (Rom. 8:17b). Christ is now in glory. Eventually we shall be brought into glory and be glorified with Christ. When we are glorified, the body of our humiliation will be transfigured into a glorious body (Phil. 3:21). At that time we shall be completely and absolutely brought into God Himself as our glory. Then we shall appear with Christ in glory (Col. 3:4).<p>Some of us may hold strictly an objective concept of glorification. According to this concept, those who have been saved and regenerated will suddenly be glorified. Supposedly, the glorification of the believers will take place instantaneously at the coming of the Lord Jesus. But although our glorification may appear to be a sudden occurrence, it will actually be the consummation of a process of gradual growth and development in life. Through regeneration the life of glory has come into us, and now we have a seed of glory within us. The life that we have within us as a seed is the life of glory. This is Christ in us, the hope of glory (Col. 1:27). Eventually, this seed will blossom, and thereby we shall be brought into glory. It will be like the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus (Matt. 17:1-2). When the Lord was transfigured on the mountaintop, it was not that the shekinah glory suddenly came upon Him from the heavens; it was that the divine glory shone from within Him. Likewise, the glory into which we shall be brought is the out-shining of the very glory that is within us right now. This means that Christ is not leading us into some objective glory but into the very glory that has been sown into us as a seed. Therefore, to be glorified means to have the glory that has been sown into us as a seed saturate our whole being. When we have been permeated and saturated with the element of glory, that glory will come out of us. This is what it means for us, the heirs of God, to be glorified with Christ.<h2 class=head3>i. To Inherit an Inheritance Kept in the Heavens as a Living Hope</h2><p>First Peter 1:3 tells us that through the resurrection of Christ we have been regenerated unto a living hope. Then verse 4 goes on to say, &#8220;Unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you.&#8221; At the end of verse 3 there is a comma, and verse 4 begins with &#8220;unto.&#8221; This indicates that &#8220;unto an inheritance&#8221; in verse 4 is in apposition to &#8220;unto a living hope&#8221; in verse 3. This means that the living hope is the inheritance and that the inheritance is the living hope. A living hope, resulting from regeneration, is our expectation of the coming blessing; an inheritance is the fulfillment of our hope in the coming age and in eternity.<p>A living hope is a hope of life. In particular, it is a hope of eternal life. Eternal life is our enjoyment and also our inheritance. All the riches of God&#8217;s being are involved in His life. These riches have become our inheritance in the heavenly bank. Our daily experience of eternal life is also an experience and enjoyment of the inheritance kept for us in the heavens. This indicates that the living hope and the inheritance are one.<p>The inheritance in 1 Peter 1:4 comprises the coming salvation of our souls (vv. 5, 9), the grace to be revealed at the unveiling of the Lord (v. 13), the glory to be revealed (1 Pet. 5:1), the unfading crown of glory (1 Pet. 5:4), and the eternal glory (1 Pet. 5:10). All these items of our eternal inheritance are related to the divine life which we received through regeneration and which we are experiencing and enjoying throughout our entire Christian life. &#8220;This inheritance is the full possession of that which was promised to Abraham and all believers (Gen. 12:3; see Gal. 3:6ff.), an inheritance, as much higher than that which fell to the children of Israel in the possession of Canaan, as the sonship of the regenerate, who have already received the promise of the Spirit through faith as a pledge of their inheritance, is higher than the sonship of Israel: compare Gal. 3:18, 29; 1 Cor. 6:9; Eph. 5:5; Heb. 9:15&#8221;-Wiesinger, quoted by Alford.<p>Through our second birth, regeneration, we have been born into a new inheritance. According to 1 Peter 1:4, this inheritance is not on earth; rather, it is kept in the heavens. Although this inheritance is kept for us in the heavens, we can enjoy it now on earth. Our heavenly, divine, spiritual inheritance is kept in the heavens; yet it is continually being transmitted into our spirit for our enjoyment.<h2 class=head4>(1) Incorruptible</h2><p>In verse 4 Peter uses three words to describe our inheritance: incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading. I believe that this threefold description points to the Trinity. The word &#8220;incorruptible&#8221; refers to the nature of this inheritance. This is God&#8217;s nature, signified by gold. Here incorruptible refers to the substance, which is indestructible, not decaying. In contrast to any earthly inheritance, our heavenly inheritance is incorruptible, for it is not material. Anything material or physical is corruptible. But our inheritance kept in the heavens is divine and spiritual, altogether incorruptible.<h2 class=head4>(2) Undefiled</h2><p>&#8220;Undefiled&#8221; describes the condition of the inheritance and refers to its purity, to its being unstained. This means that our inheritance cannot be defiled; nothing can make it unclean. This condition is related to the sanctifying Spirit.<h2 class=head4>(3) Unfading</h2><p>Finally, &#8220;unfading&#8221; refers to the beauty and glory of our inheritance; it speaks of its not withering. Because our inheritance is unfading, its beauty and glory cannot wither. Thus, &#8220;unfading&#8221; refers to the expression of the inheritance. This inheritance has unfading glory. First Peter 5:4 speaks of an unfading crown of glory. The everlasting expression indicated by the word &#8220;unfading&#8221; is the Son as the expression of the Father&#8217;s glory.<p>The three excellent qualities of our eternal inheritance in life-incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading-describe the Father&#8217;s incorruptible nature, the Spirit&#8217;s sanctifying power to maintain the inheritance in an undefiled position, to keep it holy, clean, and pure, and also the Son as the expression of the unfading glory. Therefore, the threefold description of our inheritance is also a description of the Triune God.<p>The Triune God Himself will be our basic inheritance. Related to Him as our inheritance we have five other matters: the coming salvation of our souls, the grace to be revealed at the Lord&#8217;s coming, the glory to be revealed to us, the unfading crown of glory, and the eternal glory. These five items, added together, are a subsidiary inheritance related to God Himself. Although these items are not the Triune God directly, they are related to the divine life, which is God Himself.<h2 class=head3>j. Consummating in Being Made God&#8217;s Inheritance</h2><p>As heirs of God, the believers are joint heirs of Christ according to the promise and the hope of eternal life, through justification by the grace of Christ and regeneration in the resurrection of Christ, to inherit the Triune God as their inheritance with the Holy Spirit as the pledge, to share with all the saints in the light the Triune God embodied in Christ as their portion, to be glorified with Christ, and to inherit an inheritance kept in the heavens as a living hope. This consummates in the believers being made God&#8217;s inheritance. Ephesians 1:11 says, &#8220;In whom also we were made an inheritance.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;were made an inheritance&#8221; means to choose or assign by lot. Hence, this clause literally means we were designated as a heritage. We were made an inheritance to inherit God&#8217;s inheritance. On the one hand, we were made God&#8217;s inheritance (Eph. 1:18) for God&#8217;s enjoyment; on the other hand, we were made to inherit God as our inheritance (Eph. 1:14) for our enjoyment. According to our natural being we are not worth anything, but in Christ we have been made God&#8217;s inheritance. It is by having the Triune God wrought into us that we are constituted into an inheritance. As God&#8217;s element is wrought into our being, we become His inheritance in reality. Therefore, we are still in the process of being made God&#8217;s inheritance in full.<h2 class=head4>(1) In the Saints</h2><p>Ephesians 1:18 indicates that God&#8217;s inheritance is in the saints. First God made us His inheritance as His acquired possession and gave us to participate in all He is, all He has, and all He has accomplished as our inheritance. Consummately, all these become His inheritance in the saints for eternity.<p>In Ephesians 1:18 the Greek word translated &#8220;in&#8221; may also be rendered &#8220;among.&#8221; God&#8217;s inheritance is in and among the saints. We, the saints, are God&#8217;s inheritance. However, what we are by nature cannot be God&#8217;s inheritance. God does not desire to inherit our nature, our flesh, our natural being. He desires to inherit all that He has wrought into us of Himself. Therefore, whatever God has wrought into us of Himself becomes His inheritance.<h2 class=head4>(2) With the Sealing of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>As those who are God&#8217;s inheritance, we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit (Eph. 1:13). To be sealed with the Holy Spirit means to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal. Because we have been made God&#8217;s inheritance, at the time we were saved God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God.<p>Actually the Spirit Himself is the seal. To be sealed with the Holy Spirit means that God has been dispensed into our being. Hence, this seal is living and moving within us, for the Spirit is constantly sealing us with God&#8217;s essence. To be sealed in this way is to be saturated with all that God is. Therefore, the sealing of the Holy Spirit also indicates that God is being wrought into us. Through the sealing of the Spirit God is working His essence into our being that He may enjoy us, His acquired possession, as His inheritance.<h2 class=head4>(3) Full of the Riches of God&#8217;s Glory</h2><p>Ephesians 1:18 speaks of &#8220;the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints.&#8221; The riches of God&#8217;s glory are the many different items of His attributes, such as light, life, power, love, righteousness, and holiness, expressed in different degrees. Since glory is God&#8217;s expression, the riches of His glory are the riches of God&#8217;s expression.<p>It is God Himself within us who constitutes His inheritance among the saints. In this inheritance are the riches of God&#8217;s glory. If God is not wrought into us, we could not become His inheritance, His peculiar possession. The believers become precious to Him by being saturated with the divine essence. Only in this way can poor sinners become God&#8217;s special treasure. In this universe God is the only One who is precious. Now this precious God of matchless worth is working Himself into us to make us His glorious inheritance. When the New Jerusalem comes, we shall see that it will be altogether a valuable inheritance, shining with God&#8217;s glory. Therefore, the fact that the believers are becoming God&#8217;s glorious inheritance, a precious treasure to Him, indicates that He is working Himself into us.<p>After being saved, we are children of God, sons of God, partakers of the divine nature, and heirs of God. As heirs of God we enjoy Him as our inheritance, and we become His inheritance for His enjoyment. Therefore, our enjoyment of the divine inheritance consummates in our being made God&#8217;s inheritance. We enjoy God. Then our enjoyment of Him makes us His enjoyment.<p>Daily we enjoy God in the way of the Spirit&#8217;s pledging. God pledges Himself as the Spirit within us for our enjoyment, guaranteeing that we shall eventually have the full taste of the Triune God. This enjoyment of God as our inheritance is the dispensing of God into us. The result of this dispensing is that we become God&#8217;s inheritance for His enjoyment.<p>We need to understand not only doctrinally but also experientially that we have the Holy Spirit within us as the firstfruit of God for our enjoyment. This firstfruit is the foretaste, the guarantee, the pledge, that we shall enjoy God in full. Our continuous enjoyment of the Triune God will make us His inheritance. This means that first we inherit Him. Then as He is dispensed into us and constituted into us, we become His enjoyment. Eventually God will enjoy Himself in our constitution.<p>We thank the Lord for bringing us deep into the truth concerning the believers as heirs of God. Through redemption, justification, and regeneration God has put Himself into us to be our inheritance. Now we enjoy Him in the way of a pledge. Daily we participate in Him, and He dispenses Himself into our being. Eventually we shall be saturated with Him and constituted of Him as our inheritance. This enjoyment and constitution will make us His inheritance. Therefore, we are God&#8217;s inheritance not in ourselves or by ourselves but by His being our inheritance. Then our enjoyment of Him will consummate in our being God&#8217;s inheritance for God to enjoy eternally. Ultimately, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place and also a mutual enjoyment. In the New Jerusalem we shall enjoy the Triune God as our eternal inheritance, and He will enjoy us as His eternal possession. This consummation will be the issue of God&#8217;s dispensing Himself into us and constituting us of Himself. His dispensing makes us His inheritance, and through the enjoyment of Him as our inheritance we become His inheritance.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWO</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR STATUS</h1><h1 class=msg>(4)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover further aspects of the believers&#8217; status after they are saved.<h2 class=head2>5. Priests of God</h2><p>It is a great matter that we, who once were sinners, sons of disobedience, children of wrath, children of the Devil, enemies of God, and sons of Gehenna, are now priests of God serving Him. As to our person, we are sons of God. As to our spiritual occupation, we are priests of God (Rev. 1:6; 5:10). Some of us may be teachers, doctors, or lawyers, but our real occupation is that of priests. In the Old Testament only certain men were priests, but in the New Testament all believers are priests.<p>When Peter received the revelation from the Father concerning the Lord Jesus, he said, &#8220;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&#8221; (Matt. 16:16). In His person the Lord Jesus is the Son of God, and in His work He is the Christ, the One anointed by God to carry out God&#8217;s commission. Even as the Lord Jesus is the Son of God in His person and the Christ of God in His work, we, the believers in Christ, are sons of God in our person and priests of God in our spiritual occupation. Since we are priests, we should be serving the Lord all day long in whatever we do.<p>In the Old Testament the highest ministry is the priestly ministry. This ministry came before the kingship and the prophethood. Actually, the highest ministry in the universe is the ministry of the priesthood. How marvelous, then, that we are sons of God to be priests of God!<h2 class=head3>a. Loosed from Their Sins by the Blood of Christ</h2><p>Revelation 1:5 tells us that Christ &#8220;has loosed us from our sins by His blood.&#8221; This indicates that, as priests of God, we have been loosed from our sins by the blood of Christ. In the past, our sins were holding us, but the blood of Christ has released us. Because the blood of Christ has defeated sins, we have been released.<p>The word &#8220;loosed&#8221; in Revelation 1:5 implies a fight or a struggle. This fight was caused by the fact that Satan was using our sins to hold us. But in this matter Satan has been defeated by the redeeming blood of Christ, the blood that loosed us, released us, from the hold of our sins.<p>The redemption through Christ&#8217;s blood has made us priests to Him (1 Pet. 2:5), those who express God&#8217;s image. This is the kingly, royal priesthood (1 Pet. 2:9) for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s original purpose in creating man (Gen. 1:26-28). This kingly priesthood is being exercised in today&#8217;s church life (Rev. 5:10). It will be intensively practiced in the millennial kingdom (Rev. 20:6), and it will be ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 22:3, 5).<h2 class=head3>b. Purchased to God by the Blood of Christ</h2><p>Revelation 5:9 says, &#8220;You were slain and did purchase to God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation.&#8221; Here we see that, in order to make us priests (v. 10), the Lord Jesus purchased us to God by His blood. On the negative side, the blood of Christ has released us from the usurpation of Satan; on the positive side, His blood has purchased us back to God to be His possession. As those purchased to God by the blood of Christ, we are now priests of God.<h2 class=head3>c. In the Resurrection Life</h2><p>Revelation 20:6 indicates that being a priest is a matter in resurrection. In His resurrection and with His divine life Christ has made us living priests to serve God. Therefore, it is in resurrection life that we are God&#8217;s priests.<h2 class=head2>6. Slaves of God</h2><p>The believers are also slaves of God. Romans 6:22 says that we have been &#8220;enslaved to God.&#8221; First Peter 2:16 says, &#8220;As free, and not having freedom as a cloak for evil, but as slaves of God.&#8221; One aspect of our status as believers is that we are priests of God; another aspect is that we are slaves of God. We should be happy to be both priests and slaves. Actually, the Greek word rendered &#8220;slaves&#8221; in 1 Peter 2:16 means bondslaves. A bondslave, according to ancient custom and law, was one who was purchased by his master and over whom his master had absolute rights, even to the extent of terminating his life. As believers we are such bondslaves of God.<h2 class=head3>a. Freed from All Bondage</h2><p>As slaves of God we have been freed from all bondage. However, we should not use our freedom as an excuse to behave in a careless manner. On the contrary, we should use our freedom as slaves of God. Although we are freed from the law of Moses, we are still under the law of Christ. As those under the law of Christ, we are slaves of God. On the one hand, we are free; on the other hand, we are slaves of God under His control.<h2 class=head3>b. Freed from Sin</h2><p>Before we were saved, we were slaves of sin (Rom. 6:17, 20). But now we are freed from sin. Romans 6:22 says, &#8220;Having been freed from sin and having been enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.&#8221;<h2 class=head3>c. Bought with a Price</h2><p>First Corinthians 6:20 says, &#8220;You were bought with a price.&#8221; This price is the precious blood of Christ (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 1:18-19). As fallen human beings, we were in a dreadful situation before we experienced Christ&#8217;s redemption: we were merchandise up for sale in Satan&#8217;s marketplace. But Christ came to purchase us, to redeem us. He paid a very high price to buy us-the price of His precious blood. The blood that bought us was extraordinary blood-the blood of the God-man, Jesus Christ. Only the precious blood of Christ was qualified and sufficient to redeem us, to purchase us. The highest price has been paid for our redemption so that we might now be slaves of God.<h2 class=head2>7. Brothers of Christ as the Firstborn Son of God</h2><p>The believers are brothers of Christ as the firstborn Son of God. Romans 8:29 speaks of Christ as &#8220;the Firstborn among many brothers.&#8221; From eternity Christ was the only begotten Son of God (John 1:18; 3:16; Heb. 1:8, 10-12; 7:3). As the only begotten Son, Christ is unique. However, in resurrection the only begotten Son became the Firstborn. This means that Christ&#8217;s resurrection was His birth as God&#8217;s firstborn Son. Acts 13:33 indicates that to the man Jesus resurrection was a birth. He was begotten by God in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God among many brothers. Although He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity, after incarnation, in which He put on humanity, and through resurrection He was begotten by God in His humanity to be God&#8217;s firstborn Son. He needed to be begotten in resurrection because He had put on humanity. As to His divinity there was no need for Him to be begotten as the Son of God. But as to His humanity there was the need for this. On the day of Christ&#8217;s resurrection His human nature was uplifted and transfigured into a glorious substance. In this way Jesus was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God.<p>Romans 8:29 speaks of Christ as the Firstborn and refers to us, the believers, as the many brothers. It is a wonderful fact that the Firstborn has many brothers. Today Christ is not merely the only begotten Son but also the firstborn Son, and we are His brothers. As the Firstborn Christ has both humanity and divinity, and as His brothers we have both divinity and humanity. Through regeneration we have the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4). Although we are human beings, we now have the divine nature. Although the Lord Jesus is divine, He has the human nature. Therefore, both the Lord Jesus and we are the same in that both He and we have the human nature and the divine nature.<p>However, we are not, and we never shall be, the same as Christ with respect to His deity. Deity refers to His Godhead, whereas divinity refers to His divine being. According to His deity, Christ is still the only begotten Son of God. We, His brothers, participate in His divinity, but we can never partake of His deity. It would be heresy to say that we can partake of Christ&#8217;s deity. As His brothers, we partake of the divine nature, and this is to partake of divinity. Christ is the Firstborn with divinity and humanity, and we are His many brothers with humanity and divinity.<h2 class=head3>a. Predestinated to Be Conformed to the Image of God&#8217;s Son</h2><p>Romans 8:29 says, &#8220;Whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;predestinated&#8221; can also be translated &#8220;marked out beforehand.&#8221; Marking out beforehand is the process, whereas predestination is the purpose to determine a destiny beforehand. Before the foundation of the world, God marked us out to a certain destiny-being conformed to the image of His Son. Concerning this conformation, the model or prototype is not the only begotten Son, who only has divinity, not humanity, but the firstborn Son, who has both divinity and humanity. We have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son.<p>God&#8217;s purpose is to produce many brothers of His firstborn Son for His corporate expression. The Firstborn is the prototype, and we are the mass production. Christ is the model, the mold, the pattern. God has put us into Him so that we may be molded into His image. Eventually, we shall all be conformed to the mold. This is even higher than transformation. Transformation is inward, a matter of essence, but conformation is outward, a matter of form. Christ has a form, and we need to be conformed to it. In this process we are conformed to the image of Christ.<p>To be conformed to the image of the Firstborn is to be saved from self-likeness, saved from the expression or appearance of the self. This means that to be saved from self-likeness is to be made a son of God and a brother of Christ in reality. Because in many respects we do not yet look like sons of God, we still need to be saved from self-likeness in order to bear the appearance of brothers of Christ.<p>Being conformed to the image of the Firstborn depends on the divine life we received through regeneration. Every kind of life has four basic features: the life-essence, the life-power, the life-law, and the life-shape. Conformation denotes the shaping of life. As the divine life grows within us and transforms us, it spontaneously shapes us into the image of the firstborn Son of God. However, some of us may try to shape ourselves into the likeness of Christ. Such self-effort never works. Concerning this only one thing is prevailing-the divine life that grows in us, sanctifies us, transforms us, and shapes us. There is no need for us to shape ourselves, to perform, or to strive to improve our behavior. What we need is a fuller experience of the divine life with its essence, power, law, and shape.<p>As those who are undergoing the process of transformation, we are being shaped gradually into the image of the Son of God by the function of the all-inclusive, divine life. By growth and transformation we are being conformed to the image of Christ. Eventually, we shall be completely conformed to His image. Through the shaping function of the divine life we, Christ&#8217;s brothers, shall be fully conformed to His image.<h2 class=head3>b. Born through the Resurrection of Christ</h2><p>The believers as brothers of Christ were born through the resurrection of Christ. This means that resurrection was a birth both for Christ as the Firstborn and for us as His brothers. As the Son of God, Christ has passed through two births. The first birth took place at His incarnation, and the second, in His resurrection. In the first birth He was born as a son of man. After living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, Christ was crucified. Then in the second birth in resurrection He was born as the firstborn Son of God. It was in Christ&#8217;s second birth that we were born to be His brothers. When Christ was resurrected, we were resurrected with Him and in Him. Through His resurrection He was born as the firstborn Son, and we also were born as God&#8217;s many sons and Christ&#8217;s many brothers with Christ and in Him. Therefore, the resurrection of Christ was a universal birth, for in that birth He was born as the Firstborn and we also were born into the divine sonship to be His brothers.<p>First Peter 1:3 reveals that we were regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead. We were regenerated when Christ was resurrected. Since His resurrection was our regeneration, we were regenerated before we were born. This means that before we became part of the old creation, we were already part of the new creation through Christ&#8217;s resurrection. Now we are the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God in His resurrection. God is our Father, and the Firstborn is our Brother.<p>Now we can see the significance of the Lord&#8217;s word to Mary in John 20:17: &#8220;Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.&#8221; Prior to His resurrection, the Lord Jesus never called His disciples brothers. The most intimate term the Lord used to call His disciples was &#8220;friends&#8221; (John 15:14-15). But after His resurrection He began to call them brothers, for through His resurrection His disciples had been regenerated with the divine life released by His life-imparting death, as indicated in John 12:24. It was through His resurrection that the Lord imparted Himself as the Spirit into His disciples. By receiving His life they were reborn, regenerated, and became His brothers, having the same life as the Lord. Hence, in His resurrection the only begotten Son became the Firstborn among many brothers, those who have been regenerated through His resurrection with the divine life released by His life-imparting death.<p>Furthermore, Christ&#8217;s many brothers, as the many sons of the Father, are the church (Heb. 2:10-12) to be a corporate expression of God the Father in the Son. Therefore, the many brothers are the propagation of the Father&#8217;s life and the multiplication of the Son in the divine life for the corporate expression of God the Father in the Son. This is God&#8217;s ultimate intention.<h2 class=head3>c. The Firstborn Son of God as He Who Sanctifies and They, the Many Sons of God, as Those Who Are Being Sanctified, All Being Out of One Father, for Which Cause He Is Not Ashamed to Call Them Brothers</h2><p>Hebrews 2:11 says, &#8220;He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers.&#8221; &#8220;He who sanctifies&#8221; is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and &#8220;those who are being sanctified&#8221; are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God. Both the Firstborn and the many sons are born of the same Father God in resurrection. Both the Firstborn and the many sons are the same in the divine life and nature. Hence, He is not ashamed to call them brothers.<p>The One who sanctifies us is not the only begotten Son of God but the firstborn Son of God. The firstborn Son can sanctify us because He, like us, has two natures. Our Sanctifier has the human nature as well as the divine nature. Because He and we are of the same two natures, He can sanctify us. Only when the firstborn Son was produced could the Sanctifier come into His office to do His sanctifying work. For this, He had to pass through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, glorification, and exaltation. After passing through this process, He became the firstborn Son of God to be our Sanctifier. Now He is qualified to be our Sanctifier, and we are qualified to be the sanctified ones.<p>Hebrews 2:11 says that the Sanctifier and the ones being sanctified are all &#8220;of one.&#8221; Literally, the Greek means &#8220;out of one.&#8221; This indicates that He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all out of one Father, for all have been born of the same Father in resurrection. Because He and we are born of the same Father, we are His brothers. We and He have come out of the same source, and we share with Him the same life and nature. In this life and nature we are now under His sanctifying work to transform us from being natural and to conform us to His image that we may be glorified with the glory of God.<p>Hebrews 2:11 also says that Christ, the firstborn Son, is not ashamed to call us brothers. Through His resurrection we received the Father&#8217;s life. Now because both the Firstborn and the many sons of God are of the same source and have the same life and nature, He is not ashamed to call us brothers.<h2 class=head3>d. The Firstborn Son of God Declaring the Father&#8217;s Name to His Brothers, Considering Them the Church, and Singing Hymns of Praise unto the Father in Their Midst</h2><p>Hebrews 2:12, a quotation from Psalm 22:22, says, &#8220;I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise unto You.&#8221; This indicates that the firstborn Son of God declared the Father&#8217;s name to His brothers, considering them the church and singing hymns of praise unto the Father in their midst. The firstborn Son declared the Father&#8217;s name to His brothers after He resurrected from the dead and met with the Father&#8217;s sons (John 20:17, 19-23).<p>Because the Father is the source of life and nature, to declare the name of the Father is to show the many brothers the source of life and nature. Although the Jewish people in ancient times knew God as the Creator, they did not know Him as the Father who begets. Before Christ&#8217;s resurrection, not even His disciples knew the Father&#8217;s life and begetting ability. Therefore, on the day of resurrection the Lord Jesus came to them to declare the Father that they might know the Father as the source of life. This declaration was not simply a matter of mentioning the Father&#8217;s name. Rather, it was an impartation of all that the Father is-His life, nature, and being-into the disciples. Now to us, Christ&#8217;s brothers, God is no longer merely the creating God; He is also the begetting Father. He has begotten us, imparting His life, nature, and being into us. This is what it means for the firstborn Son of God to declare the Father&#8217;s name to His brothers.<p>Hebrews 2:12 also indicates that the firstborn Son of God regards His brothers as the church. In this verse we see three crucial elements: the brothers, the church, and what the Lord is doing today in the church. This verse is a great revelation of what the church is and of what the Lord is doing in the church.<p>According to Hebrews 2:12, the church is a corporate composition of the brothers of the firstborn Son of God. We have emphasized the fact that the firstborn Son has humanity as well as divinity and that His many brothers have divinity as well as humanity. The fact that the church is a composition of the brothers of the firstborn Son of God indicates that the church is both human and divine. This means that the church has two natures-the human nature and the divine nature. The church also has two lives-the human life and the divine life. These lives are not only combined but also mingled. Therefore, the church is an organism with two natures and two lives combined and mingled. The church is altogether of life, the divine life and the uplifted, resurrected human life. This is the church as a living composition of all the brothers of the firstborn Son of God.<p>Hebrews 2:12 also reveals what the resurrected Christ is doing in the church today: He is singing hymns of praise unto the Father in the midst of the church. Throughout the centuries the firstborn Son has been singing hymns of praise unto the Father in the church. He does this in all His brothers. Because He is in us, He sings praises unto the Father in our singing. When we sing, He sings because He is within our singing. When we sing hymns to the Father from our spirit, Christ sings with us in spirit.<p>The church is one corporate Body with the firstborn Son of God. In the meetings of the church the firstborn Son, who dwells in His many brothers who compose the church, sings praise to the Father from within them. The more we sing praise to the Father, the more the Lord sings in our singing. He has made the Father known to us as the source of life. Now in the church meetings He is waiting for the opportunity to cooperate with us in singing hymns of praise to the Father. The best way for us to give Him this cooperation is to exercise our spirit and sing praise to the Father. The more we sing, the more we shall enjoy His singing. The more we praise the Father in the church meetings, the more He will praise the Father in our praising, and the more we shall enjoy Him and gain Him.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THREE</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR STATUS</h1><h1 class=msg>(5)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover more aspects of the believers&#8217; status after being saved.<h2 class=head2>8. Members of Christ as the Head of the Body</h2><p>We have seen that we are brothers of Christ as the firstborn Son of God. Now we need to see that we are members of Christ as the Head of the Body. In 1 Corinthians 6:15 Paul asks, &#8220;Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?&#8221; Because we are organically united with Christ and because Christ dwells in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22) and makes His home in our heart (Eph. 3:17), our entire being, including our purified body, becomes a member of Him. To practice such membership we need to offer our body to Him (Rom. 12:1, 4-5).<p>First Corinthians 6:17 indicates that we are organically united with Christ. To be one spirit with the Lord is to enter into an organic union with Him, to be united with Him organically. This organic union makes it possible for our bodies to be the members of Christ. Christ indwells our spirit, and from our spirit He spreads throughout our entire being, thereby making His home in our heart. Furthermore, according to Romans 8:11, from our inner being He seeks to impart Himself as life into our physical body. Therefore, Christ spreads from the spirit to the soul and from the soul to the body. In this way our bodies become His members.<h2 class=head3>a. Produced Out of Him to Be His Parts</h2><p>As members of Christ, we are produced out of Him to be His parts (Eph. 5:30-32). In Ephesians 5:30 Paul says that we are members of Christ&#8217;s Body. This indicates that we are members of Christ, parts of Christ. According to our natural constitution, we cannot be members of Christ&#8217;s Body. Christ Himself is the element, the factor, that makes us parts of Him. Hence, in order to be parts of Christ as members of His Body, we must have Christ wrought into our being.<p>In Ephesians 5:31 and 32 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh. This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.&#8221; Christ and the church being one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17), as typified by the husband and wife being one flesh, are the great mystery. The first couple in the Bible, Adam and Eve, present a picture of this. According to the book of Genesis, God did not create man and woman at the same time and in the same way. First God formed man&#8217;s body from the dust of the ground. Then He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul (Gen. 2:7). Later, in order to produce a counterpart for Adam, &#8220;the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam&#8221; (Gen. 2:21). While Adam slept, the Lord took one of Adam&#8217;s ribs and used it for the building of a woman (Gen. 2:22, lit.). In life, nature, and form the woman was the same as the man. Therefore, when God brought the woman to Adam, Adam exclaimed that she was &#8220;bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh&#8221; (Gen. 2:23).<p>Because there was no counterpart for Christ in the created universe, God caused Christ to die on the cross. As He &#8220;slept&#8221; there, His side was opened, and blood and water came forth (John 19:34). Because in Genesis 2 the problem of sin had not come in, that chapter mentions only the rib that was taken out of Adam; it says nothing about blood. But John 19 speaks of blood, which solves the problem of sin. The water signifies the flowing life of Christ, the eternal life, which produces the church. This life is also typified by the rib. According to John 19, not one of the Lord&#8217;s bones was broken when He was on the cross. This was a fulfillment of the Scripture which said, &#8220;Not a bone of Him shall be broken&#8221; (see Psa. 34:20). The unbroken bone of Christ signifies Christ&#8217;s unbreakable eternal life. Hence, Adam&#8217;s rib typifies the unbreakable eternal life of Christ. It is with this eternal life that we are produced out of Christ to be His parts. The fact that Eve had the same life and nature as Adam signifies that, as members of Christ, we have the same life and nature Christ has. Furthermore, together Adam and Eve made a complete unit. In the same principle, Christ and the church make a complete unit. The church is Christ&#8217;s other half. Adam and Eve became one flesh, but Christ and the church are one spirit.<p>In the Body there is no place for our natural life and fallen human nature. The human life and nature are not adequate to match Christ. In order to be members of Christ as the Head of the Body, we need to be one with Christ in life and nature. Therefore, as portrayed in the type of Adam and Eve, we have been produced out of Christ to be His parts. In ourselves we are not members of Christ. It is the element of Christ in us that makes us His members. Hence, a member of Christ is a person produced with the element of Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit. If we see this, we shall realize that only that which comes out of Christ can be recognized by Christ. Only that which is produced out of Christ can be part of Him.<h2 class=head3>b. Composed and Tempered Together by God to Be His Body</h2><p>As members of Christ produced out of Him to be His parts, we are composed and tempered together by God to be Christ&#8217;s Body (1 Cor. 12:24-27; Rom. 12:5). In 1 Corinthians 12:27 Paul declares, &#8220;You are the body of Christ, and members in particular.&#8221; In verse 24 he says, &#8220;God has tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked.&#8221; Literally, the Greek word translated &#8220;tempered&#8221; here means blended; hence, mixed, compounded, adjusted. God has blended all the different members of Christ together into one Body. For this we need much transformation (Rom. 12:2) by the Spirit.<p>It is not easy to be blended together in the Body. Nevertheless, in the Body we are blended, tempered, with many others. Furthermore, the Body is both local and universal. If we think that we have been tempered quite well with the saints in our locality, the Lord may bring someone from another part of the world to test how much we have been tempered. In the church believers of many races and nationalities meet together and experience the blending, the mixing, the compounding. Such a tempering of all the different members of Christ together in the Body requires a great deal of transformation. For the practical Body life we need to be transformed by the Spirit from the natural life to the spiritual life.<p>In writing chapter twelve of 1 Corinthians Paul was wise. After speaking of the indispensability of each member (vv. 14-22), he speaks of the tempering of the members (vv. 23-27). After speaking of those members who despise themselves (vv. 15-16), he says, &#8220;The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you&#8221; (v. 21). For the eye to say that it does not need the hand is pride. For the foot to say, &#8220;Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body&#8221; (v. 15), is self-made humility. First, Paul deals with those who are humble, then with those who are proud. Both are wrong, and both need tempering. Thus, God has tempered the Body, uplifting the low ones and lowering the high ones. He causes the humble to be proud and the proud to be humble. As the Body is tempered together, eventually the lower ones will be tempered to be somewhat higher, and the higher ones will be tempered to be somewhat lower. Those who are higher need to come down to the level of the low ones, and the low ones need to learn to be uplifted. This is the tempering of the Body, the real practice of the Body life. In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul was tempering the Body. This tempering is the secret of the practical Body life. When this takes place, we all shall function, and the Body will come into existence in a practical way.<p>For the practical Body life we all need to be tempered. Those who do not function must learn to function, and those who function more than they should must learn not to function too much. All the members need to function. Instead of being either proud or humble, we need to be tempered so that we may have the actuality and practicality of the Body seen in the functioning of all the members.<p>Romans 12:4 and 5 say, &#8220;As in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another.&#8221; The many members of the one Body have different functions. If we realize this, we shall not think too highly of ourselves but will respect others.<p>Romans 12:5 reveals that though we are many, yet we are one Body. We are many members, not many separate units. As members we need to coordinate with each other so that we may be a living, functioning Body. If we do not cooperate with each other, we are detached members, and the Body life cannot be realized in a practical way.<p>Romans 12:5 tells us that we are &#8220;severally members one of another.&#8221; The word &#8220;severally&#8221; does not mean separately; it means differently. It means that you are one kind of member and that I am another kind. Severally we are members one of another, composed and tempered together by God to be the Body of Christ.<p>The divine life within us has the inclination to be joined with other members of the Body, the more the better, and to be tempered together with them. This life, the life of Christ, which is the divine life, is the life of the Body of Christ. This life connects us to all the believers and causes us to love them, no matter what their race or nationality may be. Not to love the other members of the Body is contrary to the law of the life of the Body. Because of the inclination of the divine life within us to be joined and tempered, in Christ we, who are of many races and nationalities, are composed together by God to be the Body of Christ.<p>This tempering took place during Paul&#8217;s time. In the church at Corinth there were Jews, Greeks, and Romans, all of whom were tempered together to be the one Body. Furthermore, when Paul wrote to the Colossians, he said that in the new man &#8220;there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all&#8221; (3:11). In the new man there is room only for Christ. He is all the members and is in all the members. Actually He is the new man, His Body (1 Cor. 12:12). For this to be expressed in a practical way, all the members need God&#8217;s tempering. As members of Christ, we have been produced out of Him, and we are being composed and tempered together by God to be the Body.<h2 class=head2>9. Partners of Christ as God&#8217;s Anointed</h2><p>The believers are also partners of Christ as God&#8217;s Anointed. Hebrews 3:14 says, &#8220;We have become partners of the Christ.&#8221; Christ is the Firstborn, and we are His brothers. Christ is the Head of the Body, and we are His members. Christ is the anointed One, and we are His partners. Christ has been anointed by God to carry out God&#8217;s commission. Now as Christ&#8217;s partners we share with Him in carrying out God&#8217;s commission.<p>God has a great &#8220;corporation&#8221; in the universe, and this corporation is a partnership. God&#8217;s operation in His corporation is to work out a glorious expression of Himself. The Son of God has been appointed to carry out God&#8217;s plan and to head God&#8217;s corporation, which is a corporation of glory. As partners of Christ in God&#8217;s corporation, we do the same &#8220;business&#8221; and have the same interest and concern.<p>The Greek word for &#8220;partners&#8221; in Hebrews 3:14, metochos, is the same word for &#8220;partakers&#8221; in Hebrews 3:1; 6:4; and 12:8. In those three places it means that we share in the heavenly calling, the Holy Spirit, and the discipline; so we use the word partakers. In Hebrews 3:14 and 1:9 the meaning is that we share with Christ; so we use the word partners. We are partakers of heavenly, holy, and spiritual things, sharing in the heavenly calling, the Holy Spirit, and the spiritual discipline. We are partners of Christ, sharing with Him the spiritual anointing as the members share with the Head the Spirit, and sharing with Him the heavenly rest as Caleb shared with Joshua the rest of the good land (Num. 14:30).<p>A partaker is very different from a partner. We are partakers of food; that is, we are those who enjoy food. But we may be partners of a corporation; that is, we may be joint-owners of that corporation. The King James Version made a big mistake in Hebrews 3:14, translating it as &#8220;partakers of Christ.&#8221; According to the context, here the Greek word should be rendered partners, not partakers. The portion from 3:7 through 3:14 deals with entering the good land. The type of this entering the good land was the entering of the land under the leadership of Joshua. Joshua was the leader, and Caleb was his partner, comrade, companion, in possessing the good land. Today Christ is the real Joshua, and we are His Calebs. In this matter we are not Christ&#8217;s partakers; we are His partners. When we enjoy Christ, we are His partakers. When we follow Him, we are His partners. As His partners, we are working together with Him and cooperating with Him to fulfill God&#8217;s desire to have a corporate expression of Himself. We are Christ&#8217;s partners in this enterprise. Our being partakers of Christ is for the purpose of being His partners in the divine corporation.<h2 class=head3>a. In God&#8217;s Anointing with the Oil of Exultant Joy</h2><p>We are partners of Christ as God&#8217;s Anointed in God&#8217;s anointing with the oil of exultant joy. Hebrews 1:9 says that God has anointed Christ with the oil of exultant joy above His partners. Here we see again that in God&#8217;s economy Christ is God&#8217;s appointed One to accomplish God&#8217;s plan, and we are Christ&#8217;s partners in the divine interest. He was anointed by God, and we share with Him in this anointing for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose.<p>Christ was appointed by God in eternity past and anointed in time. God the Spirit poured Himself out as the anointing oil upon Christ, the appointed One, anointing Him to be the operator of God&#8217;s corporation. As the partners of Christ, we are partners in His anointing. Christ&#8217;s being anointed by God was His initial heavenly, divine inauguration. In this inauguration we are His partners. He has obtained the anointing, and we share it with Him because we are His partners. Therefore, we are not only partakers of Christ enjoying Him but also partners of Christ sharing in His operation under God&#8217;s anointing. The Holy Spirit is the oil with which God anointed Christ and also us, the partners of Christ.<h2 class=head3>b. By Holding Fast the Beginning of the Assurance Firm to the End</h2><p>Hebrews 3:14 tells us that we are partners of Christ by holding fast the beginning of the assurance firm to the end. We must hold fast what we have believed from the beginning and have no doubt concerning it. If we hold fast the beginning of the assurance firm to the end, we shall keep ourselves in the partnership with Christ.<h2 class=head2>10. Slaves of Christ</h2><p>The believers are also slaves of Christ. &#8220;He who was called in the Lord when a slave is the Lord&#8217;s freedman; likewise, he who was called when free is Christ&#8217;s slave&#8221; (1 Cor. 7:22). The Lord&#8217;s calling does not change the outward status of His believers, but it does change their inward reality. A slave outwardly is changed to a freedman inwardly, and a freedman outwardly is changed to a slave inwardly. Inwardly we all are Christ&#8217;s slaves.<h2 class=head3>a. Purchased with a Price</h2><p>As slaves of Christ, we have been purchased with a price. Paul tells us, &#8220;You were bought with a price&#8221; (1 Cor. 7:23). This price is the precious blood of Christ (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 1:18-19; Rev. 5:9).<h2 class=head3>b. Doing the Will of God from the Soul</h2><p>In Ephesians 6:6 Paul says, &#8220;Not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul.&#8221; Here &#8220;from the soul&#8221; equals from the heart. This means to serve not only with the physical body but with the heart. We need to do the will of God from the soul, from the depths of our being. All believers should be such slaves of Christ.<h2 class=head2>11. Priests of Christ</h2><p>The believers are not only priests of God (Rev. 1:6; 5:10) but also priests of Christ. &#8220;They shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years&#8221; (Rev. 20:6b). As priests of Christ they will bring man in his need to Christ and minister Christ to man.<h2 class=head3>a. In the Resurrection Life</h2><p>It is in the resurrection life that the believers are priests of Christ serving Him. Revelation 20:6a says, &#8220;Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection: over these the second death has no authority.&#8221; This indicates that the believers serve Christ as priests in resurrection life.<h2 class=head3>b. To Match Their Co-kingship with Christ</h2><p>Revelation 20:6b speaks of the believers reigning with Christ a thousand years. This refers to the overcoming believers as co-kings with Christ to reign over the nations in the millennium (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5). Therefore, the believers&#8217; being priests of Christ matches their co-kingship with Christ. In other words, if we are not priests, we cannot be kings with Christ. Only when we are priests of Christ can we be His co-kings.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR STATUS</h1><h1 class=msg>(6)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover the three remaining aspects of the believers&#8217; status after being saved: co-kings of Christ, partakers of the Holy Spirit, and heavenly citizens.<h2 class=head2>12. Co-kings of Christ</h2><p>We have seen that the believers are priests of Christ. Now we need to see that they are also co-kings of Christ. Those believers who live in the reality of the kingdom in this age will be co-kings with Christ in the millennium.<h2 class=head3>a. In Resurrection</h2><p>It is in resurrection that the believers are co-kings of Christ. Speaking of the overcoming believers, Revelation 20:4c says, &#8220;They lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.&#8221; Here the word &#8220;lived&#8221; means that they were resurrected.<p>Revelation 20:6 says, &#8220;Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection: over these the second death has no authority; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years.&#8221; The first resurrection here is the best resurrection. The Greek word translated &#8220;first&#8221; is the same word rendered &#8220;best&#8221; in Luke 15:22, where the father commanded that the best robe be put on the returned prodigal. Hence, the first resurrection in Revelation 20:6 may actually be translated &#8220;the best resurrection.&#8221; Those who are co-kings of Christ will enjoy this resurrection. The first resurrection is also the out-resurrection, for which Paul sought (Phil. 3:11). This is a resurrection that is set apart from the common resurrection; it is a resurrection with honor. This is a resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcoming believers. Hence, the first resurrection is also the resurrection of reward.<p>Revelation 20:6a says, &#8220;Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection.&#8221; This must be the highest blessing-to inherit the kingdom manifested on earth and even to be co-kings of Christ in it.<h2 class=head3>b. In the Consummation of Their Maturity in the Divine Life</h2><p>Being co-kings of Christ is in the consummation of the believers&#8217; maturity in the divine life. Until we reach maturity in the divine life we are like young princes, those who are too young to be kings. A king must be a matured person. Before a prince can be a king, he needs to grow and mature in the kingly life. Then he will be qualified to be a king. Likewise, we need to grow in the resurrection life. Eventually, this growth will reach the consummation of maturity in the divine life. Once we have reached this maturity we shall be qualified to be co-kings of Christ.<p>Second Timothy 2:12a says, &#8220;If we endure, we shall also reign with Him.&#8221; This verse implies being a co-king of Christ in the consummation of maturity in the divine life. If we endure in this age, we shall reign with Christ in the coming age.<h2 class=head3>c. Reigning Over the Nations and Shepherding Them on Earth</h2><p>Those who are co-kings of Christ will reign over the nations and shepherd them on earth. Revelation 2:26 and 27 say, &#8220;He who overcomes, and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations, and he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father.&#8221; Reigning with Christ over the nations is a prize to the overcoming believers. As they reign over the nations, they will shepherd them, for in the millennial kingdom the ruler is the shepherd.<p>In Psalm 2:9 God gave Christ authority to rule over the nations. Here in Revelation 2:26 and 27 Christ gives the same authority to the overcoming believers.<p>Two other verses that speak of the believers reigning over the nations on earth are Revelation 12:5 and 5:10. Revelation 12:5 says that the man-child will &#8220;shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.&#8221; This man-child signifies the stronger part of God&#8217;s people. The fact that the man-child will shepherd the nations with an iron rod indicates that the man-child consists of the overcoming believers, as mentioned in Revelation 2:26 and 27. Furthermore, Revelation 5:10 says that the believers will reign on the earth.<h2 class=head3>d. In the Millennial Kingdom</h2><p>It will be in the millennial kingdom that the believers will be co-kings of Christ. Revelation 20:4 and 6 both speak of the overcoming believers reigning with Christ &#8220;a thousand years,&#8221; referring to the coming age of the millennial kingdom.<h2 class=head2>13. Partakers of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Hebrews 6:4 reveals that the believers are partakers of the Holy Spirit. As such partakers, we share in the Holy Spirit and enjoy Him. The Holy Spirit is what God promised to give man in His gospel (Gal. 3:14). In His gospel God has called us from the heavens to the heavenly things that we may partake of His Holy Spirit. Now by the Holy Spirit we taste the heavenly gift, partake of the divine holiness, and live a heavenly life on earth. As partakers of the Holy Spirit, we partake of the Triune God as our enjoyment.<p>The book of Hebrews reveals that the all-inclusive Christ is superior to the angels, Moses, Aaron, and the old covenant. In our practical experience, however, this all-inclusive Christ is the Spirit. Hebrews does not tell us that we are partakers of the all-inclusive Christ, but that we are partakers of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God and also the reaching to us of the Triune God. This Spirit is much superior to the angels, Moses, and Aaron, and He is the reality of the new covenant, which is much superior to the old covenant. Now we are partakers of this Spirit. As partakers of the Spirit, we partake of and enjoy the processed Triune God with all His riches.<h2 class=head3>a. Having Been Enlightened</h2><p>Those who are partakers of the Holy Spirit have been enlightened by the Spirit. Hebrews 6:4 speaks first of being enlightened and then of becoming partakers of the Holy Spirit. In Luke 15:8 the Spirit is symbolized by the fine woman lighting a lamp, sweeping the house, and carefully seeking a lost silver coin until she finds it. As portrayed by the parable of the seeking woman, the Spirit works to enlighten us inwardly. Little by little, in a fine, careful way, the Spirit enlightens our inner being. Before we were saved, we were in the darkness of sin. Therefore, the Spirit came to enlighten us that we might wake up, repent, and turn to God. Having been enlightened by the Spirit, who is able to penetrate the depths of our being, we have become partakers of the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head3>b. Having Tasted of the Heavenly Gift</h2><p>Hebrews 6:4 tells us that we have also tasted of the heavenly gift. The heavenly gift includes the heavenly things given to us by God at the time of our salvation. This means that the heavenly gift is actually an aggregate of a number of items. The first of these items is forgiveness. Because God forgives us from the heavens, the forgiveness of sins is part of the heavenly gift. Other aspects of this gift are the washing of the blood, justification in Christ, reconciliation, and redemption. Regeneration is also a crucial aspect of the heavenly gift. Furthermore, this gift includes the divine life and sonship. The heavenly gift even includes the Holy Spirit.<p>As believers in Christ, we surely have tasted of the heavenly gift. For instance, we have tasted the sweetness of God&#8217;s forgiveness of our sins. We have also tasted the sweetness of Christ&#8217;s washing through His precious blood. Formerly, we were under the burden of our sins. But now that we have been washed in the blood of Christ we have been released. We also enjoy justification, reconciliation, redemption, regeneration, the divine life, and the divine sonship. Today we continue to enjoy these matters in our daily life. In addition to all this, we enjoy the Holy Spirit. As partakers of the Holy Spirit, we certainly have tasted of the heavenly gift.<h2 class=head3>c. Having Tasted the Good Word of God and the Works of Power of the Coming Age</h2><p>Hebrews 6:5 says that we &#8220;have tasted the good word of God, and the works of power of the coming age.&#8221; In Greek &#8220;word&#8221; here is rhema, the instant word of God. The good word of God in 6:5 refers to the word of the beginning of Christ mentioned in Hebrews 6:1, which is the milk the Hebrew believers tasted (Heb. 5:12-13) when they believed in the Lord. The good word of God as the word of the beginning of the Christ is elementary and includes repentance, faith in God, baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection, and eternal judgment, all of which are related to Christ&#8217;s earthly ministry. Without His earthly ministry we would have had no way to repent, receive baptism, lay hands on others, receive resurrection, or escape eternal judgment. Any word concerning Christ&#8217;s earthly ministry is the word of the beginning of the Christ in the primary stage. This is surely the good word because it is glad tidings, good news.<p>In particular, the good word of God is the good word of the gospel. The New Testament says that God loves the world, that Christ is our Savior, and that Christ died on the cross for our sins and even for us. These are good words. The New Testament also tells us that God is willing to forgive us and receive us. To be sure, these are good words. In the New Testament there are a great many verses that may be considered the good word of God tasted by us. When we read the Bible, often these verses become our enjoyment. As partakers of the Holy Spirit, we have tasted the good word of God.<p>According to Hebrews 6:5, we have even tasted &#8220;the works of power of the coming age.&#8221; We have been enlightened and we have tasted of the heavenly gift, the good word of God, and the works of power of the coming age. Here we have three kinds of tastes-of the heavenly gift, of the good word of God, and of the works of power. The enlightenment, the heavenly gift, and the good word of God belong to the present age, the age of grace. The works of power, which in the New Testament are synonymous with miracles, belong to the coming age, the age of the kingdom. Therefore, the enlightenment, the heavenly gift, and the good word of God are fully destined for us in this age, but the works of power of the coming age are not destined for us in this age of grace.<p>Miracles, works of power, and wonders and signs are not part of God&#8217;s central testimony of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ. Neither are they part of God&#8217;s full salvation. The Lord borrowed the miraculous things from the coming age to show that what the apostles preached and ministered and how they acted were absolutely of God, not of man (Acts 2:43; Heb. 2:3-4). God will not perform miraculous things all the time in this age of grace.<p>Between eternity past and eternity future there are basically three ages: the age of the old creation, the age of the new creation, and the age of restoration. From God&#8217;s creation of the heavens and the earth in Genesis 1:1 to the beginning of the age of grace is the time span of the age of the old creation. The age of grace is the age of the new creation. In the age of the old creation God created mankind and the entire universe. When what He created became fallen, He came in to restore it, that is, to recover and maintain it. In the age of grace God is doing neither a work of creation nor a work of restoration. Whereas the old creation is merely the creation without God in it, the new creation is the old creation born of God with God as its new element. Therefore, through the addition of the element of God the old creation becomes the new creation. Now the new creation, the believers born again of God, has the divine nature (John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet. 1:4). Therefore, the believers are a new creation (Gal. 6:15), not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life. The work of God in the age of grace is to produce the new creation. In the coming age, the millennium, God will neither create nor will He produce the new creation. Rather, through the works of power, He will do a work of restoring the old fallen creation.<p>In the age of God&#8217;s old creation God did the work of creation and also some work of restoration. The work of restoration involved miracles. It is crucial for us to see that miracles, works of power, do not belong to God&#8217;s new creation but to the restoration of God&#8217;s old creation. In New Testament times there were cases of healings. In the age of the kingdom all people will be healed miraculously. We must be clear, however, that no miracle belongs to God&#8217;s new creation. Therefore, we should not expect the Lord to perform miracles for His chosen people all the time during the age of grace. However, during the age of grace, the age of the new creation, for certain purposes the Lord may borrow the works of power from the coming age.<p>Basically, God does two kinds of work. One kind belongs to the spirit with the divine life, and another kind, which includes the works not of life but of power, involves miracles. Works of power are related to our physical body, not to our spirit. For instance, when the Lord Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, that was related to his body, not to his spirit, for Lazarus died again. During the Lord&#8217;s earthly ministry many were healed or raised from the dead, but eventually they all died. This is a strong proof that miracles do not have any relationship to our spirit. The work God is doing in this age is not in the physical realm but in the realm of our spirit. The majority of the New Testament writings are for God&#8217;s work in our spirit. Only a small percentage of the New Testament refers to God&#8217;s work in the physical realm. Whatever God works in the physical realm is a miracle. Whatever God does in the realm of our spirit is not miraculous but divine. We treasure this divine work. But we do not care much for the miraculous work, because that work belongs to God&#8217;s work of restoration in the coming age.<p>We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that God&#8217;s intention in His economy for us in this age is not to restore our body. Rather, God&#8217;s intention in this age of grace is to work on our spirit and soul. First, He regenerates our spirit. Then through our spirit He works to transform our soul. Eventually, at the coming of the next age, God will redeem, not heal, our body. Nevertheless, in His mercy and for His purpose, sometimes God borrows the works of power of the coming age and gives the believers a taste of them in this age.<p>The works of power of the coming age are related to the leaves of the tree of life. &#8220;The leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations&#8221; (Rev. 22:2b). The leaves of the tree of life symbolize the deeds of Christ. The regenerated believers eat the fruit of the tree of life, receiving Christ as their life and life supply inwardly, that they may enjoy the divine life. But the restored nations will be healed by the leaves of the tree of life, taking the deeds of Christ as their guide and regulation outwardly. Today the life of the tree of life is dispensed into our spirit and soul. Furthermore, this life may even be dispensed into our mortal bodies through the indwelling Spirit (Rom. 8:11).<p>Paul experienced such a dispensing. As the leading apostle, he had great faith and did many miracles. But when he himself had a thorn in the flesh and prayed three times for the Lord to remove it, the Lord did not heal him. Instead, He said to Paul, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you&#8221; (2 Cor. 12:9). Furthermore, although the Lord released Paul from imprisonment in Acts 16 and also from his first imprisonment in Rome, eventually the Lord did not do anything to rescue Paul from martyrdom. The reason for this is that the age of grace is not the time for the Lord to rescue our bodies from sickness and death. The Lord may do this on occasion, but He will not do it continually. But in the coming age a great many will be healed by the leaves of the tree of life. There will not be regeneration, but there will be an abundance of healing. Today, however, there is not much miraculous healing, but there is much experience of regeneration and transformation. Furthermore, most of the healing we experience comes from the indwelling Spirit giving life through our spirit and mind to our mortal bodies.<p>In Hebrews 6:4 and 5 we see that the believers enjoy three matters that are genuine blessings assigned to us for the new creation-enlightenment, the heavenly gift, and the good word of God. In addition, the believers may also taste the works of power of the coming age. As the result of being enlightened and tasting the heavenly gift, the good word of God, and the works of power of the coming age, the believers become partakers of the Holy Spirit. This means that the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit and the tasting of the heavenly gift, the good word of God, and the works of power of the coming age issue in our partaking of the Holy Spirit. Today we are not merely enlightened by the Holy Spirit and we do not merely partake of a heavenly gift, a good word, or a work of power, but we are partaking of and enjoying the Holy Spirit Himself. This is truly a great matter. As believers we are not only partakers of the divine nature-we are also partakers of the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head2>14. Heavenly Citizens</h2><p>Finally, in their status after being saved the believers are heavenly citizens. Paul says, &#8220;Our citizenship is in the heavens&#8221; (Phil. 3:20a). The Greek word rendered &#8220;citizenship&#8221; may also be rendered commonwealth or associations of life. Our national life is not in any earthly country; it is in the heavens. Our real citizenship, our true commonwealth, is in the heavens. Therefore, we are not earthly citizens or worldly citizens-we are heavenly citizens.<p>Because our citizenship is in the heavens, we should not be occupied with earthly things, with the physical things needed for our existence. We should not place such a high value on material things. This does not mean, of course, that we should not have proper food, clothing, housing, and transportation. We need these things. But if we love the earthly things needed for human life, this is an indication that we do not treasure our heavenly citizenship. We all need to remember that our citizenship is in the heavens and that we are a heavenly people sojourning on earth.<h2 class=head3>a. As Partakers of the Heavenly Calling</h2><p>The heavenly citizens are partakers of the heavenly calling (Heb. 3:1a). This heavenly calling is in contrast to the earthly calling. In God&#8217;s economy, in His full salvation, we have been called by God from the heavens and have been called to everything that is heavenly. Hence, this calling is a heavenly calling. Everything in it has a heavenly nature. We, the believers in Christ, are partakers of such a heavenly calling.<p>The heavenly calling first calls us to the heavenly Christ (Heb. 1:3, 13; 4:14; 6:20; 7:26; 9:24; 10:12). Christ was on earth and He will return to earth, but He is now in the heavens. He is the heavenly Christ ministering the heavenly life supply to us that we may live a heavenly life on earth.<p>As partakers of the heavenly calling, we have had our names enrolled in the heavens (Heb. 12:23). Today we are not in the heavens, but our names are written there. We also taste the heavenly gift (Heb. 6:4), have the heavenly worship (Heb. 8:5; 9:23-24), and come to the heavenly Jerusalem (Heb. 12:22). We have even been called to the heavenly country (Heb. 11:16). Moreover, we are partakers of the Holy Spirit (Heb. 6:4) and of the heavenly discipline (Heb. 12:8).<h2 class=head3>b. Born from Above</h2><p>The believers as heavenly citizens have been born from above. In John 3:3 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;anew&#8221; can also be rendered &#8220;from above.&#8221; We have not only had an earthly birth; we have also been born from above, from the heavens.<h2 class=head3>c. Seated in the Heavenlies in Christ Jesus</h2><p>Ephesians 2:6 tells us that God has &#8220;seated us together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.&#8221; The initial step of God&#8217;s salvation in life is to make us alive together with Christ (Eph. 2:5). The second step is to raise us up from the position of death (Eph. 2:6a). Then, as the third step of His salvation in life, God seats us together in the heavenlies in Christ. He not only raised us up from the position of death but also seated us in the highest place in the universe.<p>The word &#8220;heavenlies&#8221; is rather peculiar. It refers not only to a place but also to an atmosphere with a certain nature and characteristic. God&#8217;s salvation by life has brought us into a heavenly place and into a heavenly atmosphere with a heavenly characteristic. Because we are in a heavenly atmosphere with a heavenly nature and characteristic, we are a heavenly people. God&#8217;s salvation has transferred us into such a realm and atmosphere.<p>According to Ephesians 2:6, it was in Christ that God seated us all together, once for all, in the heavenlies. This was accomplished when Christ ascended to the heavens, and it was applied to us by the Spirit of Christ when we believed in Him. Today we realize and experience this reality in our spirit through faith in the accomplished fact.<h2 class=head3>d. Setting Their Mind on the Things Which Are Above, Not on the Things Which Are on the Earth</h2><p>Colossians 3:2 says, &#8220;Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth.&#8221; The things above refer to the various aspects of Christ in His heavenly ministry: His being crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 2:9), His being made Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36), His being Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22-23), and His being the Forerunner (Heb. 6:19-20), the High Priest (Heb. 8:1; 4:14; 7:25), the heavenly Minister (Heb. 8:1-2), and the Lamb on the throne executing the divine administration (Rev. 5:6). We need to set our mind on these things. This means that we need to forget earthly things-culture, religion, philosophy, and natural human virtues-and instead lift up our eyes to the heavens and set our mind on the wonderful, excellent things, the things that are above. These things can cause us to be transformed, for they transmit a heavenly element into us. Therefore, we need to open our spirit and our whole being to the heavens that the divine transmission may flow into us unceasingly. Then the riches of Christ in His heavenly ministry will be transmitted into us, and we shall be transformed and constituted of Christ.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR DESIGNATIONS</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>In this message we shall begin to cover the four designations of the believers given in the New Testament: disciples, believers, saints, and Christians.<h2 class=head1>A. DISCIPLES</h2><p>First, the believers are designated as disciples. The term &#8220;disciples&#8221; is often used in the Gospels and in Acts, but it is not used at all in the Epistles. Matthew 5:1 says, &#8220;Seeing the crowds, He went up into the mountain; and when He sat down, His disciples came to Him.&#8221; When Christ sat down on the mountain, His disciples, not the crowds, came to Him to be His audience. Eventually, not only the believing Jews but also the discipled nations became His disciples. In Matthew 5:1 and 2 the Lord Jesus taught the disciples, not the crowds. The crowds that gathered around Him were the outer circle, but His disciples were the inner circle. These disciples were Jewish believers. However, when they were on the mountain listening to the decree of the kingdom&#8217;s constitution, they were representatives not of the Jewish people but of the New Testament believers. In Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus told His disciples to go and disciple the nations, that is, the Gentiles. This means that the nations would be converted into disciples. Therefore, both the Jewish and Gentile believers are disciples. The audience on the mountain, composed mainly of Jews, represented all the disciples.<p>Three other verses that refer to the believers as disciples are Matthew 28:16; Acts 6:1; and 21:16. Matthew 28:16 says, &#8220;The eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus appointed them.&#8221; Acts 6:1 tells us that the disciples were multiplying, and 21:16 speaks of disciples from Caesarea. All these verses indicate that one designation of the believers is that of disciples.<h2 class=head2>1. Those Who Follow Christ</h2><p>Disciples are those who follow Christ. In His ministry the Lord Jesus told people to repent, for the kingdom of God has drawn near (Mark 1:15; Matt. 4:17). When some repented, or had an inclination to go with Him, He said to them, &#8220;Follow Me&#8221; (Matt. 4:19; 9:9; 19:21; Luke 9:59). As disciples, the believers follow the Lord Jesus.<h2 class=head2>2. Those Who Learn of Christ</h2><p>Disciples are also those who learn of Christ. In Matthew 11:29 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Take My yoke on you and learn from Me.&#8221; Discipline is required for both following Christ and learning of Him. We cannot follow Him or learn of Him without being disciplined. We especially need to be disciplined in order to learn of Christ.<h2 class=head1>B. BELIEVERS</h2><p>Many verses in the New Testament speak of the believers. Acts 5:14 says, &#8220;Believers were all the more being added to the Lord.&#8221; In 1 Timothy 6:2 Paul gives a charge to slaves whose masters are believers, and in 4:12 he charges Timothy to &#8220;be a pattern to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.&#8221;<p>In 2 Corinthians 6:14 Paul exhorts the Corinthian believers not to be &#8220;unequally yoked with unbelievers.&#8221; Then in the next verse he asks, &#8220;What part has a believer with an unbeliever?&#8221; The word &#8220;unequally&#8221; in verse 14 means diversely; it denotes a difference in kind. This refers to Deuteronomy 22:10, which forbids yoking together two different animals, the clean and the unclean. Today we, the believers, are the clean ones, whereas the unbelievers are unclean. Hence, believers and unbelievers are diverse peoples. They should not be yoked together, because of the believers&#8217; divine nature and holy standing.<p>In 2 Corinthians 6:14-16 Paul uses five illustrations to depict the difference between believers and unbelievers: no partnership, no share, between righteousness and lawlessness; no fellowship, no communion, between light and darkness; no harmony, no concord, between Christ and Belial; no part, no portion, held by a believer with an unbeliever; and no agreement, no consent, between the temple of God and idols. These illustrations also unveil the fact that the believers are righteousness, light, Christ, and the temple of God, and the unbelievers are lawlessness, darkness, Belial (Satan the Devil), and idols. We believers are of Christ, and the unbelievers are of Satan. If we have friendship with unbelievers, that means we are making harmony between Christ and Satan. A believer, however, does not have any part with an unbeliever.<h2 class=head2>1. Those Who Have Believed in Christ as the Son of God according to God&#8217;s New Testament Economy of the Faith</h2><p>The designation &#8220;believers&#8221; designates those who have believed in Christ as the Son of God according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy. This designation, of course, indicates the matter of believing. Anyone who does not have faith in Christ, who does not believe in Christ, is certainly not a believer.<p>Strictly speaking, in the New Testament we cannot find such expressions as &#8220;believe Jesus&#8221; or &#8220;believe in Jesus&#8221; or &#8220;believe Christ.&#8221; It is not accurate to say that we believe in Jesus or that we believe Jesus or Christ. We need to use a preposition after &#8220;believe&#8221; and say that we believe in Christ or on Christ. John 3:16 speaks of believing in the Son of God. Actually the Greek preposition here and in many other verses in the Gospel of John means &#8220;into&#8221; and signifies union with Christ by believing into Him.<p>When we believe in Christ, we believe in Him as the Son of God. Of course, Jesus Christ is also a man. However, the New Testament does not tell us to believe in Him as a man, but tells us to believe in Him as the Son of God. Everyone can easily realize that Jesus is a man. Therefore, we are not told to believe in Him as a man. But this man is the Son of God, and this we must believe. A believer is one who believes in Christ as the Son of God.<p>John 20:31 says, &#8220;These have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.&#8221; &#8220;Christ&#8221; is the title of the Lord Jesus according to His office, His mission. This title denotes His work to accomplish God&#8217;s purpose. &#8220;The Son of God&#8221; is the Lord&#8217;s title according to His person. His person is a matter of God&#8217;s life, and His mission is a matter of God&#8217;s work. He is the Son of God to be the Christ of God. He works for God by the life of God so that by believing in Him we may have the life of God to become children of God.<p>Because Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, we need to believe in Him as the Christ and as the Son of God. We must believe in Him as the One who is the divine person coming to carry out God&#8217;s commission for His eternal purpose. This is the One in whom we believe.<p>Our believing in Christ as the Son of God is according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy of the faith. First Timothy 1:4 speaks of &#8220;God&#8217;s dispensation which is in faith.&#8221; This dispensation is an economical administration. Hence, it refers to God&#8217;s economy. In Greek the words &#8220;God&#8217;s dispensation&#8221; also mean God&#8217;s household economy (Eph. 1:10; 3:9). This is God&#8217;s household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a house, a household, to express Himself, which household is the church, the Body of Christ (1 Tim. 3:15).<p>In 1 Timothy 1:4 Paul tells us that God&#8217;s dispensation, His economy, is in faith. The dispensing of the processed Triune God into us is altogether by faith. The dispensation of God is a matter in faith, that is, in the sphere and element of faith, in God through Christ. God&#8217;s economy to dispense Himself into His chosen people is not in the natural realm, nor in the work of law, but in the spiritual sphere of the new creation through regeneration by faith in Christ (Gal. 3:23-26). By faith we are born of God to be His sons, partaking of His life and nature to express Him. By faith we are put into Christ to become the members of His Body, sharing all that He is for His expression. This is the dispensing of the Triune God according to His New Testament economy, carried out in faith.<p>In the New Testament, faith has both an objective meaning and a subjective meaning. When used in an objective sense, faith denotes the object of our belief. Used in a subjective sense, faith denotes our action of believing. Therefore, faith refers both to the truths which we believe and to the act of our believing, that is, the action and function of our believing.<p>Faith in Ephesians 4:13 refers to those things which all Christians believe. We believe in the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. We believe that Christ, the Son of God, was incarnated, that He was crucified for our redemption, that He was resurrected from among the dead both physically and spiritually, that He has ascended to the right hand of God, and that He is coming again. Furthermore, we believe that the Bible is God&#8217;s Word, inspired by the Holy Spirit word by word. This is our faith, the &#8220;common faith&#8221; (Titus 1:4), &#8220;the faith once for all delivered to the saints&#8221; (Jude 3).<p>Subjective faith is not our natural ability or virtue. This faith is our reaction toward God, which results from God&#8217;s transfusing Himself into us and infusing His element into our being. When God&#8217;s element permeates us, we react to Him, and this reaction is faith. Therefore, faith is a reaction caused by the divine infusion, which permeates and saturates our being. Once we have such a faith, we can never lose it, for it has been infused into us and constituted into our being.<p>We need to be deeply impressed with the meaning of faith in the New Testament. First, faith is God being the word spoken to us. Through the word of God and by the Spirit of God we are infused with God in Christ. As a result, something rises up within us. This is faith. Faith then works in us to bring us into an organic union with the Triune God. Through this organic union God is continually transfused and infused into us. As a result, we have the divine life and the divine nature to become sons of God, members of Christ, and parts of the new man. As a totality we become the house of God, the Body of Christ, and the new man. This is God&#8217;s economy in faith.<p>Galatians 3:23 and 25 speak of the coming of faith. Verse 23 says, &#8220;Before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed.&#8221; This verse indicates clearly that there was a time when faith came and was revealed. Faith was not to be found in the Old Testament; it came with Jesus Christ. When Christ came, grace came, and faith came also. Faith has come to replace law. Thus, Galatians 3:25 says, &#8220;Faith having come, we are no longer under a child-conductor.&#8221; According to this verse, now that faith has come we are no longer under the law as our child-conductor. Faith and law cannot co-exist. Before faith came, we were under law. But now that faith has come and has been revealed, this faith replaces law. The law kept us and brought us to Christ, but now in our experience it should be replaced by faith. Faith characterizes those who believe in Christ and distinguishes them from those who keep the law (Acts 6:7; 1 Tim. 3:9). We are not keepers of law-we are believers in Christ.<p>Just as the law was the basic principle according to which God dealt with His people in the Old Testament, faith is the basic principle according to which He deals with people in the New Testament. All those who refuse to believe in Christ will perish, whereas those who believe in Him will be forgiven of their sins and receive eternal life. In John 16:9 we are told that the Spirit will convict the world concerning sin because of not believing in the Son of God. This indicates that the unique sin which causes people to perish is unbelief. God&#8217;s commandment to sinners is to believe in the Son of God.<p>In the New Testament faith has both a divine aspect and a human aspect. On God&#8217;s side the term &#8220;the faith&#8221; implies that God sent His Son to earth, that Christ died on the cross to accomplish redemption, that He was buried and was resurrected, that in resurrection He released the divine life and has become the life-giving Spirit-all that He might enter into those who believe in Him to be grace, life, power, and everything to them. On our side faith is related to hearing, appreciating, calling, receiving, accepting, joining, partaking, and enjoying. If we do not have faith, all that has been accomplished on God&#8217;s side will remain objective and will not be personally related to us. God&#8217;s economy to dispense Himself into us is in faith.<h2 class=head2>2. Those Who Have Received Christ as Their Generating Life for Them to Become the Children of God</h2><p>The believers are those who have received Christ as their generating life for them to become the children of God. Believing in Christ equals receiving Him. When we believe in Christ, we receive Him. We receive Him by believing in Him.<p>John 1:12 and 13 say, &#8220;As many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&#8221; Here we see that believing in the Lord Jesus is equal to receiving Him. If a person truly believes in the Lord&#8217;s name, in some way or other he will say, &#8220;Lord Jesus.&#8221; As long as we call on His name from the depths of our being, we believe in Him. If we believe in Him by calling on His name, this proves that we have received Him. Furthermore, since we have received Him, we have received the authority to become children of God. This authority is Christ Himself as the generating life that makes us children of God for His multiplication and expression.<p>We have emphasized the fact that to believe in the Lord Jesus is to receive Him. The Lord is receivable. He is now the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), with His complete redemption, waiting for and expecting us to receive Him. Our spirit is the receiving organ. We receive the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18) into our spirit by believing in Christ. Once we believe in Him, He, as the Spirit, enters into our spirit. Then we are regenerated by Him, the life-giving Spirit, and become one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17).<h2 class=head2>3. Those Who Have Believed into Christ as the Son of God to Have an Organic Union with Him</h2><p>The believers are those who have believed into Christ as the Son of God to have an organic union with Him. However, certain people believe Christ, but they do not believe in Christ. Genuine believers are those who believe in Christ, even into Christ. Those who merely believe Christ are not believers in the New Testament sense, for they take the Lord Jesus as a pattern, an example, a model, for them to imitate and follow to do certain works for the benefit of society. Because such people do not believe into Christ, they have not entered into the organic union with Christ. We, the genuine believers in Christ, have an organic union with Christ.<p>John 3:36 says, &#8220;He who believes in the Son has eternal life.&#8221; Literally translated, the phrase &#8220;believes in&#8221; in verse 36, as well as in verses 15, 16, and 18, should be &#8220;believes into.&#8221; When we believe in the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, we believe into Him. By believing in Him, we enter into Him to be one with Him organically, to partake of Him, and to participate in all that He has accomplished for us. By believing into Him, we are identified with Him in all that He is and in all that He has passed through, accomplished, attained, and obtained. As we become one with Christ by believing into Him, we are saved and regenerated by Him as life. Therefore, it is by believing into Him that we partake of Him as life and are regenerated in Him.<p>The Lord&#8217;s word in John 3:15, 16, 18, and 36 tells us clearly and definitely that the way for us to be regenerated is to believe in the Lord Jesus, even to believe into Him. To believe in the Lord is the only way for us to receive salvation and to experience regeneration. It is absolutely a matter of faith. No matter how much we can work or how good our work may be, we cannot be saved and regenerated by our work. Our work does not count in this matter. Only faith counts. Salvation and regeneration must be by faith. It is by faith in the Lord, by believing into Him, that we receive forgiveness, the release from God&#8217;s condemnation negatively. It is also by faith, by believing into the Lord, that we receive eternal life, the life of God, the divine life, positively for our regeneration. The Lord Jesus has accomplished the redemptive work for us. By His redemptive death on the cross, He has met all of God&#8217;s righteous demands on us and has fulfilled all the requirements of God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, and glory for us. By His death on the cross in the form of the serpent, the Lord has even destroyed Satan, the Devil who usurps us and enslaves us, so that we may be delivered from the evil one&#8217;s slavery and power of death (Heb. 2:14). All negative things have been solved by Christ&#8217;s all-inclusive death on the cross. Therefore, we do not need to do anything except believe in the Lord Jesus and in what He has accomplished. He has not left any room for our work. There is no need of our work, only of faith in Christ&#8217;s finished, completed, and all-inclusive redemptive work.<p>After passing through death, the Lord, by resurrection and in resurrection, has released His life and has become the life-giving Spirit. Now in resurrection He is the Spirit of life, with all the virtue of His redemptive work, waiting for us to believe into Him. Once we believe into Him, we receive not only the forgiveness of sins and the deliverance from Satan&#8217;s evil power of darkness but also the Spirit of life, that is, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, with the eternal life of God. In this way we are saved, regenerated, and enter into an organic union with Christ.<p>By believing into Christ as the Son of God we have an organic union with Him. When we believe in Him, we believe into Him and thereby become one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). This is what we mean by the expression &#8220;organic union.&#8221; By faith we are brought into an organic union with the Triune God. Now the Lord is seeking to develop this organic union, and He will cause it to be developed to the uttermost. The more this union is developed, the more we shall enjoy the dispensing of the Triune God.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIX</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR DESIGNATIONS</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>We have seen that in the New Testament the believers in Christ are designated disciples and believers. In this message we shall cover the two remaining designations of the believers in the New Testament-saints and Christians.<h2 class=head1>C. SAINTS</h2><p>Many verses in the New Testament speak of the believers as saints. Acts 9:13 and 32 refer respectively to the saints in Jerusalem and to &#8220;the saints dwelling at Lydda.&#8221; Romans 1:7 says, &#8220;To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints.&#8221; Romans 8:27 tells us that the Spirit &#8220;intercedes for the saints.&#8221; Romans 12:13 speaks of &#8220;communicating to the needs of the saints,&#8221; and 15:25, of the ministry to the saints. The word &#8220;saints&#8221; denotes those who are holy, separated unto God. We are not only believers in Christ-we are saints of God. We are God&#8217;s holy people, a people separated unto God for His purpose.<h2 class=head2>1. Those Who Have Been Separated and Made Holy unto God</h2><p>The term &#8220;saints&#8221; denotes those who have been separated and made holy unto God. Saints are separated ones, those who have been set apart to God. First Corinthians 1:2 says, &#8220;To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints.&#8221; The expression &#8220;called saints&#8221; indicates that the believers in Christ are the called saints; they are not called to be saints. This is a positional matter, a sanctification in position with a view to sanctification in disposition.<p>According to grammar, in 1 Corinthians 1:2 &#8220;to the church of God&#8221; is in apposition to &#8220;to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus.&#8221; This indicates that &#8220;to the church of God&#8221; equals &#8220;to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus.&#8221; This strongly indicates that the church is a composition of the saints and that the saints are the constituents of the church. The two should not be considered separate entities. Individually, we are the saints; corporately, we are the church.<p>Furthermore, in 1:2 &#8220;called saints&#8221; is in apposition to &#8220;those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus.&#8221; Instead of saying &#8220;called saints,&#8221; the King James Version says, &#8220;called to be saints.&#8221; According to this translation, being a saint is pending; it is not already an accomplished fact. But Paul did not say that we are called to be saints; he says that we are called saints. If we turn away from ourselves and look at Christ, in whom we have been sanctified, we shall be able to declare that we are saints. We shall realize that a saint is simply a called one.<p>To be called by God is to be separated unto Him. For example, those who have been called into military service have been separated from civilian life and drafted into the service. This illustrates God&#8217;s calling. When we were called by God we were separated by Him. As a result, we have been sanctified; that is, we have been separated unto God for the fulfillment of His purpose. Because we have been called by God unto His purpose, we are the called saints.<h2 class=head2>2. In Christ</h2><p>First Corinthians 1:2 tells us that we have been sanctified in Christ Jesus. To be sanctified in Christ Jesus is to be sanctified in the element and sphere of Christ. Christ is the element and sphere that separated us unto God, made us holy unto Him, when we believed in Him, that is, when we were brought into an organic union with Him through our faith in Him.<p>To be sanctified in Christ means that we have been put into Christ. Christ is a holy sphere, a sphere of holiness. Not only is Christ holy-Christ Himself is holiness. Because God has put us into this Christ (1 Cor. 1:30), we have been put into the sphere of holiness. Now that we are in Christ as the sphere of holiness, we are sanctified. To be sanctified in Christ is to be made holy in Him.<p>Holiness is actually God Himself, and God is embodied in Christ. Therefore, Christ is our holiness. As our holiness, He is the sphere and element of holiness. Through Christ&#8217;s redemption, God has put us into Christ. Now that we are in Christ, who is the sphere and element of holiness, we are sanctified, made holy.<p>What we have in 1 Corinthians 1:2 is a matter of being in Christ positionally. We should never despise our position in Christ. God has put us into Christ, and this makes it possible for us to experience the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity. Because we have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, we may have the boldness to declare that we are holy, that we are saints. Concerning this, we should not look at ourselves. God does not look at us as we are in ourselves; rather, He looks at us in Christ. Paul does not tell the Corinthians that they were sanctified in themselves, but that they had been sanctified in Christ Jesus. We need to forget ourselves and see that it is in Christ that we are sanctified.<h2 class=head2>3. By Christ with His Redeeming Blood Positionally</h2><p>As saints, we have been sanctified by Christ with His redeeming blood positionally. Hebrews 13:12 says, &#8220;Wherefore also Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.&#8221; Christ&#8217;s body suffered the death of the cross outside the gate, and His blood was brought into the Holy of Holies for our sanctification (v. 11). The book of Hebrews unveils that God&#8217;s heavenly calling is to make us a heavenly people (3:1), a people who are sanctified unto God. Christ is the Sanctifier (2:11). He suffered the death of the cross, shed His blood on it, and entered the Holy of Holies with His blood (9:12) that He might be able to do the sanctifying work by the heavenly ministry (8:2, 6) of His heavenly priesthood (7:26) and that we might enter &#8220;within the veil&#8221; (6:19) by His blood to participate in Him as the heavenly Sanctifier.<p>Christ&#8217;s redeeming blood sanctifies us positionally, not dispositionally. The reason the blood of Christ can sanctify us only positionally is that the blood is not able to accomplish anything in us with respect to the inner life. This is the work of the Holy Spirit with God&#8217;s holy nature to sanctify us dispositionally. The blood of Christ, however, can only separate us unto God, make us holy, positionally.<h2 class=head2>4. By the Holy Spirit with God&#8217;s Holy Nature Dispositionally</h2><p>As saints we are also being sanctified dispositionally by the Holy Spirit with God&#8217;s holy nature. The Holy Spirit is changing our disposition by causing it to be mingled with the holy disposition of God. This is subjective sanctification.<p>Sanctification is not only a matter of position, that is, to be separated from a common, worldly position to a position for God, as illustrated in Matthew 23:17 and 19 (where the gold is sanctified by the temple and the gift by the altar, in changing their position), and in 1 Timothy 4:3-5 (where food is sanctified by the saints&#8217; prayer). Sanctification is also a matter of disposition, that is, being transformed from a natural disposition to a spiritual one, as mentioned in Romans 12:2 and 2 Corinthians 3:18. This is a matter of a long process, beginning with regeneration (1 Pet. 1:2-3; Titus 3:5), passing through the whole Christian life (1 Thes. 4:3; Heb. 12:14; Eph. 5:26), and reaching completion at the time of rapture, at the maturity of life (1 Thes. 5:23).<p>Concerning subjective, dispositional sanctification, Romans 15:16 says that the believers are being &#8220;sanctified in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Christ died on the cross primarily for our justification. Now, in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit, He lives within us for our sanctification. As the life-giving Spirit, He is our life, and He is saturating our being with His holy nature so that we may be thoroughly sanctified dispositionally. This is the reason that in Romans sanctification is not positional by the blood but dispositional by life, even by the Spirit Himself. The Spirit is working within our spirit, spreading Himself from the center of our being throughout every part of us until He reaches the circumference. Then we shall be completely saturated with God&#8217;s holy nature. Eventually, our whole being will be sanctified by Christ as the life-giving Spirit.<p>To be put into Christ is a once-for-all matter, but to be sanctified by the Spirit is a life-long matter. At the very moment we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, believing in Him, we were put into Christ. In this way we are now sanctified in Christ. Because God has put us into Christ, the Spirit has entered into us and has become the sanctifying Spirit within us. Now this Spirit is sanctifying us all the time, and will continue to sanctify us during our entire life. Therefore, today we are still under the sanctifying work of the Spirit.<p>Another verse that speaks of dispositional sanctification is 2 Thessalonians 2:13: &#8220;God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit.&#8221; The salvation unto which we were chosen by God is salvation and sanctification of the Spirit. We are being saved in sanctification of the Spirit. While the Holy Spirit is sanctifying us, God is saving us. Therefore, we are being saved in sanctification of the Spirit. This sanctification of the Spirit is actually the divine transformation. By this we are thoroughly saved from all old and negative things and made a new creation to obtain the Lord&#8217;s glory.<p>The Spirit is in us to sanctify us with the divine element, which is the nature of God. In 1 Thessalonians 4:3 Paul speaks of sanctification, and this sanctification is of the Spirit. The indwelling of the Spirit is actually our sanctification. The Spirit indwells us with one goal-to sanctify us, to transform us, to change us metabolically. This is sanctification of the Spirit.<p>Every day we are being sanctified, and the One who sanctifies us is the Spirit. This is the reason the Bible speaks of the sanctification of the Spirit. All day long the Spirit is sanctifying us, applying to us what the Father has planned and what the Son has accomplished. The Spirit has been commissioned to sanctify us; He has been given to us for the purpose of completing the work of sanctification. As saints, we have such a practical, living, and subjective Sanctifier.<p>With sanctification the emphasis is on separation unto God for His purpose. Our sanctification began even before our repentance. When we heard the gospel, the Holy Spirit began to sanctify us, to separate us. Then we experienced regeneration, which is also a part of sanctification. After regeneration, we are in the process of being sanctified dispositionally. Eventually, we shall be glorified, and our glorification will be the final, the ultimate, sanctification. When we are glorified, we shall be fully separated unto God for His purpose.<p>Although with sanctification the emphasis is on being separated unto God, this does not mean that sanctification does not involve the divine dispensing. The dispositional aspect of sanctification especially involves God&#8217;s dispensing. For this reason, subjective sanctification, which is dispositional sanctification, is actually transformation. Through our experience we have come to realize that, as the sanctifying Spirit, the Spirit is dispensing His element into us. This dispensing of the Spirit is the sanctifying work of the Spirit. Therefore, the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit is to dispense His element and essence into our being to sanctify us dispositionally. As a result, we are fully saturated with the Triune God and wholly separated unto Him for His purpose.<h2 class=head1>D. CHRISTIANS</h2><h2 class=head2>1. Those Who Bear a Strong Testimony for Christ That Makes Them Distinct and Peculiar in the Eyes of the Unbelievers</h2><p>In the New Testament the believers are also designated as Christians. Acts 11:26 says, &#8220;The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.&#8221; In Acts 26:28 Agrippa says to Paul, &#8220;By a little talk are you persuading me to become a Christian?&#8221; In 11:26 &#8220;Christian&#8221; is a term of reproach. That the disciples in Antioch were given such a nickname as a term of reproach indicates that they must have borne a strong testimony for the Lord, a testimony that made them distinct and peculiar in the eyes of the unbelievers.<h2 class=head2>2. Those Who Are Adherents of Christ, Bearing His Reproach</h2><p>The designation &#8220;Christian&#8221; is used again in 1 Peter 4:16, where it denotes those who are adherents of Christ, bearing His reproach. The context of this verse concerns sharing the sufferings of Christ. Verse 14a says, &#8220;If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed.&#8221; &#8220;In the name of Christ&#8221; is actually in the person of Christ, in Christ Himself, because the name denotes the person. The believers, having believed into Christ (John 3:15) and having been baptized into His name (Acts 19:5), that is, into Himself (Gal. 3:27), are in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30) and one with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). When they are reproached in His name, they are reproached with Him, sharing His sufferings. After speaking of being reproached in the name of Christ, Peter goes on to say in 4:16 that if a believer suffers &#8220;as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name.&#8221;<p>The Greek word for Christian is Christianos, a word of Latin formation. The ending -ianos, denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire. Those who worshipped the emperor, the Caesar-Kaisar-were called Kaisarianos, which means the adherents of Kaisar, the people belonging to Kaisar. When people believed in Christ and became His followers, this caused some in the Empire to consider Christ a rival of the Kaisar. Then at Antioch some began to call the followers of Christ Christianos (Christians), adherents of Christ, as a nickname, a term of reproach. Hence, 1 Peter 4:16 says, &#8220;as a Christian, let him not be ashamed&#8221;; that is, if any believer suffers from the persecutors who contemptuously call him a Christian, he should not feel ashamed but glorify God in this name.<h2 class=head2>3. Those Who Are Men of Christ, Who Are One with Christ, Not Only Belonging to Him, but Also Having His Life and Nature in an Organic Union with Him, and Who Are Living by Him, Even Living Him, in Their Daily Life</h2><p>Whereas in the time of Peter and Paul Christian was a term of reproach, today it should bear a positive significance, that is, a man of Christ, one who is one with Christ, not only belonging to Him but having His life and nature in an organic union with Him, and who is living by Him, even living Him, in his daily life. If we suffer for being such a person, we should not feel ashamed, but be bold to magnify Christ in our confession by our holy and excellent manner of life to glorify, express, God in this name.<p>As Christians, we have an organic union with Christ, an organic oneness in life. When we believed in Christ, an organic union took place between us and Him. By believing in Christ we believed into Him and thereby became one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). This is what we mean by the expression organic union.<p>Our organic union with Christ also involves our being baptized into Christ (Gal. 3:27). God&#8217;s intention in His economy is to put us into Him and to come into us and live in us. Therefore, to be baptized into Christ is to enter into an organic union with the embodiment of the Triune God, which is able to transform our whole being.<p>In addition to believing into Christ, which is inward and subjective, we also need to be baptized into Him, an act which is outward and objective. We need both the inward action of believing and the outward action of being baptized. In this way we make one complete step to enter into Christ. In Galatians 3 Paul often speaks about faith and believing, but at the end of this chapter he speaks of being baptized into Christ. The step that begins with believing into Christ is completed by being baptized into Him. In this way there takes place in full an organic union between the believers and Christ.<p>Now as Christians, those who are of Christ and are one with Him, we need to live by Him, and even live Him, in our daily life. You may have heard of living for Christ, living out Christ, and living by Christ, but not of living Christ. To live by Christ and for Christ and to live Christ out are all somewhat different from simply living Christ. If we are living by Christ, we are still doing the living. To live Christ means that Christ is our life (Col. 3:4). When we live, He lives. When He lives, we live.<p>The central thought in the Bible is that Christ must be our life and that we must live Him as our living. The goal of being a Christian is to live Christ. Furthermore, the destiny God has ordained for us in His economy is that we live Christ. God&#8217;s economy is to dispense Himself into us and to work Himself into us that we may take Christ as our life and life supply in order to live Him. God&#8217;s desire is that we live Christ. If we are truly seeking the Lord, the day will come when we shall see that what God desires is not our doing, behavior, or virtues, but Christ. Christ is to be our life, our daily walk, our everything.<p>The key to living Christ is to realize that, as Christians, the life we have received is Another&#8217;s, yet it is not lived by Him but by us. There are two persons but one life to be lived. The life is Christ&#8217;s, yet He wants us to live it out. The two, Christ and we, have one life with one living. We should live Christ by Christ&#8217;s life. The life is His, and the living is ours. This is the proper Christian life.<p>Although we and Christ are two, we should not have two lives, nor should we have two livings. The one life that we both have is His, but the living is ours. Our living must be by His life, expressing Him, not ourselves. Therefore, the Christian life is a life involving two persons, but these two persons have only one life and one living. The life is the Lord&#8217;s, and the living is ours.<p>The Apostle Paul lived Christ. In Philippians 1:21 he says, &#8220;To me to live is Christ.&#8221; In Galatians 2:20 Paul declared, &#8220;Christ lives in me.&#8221; Paul could say not only that Christ lived in him, but also that to him to live was Christ. On the one hand, Christ lived in Paul; on the other hand, Paul lived Christ. Inwardly Christ was Paul&#8217;s life, and outwardly Christ was Paul&#8217;s living. Paul and Christ thus had one life and one living. Christ&#8217;s life was Paul&#8217;s life, and Paul&#8217;s living was Christ&#8217;s living. The two, Christ and Paul, lived as one. First Corinthians 6:17 refers to such a living. In this verse Paul says that we are one spirit with the Lord. The organic union that has taken place between us and Christ causes us to be so close and intimate with Him that we are even one spirit with Him.<p>To live Christ is not merely to live a holy life or to live holiness. To live Christ is to live a person. This is to live a life that is Christ Himself. Paul&#8217;s life was to live Christ. He lived Christ because Christ lived in him. He was one with Christ both in life and living. He and Christ had one life and one living. They lived together as one person. Christ lived within him as his life, and he lived Christ without as his living.<p>As Christians, we are privileged to have Christ as our life. Now He wants us to live Him. &#8220;Because I live, you shall live also&#8221; (John 14:19). This indicates that we and Christ may live together, having one life and one living. Day by day we need to practice living Christ, taking Him as our life and person. This is the Christian life. When we live Christ in this way, it will be our experience that we have been crucified with Christ and that it is no longer we but Christ who lives in us. Then we shall be able to say with Paul, &#8220;To me to live is Christ.&#8221;<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR SYMBOLS</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>In the New Testament there are even more symbols of the believers than of the Spirit. This indicates that as God, Christ, and the Spirit are mysterious, so the believers also are mysterious. We are mysterious because something divine has been incorporated into us. The divine element has been dispensed into us and wrought into our being. As a result, we, the believers in Christ, are mysterious. In this message we shall begin to consider the many symbols of the believers found in the New Testament.<h2 class=head1>A. WHEAT OF LIFE</h2><h2 class=head2>1. Separated from the Chaff and to Be Gathered into the Lord&#8217;s Barn</h2><p>First, the New Testament uses the wheat of life to symbolize the believers. Matthew 3:12 tells us that the Lord Jesus will separate the wheat from the chaff and gather the wheat into His barn: &#8220;He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into His barn, but He will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire.&#8221; Those symbolized by wheat have life within; they are the living children of God. The Lord Jesus will baptize them in the Holy Spirit (Matt. 3:11) and gather them into His barn in heaven by rapture. In order to become children of God, we must be baptized through water into the Spirit. We need to be born of water and of the Spirit (John 3:5). First, we are baptized through water; then we are baptized in the Spirit. In this way we are regenerated to become children of God, the believers symbolized by the wheat of life, which will be gathered into the Lord&#8217;s barn. Those symbolized by chaff, like the tares in Matthew 13:24-30, are without life. The Lord will baptize them in fire, putting them into the lake of fire. Chaff in 3:12 refers to unrepentant Jews, whereas the tares in Matthew 13 refer to nominal Christians. The eternal destiny of both will be the same-perdition in the lake of fire (Matt. 13:40-42).<h2 class=head2>2. Growing with the Tares and to Be Reaped into the Lord&#8217;s Barn</h2><p>According to Matthew 13, the wheat of life grows with the tares, the false believers, and will be reaped into the Lord&#8217;s barn. Matthew 13:25 says, &#8220;While the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares amidst the wheat and went away.&#8221; These men were slaves (v. 27), referring to the Lord&#8217;s slaves, mainly the apostles. When the Lord&#8217;s slaves were sleeping, not watching, His enemy, the Devil, came and sowed false believers amidst the true ones.<p>A tare is a kind of darnel, a weed resembling wheat. Its seeds are poisonous, producing sleepiness, nausea, convulsions, and even death. The sprout and leaves of the tares look the same as those of the wheat. It is impossible to discern one from the other until the fruit is produced. The fruit of the wheat is golden yellow, but that of the tares is black.<p>The wheat is the sons of the kingdom, the real believers regenerated with the divine life. The tares are the sons of the evil one, the Devil. The sons of the kingdom are the sons of God who have the divine life within them. The sons of the evil one are the false believers, believers only in name, who do not have the divine life in them.<p>Both the tares and the wheat grow in the field, which is the world (Matt. 13:38). Some have wrongly interpreted the field, saying that it is the church. According to this interpretation, in the church there are both false ones and real ones. But the Lord Jesus says clearly in verse 38 that the field is the world. The wheat and the tares are allowed to grow together in the world, not in the church. This means that the false believers and the true ones live together in the world. The church is not to tolerate the false believers, but both the false and the true are allowed to grow together in the world. In the world there are both true and false believers, but this must not be so in the church.<p>To gather up the tares from the field means to take away the false believers from the world. The Lord Jesus did not want His slaves to do this, lest while taking away the false believers from the world, the true ones might also be taken away from the world (Matt. 13:29). The Lord told His slaves not to separate the wheat from the tares but to allow them both to grow together until the harvest. This means that the false believers must be allowed to exist in the world with the true believers.<p>In Matthew 13:30 the Lord Jesus goes on to say, &#8220;Allow both to grow together until the harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat bring together into My barn.&#8221; The harvest is the consummation of the age, and the reapers are angels (v. 39). At the consummation of this age, the Lord will send the angels to gather all the tares, all stumbling blocks, and those who do lawlessness, bind them into bundles, and burn them with the fire of the lake of fire (vv. 30, 40-42). Then the wheat, the righteous, will be brought together into the King&#8217;s barn, the kingdom of their Father, to shine forth as the sun (vv. 30, 43).<p>As believers, we may have the full assurance that we are wheat and not tares. What does it mean to be real wheat? If we realize that we are sinful, fallen, and lost and if we truly believe in the Lord Jesus Christ-that He is the Son of God incarnated to be a man, that He died on the cross for our sins, that He was resurrected physically and spiritually, and that He is now the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us as our life and everything, we are certainly the wheat of life.<h2 class=head1>B. GOOD SEED</h2><h2 class=head2>1. The Sons of the Kingdom</h2><p>On the one hand, the Lord Jesus says that the believers are wheat; on the other hand, He tells us that the believers are the good seed. In Matthew 13:38 He says, &#8220;The good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom.&#8221; In Matthew 13:4 and 19 the seed sown by the Lord was the word of the kingdom. In verses 24 and 38 this seed has developed into the sons of the kingdom. First, the seed was the word sown into humanity. Then it grows into the sons of the kingdom. The seed in verses 4 and 19 is the word with Christ in it as life. This seed now grows in us, the kingdom people, the sons of the kingdom. Therefore, the good seed, as well as the wheat, is the sons of the kingdom, the real believers, those regenerated with the divine life.<p>Actually, the wheat and the good seed are the same. A farmer will first reap a harvest of wheat. Then he will use some of the better grains as seed for sowing. The principle is the same with us as believers in Christ. First we are the wheat and then, the good seed sown by the Lord.<p>The sowing of the good seed is a kind of martyrdom, for the seed experiences a real crucifixion and is put to death. Those who are willing to be sown, crucified, in this way will eventually grow, multiply, and be fruitful. But those who are not willing to be sown into the ground, who are not willing to be put to death, will be barren and unfruitful.<h2 class=head2>2. Sown by the Lord to Grow into His Kingdom</h2><p>Matthew 13:24 says, &#8220;The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man sowing good seed in his field.&#8221; The good seed is sown by the Lord Jesus to grow into His kingdom. This kingdom is Christ as the seed of life sown into His believers, God&#8217;s chosen people, and developing into a realm which God may rule as His kingdom in His divine life. Its entrance is regeneration (John 3:5), and its development is the believers&#8217; growth in the divine life (2 Pet. 1:3-11). It is the church life today, in which the faithful believers live (Rom. 14:17), and it will develop into the coming kingdom as an inheritance reward (Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5) to the overcoming saints in the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6). Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God, an eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God&#8217;s eternal life for all God&#8217;s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (Rev. 21:1-4; 22:1-5).<h2 class=head1>C. FISHERS OF MEN</h2><p>The next symbol of the believers, fishers of men, is unusual. The Lord Jesus said to Peter and Andrew, &#8220;Come, follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men&#8221; (Matt. 4:19). Immediately they left their nets and followed the King of the kingdom of the heavens to be fishers of men. Eventually, on the day of Pentecost, Peter became the first great fisher for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens (Acts 2:37-42; 4:4).<h2 class=head2>1. To Bring Men out of the World into the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2><p>To be a fisher of men is to bring men out of the world, signified by the sea with its death waters, into the kingdom of the heavens. This means that to fish for men, &#8220;catching men alive&#8221; (Luke 5:10), that is, unto life (Acts 11:18), is to bring them into the kingdom. On the day of Pentecost Peter began his ministry of bringing people into the kingdom of the heavens. He brought in all kinds of people, Gentiles as well as Jews. He was a real fisher of men.<p>To fish for men requires patience. Peter, a quick person, may have learned this in Matthew 17:24-27. After Peter gave a hasty answer concerning Christ&#8217;s paying the half-shekel, the Lord Jesus asked him, &#8220;What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers? And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said to him, Then the sons are free&#8221; (vv. 25-26). Then the Lord went on to say, &#8220;But that we may not stumble them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel; take that and give it to them for Me and you&#8221; (v. 27). Peter, no doubt, was troubled that he had to go fishing and wait for a fish to appear with a shekel. As a result, Peter may have learned that a fisher of men must have patience. If we would be fishers of men, gaining others for Christ&#8217;s increase, we also need patience. We cannot have the increase, the multiplication, in a quick way. Patiently we should contact others again and again until they are &#8220;caught&#8221; and brought out of the world into the kingdom of the heavens.<h2 class=head2>2. By the Gospel of the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2><p>The way to bring others out of the world and into the kingdom of the heavens is not by today&#8217;s superficial gospel but by the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens. The Lord Jesus said to His disciples, &#8220;This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations&#8221; (Matt. 24:14). The gospel of the kingdom includes not only forgiveness of sins (Luke 24:47) and the impartation of life (John 20:31) but also the kingdom of the heavens with the power of the coming age (Heb. 6:5) to cast out demons and heal diseases (Isa. 35:5-6; Matt. 10:1). Both forgiveness of sins and the imparting of life are for the kingdom.<p>The gospel of the kingdom, which also includes the gospel of grace (Acts 20:24), not only brings people into God&#8217;s salvation but also into the kingdom of the heavens (Rev. 1:9). The emphasis of the gospel of grace is on forgiveness of sin, God&#8217;s redemption, and eternal life, whereas the emphasis of the gospel of the kingdom is on the heavenly ruling of God and the authority of the Lord.<p>The New Testament speaks of the gospel of life, the gospel of grace, and the gospel of salvation. However, all these are different aspects of the kingdom. The kingdom is the center, the hub, and all the other items may be considered the spokes, which are centered on the hub. The gospel of life is for the kingdom, the gospel of salvation is for the kingdom, and the gospel of forgiveness is for the kingdom. All these different aspects of the gospel are for the kingdom. The kingdom is the real gospel. We may think that the gospel is the gospel and that the kingdom is something else. This concept is wrong. The kingdom is the gospel. If we do not know the kingdom, we do not know the gospel in a full way. If we want to know the gospel in a full way, we must realize that the kingdom is the all-inclusive gospel. This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations before the end of this age comes. The inhabited earth means every place inhabited by man. I believe that the churches in the Lord&#8217;s recovery will bear the burden to bring this gospel to all the inhabited earth. The gospel of grace has been preached in every continent but not the gospel of the kingdom. The gospel of grace is the lower gospel, but the gospel of the kingdom is the higher gospel. This higher gospel must be brought to every continent through the churches in the Lord&#8217;s recovery.<h2 class=head1>D. SALT OF THE EARTH</h2><h2 class=head2>1. People of the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2><p>Matthew 5:13 says, &#8220;You are the salt of the earth.&#8221; Here the Lord Jesus is speaking of the people of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 5:3, 10). In particular, the &#8220;you&#8221; in 5:13 refers to the overcoming believers in the kingdom life. Furthermore, being the salt of the earth is a corporate matter, not an individual matter. Individually we cannot be the proper salt. It is as a corporate entity that the kingdom people are the salt of the earth. If we separate ourselves from the church life, we cannot be such salt.<h2 class=head2>2. Keeping the Earth from Being Fully Corrupted</h2><p>For us to be the salt of the earth means that we keep the earth from being fully corrupted. This means that we exercise our influence over the earth created by God to keep it in its original condition. The earth, which was created by God, has become fallen. In a sense, it has become rotten and corrupted. But salt kills germs, eliminates rottenness, and preserves things in their original condition. By nature salt is an element that kills the germs of corruption and eliminates them. Thus, through its killing and preserving function salt brings the earth back to its original condition or keeps it in its original condition. Hence, the function of salt is to preserve what God has created. The entire earth is becoming more and more rotten. Therefore, we must exercise our influence over this corrupted earth. To the corrupted earth the people of the kingdom of the heavens are the element that keeps the earth from being fully corrupted. They have the salting function of killing germs, eliminating rottenness, and keeping things in their original condition or bringing them back to their God-created condition.<p>The Lord&#8217;s intention is to bring this earth back to its original condition. Although we cannot see this in the present age, we shall see it in the next age. When the millennial kingdom comes, the whole earth will be salted. All the germs on earth will be utterly killed, and the whole earth will be not only regained by Christ but also brought back to its God-created condition. This work will be done by the kingdom people.<p>Wherever the kingdom people are, they should exercise a salting influence over those around them. In our neighborhoods we should exercise our function of killing germs. If we have the nature of the kingdom people revealed in Matthew 5:3-12, we shall be truly salty. If we are poor in spirit, mourning, meek, righteous, merciful, and pure in seeking God, we shall have a salting function. There will be no need to rebuke others or point out their mistakes and shortcomings. They will be salted simply by our presence. This is what it means to be the salt that kills the germs of this corrupted earth.<h2 class=head1>E. LIGHT OF THE WORLD</h2><h2 class=head2>1. People of the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2><p>In Matthew 5:14a the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;You are the light of the world.&#8221; This light is also the people of the kingdom of the heavens, the overcoming believers living a kingdom life to shine in the darkness of the world. In nature the kingdom people are the healing salt, and in behavior they are the shining light.<h2 class=head2>2. Shining in the Darkness of the World</h2><p>In Matthew 5:13 the Lord Jesus speaks of the earth and in verse 14, of the world. For the earth there is the need of salt, but for the world there is the need of light. The darkness is not upon the earth; rather, it is in the world, which denotes human society, a system of Satan. The world, Satan&#8217;s system, the dark human society, needs light. The light of the world in verse 14 is the shining of a lamp to enlighten those in darkness. To the darkened world, the people of the kingdom of the heavens are such a light effacing its darkness.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR SYMBOLS</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover six more symbols of the believers: a lamp, a city situated upon a mountain, the sun, virgins, plants, and living stones.<h2 class=head1>F. A LAMP</h2><h2 class=head2>1. Placed Not under the Bushel but on the Lampstand</h2><p>In Matthew 5:15 the believers are symbolized by a lamp: &#8220;Neither do men light a lamp and place it under the bushel, but on the lampstand, and it shines to all who are in the house.&#8221; In order to be the lamp shining upon others we need to be without any covering. As the lamp on the lampstand, the light should not be hidden.<p>In verse 15 the Lord Jesus speaks about placing the lamp under the bushel. A lighted lamp placed under the bushel cannot shine out its light. The kingdom people as the lighted lamp should not be covered by the bushel, an item pertaining to eating, a matter which causes anxiety (Matt. 6:25). Instead of being covered by the bushel, we must be on the lampstand.<p>The Lord Jesus wisely speaks about not being covered by a bushel. In ancient times a bushel, as a measure for grain, was something related to eating and therefore related to the matter of making a living. Thus, hiding the lamp under the bushel indicates anxiety concerning our living. If we Christians are anxious about our living and concerned about how much money we are making, this anxiety will become a bushel covering our light.<p>In order to shine upon others, we need to come out from under our covering. This indicates that, as kingdom people, we live without care and anxiety for our existence. We care only for Christ and the church. Day after day we are a happy people, a praising people. When others contact us, they will sense that we have no anxiety, that we are not worried about our living. From experience we know that such a lack of anxiety touches others. If every time someone contacts you, you are happy and enjoying the Lord, he will be deeply touched. Filled with anxiety and occupied with all kinds of worries, worldly people talk about the fear of losing their jobs or the difficulties they are having at work. But the kingdom people, those not covered by the bushel, care only to talk about Christ and the church. By being such a people we touch the hearts of others and shine upon them.<h2 class=head2>2. Shining to All Who Are in the House</h2><p>Matthew 5:15 speaks of the light shining to &#8220;all who are in the house.&#8221; We may think that the house here refers to the church. However, there is no need to interpret the house in this manner. According to the context, the main point is that the shining of the light has two aspects: the outward aspect and the inward aspect. The light as a city on a mountain (v. 14) shines over the outsiders, whereas the lighted lamp on the lampstand shines over those who are in the house. As the city, the light shines upon people, but as the lamp in the house, the light shines into people. This indicates that our influence over others should not be just outward but also inward.<p>The outward shining of the kingdom people, likened to that of a city situated on a mountain, is general, and all of society can see it. Society can see a group of people who are built up, situated upon the top of a mountain, and shining. The inward shining, on the contrary, is particular. When others see that we are not anxious about our living, the light of the lamp will penetrate into their being and shine within them. This is not the general shining from outside; it is the particular shining from within. If we are proper kingdom people, we shall be a lamp without any covering shining into others. This inward shining penetrates the inward being of others and convinces them.<h2 class=head2>3. Glorifying Their Father Who Is in the Heavens</h2><p>Eventually our shining will give glory to the Father. &#8220;Thus let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens&#8221; (Matt. 5:16). The title &#8220;your Father&#8221; indicates that the Lord Jesus is speaking to those who are regenerated children of God (John 1:12; Gal. 4:6). The good works here are the behavior of the kingdom people through which others may see God and be brought to Him.<p>Our shining will glorify the Father because it expresses what God is. To glorify God the Father is to give Him the glory. Glory is God expressed. When the kingdom people express God in their behavior and good works, men see God and give glory to God. God hidden is God Himself. But when God is expressed, that is the glory of God. If as the kingdom people we have such a shining light, God will be expressed in this shining, and all those around us will see the glory, God expressed. When others see God in our shining, that is the glory of God.<h2 class=head1>G. A CITY SITUATED UPON A MOUNTAIN</h2><p>In Matthew 5:14a the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;You are the light of the world.&#8221; Then in 14b He goes on to say, &#8220;A city situated upon a mountain cannot be hidden.&#8221; As the shining light, the kingdom people are like a city situated upon a mountain.<p>Some may wonder why the Lord Jesus uses a city on a mountain as an illustration of the believers as the shining light. If we are in the building of the church in a practical way, we shall realize that only by being built together can we be a city situated on a mountain. This city becomes a shining light. The saints in the churches are now grouping together in their neighborhoods. If this practice becomes prevailing and the saints in these groups are built together, every group will be a part of the shining city situated on a mountaintop.<p>The light in 5:14 is not an individual person; it is a builded city. This indicates that the kingdom people need the building. If the saints in the church in your locality are not built up, but are scattered, divided, and separated, there is no city there. And as long as there is no city, there is no light, because the city is the light; the light is not an individual believer. The light is a corporate city built up as one entity to shine over the people surrounding it. In order to shine upon others outwardly, we need to be built up as a city on the mountaintop. Every local church in the Lord&#8217;s recovery must be a builded city.<p>In the book of Revelation the churches are golden lampstands (Rev. 1:20). The principle of the city and the lampstand is the same: neither is individual; both are corporate. The lampstand, like the city, is not an individual believer but the church. If we are outside the church, we are not a part of the lampstand. In order to be a part of the lampstand, we must be built into the local church. The local church, which is the lampstand, is likened by the Lord to a builded city set on the top of a mountain. If we are built up in our locality, we shall be on the mountaintop. But if we are scattered, separated, and divided, we shall be in a low valley. In every locality there must be one lampstand, one city situated on a mountain. For this, we need to keep the oneness and remain one entity, a corporate Body. Then we shall be able to shine. But if we are divided, we are finished with the shining. When we have truly been built together, we shall be the city on a mountaintop shining upon those around us.<h2 class=head2>1. Elevated above All the Surroundings</h2><p>The city situated on a mountaintop is elevated above all the surroundings.<h2 class=head2>2. Impossible to Be Hidden</h2><p>The Lord Jesus says that the believers as a city situated upon a mountaintop cannot be hidden. It is impossible for such a light to be hidden.<h2 class=head2>3. Consummating in the New Jerusalem Situated upon the Golden Mountain, Shining over and Enlightening the New Earth with the Divine Light</h2><p>The city situated upon a mountain will consummate in the New Jerusalem situated upon the golden mountain, shining over and enlightening the new earth with the divine light. Revelation 21:18b says, &#8220;The city was pure gold, like pure glass,&#8221; and verse 11 says, &#8220;Having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal.&#8221; Revelation 21:23 and 24 tell us, &#8220;The city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb. And the nations shall walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.&#8221; Here we see that the ultimate consummation of the divine revelation shows us God as the light, the Lamb as the lamp, and the New Jerusalem as the stand. Furthermore, the nations will walk by the light of the city. Under the shining of the New Jerusalem with the divine glory, the nations will not be in darkness.<p>We, the kingdom people, are the light of the world. As light we are like a city on a mountaintop and like a lamp shining in a house. From without and from within we shine to express God, to let God have the glory in the eyes of others. May we exercise such an influence on those around us.<h2 class=head1>H. THE SUN</h2><p>In Matthew 13:43a the Lord Jesus likens the overcoming believers to the sun: &#8220;Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.&#8221; Today we shine as lamps, but in the coming age we shall shine as the sun. At present, this is beyond our experience and understanding.<h2 class=head2>1. The Sons of the Kingdom as the Righteous</h2><p>Those who will shine as the sun are the sons of the kingdom (Matt. 13:38) as the righteous. According to Matthew 5:20, these sons of the kingdom will have the surpassing righteousness. They will be righteous to such an extent that their entire being will shine. This righteousness is the indwelling Christ lived out of us that we may live in the reality of the kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future. It is impossible for our natural life to gain this surpassing righteousness; it can be produced only by the resurrection life of Christ.<h2 class=head2>2. Shining Forth in the Kingdom of Their Father-the Heavenly Part of the Millennium</h2><p>In Matthew 13:43a the Lord Jesus speaks not of the kingdom of God, nor of the kingdom of Christ, nor of the kingdom of the heavens, but of the kingdom of the Father. The kingdom of the Father is the heavenly part of the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6), the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward to the overcomers. In this kingdom the righteous will shine forth as the sun. We are sons of God the Father, and God is light (1 John 1:5; 1 Tim. 6:16). The divine light, which is God Himself, is, of course, much greater than the light of the sun. When in the millennium the overcomers enjoy the Father as light, they will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.<h2 class=head1>I. VIRGINS</h2><p>Another New Testament symbol of the believers is virgins. Matthew 25:1 says, &#8220;Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.&#8221; Virgins signify the believers in the aspect of life. Believers, who are the kingdom people, are like chaste virgins, bearing the Lord&#8217;s testimony (the lamp) in the dark age and going out to meet the Lord. For this they need not only the indwelling but also the fullness of the Spirit of God.<p>Being a virgin is not a matter of work, service, or activity; it is a matter of life. Moreover, we are not merely virgins but chaste, pure virgins. Being a virgin is not a matter of what we do or are able to do; it is absolutely a matter of what we are.<p>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was loved much more by His female followers than by His male followers. For example, Luke 8:1-3 tells us that certain women ministered out of their possessions to the Lord and His disciples. This was an expression of their love for the Lord. Also, it was a woman, a widow, not a bachelor, who put all she had into the treasury (Mark 12:41-44). Furthermore, it was a woman who broke the alabaster flask of ointment and poured the ointment of very costly, pure nard upon the Lord Jesus (Mark 14:3). The disciples, however, were indignant and said, &#8220;Why has this waste of the ointment been made?&#8221; (v. 4). The point here is that whereas males tend to consider matters before loving, the females love blindly and pour out everything on the Lord Jesus in genuine love for Him. For this reason, in the new creation God makes all the believers females, virgins loving the Lord Jesus. Therefore, Paul could say to the believers in Corinth, &#8220;I betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ&#8221; (2 Cor. 11:2). Moreover, Revelation 21:2 describes the New Jerusalem as &#8220;prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&#8221; This indicates that if we would participate in the New Jerusalem, which is an aggregate virgin, we ourselves must be virgins who love the Lord and wait for Him.<p>In the sight of God, all believers, brothers and sisters alike, are virgins. When the Lord Jesus comes back for the believers, He will meet only virgins; He will not meet any men. Anyone who considers himself a man and not a virgin will not be qualified to go to the air to meet the Lord. Hence, we all must regard ourselves as virgins and say, &#8220;I love the Lord Jesus. I love my Husband, although I have never seen Him. Because I love Him, I give myself to Him. I give up my future and everything for Him. Now, while I am working for Him, I am walking out of the world to meet Him.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>1. People of the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2><p>The virgins in Matthew 25:1 are all people of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 5:3, 10).<h2 class=head2>2. Bearing the Lamps (Their Spirits with the Spirit of God to Bear the Testimony of Christ) and Going Forth (Going out of the World) to Meet the Bridegroom, the Coming Christ</h2><p>Matthew 25:1 says that the virgins took their lamps. Lamps signify the spirit of the believers (Prov. 20:27), which contains the Spirit of God as the oil (Rom. 8:16; Heb. 1:9). The believers shine with the light of the Spirit of God from within their spirit. As a result, they become the light of the world, like a lamp shining in the darkness of this age (Matt. 5:14-16; Phil. 2:15-16) to bear the testimony of the Lord for the glorification of God. Thus, as virgins we take lamps for testifying, shining, and enlightening. In our hand is a lamp shining for the Lord&#8217;s testimony.<p>The virgins in Matthew 25:1 &#8220;went forth.&#8221; This indicates that the believers are going out of the world to meet the coming Christ. The virgins do not linger or settle in any place. Instead, they are going out of the world. As virgins, we are not settled in this world; we are going out of the world to meet the coming Christ as our Bridegroom.<p>The bridegroom in 25:1 signifies Christ as the most pleasant and attractive person (John 3:29; Matt. 9:15). How good it is that here the Lord Jesus likens Himself not to a victorious general or a great commander-in-chief but to a bridegroom, a most pleasant person! Thus, we are the virgins going, and He is the Bridegroom coming.<p>Matthew 25:4 tells us that the prudent virgins &#8220;took oil in their vessels with their lamps.&#8221; We are vessels made for God (Rom. 9:21, 23-24), and our personality is in our soul. Hence, &#8220;vessels&#8221; in Matthew 25:4 signify the souls of the believers. The five prudent virgins not only have oil in their lamps but also take oil in their vessels. Having oil in their lamps signifies that they have the Spirit of God dwelling in their spirits, and taking oil in their vessels signifies that they have the fullness of the Spirit of God saturating their souls. If we are prudent virgins, we shall have not only the ordinary portion of oil-the Spirit in our spirits-but also the extra portion of oil-the Spirit in our souls for our transformation.<h2 class=head1>J. PLANTS</h2><p>Paul in 1 Corinthians 3:6-8 illustrates the believers as plants. The Lord&#8217;s word in Matthew 15:13 conveys the same illustration.<h2 class=head2>1. Planted by God through His Servants</h2><p>The believers are planted by God through His servants. This was what the apostles did with all the believers. It is altogether of life illustrated by the plant life. So there is the need of planting and watering and also the need of growth. The planting and watering are done by the apostles, but the growth is given only by God who is the source of life.<h2 class=head2>2. In the Church</h2><p>The believers, as God&#8217;s plants, are planted in the church, which is God&#8217;s farm (1 Cor. 3:9). In the farm of the church the believers are not only planted but also watered. It is also in the farm of the church that God gives the growth to the believers.<h2 class=head2>3. To Grow by Christ as Life</h2><p>According to the context of the first few chapters of 1 Corinthians, the life with which the believers grow in the church is the crucified and resurrected Christ. It is to experience and enjoy Him in the church that we grow in the divine life as God&#8217;s plants.<h2 class=head2>4. To Be Transformed into Precious Stones</h2><p>According to 1 Corinthians 3:8-12, the believers, as God&#8217;s plants, are to be transformed with Christ as their life into precious stones for the building of God-the church. The church is not only God&#8217;s farm but also God&#8217;s building (v. 9). In the church the believers are not only planted, watered, and growing in the divine life, but also transformed with the divine life into precious materials for the building of God&#8217;s house (1 Tim. 3:15).<h2 class=head1>K. LIVING STONES</h2><h2 class=head2>1. Transformed Sinners</h2><p>In the New Testament the believers are also symbolized by stones and are called living stones (1 Pet. 2:5). These living stones are actually transformed sinners. Once we were sinners, but we are now in the process of being transformed into stones.<p>According to John 1:42, when the Lord Jesus first looked at Peter, He said, &#8220;You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which translated means a stone).&#8221; The significance of a stone is that it denotes a work of transformation to bring forth material for God&#8217;s building (1 Cor. 3:12). The stone in John 1:42 signifies the believers in Christ, after being born of God, regenerated by receiving Him (John 1:12-13) to be transformed into living precious stones. This is for the building of the church, the house of God (Matt. 16:18). How wonderful it is to be transformed into living precious stones for the building of the church!<h2 class=head2>2. Being Built Up a Spiritual House-the Church</h2><p>First Peter 2:5 says, &#8220;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house.&#8221; We, the believers in Christ, are living stones, like Christ (v. 4), through regeneration and transformation. We were created of clay (Rom. 9:21). But at regeneration we received the seed of the divine life, which by its growth in us transforms us into living stones. At Peter&#8217;s conversion the Lord gave him a new name, Peter-a stone. When Peter received the revelation concerning Christ, the Lord revealed further that He also was the rock-a stone (Matt. 16:16-18). Peter was impressed by these two incidents that both Christ and His believers are stones for God&#8217;s building.<p>According to 1 Peter 2:5, as living stones we are being built up a spiritual house. Although the nourishing milk of the word (v. 2) is for the soul through the mind, it eventually nourishes our spirit. It makes us spiritual, suitable for building up a spiritual house for God.<p>God&#8217;s goal in the believers is to have a house built up with living stones. He does not want separated and scattered stones, nor even a pile of stones merely gathered together. He wants stones built up with one another.<p>The spiritual house into which we are being built is God&#8217;s building. Eventually, this building will consummate in the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem there will not be any clay, for all the clay will have been transformed into precious stone. This means that the New Jerusalem is built with precious stones. We are now becoming the precious stones that will be built up into the New Jerusalem.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED NINE</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR SYMBOLS</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><p>In this message we shall consider more symbols of the believers found in the New Testament.<h2 class=head1>L. SHEEP</h2><p>John 10 speaks of the believers as sheep. Both the Jewish and the Gentile believers are sheep with Christ as their Shepherd.<h2 class=head2>1. The Jewish Believers, Who Came out of the Sheepfold of Judaism through Christ as the Door</h2><p>First, the sheep are the Jewish believers who came out of the sheepfold of Judaism through Christ as the door (vv. 2-4, 7-9). The sheepfold in John 10 signifies the law and also Judaism, the religion of the law. Before Christ came, God put His chosen people under the custody of the law. The law was the fold where God&#8217;s people as the sheep were kept and protected temporarily until the pasture, the permanent place for the sheep, was ready. Christ is the pasture, the permanent place for God&#8217;s people to stay. Before Christ came, God prepared the law as the sheepfold to keep and confine His chosen people temporarily. However, the Jewish religion utilized the law to form Judaism, which then became the sheepfold.<p>John 10 reveals that Christ is the door through which God&#8217;s people leave the fold and come to the pasture. God no longer intends to keep His chosen people in the fold of the law. Rather, He wants them to come out of the law into Christ. Now, during the New Testament age, God intends to bring His people out of the law through Christ as the door. Christ has come, and the pasture is ready. There is no need for the sheep to be confined any longer in the custody of the Judaic law. They must be released from the fold of the law to enjoy the riches of the pasture. Christ is the door through which His believers may come out of any kind of fold and come into Him as the pasture.<h2 class=head2>2. The Gentile Believers, Who Were Brought In by Christ to Be One Flock (the Church) with the Jewish Believers</h2><p>Second, the sheep in John 10 are the Gentile believers, who were brought in by Christ to be one flock (the church) with the Jewish believers. Verse 16 says, &#8220;I have other sheep which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.&#8221; Here the Lord Jesus reveals that besides the Jewish believers as His sheep kept under the ward of the law He has other sheep which are not of the Jewish fold, which are God&#8217;s chosen people among the Gentiles and which He must bring in. When this word was spoken by the Lord Jesus, it was a prophecy. This prophecy was fulfilled in Acts when Peter went to preach the gospel to the household of Cornelius, who were Gentiles (Acts 10), and when Paul went to preach the gospel to the Gentile world (Acts 13). Through the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles, many were saved unto the Lord out of different tongues, and they all became the Lord&#8217;s sheep.<p>The Lord Jesus first called and brought His Jewish believers out of the fold of the Jewish religion, and after Pentecost He saved and brought many Gentile believers out of the Gentile world to make them all, both the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers, one flock under Himself as the one Shepherd. This one flock is the one, universal church, the one Body of Christ (Eph. 2:14-16; 3:6), brought forth by life, which the Lord imparted into us through His death and resurrection. The one flock no longer belongs to the Jewish fold or to the Gentile world, but stands by itself as the church of God set apart from the Jews and the Gentiles (1 Cor. 10:32). The one flock is very different in nature from a fold. As our Shepherd, Christ has brought us into the flock, where we are in the pasture enjoying Him as our life and life supply.<h2 class=head2>3. With Christ as Their Shepherd, Who Laid Down His Soul Life for Them That They May Have the Divine Life</h2><p>The sheep in the one flock have Christ as their Shepherd, who laid down His soul life for them that they may have the divine life (vv. 11, 14-15, 16b, 10). In verse 10 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&#8221; And in verse 11 He says, &#8220;I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.&#8221; In these two verses two different Greek words are used for life. In verse 10 the Greek word is zoe, which is the word used in the New Testament for the eternal, divine life. In verse 11 the Greek word is psuche, the same word for soul, which means the soulish life, that is, the human life. These verses indicate that the Lord Jesus has two kinds of lives. As a man the Lord has the psuche life, the human life, and as God He has the zoe life, the divine life. He laid down His soul, His psuche life, His human life, to accomplish redemption for His sheep (vv. 15, 17-18) that they may share His zoe life, His divine life (v. 10), the eternal life (v. 28), by which they may be formed into one flock under Himself as the one Shepherd. As the good Shepherd He feeds His sheep with the divine life in this way and for this purpose.<p>The Lord&#8217;s divine life could not be slain. What was slain in His crucifixion was His human life. In order to be our Savior, He, as a man, laid down His human life to accomplish redemption for us so that we may receive His zoe life. He laid down His human life in order that we, after being redeemed, might have His divine life, the eternal life.<p>The Shepherd, the divine life, and the human life are all for the flock. Those in the flock are fallen ones in need of redemption. As a man the Shepherd had the human life. He sacrificed His human life in order to accomplish redemption for His flock. In this way His flock was redeemed. Then His flock received His divine life, and by this divine life the sheep lived together as the flock. Thus, the flock is formed into one unit, into one entity. This is accomplished not by the human life but by the divine life.<p>In the human life we are condemned and divided; in the divine life we are accepted and united. In the divine life we all are one entity, meaning that we are one flock under one Shepherd in one life. However, if we live by our human life, we are no longer sheep. A sheep is a regenerated person with the divine life. We all must live by the divine life and thus become genuine, real, and pure sheep. Then we shall be in the flock. If we do not live by the divine life, there can be no flock, for the flock is produced, formed, and maintained by the divine life. In the divine life we are truly one. This is not possible in our human, psuche life; it is possible only in the divine, zoe life. Now, as redeemed and regenerated ones, we are in the divine life under one Shepherd to be one flock.<h2 class=head1>M. MANY GRAINS OF WHEAT</h2><p>The believers are also symbolized by many grains of wheat. John 12:24 says, &#8220;Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&#8221; The expression &#8220;much fruit&#8221; refers to many grains of wheat as the multiplication of the one grain.<h2 class=head2>1. Produced out of the One Grain-Christ</h2><p>In 12:24 the Lord Jesus clearly refers to Himself, God incarnate, as the unique grain of wheat that falls into the ground and dies. The believers as many grains of wheat are produced out of Christ as the one grain.<h2 class=head2>2. Through the Death and Resurrection of Christ</h2><p>The many grains of wheat are produced through the death and resurrection of Christ. In His work on the cross the Lord Jesus died as a grain of wheat falling into death for the release of the divine life. The divine life was in Jesus, just as life is confined in a grain of wheat. Because the life is concealed in the grain, the shell must be broken so that the inward life may be released. Christ&#8217;s all-inclusive death released the divine life that was within Him. As a grain of wheat He died to release the divine life and to enliven God&#8217;s redeemed ones in order to produce many grains.<p>The Lord Jesus fell into the ground and died so that His divine element, His divine life, would be released from within the shell of His humanity to produce many believers in resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3), just as a grain of wheat has its life element released by falling into the ground and growing up out of the ground to produce much fruit, that is, to bring forth many grains. The Lord Jesus, as a grain of wheat falling into the ground, lost His soulish life through death so that He might release His divine life to the many grains. This is the life-releasing aspect of the death of Christ.<p>Christ&#8217;s death released the divine life from within Him. He was a grain of wheat, and there was no other way for that grain to increase except to fall into the ground and die. This is the way to have the multiplication of life. Therefore, in His death Christ was sown into the earth as a grain of wheat to produce a multiplication through the release of the divine life.<p>As a grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died, the Lord Jesus has brought forth much fruit in resurrection. This is a matter of germination through resurrection. Concerning this, Peter says, &#8220;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead&#8221; (1 Pet. 1:3). When Christ was resurrected we, His believers, were all included in Him. Hence, we were resurrected with Him (Eph. 2:6). In His resurrection He imparted the divine life into us and made us the same as He is in life and nature.<p>Through His death and resurrection the Lord Jesus has been multiplied and propagated. The many grains are the multiplication of the one grain, and this multiplication is the propagation of that grain of wheat. Therefore, the Lord&#8217;s resurrection was His propagation to produce the church as His reproduction.<h2 class=head2>3. For the Formation of One Bread- the Body of Christ</h2><p>The many grains of wheat produced through Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection are for the formation of one bread-the Body of Christ. After the many grains have been produced, they need to be crushed, ground into flour, and blended together in a loaf to be offered to God. This loaf is the church, the Body of Christ. &#8220;We who are many are one bread, one Body; for we all partake of the one bread&#8221; (1 Cor. 10:17). The Christ out of whom we have been produced and of whom we partake constitutes us into His one Body.<h2 class=head1>N. BRANCHES OF THE VINE</h2><h2 class=head2>1. Members of the Christ of God to Form the Organism of the Triune God in the Divine Dispensing</h2><p>In addition to being many grains of wheat, the believers are also the many branches of the vine. This means that the believers are members of the Christ of God to form the organism of the Triune God in the divine dispensing. In John 15:1 the Lord Jesus declares, &#8220;I am the true vine,&#8221; and in verse 5 He says, &#8220;I am the vine, you are the branches.&#8221; This vine, which is Christ, with its branches, which are the believers in Christ, is the organism of the Triune God in God&#8217;s economy to grow with His riches and to express His divine life.<p>Christ and the believers, the vine with the branches, form the organism of the Triune God in the divine dispensing. The vine in John 15, therefore, is a universal vine comprising Christ and His believers as the branches. In this vine, this organism, the Triune God lives, expresses Himself, and dispenses Himself to the uttermost.<p>In John 15 we see the focus of what God is doing in the universe. Here the Father is a husbandman, a farmer, cultivating the true vine, Christ, with its branches, the believers in Christ. In His economy God is growing Christ, and all of us are branches in Christ as the true vine.<p>Christ, the infinite God, is the vine, and we are His branches. We are actually branches of the infinite God, organically one with Him. This means that we have been organically joined to the Triune God. Now we are part of God, even as the members of our bodies are parts of us. If we are in the light, we shall see that we are members of Christ, that we are part of Him.<p>We have become branches of the vine, members of the Christ of God, by the branching out of the vine, for the branches are the spreading of the vine. By our natural life we are not branches of the vine. On the contrary, by our fallen nature we are branches of Adam and even branches of the Devil. Just as a branch is the branching out of a tree, so when we were born we were just the branching out of Adam. As branches of Adam, we were also branches of Satan. The wonderful thing is that when we believed in the Lord Jesus, He branched out into us. This branching out has made us branches of this wonderful Christ. Therefore, Christ&#8217;s branching out has made us branches of Christ as the vine. Now as branches we are filled with Christ as life, for to be a branch in the vine means that Christ has become our life.<p>No plant other than the vine can illustrate adequately the living relationship between the believers and Christ. A vine differs from a tree in that it has virtually no trunk. If you cut off the branches of a vine, there is practically nothing left, only the root. It is very significant, therefore, that the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am the vine, you are the branches.&#8221; The vine is everything to the branches. Whatever is in the vine is also in the branches. This indicates that as the vine Christ is a great enjoyment for us, the branches. From the vine and through the vine we receive everything we need to live as branches.<p>As believers, we are branches of the vine and are good for nothing except to express the vine. All that the vine is and has is expressed through the branches. Individually, the branches are the regenerated ones. Corporately, they are the church, the Body of Christ. The branches, the believers in the Son, are for the expression of the Son with the Father through fruit bearing.<h2 class=head2>2. Abiding in the Vine, the Christ of God</h2><p>As branches of the vine, we need to abide in the vine, the Christ of God. The Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing&#8221; (John 15:4-5). Only when the branches abide in the vine can the vine be everything to them. This is the reason the Lord Jesus says concerning Himself as the vine and us as the branches, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you.&#8221; Our life and enjoyment are to abide in the vine. Our destiny as branches is to remain in the vine.<p>Apart from the vine, we, the branches, can do nothing. A branch of a vine cannot live by itself, for it will wither and die apart from the vine. The relationship between the branches and the vine portrays the relationship between us and the Lord Jesus. We are nothing, we have nothing, and we can do nothing apart from Him. What we are, what we have, and what we do must be in the Lord and by the Lord in us. Therefore, it is crucial for us to abide in the Lord and for the Lord to abide in us. We should not do anything in ourselves; we should do everything by abiding in the vine. Christ as the vine is an all-inclusive portion for our daily enjoyment. Because we are branches to the Lord and the Lord is the vine to us, we must abide in Him and let Him abide in us. Then in our experience Christ will be everything to us for our enjoyment.<p>Abiding in the Christ of God is a crucial matter. Fruit bearing depends on abiding. Our abiding in Christ depends on a clear vision that we are branches in the vine. If we are to abide in the vine, we must see the fact that we are branches in the vine. If we see that we are already in Christ, we shall be able to abide in Him. Therefore, we need to pray, &#8220;Lord Jesus, show me clearly that I am a branch in the vine.&#8221;<p>Once we see the fact that we are branches in the vine, we need to maintain the fellowship between us and the vine. Any insulation will separate us from the rich supply of the vine. A little disobedience, a sin, or even a sinful thought can be the insulation that separates us from the riches of the vine. First, we must see that we are branches. Then we need to maintain the fellowship between us and the Lord. Nothing should be between Him and us. From experience we know that even a small thing can separate us from the rich supply of the vine. Hence, we need to pray, &#8220;Lord Jesus, let there be nothing between You and me separating me from Your rich supply.&#8221;<p>As long as we abide in Christ, He will abide in us. His abiding in us depends on our abiding in Him. Our abiding is the condition of His abiding, but His abiding in us is not a condition of our abiding in Him. Nothing is conditional with Him. But with us, because we are so fluctuating, there is the need of a condition. If we do not abide in Christ, there is no way for Him to abide in us. Although He does not change, we have many changes. We may abide in Him today and stay away from Him tomorrow. Therefore, His abiding in us depends on our abiding in Him. Our abiding in Him is the condition of His abiding in us. Thus, the Lord says, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you.&#8221; If we abide in Him, He will certainly abide in us. If we do not abide in Him, we fail to meet the condition of His abiding in us. His abiding depends on our abiding. This mutual abiding will bring forth fruit.<h2 class=head2>3. Bearing Much Fruit to Glorify the Father for His Expression</h2><p>The vine and the branches are an organism to glorify the Father. With the vine we have the glorification of the Father through the expression of the riches of the divine life in fruit bearing. In fruit bearing the Father&#8217;s life is expressed; hence, in fruit bearing He is glorified. This is the reason the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit&#8221; (John 15:8).<p>In John 15:8 the word &#8220;glorify&#8221; means to have the intent, the content, the inner life, and the inner riches released and expressed. The vine and the branches are an organism to glorify the Father, to have the intent, the content, the inner life, and the inner riches released and expressed from within. As an organism to glorify the Father, the vine and the branches express the riches of the divine life. When the vine bears clusters of grapes, the riches of the divine life are expressed. This expression is the glorification of the Father because the Father is the divine life.<p>The Father is the source and substance of the vine. Apart from the fruit, the essence, substance, and life of the vine are concealed, hidden, confined. However, the riches of the inner life of the vine are expressed in the clusters of fruit. To express the inner life in this way is to release the divine substance from within the vine. When the life of the vine is expressed through the branches in its propagation and multiplication, the Father is glorified, because what the Father is in the riches of His life is expressed in the propagation and multiplication of the vine. This is the glorification of the Father.<p>Our fruit bearing is the glorification, the expression, of the Triune God from within. Today the Triune God is within us as our life and nature, and the expression of the life and nature of the Triune God from within us is glory. Therefore, when the divine life with its nature is expressed through us in fruit bearing, the Father is glorified.<p>In John 17:22 the Lord Jesus prayed concerning the glory which the Father had given Him and which He had given to His disciples. The glory given by the Father to the Son and by the Son to the disciples is the divine life with the divine nature for God&#8217;s expression. The Father has given His life and nature to the Son so that the Son may express the Father&#8217;s glory. The Son has given us this divine life with its divine nature so that we also may express God in glory. In John 15 this expression of the divine life, this glorification of the Father, is in fruit bearing. Day by day we need to live a life that bears fruit, and in this way we glorify the Father. The more we express the divine life in fruit bearing, the more the Father will be glorified.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR SYMBOLS</h1><h1 class=msg>(4)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover five more symbols of the believers used in the New Testament: vessels of mercy unto honor and glory, branches of the cultivated olive tree, a spectacle, the offscouring of the world and the scum of all things, and the temple of the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head1>O. VESSELS OF MERCY UNTO HONOR AND GLORY</h2><p>The believers in Christ are vessels of mercy unto honor and glory. Romans 9:21 says, &#8220;Has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor?&#8221; Verse 23 goes on to speak of God&#8217;s making known &#8220;the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory.&#8221; As vessels, we are not instruments or weapons-we are containers. According to Romans 9, we contain mercy, honor, and glory. This mercy, honor, and glory are actually the Triune God. In the initial stage of our experience the Triune God is our mercy, in the progressing stage He is our honor, and in the completing stage He is our glory. At present we are enjoying our God as mercy and somewhat as honor. When the Lord Jesus comes back, we shall be fully brought into honor and also into glory. Then we shall be filled with the Triune God not only as our mercy but also as our honor and glory.<p>Mercy is the most far reaching of God&#8217;s attributes. Mercy goes further than grace, for mercy reaches into a situation that is pitiful and unworthy of grace. According to our natural condition, we were far removed from God, totally unworthy of His grace and eligible to receive only His mercy. How wonderful that God&#8217;s mercy does not depend on our being in a good condition! Rather, God&#8217;s mercy is shown in man&#8217;s pitiful condition. It is God&#8217;s mercy that has reached us. We were so poor and pitiful that there was the need for God&#8217;s mercy to extend to our fallen condition. We need to see the preciousness of God&#8217;s mercy and praise Him for it and testify concerning it. Once we were sinners far from God; now we are one with the all-inclusive Christ. What a mercy! We are vessels containing the Triune God as mercy. In the words of a hymn written by Charles Wesley,<p class=hbody>&#8217;Tis mercy all, immense and free; For, O my God, it found out me.<p class=hbody>(Hymns, 296)<p>When Paul wrote chapter nine of Romans, his thought was fully occupied with God&#8217;s mercy. He says, &#8220;It is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy&#8221; (v. 16). It is altogether a matter of God&#8217;s mercy that we are believers and that we are in the church life. Because all is of God&#8217;s mercy, we have nothing to boast of in ourselves. Our going on with the Lord is a matter not of our willing or running but of God&#8217;s mercy. Our willing is of no avail, and our running is vain. God&#8217;s mercy, however, works in a wonderful way. We are changeable, constantly fluctuating. Therefore, we should not trust in ourselves but in God&#8217;s mercy. We praise the Lord that we are vessels of mercy unto honor and glory. We now contain Him as mercy, and we shall contain Him as honor and glory.<h2 class=head2>1. Chosen by God according to His Sovereign Mercy</h2><p>As vessels of mercy unto honor and glory, we were chosen by God according to His sovereign mercy (Rom. 9:11-16). The expression &#8220;sovereign mercy&#8221; means that God&#8217;s mercy is absolutely according to His sovereignty. Being a vessel of mercy is not the result of our choice; it originates with God&#8217;s sovereignty. It is of God&#8217;s sovereignty that He created us vessels of mercy to contain Himself. His sovereignty is the basis of His selection.<p>In Romans 9:15 Paul quotes the Lord&#8217;s words, &#8220;I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.&#8221; Because of God&#8217;s mercy we responded to the gospel when others did not respond, we received a word about Christ as life when others refused to receive it, and we took the way of the Lord&#8217;s recovery when others drew back from taking this way. Concerning the gospel, the ministry of life, and the church life, God, in His sovereignty, has had mercy on us. Therefore, we must praise Him for His sovereign mercy.<p>In society selection is related to birth, upbringing, education, and success. Divine selection is absolutely different. God chose us even before we were born, in fact, before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4). Human selection depends on what people are in themselves. Those who are good, promising, or successful are likely to be selected. God&#8217;s selection, on the contrary, does not depend on what we are; it depends entirely on God&#8217;s sovereignty and His desire. This is illustrated by the case of Jacob and Esau. Before they were born, God told Rebecca, &#8220;The greater shall serve the less&#8221; (Rom. 9:12). God&#8217;s choice was made before the children were born, before they had done anything good or bad. This was that the &#8220;purpose of God according to selection might remain, not of works, but of Him who calls&#8221; (v. 11). If we were to ask God why He chose Jacob and not Esau, He might reply, &#8220;I am sovereign, and I have the full authority to do whatever I desire.&#8221;<p>Another illustration of God&#8217;s sovereign mercy found in Romans 9 is that of the potter and the clay. Paul says, &#8220;O man, who are you that replies against God? Shall the thing formed say to him who formed it, Why did you make me thus? Or has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor?&#8221; (vv. 20-21). God is the potter, and we are the clay. As the potter God has authority over the clay. If He wills, He can make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor. This does not depend on our choice-it depends on His sovereignty.<p>In 9:23 and 24 Paul goes on to ask, &#8220;And what if He should make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory, even us, whom He has also called, not only from among the Jews, but also from among the nations?&#8221; All depends on God&#8217;s authority. God has the authority to make us, whom He has selected and called, vessels of mercy to contain Him so that the riches of His glory may be made known, manifested. According to His sovereign authority, He before prepared us unto glory. We were predestinated by His sovereignty to be His containers, vessels of mercy unto honor and glory to express Him. This is altogether a matter of God&#8217;s sovereign mercy.<p>We have pointed out that in 9:16 Paul tells us that &#8220;it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy.&#8221; Our concept is that the one who wills will gain what he wills to obtain and that the one who runs will gain what he runs after. If this were the case, then God&#8217;s selection of us as vessels of mercy would be according to our effort and labor. But it is not so. God&#8217;s selection is of God who shows mercy. We do not need to will or to run, for God sovereignly has had mercy on us.<h2 class=head2>2. Created by God</h2><p>The Bible reveals that man was created as a vessel to contain God. In His creation of man, God made man a vessel to contain Him with the intention of coming into this vessel and filling it with Himself. When God enters into the vessels created by Him, He finds that they are a proper match for Him. For example, God has emotion, and His vessel, His container, also has emotion. Hence, in the vessel God has a place to dispense His own emotion. In this way human emotion and divine emotion become one. The divine emotion is the content, and the human emotion is the container and the expression. We thank the Lord for showing us the fact that man is a vessel to contain God and that God feels at home in this vessel.<p>Romans 9:21 discloses God&#8217;s purpose in creating man. This verse is unique in its revelation of God&#8217;s purpose in the creation of man. Without this verse it would be difficult for us to realize that God&#8217;s purpose in creating man was to make him His vessel to contain Him. We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that we are God&#8217;s containers and that He is our content.<p>God&#8217;s selection in His sovereign mercy has a goal, and this goal is to have many vessels to contain God and express Him eternally. God created us in such a way that we are able to take Him into us and contain Him as our life and life supply, to the end that we may be one with Him to express what He is and that He may be glorified in us and with us. This is God&#8217;s goal in His selection and in His creation of man.<p>Romans 9 reveals that the climax of our usefulness to God is that we are vessels to contain Him and express Him. We are His container and His expression, and He is our content and our life. He lives in us that we may live Him. Eventually, He and we, we and He, will be wholly one in life and nature. This is our destiny as vessels of mercy.<h2 class=head2>3. Unto Honor with Christ as Their Treasure through Regeneration</h2><p>The believers are vessels unto honor with Christ as their treasure through regeneration. Romans 9:21 speaks of vessels of honor. Second Corinthians 4:6 and 7 say, &#8220;The God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts for the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us.&#8221; This treasure is the Christ who dwells within us. We are containers of honor because Christ Himself is honor. He is the treasure within us. Although we have this treasure in earthen vessels, this treasure has not yet been manifested. When the Lord Jesus comes back, Christ as our treasure will be manifested. Then others will be able to see that we, as vessels unto honor, are containers of such a treasure.<h2 class=head2>4. Unto Honor through Their Cleansing of Themselves from the Vessels unto Dishonor</h2><p>The believers are vessels unto honor through their cleansing of themselves from the vessels unto dishonor. Second Timothy 2:20 says, &#8220;In a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthen, and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor.&#8221; In the great house spoken of here, there are not only gold and silver vessels but also wooden and earthen ones, and some unto honor and others unto dishonor. The house of God defined in 1 Timothy 3:15 and 16 is the genuine church in its divine nature and essential character as the foundation of the truth, whereas the great house in 2 Timothy 2:20 refers to the deteriorated church in its mixed character, as illustrated by the abnormally big tree in Matthew 13:31 and 32. In this great house there are not only precious vessels but also base ones. For this reason we cannot believe that the great house refers to the church as the house of the living God in 1 Timothy 3:15. The great house is certainly not the house of the living God. The house of the living God is the great mystery of godliness and also God manifested in the flesh. Such a house does not contain vessels unto dishonor. Therefore, the great house must refer to Christendom. Furthermore, this great house is equal to the big tree in Matthew 13. The genuine church today is the house of the living God, whereas abnormal Christianity is the great house. How great today is this abnormal house! Just as many unclean birds lodge in the big tree, so in the great house there are vessels unto dishonor, wooden and earthen vessels. In the genuine church, however, there are only gold and silver vessels.<p>Honorable vessels are of both the divine nature (gold) and the redeemed and regenerated human nature (silver). These, like Timothy and other genuine believers, constitute the firm foundation (2 Tim. 2:19) to hold the truth. Dishonorable vessels are of the fallen human nature (wood and earth). Hymenaeus, Philetus (2 Tim. 2:17), and other false believers are of these.<p>In 2 Timothy 2:21 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, prepared unto every good work.&#8221; To cleanse ourselves is to &#8220;depart from unrighteousness&#8221; (v. 19), as an outward evidence of the inward divine nature. The word &#8220;these&#8221; in verse 21 denotes the vessels unto dishonor, including those mentioned in verses 16 through 18. We should not only cleanse ourselves from anything unrighteous but also from the dishonorable vessels. This means that we must stay away from them. Hence, we must cleanse ourselves from the unrighteous things and from the dishonorable vessels of wood and earth. If we cleanse ourselves from these negative things and negative persons, we shall be vessels unto honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, and prepared unto every good work. &#8220;Unto honor&#8221; is a matter of nature, &#8220;sanctified&#8221; is a matter of position, &#8220;useful&#8221; is a matter of practice, and &#8220;prepared&#8221; is a matter of training.<p>Second Timothy 2:20 and 21 indicate that, based upon God&#8217;s mercy, which has made us vessels of honor, we must cleanse ourselves from the vessels unto dishonor. We need to separate ourselves from these vessels. For example, we should separate ourselves from today&#8217;s modernists, who deny that Jesus is God and that the Scripture is inspired by God. Such ones are vessels unto dishonor, and we should not be with them. In order to be vessels unto honor we need to separate ourselves, cleanse ourselves, from the dishonorable vessels.<h2 class=head2>5. Prepared by God unto Glory through Glorification- the Last Step of God&#8217;s Full Salvation</h2><p>As vessels of mercy unto honor and glory, we have been prepared by God unto glory through glorification-the last step of God&#8217;s full salvation. Romans 9:23 tells us that the vessels of mercy have been prepared unto glory, and Romans 8:30 indicates that glorification is the last step of God&#8217;s salvation. We are predestinated, called, justified, and, eventually, we shall be glorified. Glorification includes the redemption (transfiguration) of our body (Phil. 3:21) and full conformity to the Lord. In this final step of His salvation God will redeem our fallen and corrupted body (Rom. 8:23) by transfiguring it into the body of Christ&#8217;s glory. He will also conform us to the glorious image of Christ, His firstborn Son (Rom. 8:29), making us wholly and absolutely like Him in our regenerated spirit, transformed soul, and transfigured body. Thus, our body will be freed from the slavery of corruption of the old creation into the glory of God&#8217;s new creation (8:21).<h2 class=head1>P. BRANCHES OF THE CULTIVATED OLIVE TREE</h2><p>We have seen that the believers are symbolized by the branches of the vine (John 15:5, 8). Now we need to see that the believers are also symbolized by the branches of the cultivated olive tree. Romans 11:24 tells us that we &#8220;were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree.&#8221; In this way we &#8220;became a fellow partaker of the root of the fatness of the olive tree&#8221; (v. 17).<h2 class=head2>1. The Cultivated Olive Tree Being the God-chosen Race of Israel with Christ as the Reality of Their Life and Everything</h2><p>The cultivated olive tree in Romans 11:24 is the God-chosen race of Israel with Christ as the reality of their life and everything (Rom. 9:4-8). The cultivated olive tree is not merely Israel-it is Israel with Christ as reality. Apart from Christ, the children of Israel are empty, void of reality. The book of Romans reveals that they are God&#8217;s chosen people with Christ as their reality.<p>Christ is the root of this cultivated olive tree. Apart from the root a tree is nothing. Christ is the root of the God-chosen race of Israel. Furthermore, the riches of the olive tree for our enjoyment are in Christ as the root of this tree. If a tree is cut off from its root, it loses everything. Today Israel is still rejecting Christ and thereby cut off from Him. But one day they will come back to Him. During the time in which Israel is cut off from Christ, we, the Gentiles, are being grafted into the cultivated olive tree that we may enjoy Christ as the root of the fatness of this tree.<p>Hosea 11:1 and Matthew 2:15 prove that Christ is the reality of the life of Israel as the cultivated olive tree. Hosea 11:1 says, &#8220;When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.&#8221; Matthew 2:15 applies this prophecy to Christ&#8217;s being brought out of Egypt. Therefore, this prophecy and its fulfillment join Christ to Israel. Hosea 11:1 and Matthew 2:15 prove that Christ is absolutely united to the race of Israel. In fact, God even considers Christ to be Israel, because He is the root of the cultivated olive tree. If the stump and branches of a tree are regarded as the tree, surely the root of the tree must even the more be considered the tree itself. This certainly is true of Christ in relation to Israel.<h2 class=head2>2. The Gentile Believers as the Branches of This Cultivated Olive Tree Having Been Grafted into It to Be Fellow Partakers of the Root of Its Fatness</h2><p>The Gentile believers as the branches of this cultivated olive tree have been grafted into it to be fellow partakers of the root of its fatness, that is, to enjoy the riches of Christ, who is the root of the children of Israel. We praise the Lord that we, the wild olive tree, have been grafted into God&#8217;s cultivated olive tree that we may be fellow partakers of its root of fatness. This is our enjoyment.<p>Our being grafted into the cultivated olive tree is altogether a matter of life. For the branch of a wild olive tree to be grafted into the cultivated olive tree is for it to receive the life of the cultivated tree. What we needed as Gentiles was not to change our religion but to receive the life of the root of the fatness of the cultivated olive tree, which life is Christ. Through our faith in Christ we have been grafted into the olive tree cultivated by God with Christ as life, and now we are enjoying the riches of the root, the riches of Christ.<h2 class=head1>Q. A SPECTACLE</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 4:9 the believers are symbolized by the unusual figure of a spectacle, a public gazingstock: &#8220;God has set forth us the apostles last of all, as doomed to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.&#8221; In the New Testament all the overcoming believers, not only the apostles, are likened to such a spectacle, such a gazingstock for the public.<h2 class=head2>1. Like the Show of the Fights between Criminals and Wild Beasts in the Roman Amphitheater, Exposed to the Public as a Gazingstock</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 4:9 Paul uses the phrase &#8220;last of all.&#8221; This expression, commonly understood at the time, refers to the last part of the performance in the Roman amphitheater. According to ancient custom, when the criminals fought with wild animals in the amphitheater for the entertainment of the populace, the criminals, who were regarded as nothing, the lowest of people, were exhibited last of all. The last act, the last show, was that of condemned criminals fighting with wild beasts for the entertainment of the people. The phrase &#8220;last of all&#8221; refers to this. In verse 9 Paul uses this expression metaphorically to convey the thought that God had set forth the apostles, and all the overcoming believers, last of all, as if they were the lowest criminals condemned to death, to be entertainment for the people. The apostles, therefore, considered themselves criminals doomed to death before the world.<p>Paul also says in 4:9 that the apostles had become &#8220;a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;spectacle&#8221; is the word for theater. It refers to a show, a display, made in a theatrical way as entertainment. This also is a metaphor, referring to fights between criminals and wild beasts in the amphitheater.<h2 class=head2>2. To the World, both to Angels and to Men</h2><p>The apostles became a spectacle to the world, seen not only by men but also by angels. Both men on earth and angels in the air were watching the exhibition of the apostles. Hence, they were a spectacle to the whole universe. This is related to their becoming &#8220;the offscouring of the world&#8221; and &#8220;the scum of all things&#8221; (v. 13).<p>The metaphors in 4:9 present a vivid picture of the situation of the apostles and the overcoming believers they were criminals condemned to fight with wild beasts for people&#8217;s entertainment. Today this is also our destiny in the sight of man. However, in the sight of God our destiny is to enjoy Christ. We who enjoy Christ have become as criminals in the sight of man for their enjoyment. But in the sight of God Christ is our destiny for our enjoyment. While others mock us and ridicule us for their entertainment, we are enjoying Christ. This shows that we have two destinies. Our destiny in the sight of God is to have Christ for our enjoyment. Our destiny in the sight of men is to be regarded as criminals condemned to death for others&#8217; entertainment. If we are faithful to the Lord, as Paul was, this will be our destiny before men. We shall be set forth last of all, and we shall be made a spectacle both to angels and to men.<h2 class=head2>3. Both in Reproaches and in Afflictions</h2><p>Hebrews 10:33a speaks of our &#8220;being made a spectacle both in reproaches and in afflictions.&#8221; This is to become a show exposed to the public, a gazingstock.<h2 class=head2>4. The Apostles, as the Criminals, Becoming the Partakers with Those Who Experienced the Same</h2><p>Hebrews 10:33b speaks of the apostles and the overcoming believers &#8220;having become partakers with those who experienced the same.&#8221; On the one hand, we are made a spectacle; on the other hand, we become partakers with those who have experienced the same thing. Many of the overcoming ones in the Old Testament had the experience of being a spectacle. Now the apostles and the overcoming believers are partakers with them, being the continuation of such a gazingstock. Therefore, we are a spectacle to the world. We in the Lord&#8217;s recovery should be like the apostles-criminals doomed to death and a spectacle both to angels and to men. We should give others the impression that we are as criminals condemned to death and a spectacle to the whole universe.<h2 class=head1>R. THE OFFSCOURING OF THE WORLD AND THE SCUM OF ALL THINGS</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 4:13 Paul says, &#8220;We have become as the offscouring of the world, as the scum of all things until now.&#8221; Offscouring and scum are synonymous. Offscouring denotes that which is thrown away in cleansing; hence, refuse, filth. Scum denotes that which is wiped off; hence, rubbish, refuse. Both synonyms are metaphorically used, especially of condemned criminals of the lowest class, who were cast into the sea or to the wild beasts in the amphitheater. Here Paul likens himself to the lowest criminals, to offscouring, scum, rubbish, refuse. This was Paul&#8217;s estimation of himself with respect to both the Jews and the Gentiles. In the eyes of certain worldly people our situation is the same. Compared to them, we are scum and offscouring. They may be extremely successful and wealthy, but we have become the offscouring of the world and the scum of all things. We are qualified only to become cast aside as waste.<h2 class=head1>S. THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>The believers are the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:16-20). In 1 Corinthians 3:16 Paul asks, &#8220;Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you?&#8221; In 6:19 he inquires, &#8220;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?&#8221; The temple of God in 3:16 refers to the church corporately, not to the believers individually, whereas the temple of the Holy Spirit in 6:19 does refer to individual believers. In particular, 6:19 reveals that a believer&#8217;s body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head2>1. The Holy Spirit from God Being Not Only with the Believers&#8217; Spirit but Also in Their Body as His Dwelling</h2><p>Romans 8:16 tells us that the Holy Spirit is with the believers&#8217; spirit. According to 1 Corinthians 6:19, the Holy Spirit from God is also in the believers&#8217; body as His dwelling. The Holy Spirit is in our spirit, and our spirit is within our body. Hence, our body becomes a temple, a dwelling, of the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head2>2. They Are Not Their Own, For They Were Bought by God with a Price</h2><p>The believers are not their own, for they were bought by God with a price. In 6:19b and 20a Paul indicates that the believers are not their own because they were bought with a price. This price is the precious blood of Christ (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 1:18-19; Rev. 5:9).<h2 class=head2>3. They, as the Dwelling of the Spirit, Should Glorify, Express, God in Their Body</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 6:20b Paul concludes his word concerning the believers being a temple of the Holy Spirit: &#8220;Therefore glorify God in your body.&#8221; As the dwelling of the Spirit, the believers should glorify, that is, express, God in their body. To glorify God in our body means to let God, who dwells in us (1 John 4:13), occupy and saturate our body and express Himself through our body as His temple, especially in the matters of eating and marriage, according to the context of the section of 1 Corinthians from 6:13 through 11:1. For this, we need to exercise a severe and strict control over our body, bringing it into subjection (1 Cor. 9:27) and presenting it to God as a living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1).<p>In 1 Corinthians 6:15, 17, and 19 Paul covers three crucial matters: that our bodies are the members of Christ (v. 15), that we are joined to the Lord as one spirit (v. 17), and that our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit (v. 19). In actuality and practicality these three are one. The key to all three is in verse 17. Apart from being joined to the Lord in our spirit, it is impossible for our bodies, which are sinful and lustful, to become the members of Christ. Another crucial matter related to this is Paul&#8217;s word in verse 14 that the Lord &#8220;will raise up us through His power.&#8221; Even now the Spirit of the resurrected Christ who dwells in our spirit gives life to our body. This impartation of life makes our bodies the members of Christ and the temple of the Holy Spirit. Hence, the key to our being the temple of the Holy Spirit is that the indwelling Spirit of the resurrected Christ imparts life to our mortal bodies. Because this is the key, we must exercise and practice to experience the Lord as the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit. This is to practice being one spirit with the Lord. If we exercise ourselves to experience and enjoy this, we shall open the way for the Lord to impart life to our physical bodies. Then our bodies will be full of the resurrection life of Christ and will become the members of Christ. When our body becomes a member of the indwelling Christ, it automatically becomes the temple, the dwelling place, of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, in our experience the three matters of our bodies being members of Christ, of being one spirit with the Lord, and of our body being the temple of the Holy Spirit are three aspects of one reality.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR SYMBOLS</h1><h1 class=msg>(5)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover more symbols of the believers: threshing oxen, runners in a race and contenders in a game, workman in carpentry, nursing mother, father, wise master builder, ambassadors, stewards, captives of Christ in His triumphal procession, and incense-bearers.<h2 class=head1>T. THRESHING OXEN</h2><p>We come now to another unusual symbol of the believers-threshing oxen. In 1 Corinthians 9:9 and 10a the believers are likened to laboring oxen that thresh the harvest: &#8220;In the law of Moses it is written: You shall not muzzle a threshing ox. Is it for the oxen that God cares? Or does He say it assuredly for our sake? For our sake.&#8221; Here Paul quotes the Old Testament in a wonderful way and applies it to the present situation, in particular, to the situation of those who labor in serving the Lord.<p>In 1 Timothy 5:18 Paul again quotes Deuteronomy 25:4, saying, &#8220;You shall not muzzle a threshing ox.&#8221; According to the context, those who labor in word and teaching (v. 17) may be fully occupied, devoting all their time to this. Therefore, the church and the saints should care for their living. For this reason, in verse 18 Paul refers to what the Scripture says about not muzzling a threshing ox.<h2 class=head2>1. Laboring with Their Mouth Not Muzzled</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 9:9 Paul likened himself to an ox laboring for Christ. However, the Corinthians wanted to muzzle him; that is, they wanted him to work without being fed. This is the reason Paul pointed out that while threshing oxen are laboring to thresh the harvest, their mouths should not be muzzled.<h2 class=head2>2. Eating What Is under Their Threshing</h2><p>Instead of being muzzled, threshing oxen should eat what is under their threshing. This means that while they are laboring to thresh the harvest, they should be free to eat what they are threshing.<h2 class=head1>U. RUNNERS IN A RACE AND CONTENDERS IN A GAME</h2><p>&#8220;Do you not know that those who run in a race-course all run, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may lay hold. And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; those, therefore, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:24-25). These verses reveal that the believers are runners in a race and contenders in a game. The Christian life is a race that we must run successfully and a game in which we must contend. The prize is a reward as an incentive; to &#8220;lay hold&#8221; is to obtain the prize.<p>If we consider verse 24 in relation to verse 23, we shall see that to run in a race-course is to labor, but to receive the prize is to have enjoyment. As we preach the gospel today, we are running the course. But to receive a reward, a prize, at the coming of the Lord Jesus is to have a particular enjoyment.<p>In 9:17 Paul speaks of a reward, and in Acts 20:24 he refers to the course: &#8220;I consider my life of no account as if it were precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify the gospel of the grace of God.&#8221; Paul regarded his preaching of the gospel as the running of the Christian race. First Corinthians 9:24 indicates that all believers are running a race. Paul exhorts us to run so that we may obtain, lay hold of, the prize.<p>First Corinthians 9 reveals that the Christian course involves the preaching of the gospel. To preach the gospel is to dispense Christ into others. By dispensing Christ into those who are receptive to our preaching we run the Christian course. However, because many believers today are not running the race, we need Paul&#8217;s word, &#8220;So run, that you may lay hold.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>1. To Receive the Prize-an Incorruptible Crown</h2><p>The prize in verse 24 is a reward as an incentive, and this reward is an incorruptible crown, which the Lord will award His overcoming saints who win the race. This reward is in addition to salvation (Heb. 10:35). Eternal salvation is by faith, having nothing to do with our work (Eph. 2:8-9), whereas reward is for our work after we are saved (1 Cor. 3:8, 14). We may not receive a reward but rather suffer loss, even though we are saved, because we are void of the work which the Lord would approve (1 Cor. 3:15). The reward will be given to us according to our works at the Lord&#8217;s coming back (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 1 Cor. 4:5). It will be decided by the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10) and enjoyed in the coming kingdom (Matt. 25:21, 23). The Apostle Paul strived to gain the reward (1 Cor. 9:24-27; Phil. 3:13-14; 2 Tim. 4:7-8).<p>We, the believers in Christ, have all received His salvation through faith in Him. This has been settled once for all. But whether we shall be rewarded by Him depends on how we run the race. In 1 Corinthians 9 Paul is running the course. In Philippians, one of his last Epistles, he was still running (Phil. 3:14). It was not until the last moment of his running, in 2 Timothy 4:6-8, that Paul had the assurance that he would be rewarded by the Lord at His appearing. With this reward in view, Paul charges the believers to run the race so that they may obtain the reward.<h2 class=head2>2. By Exercising Self-control in All Things</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 9:25 Paul speaks of exercising self-control in all things. All those who contend in the games, Paul says, exercise strict self-control. For instance, they watch their diet very carefully. If athletes exercise self-control in order to receive a corruptible crown, we should exercise self-control even more to obtain an incorruptible crown. Only by the exercise of self-control can we be runners in the race and contenders in the game.<h2 class=head2>3. By Putting Off Every Encumbrance and the Entangling Sin</h2><p>Hebrews 12:1 says, &#8220;Let us also, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, putting off every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, run with endurance the race which is set before us.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;encumbrance&#8221; may also be rendered weight, burden, impediment. The runners in a race must strip off every unnecessary weight, every encumbering burden, that they may have no impediment to running the race. It is easy for us to pick up unnecessary burdens. But if we would run the Christian race, we need to put off every encumbrance, every unnecessary burden or impediment.<p>According to Hebrews 12:1, we also need to put off the sin which so easily entangles us. Here &#8220;the sin&#8221; refers mainly to the thing that entangles us from running the race. Both the encumbering weight and the entangling sin frustrate us in running the race. The encumbrances are outward, but the sin is inward, for it involves our sinful nature. Within our sinful nature there is something that often entangles us. In order to run the course of the Christian life, we need to put off the entangling sin.<h2 class=head2>4. Running with Endurance</h2><p>Because there is much opposition to the Christian race, we need to run it with endurance. For this reason, Hebrews 12:1 charges us to &#8220;run with endurance the race which is set before us.&#8221; In order to run the race, we must suffer the opposition with endurance, never growing weary or fainting in our souls (v. 3).<h2 class=head2>5. Contending Lawfully</h2><p>&#8220;If also anyone contends in the games, he is not crowned unless he contends lawfully&#8221; (2 Tim. 2:5). An athlete must contend lawfully to receive the crown. If we would receive the prize, the incorruptible crown, we must contend lawfully.<h2 class=head1>V. WORKMAN IN CARPENTRY</h2><p>Second Timothy 2:15 says that Timothy should present himself &#8220;approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth.&#8221; This indicates that some of the believers who know the truth should learn to be workmen in carpentry to cut the word of the truth straight, that is, to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion.<h2 class=head1>W. NURSING MOTHER</h2><p>In 1 Thessalonians 2:7 Paul says, &#8220;But we were gentle in your midst, as a nurse would cherish her own children.&#8221; The Greek word rendered nurse, trophos, sometimes means a mother; hence, it may denote a nursing mother (see Gal. 4:19). Cherishing includes nourishing. Therefore, this word not only includes nourishing but also includes tender care.<p>Even though Paul was a brother, he considered himself a nursing mother. Surely, he had no thought of position, dignity, or authority. The thought of being a nursing mother is very different from the thought of dignity or position. What position does a nursing mother have? What rank, dignity, or authority belongs to her? Her dignity consists in nourishing and cherishing her children, in taking care of them in a tender way.<p>The word &#8220;cherish&#8221; is lovely, a word of utmost tenderness. Paul regarded himself as a cherishing one, not merely as one who serves. He certainly did not control the believers. Neither did he merely serve them. Rather, he cherished them. His care for them was full of tenderness.<h2 class=head1>X. FATHER</h2><p>First Thessalonians 2:11 says, &#8220;Even as you know how we were to each one of you, as a father his own children, entreating you and consoling and testifying.&#8221; The apostle was strong in stressing what or how they were (1 Thes. 1:5), for what they were opened the way to bring the new converts into God&#8217;s full salvation.<p>In 2:11 Paul likens himself to a father exhorting his children. In cherishing the believers as their own children, the apostles considered themselves nourishing mothers. In exhorting them, they considered themselves fathers.<p>In 1 Corinthians 4:15 Paul says, &#8220;Though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.&#8221; Guides give instructions and directions to the children under their guardianship; fathers impart life to their children whom they beget. The apostle was such a father. He had begotten the Corinthian believers in Christ through the gospel, imparting the divine life into them so that they became children of God and members of Christ.<h2 class=head1>Y. WISE MASTER BUILDER</h2><p>Paul in 1 Corinthians 3:10 tells us, &#8220;According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, but another builds upon it.&#8221; In Matthew 16:18 the Lord says He will build His church; yet here the apostle says he is a builder, even a wise master builder. This indicates that the Lord builds the church not directly but through His ministers, even through every member of His Body, as revealed in Ephesians 4:16. Although in 1 Corinthians 3:6 and 7 the apostle admits that he is nothing, he frankly and faithfully makes clear here that by the grace of God he is a wise master builder who has laid the unique foundation, Christ, for others to build upon.<h2 class=head1>Z. AMBASSADORS</h2><p>In both 2 Corinthians 5:20 and Ephesians 6:20 Paul says that he and his co-workers were ambassadors of Christ. An ambassador is one sent by a particular authority to contact certain people. The faithful believers are ambassadors sent by God, the highest authority in the universe. They are one with God, representing God to carry out His purpose in Christ on this earth.<h2 class=head1>AA. STEWARDS</h2><p>In Luke 16:1 the Lord illustrates the believers, saved by the love and grace of the Triune God, as His stewards, to whom He has committed His possessions.<p>In 1 Peter 4:10 Peter tells us that all the believers, who have received a gift, should minister &#8220;it among themselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God.&#8221;<p>In 1 Corinthians 4:1 Paul considers himself and his co-workers as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. The Greek word for stewards is the same root as the word economy or dispensation in 1 Timothy 1:4 and Ephesians 1:10. It means a dispensing steward, a household administrator, who dispenses the household supply to its members. The apostles were appointed by the Lord to be such stewards, dispensing God&#8217;s mysteries, which are Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ (Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4), to the believers.<h2 class=head1>BB. CAPTIVES OF CHRIST IN HIS TRIUMPHAL PROCESSION</h2><p>The believers are also symbolized by captives of Christ in His triumphal procession. Paul says, &#8220;Thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ&#8221; (2 Cor. 2:14a). Here Paul uses the metaphor of a procession held in honor of the victory of a Roman general. Conybeare explains that the &#8220;verb here used means to lead a man as a captive in a triumphal procession; the full phrase means, to lead captive in a triumph over the enemies of Christ....God is celebrating His triumph over His enemies; Paul (who had been so great an opponent of the gospel) is a captive following in the train of the triumphal procession....&#8221; Paul once fought against Christ, the heavenly General, but eventually he was defeated, subdued, and captured and thereby became a captive of Christ. After he was captured, he was placed in Christ&#8217;s triumphal procession as one of the captives in a train of defeated foes.<p>The picture portrayed in 2 Corinthians 2:14 is that of a victorious Roman general leading a procession of former enemies who had been captured by him. As the general returned to the capital, the captives followed him in a procession to celebrate his victory. Paul uses this to illustrate how Christ has gained the victory and has captured the apostles and so many other believers, who have become captives of Christ to follow Him in His triumphal procession.<h2 class=head2>1. Led by God</h2><p>In 2:14a Paul specifically says that it is God who leads us in triumph in the Christ. God always leads the believers in such a triumphant way. As a captive in the triumphant procession, Paul did not do anything according to his own choice, preference, or taste. On the contrary, he was truly led by God, and he took God&#8217;s leading, no matter what it was. As the metaphor in 2:14 indicates, Paul considered himself a captive who had been placed in Christ&#8217;s triumphal procession. There is no choice for such captives. Because Paul, a captive, was willing to be led by God, wherever he went was according to God&#8217;s leading.<h2 class=head2>2. To Celebrate and Participate in Christ&#8217;s Triumph in Their New Testament Ministry Ministering Christ to Others</h2><p>As captives of Christ in His triumphal procession, the believers celebrate and participate in Christ&#8217;s triumph in their New Testament ministry, ministering Christ to others. Paul likens the apostles&#8217; ministry to a celebration of Christ&#8217;s victory. Their move in their ministry for Christ was like a triumphal procession from one place to another under God&#8217;s leading. Paul and his co-workers had been conquered by Christ and had become His captives in the train of His triumph, celebrating His victory. Therefore, Paul&#8217;s ministry was a triumphal procession of the victorious General, the Lord Jesus, leading many captives. This indicates that the ministry of the New Testament is a triumphal procession celebrating Christ&#8217;s victory. Inwardly we should have the sense that we are captives in Christ&#8217;s triumphal procession. As such captives, we are witnesses that once we were enemies of Christ, but we have been defeated, subdued, captured, and made submissive to Him.<p>The ministry of the New Testament is to testify of Christ as the Victor. I believe that as Paul was marching in Christ&#8217;s triumphal procession, he could praise the Lord for His victory and in this way testify of Him. Likewise, as captives of Christ, we can testify that we have been defeated, captured, and subdued by Him. Now we are submissive captives, saying &#8220;amen&#8221; to the Lord&#8217;s victory. This is our ministry.<h2 class=head1>CC. INCENSE-BEARERS</h2><h2 class=head2>1. Scattering the Fragrance of Christ in His Triumphal Procession in Their New Testament Ministry</h2><p>As captives in Christ&#8217;s triumphal procession, we are simultaneously incense-bearers. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 2:14b that through us God manifests the savor of the knowledge of Christ in every place. This indicates that as conquered and captured captives in the train of Christ&#8217;s triumph, we are incense-bearers, scattering the savor of the knowledge of Christ in His triumphant ministry as in a triumphal procession. The believers are such incense-bearers in their ministry of Christ as well as captives in the train of His triumph. Concerning the phrase &#8220;the savor of the knowledge,&#8221; Vincent says, &#8220;According to the Greek usage, savor and knowledge are in apposition, so that the knowledge of Christ is symbolized as an odor communicating its nature and efficacy through the apostle&#8217;s work.&#8221; Therefore, our excellent knowledge of Christ becomes a sweet savor.<p>Because we have been captured, subdued, possessed, and gained by Christ, He has the liberty to saturate us with His fragrance. As a result, we become a savor spreading His sweet fragrance. The metaphor of the incense-bearer illustrates this. As captives of Christ, we are being saturated with His fragrance. In this way, the captives in His procession become incense-bearers.<p>Actually, to scatter the incense of Christ is to live Christ. The Christ we live has incense, and He even is this incense. Therefore, when we scatter the incense of Christ, we scatter Christ Himself. We praise the Lord that it is possible for us to be those who scatter the incense of Christ. When we have been captured, subdued, and led, we shall scatter the incense of Christ.<h2 class=head2>2. To God a Savor from Life unto Life in Those Who Are Being Saved and a Savor from Death unto Death in Those Who Are Perishing</h2><p>The scattering of Christ as incense has an effect: it is a matter of life or death. For those who have been chosen by God, the scattering of incense is unto life. But to others, it is unto death. This is a very serious matter. In 2 Corinthians 2:15 Paul says, &#8220;We are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing.&#8221; The apostles, being permeated with Christ, become a fragrance of Christ. They are not merely a sweet savor produced by Christ, but Christ Himself is the savor being exhaled in their life and work to God, both in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing.<p>In verse 16 Paul continues, &#8220;To the one a savor from death unto death, to the other a savor from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?&#8221; The phrases &#8220;unto death&#8221; and &#8220;unto life&#8221; mean resulting in death or resulting in life. This refers to the different effects of the apostles&#8217; ministry upon different persons. It is a matter of life or death! Only the captives of God in Christ, who are saturated with Christ by the Spirit, are sufficient and qualified for this.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWELVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR SYMBOLS</h1><h1 class=msg>(6)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover the following New Testament symbols of the believers: letters of Christ, mirrors, earthen vessels, pillars, luminaries in the world, good soldiers of Christ, and laboring husbandmen.<h2 class=head1>DD. LETTERS OF CHRIST</h2><p>In 2 Corinthians 3:2 and 3 we have yet another symbol of the believers-letters of Christ. Verse 2 says, &#8220;You are our letter, inscribed in our hearts, known and read by all men.&#8221; The believers were the fruit of the apostles&#8217; labor, commending the apostles and their ministry to others. Thus, they became the apostles&#8217; living letters of commendation, letters written by the apostles with the indwelling Christ as the content in every part of the believers&#8217; inner being.<p>Verse 3 is the continuation of verse 2: &#8220;Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.&#8221; In verse 2 Paul speaks of &#8220;our letter,&#8221; and in verse 3, of &#8220;a letter of Christ.&#8221; It seems that here there are two kinds of letters- the apostles&#8217; letter and the letter of Christ. The believers, as the apostles&#8217; letter, were a letter of Christ. But which comes first, &#8220;a letter of Christ&#8221; or &#8220;our letter?&#8221; The letter of Christ must come first. The believers are the apostles&#8217; letter because they are first a letter of Christ.<h2 class=head2>1. Inscribed with the Spirit of the Living God as the Writing Element</h2><p>As letters of Christ the believers are inscribed with the Spirit of the living God as the writing element. The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not an instrument, like a pen for writing, but the very element, like the ink, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content for the writing of living letters that convey Christ. The writer of this letter is not the Spirit of God; the writer is the apostles. The Spirit of the living God is the &#8220;ink,&#8221; the element, the essence, of the writing. This means that the Spirit of the living God is the element with which the letters of Christ are written.<p>The writing that takes place in our hearts has the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit as the element. This element is actually the processed Triune God. As the processed Triune God is written into us, we become letters of Christ.<h2 class=head2>2. Inscribed in Fleshy Tablets of the Heart</h2><p>In verse 3 Paul says that the letter of Christ is inscribed &#8220;not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.&#8221; Our heart, as the composition of our conscience (the leading part of our spirit), mind, emotion, and will, is the tablet upon which the living letters of Christ are written with the living Spirit of God. This implies that Christ is written into every part of our inner being with the Spirit of the living God to make us His living letters so that He may be expressed in us and read by others in us.<p>Because this letter is written on our heart, a composition of the soul and the conscience, the leading part of our spirit, the letter of Christ is actually written on our spirit and soul. When the apostles minister Christ, they minister Him into the heart and spirit of the believers. First, Christ as the life-giving Spirit is ministered into a believer&#8217;s spirit. This means that Christ is written in the spirit of that believer. Then by further ministry Christ spreads into the mind, the emotion, and the will. Eventually, Christ will be written into every part of our inner being. In the words of Ephesians 3:17, this is Christ settling Himself, or making His home, in our heart. Christ making His home in our heart equals the writing of Christ throughout our inner being. This writing causes a believer to become a living letter of Christ. Such a person expresses Christ in whatever he says and does. He becomes a living letter for others to read.<h2 class=head2>3. Conveying Christ as Their Contents</h2><p>In 3:3 a letter of Christ does not mean a letter written by Christ; rather, this letter is a composition that uses Christ as the alphabet and conveys Christ as the contents. A letter of Christ is one composed of Christ as the contents to convey Christ and express Him.<p>A letter of Christ is composed using Christ as the words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs. From first to last, Christ is every part of such a letter. Therefore, a letter of Christ speaks Christ, for every part of the letter expresses Him. We all should be such living letters of Christ so that others may read and know Christ in our being.<h2 class=head2>4. Read by All Men</h2><p>Finally, the believers as letters of Christ are read by all men (3:2). We are living letters of Christ, living epistles, and others can read the Christ who has been inscribed into us. We need to exhibit to others the Christ who has been written into us. The more Christ is written into our being, the more others will be able to read Him in us.<h2 class=head1>EE. MIRRORS</h2><p>In 2 Corinthians 3:18 the believers are symbolized by mirrors: &#8220;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&#8221; In this verse &#8220;we&#8221; denotes the apostles, who, as examples and representatives of all believers, are ministers of Christ. Because the apostles are our examples and representatives, what they are we should be also. Therefore, this verse is related to us and reveals that we are mirrors. First, the heart turns to the Lord so that the veil may be taken away (v. 16); second, the Lord as the Spirit frees us from the bondage of the law (v. 17); and last, with unveiled face we, as a mirror, behold and reflect the glory of the Lord and thus are transformed into His image from glory to glory.<h2 class=head2>1. Beholding and Reflecting with Unveiled Face the Glory of the Lord</h2><p>According to verse 18, we behold and reflect as a mirror the glory of the Lord. The words &#8220;beholding and reflecting as a mirror&#8221; translate a single word in Greek. Here we have the beholding, the reflecting, and a mirror. Beholding is to see the Lord for ourselves; reflecting is for others to see Him through us. A mirror reflects what it beholds. As a mirror beholds, it reflects what it beholds. We are mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord.<p>The glory in 3:18 is the glory of the Lord as the resurrected and ascended One, who is both God and man, passing through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion, accomplishing full redemption, entering into resurrection, and becoming a life-giving Spirit. This Spirit dwells in us to make Christ and all He has accomplished, obtained, and attained real to us so that we may be one with Him and be transformed into His image from glory to glory.<p>In our experience we all should be mirrors looking at the Lord and reflecting Him. However, if we would be mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord, we need to be unveiled. There must not be any veils covering us. Suppose a mirror is proper in every way. It is in the right position with respect to the object it is to behold and reflect. But the mirror is covered with a veil. As long as a mirror is covered with cloth, veiled, it loses its function. The veil keeps the mirror both from beholding and from reflecting. Likewise, if we are veiled, we cannot behold and reflect the Lord&#8217;s glory. But if, by the mercy and grace of the Lord, all the veils are removed, we shall be mirrors beholding and reflecting the Lord with unveiled face.<p>If we want to be unveiled, we need to pray, &#8220;Lord, take away anything that is covering me. Lord, remove my veils. I want to be completely open and absolutely unveiled so that I may behold and reflect You.&#8221; Then with an unveiled face we shall behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, and we shall be transformed into His image from glory to glory.<h2 class=head2>2. Being Transformed into the Image of the Lord from Glory to Glory, Even as from the Lord Spirit</h2><p>When we with unveiled face are beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done. Thus, we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence, transfigured, mainly by the renewing of our mind (Rom 12:2), into His image. The words &#8220;being transformed&#8221; in 3:18 indicate that we are in the process of transformation.<p>We need to be deeply impressed with what it means to be transformed. To be transformed is to have Christ added into our being to replace what we are so that Christ may increase and our natural life may decrease. As the process of transformation takes place within us, the old element of our natural being is carried away, and the glory, the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit, is added into us to replace the natural element. This is what it means to be transformed.<p>Second Corinthians 3:18 tells us that we are being transformed into &#8220;the same image.&#8221; This image is the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ. The &#8220;same image&#8221; means that we are being conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, being made the same as He is (Rom. 8:29).<p>In 3:18 we are also told that we are being transformed into the same image &#8220;from glory to glory.&#8221; This means that we are being transformed from one degree of glory to another degree. This indicates a continuing process in life in resurrection.<p>The process of being transformed from glory to glory is &#8220;from the Lord Spirit.&#8221; &#8220;From&#8221; indicates that transformation is proceeding from the Spirit rather than being caused by Him.<p>Today glory is the resurrected Christ, and this Christ is the Spirit. This means that the Lord as the glory is the Spirit living in us and dwelling in our spirit. Now that we have the Spirit indwelling our spirit, we need to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord. The more we exercise our spirit with an unveiled face, the more we shall behold the Lord. As we are gazing on Him, we shall also reflect Him. While we are beholding and reflecting Him in this way, His element, His essence, will be added to our being. This new element will replace and discharge the element of our old, natural life. Then we shall experience transformation, a metabolic change. We shall be transformed into the Lord&#8217;s image.<h2 class=head1>FF. EARTHEN VESSELS</h2><h2 class=head2>1. Containing the Christ of Glory as the Excellent Treasure Received by Them through the Illumination of the Gospel of the Glory of Christ</h2><p>In 2 Corinthians 4:7 Paul says, &#8220;We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us.&#8221; Here we have another symbol of the believers-earthen vessels. God&#8217;s shining, which is God&#8217;s dispensing, in our hearts (2 Cor. 4:6) brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything. Because of the shining in our hearts, we have this treasure, a treasure that is wonderful, precious, and marvelous. However, we who contain this treasure are earthen vessels, worthless and fragile. A priceless treasure is contained in these worthless vessels.<p>The Christ of glory as the excellent treasure is received by the believers through the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ. Second Corinthians 4:4 speaks of &#8220;the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ.&#8221; Here we have four matters: illumination, gospel, glory, and Christ. Verse 6 goes on to say, &#8220;The God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts for the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.&#8221; God&#8217;s shining in our hearts results in the illumination of knowing the glory of God in the face of Christ, that is, in the enlightenment that causes us to know the glory of the gospel of Christ. This illumination, this enlightenment, that makes the glory of Christ&#8217;s gospel known to us issues from the shining of God in our hearts. God&#8217;s shining in the universe produced the old creation. His shining in our hearts has made us a new creation, for this shining brings into us, earthen vessels, the marvelous treasure of the Christ of glory.<p>In our preaching of the gospel there should be an illumination, a shining. We need to preach the gospel in a very illuminating way. This means that while we are preaching, God shines into the hearts of those to whom we are speaking. To preach in this way is to present not merely a gospel of certain facts but a gospel of glory. Those who receive the gospel of glory will have Christ as the precious treasure dispensed into them. Then, like us, they will be earthen vessels containing this treasure.<h2 class=head2>2. With the Excellence of the Power of God</h2><p>According to 2 Corinthians 4:7, we have this treasure in earthen vessels &#8220;that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us.&#8221; The Greek word translated excellence may also be rendered transcendence, surpassingness, exceeding greatness. The fact that we are earthen vessels proves that the excellence of the power is of God and not of us. In ourselves we are earthen vessels, fragile and worthless. How can we shine forth the glory of the gospel? We do this with the power that is of God. Although we are earthen vessels, God has shined this precious treasure into us. Now this treasure becomes the source of the power energizing us and enabling us to shine forth God&#8217;s glory. Therefore, this treasure, the indwelling Christ, in the earthen vessels is the divine source of supply for the Christian life. It is by the excellent power of this treasure that we can now live a crucified life so that the resurrection life of Christ may be manifested for the shining of the gospel of the glory of Christ.<p>The shining reality of Christ is the treasure in us, the earthen vessels. Outwardly we are earthen vessels, but inwardly we have a priceless treasure-Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God to be the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This treasure has a power, and this power is excellent. Christ as the life-giving Spirit in us is the One who shines and works. This is the treasure we have in us.<p>In chapters two, three, and four of 2 Corinthians Paul uses five very significant and expressive symbols of the believers: captives in a triumphant procession for the celebration of Christ&#8217;s victory, incense-bearers scattering the fragrance of Christ, letters written with Christ as the content, mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of Christ in order to be transformed into His glorious image, and earthen vessels containing the Christ of glory as the excellent treasure. We need to be deeply impressed with the significance of these symbols. We need to have the consciousness that we are captives of Christ and also His incense-bearers, those bearing Him as incense. We should not simply work for Him but should spread abroad the sweet fragrance of Christ. We also need to realize that we are letters written with the &#8220;ink&#8221; of the Triune God. Moreover, we are mirrors beholding and reflecting Christ and earthen vessels containing Him. How marvelous! We need to consider these symbols again and again, for they illustrate matters that are deep, profound, and experiential. May we experience all the matters indicated by these symbols. We all need to be such believers.<h2 class=head1>GG. PILLARS</h2><h2 class=head2>1. The Prominent Ones among Them in the Church Today</h2><p>According to Galatians 2:9 and Revelation 3:12, the believers are symbolized by pillars. First, the pillars are the prominent ones among the believers in the church today. This is indicated in Galatians 2:9 where Paul speaks of &#8220;James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars.&#8221; These pillars were prominent ones in the church at Jerusalem.<h2 class=head2>2. The Overcomers among Them in the Temple of God in the Coming Age and in Eternity</h2><p>The pillars are also the overcomers among the believers in the temple of God in the coming age and in eternity. Revelation 3:12 says, &#8220;He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore.&#8221; Here we see that the overcomer will be made a pillar built into the temple of God. Because he is built into God&#8217;s building, &#8220;he shall by no means go out anymore.&#8221; This promise will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom as a prize to the overcomer.<p>In Revelation 3:12 the word &#8220;make&#8221; is very significant. The Lord says that He will make the overcomer into a pillar. The Lord makes us pillars by transforming us, that is, by carrying away our natural element and by replacing it with His divine essence. Therefore, the meaning of &#8220;make&#8221; in 3:12 is to constitute us into something, to construct us in a creative way. In the church life today the Lord is making us, constituting us, into pillars in the temple of God. The Lord&#8217;s work in the church is to work Himself into us as the divine flow to carry away our natural being and replace it with His substance that we may be gradually processed by His transforming element. As the result of this transforming work, we become pillars in the temple of God.<p>Revelation 3:12 tells us that the overcomers will be pillars in the temple of God in the coming age. However, Revelation 21:22, speaking of the New Jerusalem in the coming age and in eternity, says, &#8220;I saw no temple in it, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.&#8221; Here we see that in the New Jerusalem the Triune God Himself will be the temple. This means that for the overcomers to be pillars in the temple means that they will be pillars in the Triune God. This involves being mingled with the Triune God and constituted of Him. This is a mystery.<p>Even in today&#8217;s church life, the overcoming saints are pillars in the Triune God. Furthermore, these saints sometimes have the consciousness that the church is actually nothing other than the Triune God. This fact is indicated by the golden lampstands as a symbol of the church (Rev. 1:12, 20). Furthermore, the lampstand is the embodiment and expression of the Triune God. The gold of the lampstand signifies the nature of the Father; the form signifies Christ as the embodiment and image of God; and the seven lamps signify the Spirit as the expression. Therefore, the lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God and also a symbol of the church. Hence, it is not too much to say that, in actuality, the church is the Triune God, because the lampstand is the church and also the embodiment of the Triune God. Now we can see that the pillars in the church today are pillars in the Triune God. In the coming age these overcoming believers will be pillars in the temple of God, which is God Himself. From this we see that being made a pillar involves the Triune God being mingled with and constituted into the faithful overcomers.<h2 class=head1>HH. LUMINARIES IN THE WORLD</h2><p>Philippians 2:15 reveals that the believers are luminaries in the world: &#8220;That you may become blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world.&#8221; Literally the Greek word translated &#8220;lights&#8221; here is luminaries, which reflect the light of the sun, Christ. As children of God with the divine life and nature, we have a special function-the function of shining. Because we have the divine life and nature, we have become luminaries reflecting Christ as the real sun. Whenever we cooperate with God&#8217;s inward operation (Phil. 2:13) according to the divine life and nature, we shine with the light of Christ.<h2 class=head2>1. Children of God, Blameless and Guileless, without Blemish in the Midst of a Crooked and Perverted Generation</h2><p>In 2:15 Paul speaks of the believers as children of God. This implies regeneration, the new birth. To be a child of God means that we have been born of God, that God has been conceived within us. When we became children of God, God was conceived in our being. This means that when we were born of God in our spirit, we were mingled with Him. God has been conceived within us, and we have been born of Him to become His children.<p>The expression &#8220;children of God&#8221; in 2:15 is very rich in its implications. It implies that God has actually been born into us and that we possess His life and nature. Sometimes we may say, &#8220;I am just a sinner saved by grace.&#8221; Although this, of course, is true, it is very shallow compared with the revelation in the New Testament. If we know the truth of the Word, we shall not say that we are merely sinners saved by grace. We shall have the boldness to declare, &#8220;I am a child of God born of the Spirit!&#8221; No doubt, we are sinners who have been saved by God&#8217;s grace. But because we have been born of God, we are now His children. How marvelous!<p>We can be children of God only by having the life of God. How wonderful it is to have God&#8217;s life! Just as a child has the life of his parents, so as children of God we have the life of God. All those who are truly children of God need to realize that they have the divine life within them. It is this life that makes us luminaries.<p>As children of God we should be blameless and guileless. The Greek word rendered &#8220;guileless&#8221; also means simple, artless, innocent; hence, harmless (Matt. 10:16). The Greek root of this word means unmixed. Blameless describes our outward behavior, and guileless, our inward character. If we are blameless and guileless, we shall be without blemish. To be without blemish is the total quality of being blameless and guileless.<p>Philippians 2:15 goes on to tell us that as children of God who are blameless and guileless, we are without blemish &#8220;in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;perverted&#8221; literally means warped, twisted. The generation in which we live is crooked, warped, and twisted. However, as children of God we must be different. Because we are God&#8217;s children, we should be both blameless and guileless, without blemish.<h2 class=head2>2. Shining among the Sinful Generation by Reflecting the Light of the Sun, Christ</h2><p>As lights, or luminaries, the believers shine among the sinful generation by reflecting the light of the sun, Christ (Mal. 4:2; Luke 1:78). Actually, we have no light in ourselves. Our shining is simply the reflection of light which we receive from another source. Christ is the light, the real sun, and we reflect Him. Therefore, our shining is our reflection of Christ as the source of our light.<p>Ultimately, the New Jerusalem as the aggregate of all the redeemed and perfected saints, will be a great luminary, shining the glory of God in Christ over all the nations (Rev. 21:11, 24a).<h2 class=head1>II. GOOD SOLDIERS OF CHRIST</h2><p>The believers are also soldiers of Christ. Second Timothy 2:3 says, &#8220;Take your share in suffering evil as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.&#8221; The apostles considered their ministry a warfare for Christ, just as the priestly service was considered a military service, a warfare, in Numbers 4:23, 30, 35 (lit.). Whenever we minister Christ to others, we find ourselves in a battle. Hence, we should be soldiers fighting for God&#8217;s interest.<h2 class=head2>1. Sharing the Suffering of Evil</h2><p>In 2 Timothy 2:3 Paul speaks of suffering evil as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. The first aspect of being a good soldier of Christ is to share in suffering evil. To suffer evil means to suffer persecution. A minister of Christ is one who shares in the suffering of such evil.<h2 class=head2>2. Not Entangling Themselves with the Affairs of Life That They May Please the One Who Enlisted Them</h2><p>In 2 Timothy 2:4 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;No one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life, that he may please the one who enlisted him.&#8221; The word for &#8220;life&#8221; here in Greek is bios, indicating the physical life in this age. To fight a good fight (4:7) for the Lord&#8217;s interest on this earth we must be cleared of any earthly entanglement. The matter of our material, physical life should not entangle us as we are endeavoring to minister Christ to others. This ministry is a fighting, and the fighting requires that we be free from entanglement. On the one hand, the priestly service is a ministry to God; on the other hand, it is a warfare against God&#8217;s enemies. As the priests were bearing the ark of testimony, they had to be prepared to fight against those who might attack this testimony.<h2 class=head2>3. Carrying On a War Not at Their Own Expense</h2><p>The good soldiers of Christ should not carry on a war at their own expense. &#8220;Who at any time carries on a war at his own expense?&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:7a). This word was spoken as part of Paul&#8217;s vindication of his rights as an apostle. Paul&#8217;s reference to carrying on a war implies that formerly the believers at Corinth were captives and that Paul had fought for them so that they might be released from Satan and set at liberty. It should not have been necessary for him to carry on such a war at his own expense. It is not fair that a good soldier of Christ must do so.<h2 class=head1>JJ. LABORING HUSBANDMEN</h2><h2 class=head2>1. The First to Partake of the Fruits</h2><p>Second Timothy 2:6 says, &#8220;The laboring husbandman must be the first to partake of the fruits.&#8221; Here Paul likens Timothy to a husbandman, a farmer. Just as a soldier must win the victory and an athlete must receive the crown, so a husbandman must partake of the fruits, the food.<p>The most significant thing related to being a laboring husbandman, a farmer, is labor. A farmer must labor day and night. But it is an encouragement to him, a comfort, that he is also the first to enjoy the fruits.<h2 class=head2>2. By Awaiting the Precious Fruit through Longsuffering</h2><p>As laboring husbandmen, we should await the precious fruit through longsuffering (James 5:7; 1 Cor. 9:10b). Waiting for this precious fruit requires patience. As athletes we should be quick, but as farmers we need to be patient. If out of impatience a farmer would pluck up the tiny sprouts, his crop would be ruined. Likewise, if he drives his cattle too much, he may hurt them. With both crops and livestock, farmers must learn to have patience.<p>James 5:7 says, &#8220;Behold, the farmer awaits the precious fruit of the earth, being longsuffering over it until it receives the early and late rain.&#8221; The word &#8220;longsuffering&#8221; here expresses patience toward persons, as toward those who persecuted the prophets. In addition to being patient with persons, we also need to be patient with our circumstances. Through patience we shall receive the precious fruit.<p>In 1 Corinthians 9:10b Paul says, &#8220;The plower should plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope of partaking.&#8221; Here Paul again likens the church to a farm. In 3:9 he had already told the believers at Corinth that they were God&#8217;s farm. As a laboring husbandman, Paul plowed the ground and threshed in hope of partaking. Like Paul and Timothy, all believers in Christ should be laboring husbandmen.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE BELIEVERS-THEIR SYMBOLS</h1><h1 class=msg>(7)</h1><p>We come now to the last four New Testament symbols of the believers: stars, the man-child, the firstfruit and the harvest, and jasper and other precious stones.<h2 class=head1>KK. STARS</h2><h2 class=head2>1. The Shining Ones in the Churches Who Are the Serving Ones (Angels) of the Churches, Responsible for the Testimony of Jesus</h2><p>In the book of Revelation stars are the shining ones in the churches who are the serving ones (angels) of the churches, responsible for the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1:20, 2, 9). Revelation 1:20 says, &#8220;The seven stars are messengers of the seven churches.&#8221; These messengers are the spiritual ones in the churches. They may not be responsible for the affairs of the church, but they are responsible for bearing the testimony of Jesus. As stars, they should be of the heavenly nature and in a heavenly position.<p>In the Acts and the Epistles the elders were the leading ones in the operation of the local churches (Acts 14:23; 20:17; Titus 1:5). The eldership is somewhat official, and at the time the book of Revelation was written the offices in the churches had deteriorated in the degradation of the church. Therefore, in this book the Lord calls our attention back to spiritual reality. For this reason, Revelation emphasizes the stars, the messengers, of the churches rather than the elders. The office of the elders is easily perceived, but the believers need to see the importance of the spiritual and heavenly reality of the stars for the proper church life to bear the testimony of Jesus in the darkness of the church&#8217;s degradation.<p>The stars may or may not be elders. It is certain that they are the faithful ones, the genuinely spiritual ones, the overcoming ones among the saints in the church. In the sight of God such ones are shining stars.<p>All believers should aspire to be stars. Do not aspire to have a position-desire to be a shining star. We all, not only the leading ones in the local churches, must be stars. What the Lord Jesus wrote to the messengers, the stars, in Revelation 2 and 3 was what He wrote to the whole church. This indicates that we all can be stars. This is not a matter of title or position; it is absolutely a matter of shining. We all need to be shining stars bearing the testimony of Jesus.<h2 class=head2>2. Held in the Hand of Christ the Head of the Church</h2><p>The stars are held in the hand of Christ the Head of the church. Revelation 1:16a says, &#8220;He had in His right hand seven stars,&#8221; and 2:1 tells us that the Lord &#8220;holds the seven stars in His right hand&#8221; as He walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands. The messengers of the churches, the spiritual ones, signified by the stars, are held in the right hand of the Lord, and the Lord is walking in the midst of the churches signified by the seven golden lampstands. What a wonderful scene! While the Lord is sitting at the right hand of God as our High Priest interceding for us (Heb. 7:25), He is holding the stars and walking in the midst of the churches to care for them. This is very comforting. The leading ones should praise the Lord that they are in His hand and that He is holding them. Christ truly takes the responsibility for His testimony.<h2 class=head2>3. Participating in and Enjoying the Seven Spirits of God</h2><p>In Revelation 3:1 the Lord Jesus refers to Himself as &#8220;He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars.&#8221; This indicates that the stars participate in and enjoy the seven Spirits of God. The seven Spirits are one with the seven stars, and the seven stars are one with the seven Spirits. If we are one with the seven Spirits, we shall eventually become stars, for the seven Spirits make it possible for the believers to be shining stars. This means that the searching, infusing, enlightening sevenfold Spirit is for the shining stars. The Spirit&#8217;s searching and enlightening are for the stars&#8217; shining. In other words, the stars&#8217; shining comes from the searching and enlightening of the sevenfold Spirit. During the time of the degradation of the church, the faithful ones need to be filled with the sevenfold Spirit so that they may be shining stars bearing the living testimony of Jesus.<h2 class=head1>LL. THE MAN-CHILD</h2><p>Another symbol of the believers is that of the man-child (Rev. 12:5) brought forth by the universal, bright woman. Revelation 12:1 describes this woman as being &#8220;clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.&#8221; In Genesis 37:9 Joseph in his dream saw the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars, signifying his father, his mother, and his eleven brothers. There the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars plus Joseph himself signify the total composition of God&#8217;s people on earth. Based upon the principle of that dream, the sun, the moon, and the twelve stars in Revelation 12 must signify the totality of God&#8217;s people, which is symbolized here by a woman. Most of her being is clothed with the sun. The sun signifies God&#8217;s people in the New Testament age. Before Christ came to the world, it was the dark night of the Old Testament age. When Christ came, it was the sun rising from on high (Luke 1:78), the beginning of the age of the sun. Before that, it was the age of the moon, which signifies God&#8217;s people in the Old Testament time. The moon is under the feet of the woman, for the age of the moon was the age of the law, which should not be exalted as the stars. The stars, which signify the patriarchs, God&#8217;s people before the law was given, are on her head as a crown. All God&#8217;s people in these three ages, who together constitute this woman, are light bearers. Hence, she is the bright woman shining throughout all generations.<p>The woman who brings forth the man-child is a composition of God&#8217;s people in three dispensations: the dispensation of the patriarchs, the dispensation of the law, and the dispensation of grace, which is the dispensation of the church. Therefore, she is a totality, an aggregate, a composition, of all of God&#8217;s people throughout all generations. Through the three dispensations of the patriarchs, the law, and grace, God has gained a people who compose the universal bright woman.<p>The man-child signifies the stronger part of God&#8217;s people. Throughout all generations there have been some stronger ones among God&#8217;s people. In the Bible these are considered a collective unit-the man-child-fighting the battle for God and bringing God&#8217;s kingdom down to earth. In the Bible the woman signifies the weaker one and the man the stronger one (1 Pet. 3:7). Hence, the man-child in Revelation 12:5 signifies the stronger part of God&#8217;s people.<h2 class=head2>1. The Overcomers among Them</h2><p>As the stronger part of the universal woman, the man-child consists of the overcomers among the believers. The fact that the man-child will shepherd the nations with an iron rod indicates that the man-child consists of the overcomers, as mentioned in Revelation 2:26-27. In particular, the man-child consists of the resurrected overcomers. Revelation 12:11 indicates that a number of those who compose the man-child have been martyred for the Lord&#8217;s testimony. This proves that the man-child brought forth by the woman will be the dead and resurrected overcoming saints.<p>Furthermore, the words &#8220;brought forth&#8221; in 12:5 signify resurrection, as in Acts 13:33-34. The man-child, therefore, is composed of overcoming saints who have died and who have been resurrected. The Lord Jesus was brought forth in resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God. Hence, to Him resurrection was a birth. In like manner, the man-child will be brought forth in birth through resurrection. By resurrection the man-child will come into full existence. This means that the resurrection of the dead overcomers will be the delivery of the man-child. From this we see that the man-child does not represent the overcomers who live until the Lord comes back; rather, the man-child represents all the dead overcomers, who will be resurrected shortly before the Lord&#8217;s coming back.<h2 class=head2>2. About to Shepherd All the Nations</h2><p>Revelation 12:5 says that the man-child &#8220;was about to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.&#8221; This is the authority of Christ (Psa. 2:9) which He gives to the overcomers (Rev. 2:26-27). The man-child, the resurrected overcomers, will exercise the authority of Christ over the nations and rule them with Christ in the millennial kingdom (Rev. 20:4, 6).<h2 class=head2>3. To Be Caught Up to God and to His Throne</h2><p>Revelation 12:5 also says that the man-child &#8220;was caught up to God and to His throne.&#8221; To be &#8220;caught up&#8221; is to be raptured. The rapture of the man-child differs from that of the majority of the believers, as mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 4:17. There, the rapture of the majority of the believers will be to the air and at the last trumpet (1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes. 4:16), which will be the seventh trumpet (Rev. 11:15). But in 12:5 the rapture of the man-child will be to the throne of God and before the &#8220;thousand two hundred and sixty days,&#8221; which will be the time of the great tribulation of three and a half years (forty-two months, 12:14; 13:5; 11:2), beginning from the fifth trumpet (9:1). Therefore, whereas the majority of the believers will be raptured to the air near the end of the tribulation, the man-child will be caught up directly to the throne of God in the third heaven before the great tribulation.<h2 class=head1>MM. THE FIRSTFRUIT AND THE HARVEST</h2><p>In Revelation 14 the believers are symbolized by the firstfruit and the harvest. First we shall consider the symbol of the firstfruit and then the symbol of the harvest.<h2 class=head2>1. The Firstfruit</h2><h2 class=head3>a. The Early Overcomers among the Believers as the First Ripe Ones in God&#8217;s Field, Reaped before the Harvest as Firstfruit to God and to the Lamb</h2><p>Revelation 14:4b speaks of those who &#8220;were purchased from among men as firstfruit to God and to the Lamb.&#8221; These are early overcomers who will be the first ripe ones in God&#8217;s field. Hence, they will be reaped before the harvest as firstfruit to God and to the Lamb. According to verses 14 through 16, the harvest will be reaped later. This means that the firstfruit will be raptured to the heavens before the harvest, just as the firstfruit of the good land was reaped and brought into the temple of God before the harvest (Lev. 23:10-11; Exo. 23:19). The events recorded in Revelation 14:6-13, all of which will take place during the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), indicate clearly and prove strongly that the first overcomers as the firstfruit in Revelation 14:1-5 will be raptured before the great tribulation and that the harvest in 14:14-16, which should be the majority of believers, will be raptured towards the end of the great tribulation.<p>Whereas the man-child refers to the dead overcomers throughout all the dispensations, the firstfruit refers to the living overcomers at the end of this age. Just as the man-child will be caught up to the throne of God, so the firstfruit will be caught up to the heavenly mount Zion, to the place of God&#8217;s dwelling in the third heaven. This means that the firstfruit will be raptured not to the air but to the third heaven in order to be in the presence of God and Christ.<h2 class=head3>b. &#8220;Virgins&#8221; Who Were Not Defiled, Who Followed the Lamb Wherever He Went, and in Whose Mouth No Lie Was Found, for They Were without Blemish</h2><p>Speaking of the firstfruit, Revelation 14:4 says: &#8220;These are they who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He may go.&#8221; Verse 5 goes on to say, &#8220;In their mouth no lie was found, for they are without blemish.&#8221; The virginity in verse 4 should be that mentioned by the Lord in Matthew 19:11-12. However, the same principle can be applied to the sisters (1 Cor. 7:7, 37). The principle of virginity is that we should not be defiled by anything earthly. In order to be a living overcomer we must be kept by the Lord&#8217;s grace from every defilement and pollution and live on earth like virgins. We need to follow the principle in verse 4. This principle is that we, sisters and brothers alike, must keep our virginity, looking to the Lord that, by His grace, He would preserve us for Himself.<p>We are also told that the firstfruit &#8220;follow the Lamb wherever He may go.&#8221; It is not that the Lamb follows us but that we follow Him wherever He goes. We all need to learn the lesson of following the Lamb wherever He goes.<p>Verse 5 says of the firstfruit that in &#8220;their mouth no lie was found.&#8221; Lies are the expression and representation of Satan. The Devil is the father of all liars, and lies come out of him (John 8:44). That no lie was found in the mouth of the living overcomers indicates that there is nothing of Satan in their expression.<p>Verse 5 also says that the firstfruit are without blemish. This indicates that they are without spot or wrinkle but are perfect in the holiness of God (Eph. 5:27), absolutely sanctified to God and fully saturated with Him (1 Thes. 5:23).<p>Luke 21:36 and Revelation 3:10 prove that the living overcomers will be raptured before the great tribulation. In Luke 21:36 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Be watchful, at every time beseeching, that you may prevail to escape all these things which are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.&#8221; Here to escape is to be taken, raptured, before the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), which will be a severe trial upon the whole inhabited earth (Rev. 3:10; Luke 17:34-36). To be thus raptured is to be kept &#8220;out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth&#8221; (Rev. 3:10). The fact that the ones raptured before the great tribulation will &#8220;stand before the Son of Man&#8221; indicates that the raptured overcomers will stand before the Savior on mount Zion in the heavens. This corresponds to the standing in Revelation 14:1.<p>In Revelation 3:10 the Lord says, &#8220;I also will keep you out of the hour of trial.&#8221; Here the Lord promises to keep the overcoming ones not only out of the trial but out of the hour of trial. This promise of the Lord, like His promise in Luke 21:36, indicates that the saints who have kept the word of the Lord&#8217;s endurance will be raptured before the great trial. These overcoming ones, the first ones to ripen among the believers in God&#8217;s field on earth, will be raptured to the third heaven.<h2 class=head3>c. Purchased from among Men to Be Raptured to Mount Zion in the Heavens Where the Lamb Is, with His Name and the Name of His Father Written on Their Foreheads</h2><p>The firstfruit are purchased from among men (Rev. 14:4) to be raptured to mount Zion in the heavens, where the Lamb is, with His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads (v. 1). For the firstfruit to be purchased from among men indicates that they are no longer among men but are in the heavens.<p>Revelation 14:1 says, &#8220;I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.&#8221; Here we see that the firstfruit stand with the Lamb on mount Zion. The Zion mentioned here is not the earthly one but the Zion in the heavens (Heb. 12:22). Those who stand with the Lamb on mount Zion are raptured to the heavens before Antichrist&#8217;s persecution of religion. After this rapture, Antichrist will persecute people and compel them to worship him. By this fact we know that the living overcomers are raptured before the great tribulation. According to the Lord&#8217;s word in Luke 21:36, they escape the things which are about to come to pass, that is, all the things of the great tribulation, and stand before the Son of Man.<p>The firstfruit have the name of the Lamb and the name of His Father written on their foreheads. This is the designation of their being one with the Lamb and with the Father and of their belonging to Them. The name of the Lamb and the name of the Father written on the foreheads of these early overcomers is in contrast to the name of the beast written on the foreheads of his worshippers (Rev. 13:16-17). The fact that the firstfruit have the name of the Son and the Father indicate that they are wholly constituted of the Son and the Father.<h2 class=head2>2. The Harvest</h2><h2 class=head3>a. The Majority of the Believers Who Will Be Ripe Later Than the Firstfruit</h2><p>Revelation 14:15 speaks of the harvest: &#8220;Another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, Send forth Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.&#8221; The harvest of the earth is God&#8217;s people on earth, the believers in Christ (1 Cor. 3:9). At His first coming to the earth, the Lord Jesus sowed Himself into His believers (Matt. 13:3-8, 24). All the believers since that time who have received Him as the seed of life have become the crop of God on earth. The first ripe ones will be raptured as the firstfruit to God before the great tribulation. The majority will ripen with the help of the sufferings in the great tribulation and will be reaped near the end of the great tribulation.<p>Literally the Greek word translated &#8220;ripe&#8221; in verse 15 means dried. To be ripe is to be dried of all earthly water. The suffering of the great tribulation will be like the parching sun, drying the earthly waters from the believers who will be left on earth in the great tribulation so that they may ripen.<h2 class=head3>b. To Be Reaped by Christ as the Reaper toward the End of the Great Tribulation at His Coming Back Sitting on a White Cloud</h2><p>The harvest will be reaped by Christ as the Reaper toward the end of the great tribulation, which will take place in Revelation 14:6-13, at His coming back sitting on a white cloud. Revelation 14:14 says, &#8220;I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud One sitting like the Son of Man, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.&#8221; The harvest will be reaped by Christ as the Son of Man. He came as the Son of Man to sow the seed, and He will come again as the Son of Man to reap what He has sown. The golden crown on the Lord&#8217;s head indicates that He is the One crowned with glory (Heb. 2:9). The sharp sickle in His hand indicates that He is the One who reaps God&#8217;s field.<p>Revelation 14:16 says of Christ&#8217;s reaping of the harvest: &#8220;He who sat on the cloud thrust His sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.&#8221; The reaping here will be the rapture of the majority of the believers who will be left on the earth to pass through the greater part of the great tribulation.<p>Revelation 14 covers two kinds of raptures: the rapture of the firstfruit and the rapture of the harvest. The picture in typology portrays this vividly. According to the type in the Old Testament, the early wheat, the firstfruit, was reaped first, and the harvest, the majority of the crop, was reaped later. Moreover, the firstfruit was brought into the temple of God for God&#8217;s enjoyment (Exo. 23:19), but the harvest was taken into the barn, between the field and the farmhouse. From this we see that the firstfruit will be taken to God&#8217;s house-to mount Zion in the heavens-and the harvest will be taken to the air. A period of time after the firstfruit is taken to the Lord Jesus in the third heaven, He will leave the heavens and descend to the air, where He will remain for a shorter period of time. According to the prophecy in 1 Thessalonians 4, the harvest will be raptured to the air.<h2 class=head1>NN. JASPER AND OTHER PRECIOUS STONES</h2><p>Now we come to the last, consummating, and most striking symbol of the believers in the New Testament-jasper and other precious stones. The believers may be living stones (1 Pet. 2:5) without being precious stones. Eventually all believers will be transformed into precious stones. By nature we are clay. But from the time we were regenerated we began to be transformed. Gradually we are being transformed into precious stones.<h2 class=head2>1. Jasper Signifying the Appearance of God Shining with the Glory of God as the Light of the New Jerusalem for the Expression of God</h2><p>Jasper signifies the appearance of God shining with the glory of God as the light of the New Jerusalem for the expression of God. In Revelation 4:3 we are clearly told that God sitting on the throne has the appearance of jasper which, according to 21:11, is &#8220;a most precious stone...clear as crystal.&#8221; Its color must be dark green, which signifies life in its richness. Jasper here, as 21:11 indicates, signifies God&#8217;s communicable glory in His rich life (John 17:22, 2). It is the appearance of God, which will also be the appearance of the New Jerusalem. The city&#8217;s wall and first foundation are built with it (Rev. 21:18-19).<p>Since jasper is God&#8217;s appearance, His expression, and since we shall be transformed into jasper, this means that we shall be the corporate expression of the Triune God. The jasper wall of the New Jerusalem signifies that the whole city, as the corporate expression of the Triune God in eternity, bears the appearance of God. God, the One sitting on the throne in the center of the New Jerusalem, has the appearance of jasper; the wall, the circumference, of the city is made of jasper; and the light of the city is like a jasper stone, clear as crystal. Therefore, the entire city will bear God&#8217;s appearance, God&#8217;s expression. This corresponds to the word in 1 John 3:2: &#8220;We know that if He is manifested, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him even as He is.&#8221; God and the believers will have the same appearance-the appearance of jasper. This will be the ultimate fulfillment of Genesis 1:26, for this will be the splendid, corporate expression of the Triune God.<h2 class=head2>2. Other Precious Stones Signifying the Riches of the Beauty of Christ in Different Aspects for the Foundation of God&#8217;s Eternal Dwelling</h2><p>In Revelation 21:19 and 20 the believers are symbolized by eleven other precious stones in addition to jasper. The other precious stones signify the riches of the beauty of Christ in different aspects for the foundation of God&#8217;s eternal dwelling. Christ is the foundation stone of God&#8217;s building in eternity, and all the precious stones are different aspects of the riches of Christ as the foundation.<p>The colors of the precious stones in 21:19 and 20 give the appearance of a rainbow. This signifies that the city of New Jerusalem is built upon and secured by God&#8217;s faithfulness in keeping His covenant (Gen. 9:8-17). Because the foundation is built upon the faithfulness with which God keeps His covenant, it is trustworthy and reliable. Therefore, the foundation of the New Jerusalem will be an eternal rainbow guaranteeing the faithfulness of God. Nothing can destroy or shake God&#8217;s faithfulness. The faithfulness of God is the sure foundation upon which the New Jerusalem is built.</body></html>
