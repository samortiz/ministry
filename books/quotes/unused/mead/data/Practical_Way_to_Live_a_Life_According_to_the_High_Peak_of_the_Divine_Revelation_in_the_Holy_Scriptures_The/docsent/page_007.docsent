   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Consummating the Spirit of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Be the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ first became a man, and that man was born to be God's firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Also, millions of God's chosen people were born with Him to be God's many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the same resurrection, this wonderful Christ also became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The life-giving Spirit is the Spirit of Christ the pneumatic Christ, the pneumatized Christ Rom 8:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The life-giving Spirit is also the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, who is embodied in the pneumatized Christ realized as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The life-giving Spirit is the reality of resurrection, which is Christ Himself and the processed and consummated Triune God John 11:25; 1 John 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The resurrection is Christ and the consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And this resurrection is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to see that in the all-conquering resurrection of Christ, three major things transpired.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, the man Jesus was born to be the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second, all His believers were born in that birth with Him to be the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One delivery produced the firstborn Son and millions of "twins."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are the "twins" of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are His "twin" brothers, born by one delivery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of course, He took the lead to come out, and we followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Peter 1:3 says that all the believers in Christ were regenerated through the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Third, at the time when Christ in His humanity was born to be the firstborn Son of God, He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE ALL-TRANSCENDING ASCENSION A. Transcending Four Layers of Opposition</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ in His ascension transcended Hades where the dead people are being held , the earth where the fallen men are moving against God , the air where Satan and his power of darkness are acting against God , and all the heavens where Satan can go .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ transcended these four layers Eph 1:20-21; 4:8-10; Heb 4:14; 7:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hades is the first layer, below the earth where the dead people are held.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The earth is where the fallen men are moving against God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The air is where Satan and his power of darkness are struggling against God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The third heaven is a good place, but Satan even has a way to go to that good place Job 1:6-12a; 2:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Christ's ascension He transcended these four layers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today He is not only above Hades, the earth, and the air, but also above the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is higher than all the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>B. To Be Transmitted into the Church</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a transcending Christ is to be transmitted into the church, which is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>C. To Be the Head of the Body, the Church</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In His ascension He is the Head of the Body, the church, having the first place in all things Col 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>D. To Be Made Lord, Christ, Leader, and Savior</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In His ascension this One was made both Lord and Christ Acts 2:36 and the Leader of all the kings and Savior 5:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If He were not the Ruler, the Leader, of all the kings, He could not be the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the Ruler of all the kings, so He can manage the environment for all of God's chosen people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I was saved in China.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If in history God had not managed the world affairs to have some saints from the West go to the Far East to preach the gospel, I could never have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For the British and Americans to go to my country to preach the gospel needed much work by God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That was a great management.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes the management is small, but only God can carry this out to create the proper environment for people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, He is the Ruler of all the kings so that He can be the Savior to save God's chosen people.</S>
