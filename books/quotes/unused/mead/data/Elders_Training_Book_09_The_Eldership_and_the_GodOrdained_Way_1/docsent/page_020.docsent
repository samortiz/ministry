   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God promised Adam that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent Gen 3:15 , and He waited four thousand years to fulfill this promise.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>About two thousand years after this promise to Adam, God promised Abraham that through his seed, all the nations of the earth would be blessed 22:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The birth of Jesus was the fulfillment of these two promises.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was the Triune God incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He came to fulfill His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus far, He has been waiting for almost two thousand years for the complete fulfillment of all of His words in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To the Lord, however, a thousand years is as one day 2 Pet 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the time of Martin Luther, the Lord has brought His people through many recoveries.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to my knowledge, the experience of 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 may be one of the final things that needs to be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brother Nee stressed this so much, but he did not have the opportunity to see this come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He shared his burden concerning the church meeting of mutuality first in 1937 and a second time in 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the following year, 1949, mainland China was lost to the Communists.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1952 he was put into prison by them, so there was no opportunity for him to see the Lord's recovery of 1 Corinthians 14:26.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I feel that I owe him something.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even for his sake, I need to labor to see this truth, which he stressed so much, realized among us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have been serving the Lord in His ministry for exactly fifty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I began to practice the church life in my home in 1932.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By 1984, fifty-two years later, I realized that I must do something for the Lord to see the churches brought into His ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have a burden to carry this out at any risk.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have not been attacked by the enemy at any time in my entire life as I have at this time, but by His mercy I am standing here.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I only care for God's burden.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether I could see His present burden come to pass or not, only He knows.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I only care for one thing I have to finish my course; I have to discharge my burden.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The recovery of 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I only care for this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If I could not speak to all the saints on this earth, at least I could speak to a part of them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I must discharge my burden.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I desire to sacrifice everything for this burden, even my life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not care for my life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I only care for this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is a Chinese proverb which says, "I will do it to the uttermost until I die."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is my feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we have the burden to take this way, we should simply do it ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not criticize others or look down on others who do not take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the other hand, those who do not feel to take this way should not criticize those who do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all are saints in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From the very beginning of my fellowship concerning the new way, I did not expect all of the saints in the churches to pick up the burden to preach the gospel by visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if we mean business with the Lord, we must try our best to build up in the church a habit of going out to reach people, a habit of preaching the gospel by visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I hope that all of the churches would endeavor to pick up this burden to build up such a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It would be wonderful if one-fourth of the saints could be raised up to carry out this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we will gain a consistent yearly increase.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must help the saints to be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By 1984 my feeling was that all the churches had become somewhat dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We lost our impact and our morale.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What we had by 1984 was a routine way to meet, a routine way to work, and a routine way to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We were practicing the church life in a routine way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Where was the living burden?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Where was the burning among us?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to pick up the burden to practice the church life according to the God-ordained way, but I also advise all the churches not to do this in a fast way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I want to encourage us, though, to endeavor to enter into the reality of the Lord's biblical way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must get ourselves revived to live a victorious life, and we need to help the saints to live the same life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I hope that we could all be in one accord for the Lord's present move.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We cannot organize the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The one accord comes out of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must endeavor to do everything we can to keep the one accord among us for the sake of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not do anything that would damage this one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must be one with the church where we are according to what the church there feels it must practice presently.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must go on gradually and positively with the Lord until we fully enter into the reality of His ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I would again like to remind us that we must live a revived life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must live a victorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must learn to do things, not according to our preference but according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the spirit we love each other, sympathize with each other, and forgive each other.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this way the one accord can be produced and maintained among us.</S>
