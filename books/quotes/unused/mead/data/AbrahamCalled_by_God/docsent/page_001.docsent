   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Abraham Called by God is composed of messages taken from Life-study of Genesis, a detailed study of the book of Genesis that emphasizes the experience of Christ as life for the fulfillment of the eternal purpose of God to have a corporate expression of Himself.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the experience of Isaac is, to a great extent, interwoven with that of Abraham and because many of the aspects of Isaac's life are covered in the messages on Abraham, this volume includes messages that concentrate on the spiritual significance of Isaac, who rested in and enjoyed the riches bestowed on him by Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May all the children of God, all the called ones, walk in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham Rom 4:12 .</S>
