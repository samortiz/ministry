   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST THESSALONIANS MESSAGE THREE THE LIVING GOD AND THE WORK OF FAITH Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:1-10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For the most part, Christians understand and interpret the Bible in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This may be the case in reading 1 and 2 Thessalonians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have pointed out that these Epistles were written by Paul in an elementary way to new believers, to those who had been in the Lord probably for less than a year.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was very young, I was told that the books to the Thessalonians are very precious, and I began to pay close attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, my understanding of these Epistles was natural.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As I look back on the past, I realize that I interpreted these books in a very natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all need to see the difference between understanding the Word in a natural way and understanding it in a spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE CHURCH IN THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although 1 and 2 Thessalonians were written to new believers, in these books a number of profound terms are used.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both 1 and 2 Thessalonians begin in almost exactly the same way: "Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of the many Epistles written by Paul, only these two have this expression, the church in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead of taking this expression for granted, we should seek to find out what it means.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we check in this way, we shall learn that it is a very profound matter to say that the church is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This thought cannot be found in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God never told His people, the children of Israel, that they were in God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in the New Testament there are two Epistles that tell us that the church is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to learn the real significance of the church being in God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What a great matter that the church is in God!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1 Corinthians Paul says that the church is in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He also speaks of the churches in Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both in 1 and 2 Thessalonians the location of the church is not a city it is God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, the church is in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is indicated by the fact that Paul says "in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The object of the preposition "in" is both God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Father and the Son are two and yet are one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For the church to be in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ means that the church is in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The God revealed in the New Testament is not merely God the Creator; He is God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The name Jesus indicates incarnation, and the title Christ, resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If God had not become incarnate, how could He be Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If He did not enter into resurrection, how could He be Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The God who has passed through incarnation and resurrection is now in our spirit to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church is an entity in such a God, even the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although the church in Thessalonica was a new church, the Thessalonians nevertheless had to realize that the church is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those in this young church needed to see that the church is in the Triune God, in the very God who is our Father and our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The books of 1 and 2 Thessalonians were written not to individuals, but to the church in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the reason we speak of a holy life for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These two Epistles are addressed to the church, and the church is in the processed Triune God.</S>
