<h2 class="head2">B. Exalting and Magnifying Himself<br />above Every God<br />and Speaking Marvelous Things<br />against the God of Gods</h2><p>Daniel 11:36 and 37 reveal that this king, Antichrist, &ldquo;shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God of gods.... Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.&rdquo; Antichrist will do all this.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Honoring the God of Fortresses</h2><p>Daniel 11:38 says that Antichrist shall &ldquo;honor the god of fortresses: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things&rdquo; (Heb.). Antichrist will turn from God to worship his own idol.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Increasing with Glory<br />Those Who Acknowledge Him,<br />Causing Them to Rule over Many<br />and Dividing the Land for a Reward</h2><p>Daniel 11:39 says, &ldquo;Whoso shall acknowledge him will he increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for reward&rdquo; (Heb.). This indicates that Antichrist will promote those who acknowledge him. He will give them glory, authority to rule, and part of the land as their reward.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Entering into the Countries,<br />Overflowing, and Passing Over</h2><p>Daniel 11:40 says that Antichrist &ldquo;shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.&rdquo; This means that he will take over the nations which he will invade.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Entering into the Beautiful Land</h2><p>Antichrist will also enter into &ldquo;the beautiful land&rdquo; (Dan. 11:41, Heb.). The &ldquo;beautiful land&rdquo; is the Holy Land. This indicates he will also take over the Jewish nation.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Planting the Tents of His Palace between<br />the Seas and the Beautiful Holy Mountain</h2><p>Daniel 11:45 says, &ldquo;And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the seas and the beautiful holy mountain&rdquo; (Heb.). The &ldquo;seas&rdquo; here are the Mediterranean Sea and the Sea of Galilee. The &ldquo;beautiful holy mountain&rdquo; refers to Zion, where Jerusalem is. Between these two seas and Mount Zion Antichrist will erect the tents of his palace.</p>
