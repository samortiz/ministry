   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEUTERONOMY GOD'S DESIRE BEING FOR MAN TO EAT THE PRODUCE OF CANAAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the book of Deuteronomy, you see all kinds of produce as different kinds of offerings for the people of Israel to bring before God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These different kinds of produce are all types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although the offerings are for God, eventually they are for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We offer them to God, yet they become our food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we must eat what we offer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At this stage, what we enjoy is not only the lamb but also a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this feast we have oxen, sheep, pigeons, grain, new wine, and all kinds of firstfruits.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have a rich feast that includes both plants and animals.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, we eat this feast not only once; we eat it for seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In all seven days of the Feast, we eat a feast every day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today we eat Christ not only as the tree of life and as the Lamb but also as a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are keeping the Feast of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every church meeting is to keep the feast and eat Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Come and keep the feast!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Come and eat Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>REVELATION GOD'S DESIRE STILL BEING FOR MAN TO EAT THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Finally, at the end of Revelation you see the New Jerusalem with a river of water and the tree of life growing on both sides of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is a verse in the last chapter of Revelation that says, "Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life" v. 14 . Therefore, we see that eating and drinking the Lord is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you do anything else or have any other choice, you will find death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's ordination is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not have our own choice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God ordained even before the foundation of the world that our destiny, our future, would be to daily eat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What must Christians do?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eat the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What kind of Christian are you?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are Christians who eat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What kind of church do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A church that eats the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christians are people who eat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is the Lord recovering?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord is recovering the matter of eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christianity in general has lost the matter of eating the Lord, and it has lost sight of the fact that believers have the right to eat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord is recovering this today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Blessed are those who have washed their robes because they have the right to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not the right to worship and to serve but the right to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Recently when the church in Los Angeles has met, the chairs were not neatly arranged in single rows but rather in many small circles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have heard that they plan to set up small round tables, so that they can sit around them during meetings to enjoy the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Consider the way the benches are arranged in this meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the brothers and sisters come together and occupy the benches row by row, it looks like a "Sunday worship service."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When you are seated in this way, the atmosphere of Sunday worship is present.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not think that the seating arrangement does not deserve consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When everyone is seated in this orderly way, this is religion, and the atmosphere of eating is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But to have small round tables here, each with five or six chairs, and to sit around them gives the atmosphere of feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE WAY TO EAT</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord whom we eat as our food is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, which organ do we use to eat Him?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We use our spirit to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord is Spirit, so we must use our spirit to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How do we eat Him?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By calling, "O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>O Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To call on the Lord is to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Bible clearly shows us that the Lord is our food, and we must eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As the Spirit He is our food.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The organ by which we eat Him is also the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Moreover, the way to eat Him is by calling on the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Calling on the Lord is eating the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some may say that we do not appear to be holding a Sunday worship service with our calling and shouting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They are absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not care for their kind of Sunday worship; we come here to eat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How do we eat?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>By calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You can be refined in many other gatherings but not in a time of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Calling on the Lord's name may not be considered refined, but I know it is truly sweet, because I have tasted it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We thank and praise the Lord that this is the Lord's recovery today!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What is the Lord recovering?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Eating the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hallelujah!</S>
