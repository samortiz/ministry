<h1 class="title">THE IMPORTANCE AND THE COMMISSION<br />
OF THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE BIBLE-READING MEETING</h2>
<p>Some localities are doing well related to the administration of the church and the ministry of the word. Generally speaking, however, the administration of the church is weaker than the ministry of the word in all the localities. According to function, the ministry of the word is more important than the administration of the church. Hence, there is a greater need for the ministry of the word than for the administration of the church in all the localities.</p>
<p>The messages given on the Lord&rsquo;s Day are common and general. Since they are not living, they have become ordinary and routine and cannot produce any impact. Therefore, the churches should pay attention to the word ministered in all the meetings, not only on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. The word ministered in the other meetings often produces a definite impact. For instance, in one of the localities the Bible-reading meeting has been carried out successfully and is full of the Lord&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Person Responsible for the Meeting</h2>
<p>Every local church should endeavor to give the brothers and sisters a heart to read the Bible so that they would love and enjoy reading the Bible. If possible, every locality should endeavor to have a meeting for the brothers and sisters to read the Bible. The Bible-reading meeting in the local church that we mentioned earlier has a person who is responsible for the meeting. On the one hand, the leading ones ask the saints to read the word; on the other hand, there is always a person responsible for the meeting, who is given at least twenty to thirty minutes to speak on some relevant matters. In their meetings the brothers and sisters share in the first half of the meeting, and then the person responsible develops the portion they read. This is a characteristic of their meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having the Spiritual Supply</h2>
<p>Another characteristic is that in the development of the word by the brothers and sisters, the emphasis is not on logic or exposition but on the spiritual supply. Although the brothers and sisters study the Word, their development is not limited to simply reading the Word but to supplying life based on the spiritual light gleaned from a verse, a phrase, or the entire portion. There is a temptation in the Bible-reading meeting to require everyone to comprehend and memorize outlines. We should not fall into this temptation, because it will turn our meetings into a dead practice.</p>
<p>Our Bible-reading meetings, however, have somewhat fallen into this temptation. In helping the brothers and sisters to read the Word, we should not explain how different sections are divided, nor should we fellowship concerning the outline. Rather, we should share the light of life and the spiritual supply. A brother who has light and is strong in the Word should give a summary of twenty to thirty minutes. The first part of the meeting allows the Holy Spirit an opportunity to release the riches through the brothers and sisters and gives the brothers and sisters an opportunity to practice. But the Bible-reading meeting does not depend on this sharing. Whether the sharing from the brothers and sisters is rich or poor will not affect the meeting, because the speaking at the end supplies and feeds everyone.</p>
<p>If we depend only on the fellowship from the brothers and sisters, the meeting may not be strong and the saints&rsquo; appetite for the meeting will be spoiled. They will not regard the Bible-reading meeting as important, and the attendance will drop. For example, in Taipei the number of participants in the Bible-reading meeting is gradually decreasing. One of the reasons may be the poor sharing. We should never make people feel that the Bible-reading meeting is insignificant. If people come to the meeting with an empty stomach and then go home with an empty stomach, they will feel that the meeting is a waste of their time. They will come with great anticipation and go home disappointed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the sharing and in the summary we must free ourselves from the outline. When the brothers and sisters begin reading the Bible, we can help them with the outline so that they may understand how the chapters are sectioned. But as the meetings continue, we should not focus on the outline; otherwise, our meeting can become dead.</p>
