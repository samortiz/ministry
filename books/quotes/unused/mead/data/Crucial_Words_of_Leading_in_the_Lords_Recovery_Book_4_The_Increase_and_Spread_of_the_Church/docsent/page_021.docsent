   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE FORMING SMALL GROUPS OUR MEETINGS BEING LIKE OUR HOME LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should not imitate the practice of Christianity in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For over thirty years we have encouraged the brothers and sisters to exercise their spirit and to function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible does not speak of someone presiding over or taking the lead in Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 14:26 says, Whenever you come together, each one has...</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this verse the first thing that the saints have is a psalm, which means that when the saints gather together, anyone can call a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our meetings should be as comfortable as our home life because we have been in meetings together for many years, just like a family.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not be unfamiliar with the things that we need to do in a meeting, such as exercising our spirit and functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Singing Hymns</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not Only Loudly and Clearly</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>but Also in a Refined Manner</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many among us are not familiar with how to sing hymns in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I heard you sing, Thy dwelling-place, O Lord, I love; / It is Thy Church so blessed Hymns, #852 , I sensed a lack of refinement in the use of this hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we sing hymns, we should not only be loud and clear in our singing but also refined in our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, after singing each stanza, there could be a short prayer of longing and enjoyment: O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I love Your dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I love Your church; she is Your joy and heart s delight, and she is also where my heart finds rest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Or we could pray, O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church is so lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we come here, our hearts are joyful; once we are here, our hearts find rest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After such a simple prayer, our feeling will be quite different when we sing the next stanza.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every stanza should be the pouring out of our feelings from within, expressing our appreciation to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this matter, we need to practice until we are more skillful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Christian college where I studied, there was a one hour worship service Monday through Saturday at 11:30 A.M. During this time, sermons were given in English by Western pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some of the pastors would speak regardless of whether the students understood or not.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since we could not leave early, we suffered through this time, looking at our watches and waiting for the meeting to be dismissed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the situation in Christianity, but our meetings should not be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we worship the Lord, our spirit is refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We not only should worship and enjoy the Lord; we should also testify to Him of our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This speaks of the importance of singing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we meet, we should be like players on a basketball court.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In particular, when singing hymns, one person should not shout the words repeatedly and continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This would be like one person dribbling the ball all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have been meeting for many years, and we have many meetings every year.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, we have many opportunities for everyone to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Needing to Exercise the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>in the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the end of 1962, I received a burden from the Lord to start the work in the United States, and I began the work by stressing the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The American saints surely know how to exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the meetings one hundred fifty saints can be playing basketball, not just five.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the meetings they pass the ball from one person to another.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, their meetings have reached a point where there is no formal calling of hymns, no preaching, and even no announcement to start the meeting; the meetings just begin spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first person who comes to the meeting begins to pray, and when another comes, he begins to pray as well.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are no long prayers; instead, everyone follows each other with prayers that are two or three sentences in length but which are full of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have not yet entered into this kind of exercise in the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It seems as if we are still in our old culture.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May the Lord forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I hope that 1985 would be a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need more practice.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For example, we should practice singing hymns with two or three saints, and pray after each stanza.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We also should be willing to critique one another so that there would be greater benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God can accomplish whatever He desires to accomplish; He does not need to practice, because He does not need to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But since we are not God, we need to learn and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even though I am eighty years old this year, I still need to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have many dictionaries in many languages, and I use them whenever I write because I still need to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to learn in order to glorify the Lord.</S>
