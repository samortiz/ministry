In this series of messages we want to see something of the land of Canaan, which is the type of the all-inclusive Christ
What we will consider is the all-inclusive Christ, out of which and upon which the fullness of Christ, the church, is built
Remember well that it is not just Christ and the church but the allinclusive Christ and the fullness of Christ which is His Body the church
You may be quite clear that Christ is your food, that Christ is your living water, that Christ is your light, and that Christ is your life
You may feel that day by day you are living on this earth, on this piece of land, but you must realize that this earth is not your real land
The Lord called out Abraham, telling him that He would bring him to a certain land, which was the land of Canaan
The Old Testament, from the first chapter of Genesis, always takes the land as the center, always mentions something related to the land
Later you will see how God brought His people into the promised land and how His people remained there and enjoyed all its riches
The city is the center of God's authority, God's kingdom, and the temple is the center of God's house, God's dwelling place
In principle, everything recorded in the Old Testament is exactly the same as that in the New; there is no difference
Satan, the enemy of God, has done his utmost and is still doing his utmost to frustrate the people of God from enjoying this piece of land
Because of Satan's rebellion, God had to judge the universe, and due to that judgment the earth was buried beneath the waters of the deep
God came in to work and do something, and as we have seen already, He recovered the land from the waters of the deep
Through the redemption of the ark, Noah and his family obtained the right to possess the land and enjoy all its riches
Out of that race made rebellious by Satan, God called one man, Abraham, and told him that He would bring him to a certain land
Then, you remember well, it was not long before even this chosen one gradually drifted away from the land into Egypt
After a long period, the Lord once more brought all the people up from Egypt and back to this very piece of land
All the people of Israel had the lamb on that Passover Day in Egypt, but very few, I'm sorry to say, got into the land
Some have come out of Egypt, some have been delivered from the world, but they are still wandering in the wilderness
We say, 'Oh, praise the Lord, here are some brothers and sisters who really enjoy the Lord as their manna day by day'!
In Egypt was the lamb, in the wilderness was the manna, and ahead of the people of Israel was the land of Canaan
Whenever we are going to eat, we should immediately have the registration within us that Christ is our real food
Whatever we are going to do, whatever we are going to enjoy and experience, we must realize that Christ is that very thing
If you have received true light from the Lord, the Holy Spirit will point out Christ to you in a practical way day by day, step by step
What God planned to do on this earth was to obtain that piece of land with the temple and the city built upon it
God's presence and God's authority could only be realized by the temple and the city built upon that piece of land
The passover lamb is not the all-inclusive type, and neither is the manna or even the tabernacle with all the things related to it
We are told that Christ is the food and the living water, but even these do not make Him the all-inclusive One
Whatever you need, whatever you contact, whatever you obtain, whatever you enjoy, whatever you experience-all these things must be Christ
Whenever you do something, whenever you enjoy something, whenever you use something, you must immediately apply Christ
If you do not have Christ and know not how to apply Him and experience Him in such a practical way, you have nothing
Eventually most of the brothers and sisters have been convinced and have come to know something of Christ in a practical way
The people of Israel enjoyed the passover lamb and then the manna day by day for forty years, but they were never fully satisfied
When they entered the land, what they ate came from the land, what they drank came from the land-all their living came out of the land
Only the land was the rest to the people of God, because the land was the completion, the perfection, and the fullness
By Hebrews 3 and 4, we may realize that the land which was the rest to the people of Israel is the type of Christ
Can you tell how broad is the breadth, how long is the length, how high is the height, and how deep is the depth?
Christ is the breadth, Christ is the length, Christ is the height, and Christ is the depth of the whole universe
If you would experience Him in a greater way, if you would experience a greater Christ, you must be ready to encounter a worse situation'
If you want to have an increasing experience of Christ, you must be ready to meet a worse situation day by day'
Today you will love him, and tomorrow you will love him; in these things you will love him, and in those things you will love him
You will love him one day, the next day, and the third day; you will love him this month, this year, and next year
If you love her with your own love, be assured that the more you love her today, the more you will hate her another day
In the Scriptures we are told that in this land are the high places of the earth: 'He made him ride on the high places of the earth'
The books of Deuteronomy and Ezekiel contain many passages which tell us that the land of Israel is a mountainous and high country
It was because at the very moment they stood up to speak of the ascended Christ, they were in the ascended Christ
They surpassed the highest rank of man because of the ascended Christ and because they were in this ascended Christ
They said, 'All right, we will call in a barber to cut your hair and get some good food from the restaurant for you'
Under those pressures, those troubles, those hardships, she learned something of the mighty power of Christ's resurrection
Whenever you feel depressed in spirit or in heart, it means that you are under the threatening of death, you are under the power of darkness
The problem is that whenever you feel depressed, you forget Christ; you forget that you have such a Christ who is ascended far above all
We are also told that upon the mountains the Lord's people have the good pasture, the fat pasture, upon which to feed
You will have the living water, you will have the fat pasture, and you will have the good fold in which you may lie
You will experience the Lord, not just in knowledge or doctrine but in a very practical way in your daily life
The water issues from that spring and fills the well, and the well becomes the 'fountain' or the 'deep waters'
The Lord said that the water He gives will be in us a well of water, a fountain, springing up unto the life of eternity
If you view it accurately, you will realize that the supply of the life of Christ is just as living water within you
You will immediately offer praise or a prayer, which will be just like a living stream flowing forth from within you
You cannot utter it; you cannot give forth a fitting praise for this living spring, this deep fountain, and this flowing stream
In this land there is not only one stream, but many streams; not just one spring and one fountain, but many springs and many fountains
Sometimes you experience Him as a spring of joy, sometimes as a spring of peace, and sometimes as a spring of comfort
We must be one who always has some trouble some valley but also one who is always on the mountains always in the experience of resurrection
It is a good land, a land of waterbrooks, of springs, and of deep waters, flowing forth in the valleys and the mountains
The land is good in the riches of water: in brooks, in springs, and in deep waters, flowing forth in valleys and mountains
We are told in this same passage that this land is a land after which the Lord is seeking: 'A land which Jehovah your God cares for '
You have to live within this good land and enjoy its riches; then you will obtain the presence of God with the eyes of God
The presence of God will be with you because you experience Christ as your living water, because you are in the good land
We have considered how good it is in many aspects, such as its spaciousness, its transcendency, and its unsearchable riches
A land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of olive trees with oil and of honey
There are six items, all of which belong to the vegetable kingdom, and a seventh which is quite peculiar-honey
All these things-the wheat, the barley, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree-represent Christ
Wheat points to His incarnation, death, and burial, and following this the barley points to His resurrection, the resurrected Christ
When the harvest time came, the firstfruits of the harvest had to be offered to the Lord, and the first fruit was clearly the barley
Now we must read 1 Corinthians 15:20: 'But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep'
All students of the Scriptures recognize that the first fruits of the harvest typify Christ as the first fruits of resurrection
Many are familiar with the miracle of the five loaves, but very few are aware that those loaves were loaves of barley
When in the midst of that limiting and pressing situation you contact the Lord, He is just as a grain of wheat to you
Of course, she dared not ask the Lord to get rid of her mother-in-law, but she asked the Lord to deliver her from that situation
She said then that when she besought the Lord, the Lord immediately began to show her what kind of person He was on the earth
Whenever you experience Christ as the wheat, be assured that an experience of Christ as the barley will follow
In order to experience Christ as the grain of wheat, the limited Jesus, we must apply Him as the barley, as the resurrected Christ
You may only have one loaf, but remember, it is a barley loaf, it is a loaf of the resurrected Christ who can never be limited
Watchman Nee once told us that when some young coworkers come to a meeting they look around to see if any senior brothers are there
When you come to the meeting, apply Him as the one loaf of barley to feed all the others by your prayer or by your testimony
The disciples said, 'There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are these for so many'?
Christ as the sacrificing lamb lives in you, energizing you to sacrifice yourself for others to bring them cheer
She had no experience of Christ as the wine producer, sacrificing Himself to produce wine for others and for God
You rejoice to learn that Christ is the barley, the resurrected Christ within you, and that He is enough to meet every situation
The incarnated, limited, crucified, and buried Jesus comes into our experience first; then we touch the resurrected Christ
In the first item, the wheat, we could not see the sweetness and the satisfaction; neither could we in the barley
The more we enjoy Christ as the resurrected One, the more we will be pressed, the more we will enjoy Him as the vine
Going to her room and shutting the door, the young sister sang praises to the Lord and prayed with a loud voice
When others touch you, they will sense the loveliness and attractiveness of Christ, and an abundance of life will be imparted to them
Praise Him, if we enjoy Him as the wheat, the barley, the vine, the fig tree, and the pomegranate, we will surely have the oil
When you have experienced Christ as all the other items and have reached this point, then you are full of the Holy Spirit
Brothers and sisters, if anyone comes to fellowship with you in the Holy Spirit, you are truly honored by that one
If we can only talk with them about the world situation and about this and that, we are heaping dishonor upon them
In all your contacts with others, can you say that by the Lord's mercy and grace and by the Holy Spirit you honor them?
The aspect of the Lord Jesus Christ which is represented by the vegetable life is that of generating and multiplying
We must remember that before the fall before man had sinned the food which God ordained for man was of the vegetable kingdom not the animal
Animals were not required for human consumption before the fall, but when sin entered, man must include them in his food
Without sin, there was no need of redemption through the blood, but after the fall, because of sin, the blood was required
The Lord said in John 6 My flesh is true food and My blood is true drink and he who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life
You must realize that you can never simply apply Christ as the barley, because you are a sinner, you have sinned
With all the offerings in the Old Testament, there was always the offering of an animal with the offering of the vegetable
Whenever we come to experience Christ and apply Him as our life we must realize that He is not only the plant life but also the animal life
We must always apply Him as the redeeming One, as the Lamb who has been slain, that we may enjoy all the riches of His generating life
If we do not have the pasture, if we do not have the grass, even though we have the cattle and the flock, we cannot have milk and butter
Which is the better food: the milk, or all the fruit of the trees-the vine, the fig, the pomegranate, and the olive?
Especially when you are weak in spirit and you come to the Lord to experience and apply Him, you sense that He is the milk and the honey
We must have such an adequate and full experience of Him, not just as the living water, but as so many kinds of food
The iron has something to do with the stones, and the copper has something to do with the hills or the mountains
In Revelation 1 the bronze is related to the feet of the overcoming and judging Christ: His feet were like burnished bronze
In Matthew 5 the city is related to the hill, and in the second Psalm the hill of Zion is related to the anointed One
The Lord said that He would make them a nation not only in the land but also on the mountains of Israel, the mountains of the land
Beautiful in elevation, / The joy of the whole earth, / Is Mount Zion, the sides of the north, / The city of the great King
We must notice here that the city of God is related to the holy mountain, and the city of the great King is related to Mount Zion
The stones are for the building and the hills or the mountains are for the city which is the center of the nation the center of the kingdom
We have seen that the land is rich first in waters, second in vegetables and plants, third in animals, and last in mines or minerals
It was the very water that was healed by the prophet Elisha, and because of this we were very interested in seeing it
After these three, the Spirit turns to something else-to the stones and to the mountains, out of which the iron and the copper come
We are told that from the throne of God and of the lamb, there flows a river of living water, and in this river grows the tree of life
All these kinds of food will bring you to maturity; they will bring you to the place where you are filled with the Holy Spirit
When you are really mature in the life of Christ, Christ will be just as milk and honey to you through the whole day
Of course, the living water is included in the milk and honey, but this drink is exceedingly richer than water
The Holy Spirit put honey at the end of the list of the vegetables and He put the milk and butter after the cattle and the flock the animals
We must be very clear that whenever we enjoy Christ to a certain extent, there is always an issue-the building and the battle
We must remember that upon the land the city and the temple are built and they are built with these very materialsstones iron and copper
If we just enjoy Christ as the living water day by day, we can never reach the point where the building of God will be realized among us
We must enjoy Christ to a certain extent; then there will be a building for the Lord and the battle with the enemy
Sometimes you meet a brother or a sister, and you feel that he or she is quite good, but there is something short, there is a real lack
It is not that they are sinful; on the contrary, they are upright with the Lord and their attitude is positive
When we are just babes in Christ, drinking the living water, how is it possible for the building of the Lord to be among us?
The Lord is the living stone, and we too must be the living stones so that we may be material for His building
You can recognize a little transformation; they look like a stone, but the greater part of their being is still in the original state
After becoming a stone, we are burned and pressed that we may be transformed even further-from an ordinary stone to a precious stone
All the spiritual, living stones are in the resurrection life; they are stones joined to the mountain of Christ's resurrection
We are all a group of such believers; we are all so natural, continually living and walking in the natural life
When you come to them, you sense there is something raised, something exalted, something which is higher than you
If two brothers in the local church are so much in the resurrection, to them the divine, the heavenly authority is committed
The authority of the church is where the saints know what it means to be crucified with the Lord Jesus and live in the resurrection
Immediately following such a rich experience of Christ we come to the mines and the mineralsthe stones the mountains the iron and the copper
When we are mature in the life of Christ, we realize something in our experience of the stone, the mountain, the iron, and the copper
By the renewing of the Holy Spirit, we are transformed from a piece of clay to a stone that we may be material for the building of God
The stones produced for the building of God with the divine authority and government are all the issue of Christ's resurrection
The more we enjoy Christ and experience Christ, the more we will be transformed by the Holy Spirit with the elements of His life
When you arrive at this point, you will be enabled to fight, you will be qualified to fight, you will be matured in the life of Christ
The last items of the riches of Christ are iron and copper or bronze because the last stage of Christian experience is the spiritual warfare
You can exercise your spirit by faith to apply this tested, proved, and perfect Christ as the helmet for your head
The policeman's power compared with that of all the cars, or even with one of the cars, is much inferior; in fact, it is almost nil
That little policeman can stand there today and give all the orders: whatever he binds is bound; whatever he looses is loosed
When he is in uniform the traffic must obey him but when he is out of uniform he is meaningless directing traffic and no match for the cars
If you are in yourself, if you are in your natural life, you have lost the ground, you are out of uniform, and you have no authority
The evil spirits, instead of leaving, leaped upon them and gave them such an assault that they fled naked and wounded
Because we realize the judgment and the authority of Christ, we can exercise the judgment and the authority of Christ
The most safe and the most secure are those believers who know something regarding the exercise of Christ's authority
They are not only the material for the building, not only the stones for the house, but the house built together
We have to grow gradually, of course, from the first stage, through the second, to the third, and to the fourth
We must learn to enjoy Christ to such an extent that He will be as sweet and rich to us as milk and honey all the day
When traffic approaches the policeman, does he need to call the mayor and ask that he do something to stop it?
In the original tongue, the word for make His home, or dwell, has the same root as the word for house and home
Now notice that it is not just that we may be able to apprehend but that we may 'be full of strength' to apprehend
We are not just to know or understand but to possess something by knowing, to obtain something by understanding-to apprehend
The breadth, the length, the height, and the depth-the spaciousness of Christ, the unlimited dimensions of Christ
We will have full power to apprehend, to obtain by understanding, the unlimited spaciousness of Christ with all the saints
The first point here is that the Lord promised Moses that His presence would go with him and the people of Israel
Exodus 4012 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses saying On the first day of the first month you shall raise up the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting
Exodus 40:17, 21, 34-35: In the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was raised up
Moses was not able to enter the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud settled on it and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle
The Lord never asked the children of Israel one by one to gradually, singly, and individually cross the Jordan and enter the land
It was never God's mind that one should enter this month, another next month, and still another the following month
At the very beginning, the people of Israel enjoyed the lamb of the passover , which we know was the type of Christ
Brothers and sisters, we must begin by enjoying Christ as the redeeming lamb with the generating power, the multiplying strength
Exodus 1631 The house of Israel called its name manna and it was like coriander seed white and its taste was like wafers made with honey
In that passage the tree of life is introduced and then a river in whose flow are several precious materials, one of which is bdellium
When we take the tree of life and drink the water of life, the pearl, the transformed material for God's building, will be produced
The way to get into the land starts from the twelfth chapter of Exodus and continues on to the last chapter of Joshua
We must read all these parts thoroughly and understand them clearly; then we will have the way to possess the land
To enjoy Christ, starting from the lamb of the passover and continuing day by day with the manna from heaven, is just the beginning
The impression most Christians have concerning the Ten Commandments is that they are simply the strict demands of God
The primary significance, we must realize, is the description, the expression, the testimony of the glorious yet invisible God
As we enjoy Christ as the lamb of the passover and as our daily manna, we must also have this Christ, this larger Christ , as our center
We must have the Ark of the Testimony, the Christ who is the expression, the manifestation, and the testimony of God as our very center
We must not only have the lamb as our Redeemer and not only the daily manna as our food but also the Ark of the Testimony as our center
If they just realize that we are those who feed on Christ day by day as the daily manna, even this misses the mark
When people come to us, do they realize that here is the manifestation, the expression, the definition, the explanation, of God?
After Exodus 12, 13, and 14, after the passover and the crossing of the Red Sea, there are many more experiences to be gained
There are many more things to be dealt with many more things to experience many more things to be possessed before we can get into the land
More important than that, the Ten Commandments are the definition, the explanation, the interpretation, of the invisible God
The Ark was made with wood overlaid with gold and the major part of the tabernacle was composed of the same materialswood overlaid with gold
The tabernacle is made in the same shape and with the same materials, and it is constituted with and contains within it more of Christ
The innermost covering is of linen, so beautiful, so fine, so full of glory, with the cherubim embroidered upon it
From without, you see His lowliness, His humility, His simplicity; you see His strength and His enduring power, but there is no beauty
There were at least forty-eight boards, all overlaid with gold, and joined together with golden rings and bars
Praise the Lord, we are bound in a real and indissoluble union by something divine, by the very nature of God Himself
If we can escape from each other, if we can be separated from one another, there is no way for us to go into the good land
The Ark, which is Christ, is within as our center, and we are the enlargement of this Christ as the tabernacle embodying the Ark
We have seen how we must enjoy Christ as the lamb of the passover, as the daily manna, and as the Ark embodied within the tabernacle
The people of Israel began to enjoy the types of Christ with the lamb of the passover-that is the place where we all must start
If you compare the Ark with the lamb, the manna, or the rock flowing with living water, you can see what an improvement there is
In the lamb of the passover you may realize Christ only as the redeeming One the One who died on the cross shedding His blood for our sins
The Ark was constructed with wood overlaid with gold, and the tabernacle was made in the same way with the same materials
They are all covered by the fourfold Christ, just as the tabernacle was covered with the four layers of curtains
All these forty-eight boards were standing on silver sockets or bases, meaning that they are based on the redemption of Christ
We can realize that this is much more than the lamb of the passover, the manna, and the rock flowing with the living stream
We learn to enjoy Christ daily as the manna, as our food supply, and as the rock flowing with the living stream
It is where the Ark is the center and where the tabernacle is built up as the enlargement and embodiment of it
Even when we enjoy Him as the daily manna and as the rock flowing with the living stream, the shekinah glory is missing
Christ is of two natures, the human and the divine, and we are the same: we are of the human nature but covered with the divine
Christ is the manifestation of God, and all these boards combined together as one in the gold are the expression of Christ
Is the testimony, here is the manifestation of God, here is the expression of Christ, but how can we contact these?
There is an entrance, but the only proper way for us to approach this entrance and contact the tabernacle is by the offerings
On one hand, He is the manifestation of God, and on the other hand, He is the way by which we can contact this God: He is the offerings
There are five: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering
Suppose we are having a meeting and you are coming to the meeting; you are coming to contact the tabernacle with Christ as its center
The Lord has told you to love your brother, but you have loved him in a false way; you have smiled at him with hatred
In America you have separate seats, so you cannot take advantage of others, but in Formosa they have long benches
When they have a conference, they ask the brothers and sisters to sit as closely as possible in order to make the bench available for five
We have the ground of the blood to claim the anointing, the working of the Holy Spirit, so that we can minister in a living way
By the protection of the Lord, we have been kept through the entire day in His presence without any trespasses
Whenever we as fallen creatures come to contact the testimony of the Lord we must at least apply Christ as the sin offering
You must realize that since you are still in the sinful nature, you must still apply Christ as the sin offering
Day by day and even moment by moment, as we enjoy Him as our trespass offering and our sin offering, we also enjoy Him as our peace offering
He is so sweet, He is so satisfying; everyone of us may enjoy Him in the presence of God and enjoy Him together with God
We must have this we must have Christ as our Aaron Christ as our high priest and all of us must be His sons the priests to serve the Lord
Please do not consider that the priests among God's children today are those so-called ministers, pastors, preachers, etc
The essential and basic thing is that you live in Christ, walk in Christ, enjoy Christ, experience Christ, and apply Christ to all your life
What the priests eat represents Christ, what they wear represents Christ, and all their living represents Christ
She sent us a telegram, indicating her time of arrival and her flight number, but none of us knew her or had ever met her before
The brothers were very much concerned and talked with me, saying, 'Brother, how will we be able to recognize this sister?
If you are a priest, there is something about you which is not ordinary; you have distinct and distinguishing characteristics
If you are a sister and you are handling Christ all the day, think how much you will be able to minister to the Lord
All the brothers and sisters considered it best to reserve the seats for their unsaved friends; so they withdrew to another room
Brothers and sisters, we can never fool the enemy, we can never fool our conscience, and we can never fool the Lord
When the occasion arose that a brother must minister, they could say, 'Let us go with him to the platform as an army'
There was no room for the enemy, and the whole meeting with the entire congregation was conquered and captured by the Lord
It all depends on how much you live in Christ, walk in Christ, and take Christ as your food, your clothing, and your everything
There is something in our experience which is still more vital to us: that is, the governing principles, the governing factors
If there are no governing principles, disorder and confusion will reign, and disorder and confusion are akin to the enemy
In order to maintain order among the Lord's children, there must be some governing principles, some governing factors
We all traveled on the same train: all but this one brother sat in car number one, and he sat by himself in car number two
He will bring you to your destination and He will bless you, but throughout the whole trip you will not sense His presence
The firsthand presence of the Lord will strengthen you with might to obtain the fullness, the all-inclusiveness of Christ
In the ancient time, His presence was always in the cloud by day and the fire by night, in the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire
During the day while the sun was shining, the cloud was there; in the darkness of the night, there was the fire
Immediately the meeting took a definite turn, and the words which issued from my mouth were just as living water pouring out
You are burdened with something for the Lord, and the Lord gives you such an encouragement to let you sense His presence in the Spirit
When the sun shines, the Lord's presence takes the appearance of a cloud; when darkness comes, it takes the appearance of fire
When darkness veils the sky, you cannot discern which is the cloud and which is not the cloud; you must follow the fire
In the day, when it is clear, we have the Spirit as the cloud; in the night, when it is dark, we have the Word as the fire
The priesthood includes three things: communion or fellowship with the Lord, the anointing of the Holy Spirit, and the Urim and Thummim
Upon the breastplate of the high priests were the names of the twelve tribes of Israel carved upon twelve stones
These four letters were carved upon the Thummim and when this stone was put into the breastplate there was perfection there was completion
The high priest took down all the letters from the various stones as they shone, and in so doing formed words and then sentences
It was in this way, the article says, that Achan was apprehended from among all the children of Israel for his sin
It is that among them there should be the priesthood that brings all the Lord's children upon the breast before the Lord
We will then bring this problem to the Lord and read these brothers in His presence with the light of the Scriptures
By this we can get the letters, the words, and the message of the Lord regarding what decision must be made in this matter
Paul was confronted with many problems in that church: problems of sectarianism, discipline, marriage, the doctrine of resurrection, etc
The apostles as priests fulfilling their priestly ministry brought all these problems with all the Lord's children into God's presence
You who are leading brothers meet many kinds of problems in the church which give you opportunity to practice this priestly ministry
Sometimes a brother will come to you to share a problem he has with his father, who is also a brother in the Lord
The next day a sister may come to you telling of some trouble she has with her sister-in-law, who is also a sister in the church
It is not a small thing to have a group of the Lord's children who are coordinated together to serve the Lord collectively
Sometimes the sisters, especially in the Far East, wear dresses which are really not becoming to a child of the Lord
If they would only remember that they belong to the Lord, the very thought would cause them to shrink from such attire
There are so many peculiar and modern styles, it is rather difficult to find a suitable pair as a child of God
At least we who are converted by the Lord must remember that we are those whom the Lord has separated from this world
These three minor principles compose one of the major governing principles, and these are the regulations of a holy life
At this point in our experience, we are rather matured; thus, we are in the position to assume some responsibility
It is at this stage that we are able to function in the priesthood, which means that to a certain degree we can serve God
It was then that they enjoyed Christ as the testimony of God, and at that stage they could take responsibility for God as priests
They can then bear the full responsibility of the priesthood and realize all the divine regulations concerning the holy life
It is indeed glorious that a group of the Lord's children could be formed into an army for the Lord on this earth
They were numbered the second time, not only as an army for the warfare, but also as a people to divide and inherit the good land
Day by day we must enjoy Christ as our daily food and our living water; we must have something to eat and something to drink
Do you have a tabernacle with such a Christ, not only as the lamb or as the daily manna, but as the testimony of God?
Formerly, all you have enjoyed has been Christ as the lamb, as the manna, and at the most as the rock with the living water
Now you must enjoy Christ in a new way, in a new stage, so that there will be a new start of the Spirit among you
The thought or line of the Holy Spirit in the record of the Scriptures is always progressive, is always improving
From the first to the second, to the third, to the fourth, and now to the fifth, there is a steady improving, solidifying, and deepening
If most of you speak honestly before the Lord, you must confess that it is rather difficult to pass this fifth item
We have not experienced very much regarding Christ as the high priest, so we are not able to assume the priesthood
You must pray together Lord do we know something of experiencing You as the Ark the testimony of God with its expansion as Your expression
Ask the Lord, 'Do we have some experience of You as the high priest so that we are able to assume the priesthood among Your people'?
By the assuming of the priesthood, we can be formed into a spiritual army to fight for the Lord's interest on this earth
To be formed into an army, everyone must give his pedigree, his genealogy-not physical, of course, but spiritual
If they could not make such a declaration if they could not give their pedigree they must stand back they could not be formed into the army
You have the birth, you have the life, but you must have a certain amount of growth; you must be twenty years of age
Can you say that there are some among you who are truly matured, who can stand up to fight the battle for the kingdom of God?
In many places there are many Christians, but it seems that they are just like children playing with spiritual things
We must grow up to a certain standard that we may be formed into an army to fight the battle for the kingdom and the testimony of God
Those from the tribe of 'Judah' have come under the standard of 'Benjamin,' and those of the tribe of 'Benjamin' have moved to 'Manasseh'
Certain tribes were ordained to camp on the east, certain tribes on the south, others on the west, and some on the north
When we grow in life to be formed as the army of God to fight the battle for His kingdom, we will spontaneously be submissive
Those who can be formed into an army among the children of God and share the good land are those who are continually young and fresh
Praise the Lord, as long as there are a few who truly have the growth of life, you may take the ground to be formed as an army
Do we take the limitation to our personal tastes, our personal desires, and our personal choices among the Lord's children?
By checking item by item, it seems that when we come to item five concerning the priesthood we cannot get through
The requirement for service in the army is twenty years of age, while the requirement of the priesthood is thirty years of age
The duration of service in the army is from twenty to sixty years of age, while in the priesthood it is from thirty to fifty years of age
Only by growing to a certain standard can we assume the responsibility of the priesthood and be formed into an army
All the records of these three books-Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers-deal with the steps to possess the good land
By going on we attain to the point where Christ to us is the Ark of the Testimony with the increase of the tabernacle
We must be very clear that at this stage these people who have been continually enjoying Christ have become one
The number five is four, the number of the creature, plus one, the Creator; the creature plus the Creator becomes five
Now notice: the width of the boards is not three cubits, but one and a half cubits, or in other words, one half of three
As a member of the Lord's Body, we must be united with others, not theoretically, but actually and practically
Can you name a brother or certain brothers with whom you are really one, with whom you are inwardly and practically one?
Suppose we have the tabernacle here with its forty-eight boards and could ask the first board to whom it is united
It would answer without any hesitation that it is united to board number two, and we could clearly see that indeed it is
All the boards could answer in such a way; therefore, they are all composed together to form God's dwelling place
If you can answer that you are definitely and practically related and united with certain others it is a wonder of wonders
Wherever there are two or three who are really united together, it is a wonder and a testimony to the whole universe
How can you enjoy Christ as the Ark, the testimony of God, and the tabernacle as His enlargement if you are not united in the tabernacle?
In spiritual reality today, He is found in the practical building together of the saints in Him as His dwelling place
Twenty years ago they enjoyed Christ as little pieces of manna day by day, and today they still enjoy Him as such-nothing more
At this juncture, if you would enjoy Christ as the Ark of the Testimony of God, it is impossible as long as you are individual
You are meeting, meeting, meeting, but you are an individualistic person-not merely an individual person but an individualistic person
There is no building between you and others, so the Lord can never be enjoyed or experienced in any further way
Some people today insist that wherever there are two or three meeting together in the Lord's name, it is sufficient
If there were only two or three states, for example, Missouri, Iowa, and Illinois, how weak the country would be!
It is really difficult in any place to find an army formed among the Lord's children; therefore, they are exceedingly weak
Just consider the situation among the Lord's people in one city or area, to say nothing about the entire country and the world
We must fight the battle, not just by two or three; it must be by a group of the Lord's children, a good number, an adequate number
As long as the Lord's people will recognize the all-inclusive Christ and be willing to have a real expression for Him, it is sufficient
In most large cities there are thousands of Christians, but where is the army, where is the tabernacle, where is the priesthood?
There is no unity, no oneness, no submission, no formation, no building up, no tabernacle, no priesthood, no army
If there is no tabernacle, there is no presence of the Lord; the Lord's presence cannot be with us and cannot go with us
The Lord commanded that the fire to burn the incense be taken from the offering altar that the incense may be acceptable to Him
Miriam and Aaron, the elder sister and elder brother of Moses, rebelled against Moses, who at that time was the authority
Of course, as a leader we should be careful; we should not do anything typified by Moses' marrying of a Gentile woman
Perhaps in your city there is a local church, an expression of the Lord's Body, and in that church there are three or four leading brothers
When Miriam and Aaron took this ground and rebelled against authority, they brought upon themselves the judgment of God
Miriam was immediately gripped with leprosy, and although she was subsequently healed, Aaron and Miriam both died later in the wilderness
You will later fall, as Miriam and Aaron, by the wayside in the wilderness; you can never go on to share the all-inclusive, good land
If we rebel, we will be spiritually cut off, and to a certain extent we will kill the testimony, the priesthood, and the army
On one hand, they said the land was exceptionally good, but on the other hand, they said that it was impossible to enter
They asserted that Israel could never conquer the land, and if they tried, they would be utterly defeated and devoured
If we are caught by any union with the world, whether it be the secular or the religious world, we will be rendered powerless
We are built together, standing upon the solid basis of His redemption and covered over by the fullness of Christ
We have been formed under the priesthood to be the army, the divine army to fight the battle for that good land
A much greater Christ is waiting to be possessed, for the goal God has set before us is the all-inclusive Christ
In the eyes of the Lord, when we were buried, all the things we loved, all the things that comprised our world, were buried with us
The Ark with the priesthood entered the river first, and there, in the heart of the river, the Ark with the priesthood stayed
Christ entered into death first and Christ came out of death last He was the first in and the last out we were the last in but the first out
Believing that we have been crucified with Christ and that we have been buried, we must apply this death to ourselves
On this basis, we are then told in Colossians 3:5: 'Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth'
If we realize our burial and resurrection with Christ, we must apply His death to our fleshly members in a practical way by faith
Now we are tasting the greater, the richer, the fuller Christ; now we are enjoying the land, the all-inclusive Christ
Brothers and sisters, as soon as we enjoy Christ in such a way, we realize in our spirit the reality of the evil forces in the heavenlies
By enjoying something of the all-inclusive Christ, we will be burdened for this fighting; we will be burdened for this battle
It is at this stage that we are given the vision of the Lord Christ as the prince, the glorious captain, of the host of Jehovah
He knew then without a shadow of doubt that the Lord Himself as the prince of the army of God was going before him
In other words, before and behind was the army, and in the midst was the Ark with the priests blowing the rams' horns
They all marched around the stronghold of Jericho, the priests blowing the trumpets of rams' horns as they went
Came one division, then the priests blowing the trumpets, then the Ark, and then the remainder of the army at the rear
We can only apprehend the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the all-inclusive Christ with all the saints
We have seen the details of its riches: it is rich in waters, in all kinds of food, both vegetable and animal, and in minerals
By the time Moses the servant of the Lord wrote the book of Deuteronomy everything was ready for the people of Israel to enter into the land
They had the tabernacle with the Ark, they had the priestly service, and they were coordinated and formed into an army
It was he who brought them to this stage of full preparedness, but he himself could not enter into the land with them
He was very much concerned about their future, especially regarding their life after they took possession of the land
With such love and concern, he did his best to instruct them regarding the manner of life they should live after they possessed the land
The book of Deuteronomy precedes the book of Joshua, but the contents of Deuteronomy deal with that which follows Joshua
Joshua deals with the possession of the landcrossing the river fighting the battle entering the land and wresting it from the usurping enemy
People study many subjects for industry, they go into business for industry, and cities are planned for industry
A little sleep, a little slumber, / A little folding of the hands to rest, / And your poverty will come upon you like a robber'
Many Americans have worked diligently upon this land to produce its riches, to bring forth its abundant wealth
We must till our spiritual ground; we must sow the spiritual seed; we must water the spiritual plants-all the time
We must realize that whenever we come to the meetings whenever we come to worship the Lord we should not come with our hands empty
You shall give him the firstfruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your fresh oil, and the first shearing of your sheep'
We are reaping so much of Christ that we are fully satisfied, and beyond that we have a surplus to share with others and to worship God
You must consecrate yourself sincerely to the Lord for the simple purpose of enjoying and experiencing Him-nothing more
You can give him a little of the produce from the Christ upon whom you have been laboring, the Christ whom you have been enjoying day by day
You have been abundantly satisfied with Him, and you have something over to share with the brothers and sisters
When the meeting begins, you are well prepared to offer your prayers and praises to the Lord from your reserve for Him
This is what all our meetings should bean exhibition a fair in which all sorts of the produce of Christ are displayed
At the time of the feast of tabernacles, so many from all over the land came together to their center, Jerusalem
They are rejoicing in the abundance of their harvest and in all the riches they have reaped from that 'good land' in which they are living
At that place in the presence of God, these things were to be enjoyed together with all the children of God and with God Himself
If they desired to eat the meat of the flock or of the herd, they could slay the animals in any place and enjoy them
If we would enjoy Christ in a collective way with the Lord's children, we have no choice; there is only one place to which we can go
When we come into that land which is the all-inclusive Christ, we can no longer do what is right in our own eyes
If there are nine or ten brothers in a certain place, it is so easy for them to say, 'Come, let us form a new church'
If you were an Israelite in the Old Testament times, you could not say to David or Solomon, 'I am not happy with you
We have no right to set up another center for worship-it will only create a division among the Lord's children
We must all go to the very place which the Lord has appointed, where He has set His name and where His habitation is
In the whole universe the Lords Body the Lords dwelling place is only one therefore in every place there should only be one expression of it
You must give up your own thoughts and say in fear and trembling, 'Lord, where is the place that You have chosen?
We must remember the basic and strict rule, that if we would enjoy Him with the Lord's people before God as worship, we cannot do as we like
Brothers and sisters, are you meeting now with God's children in the place which He has appointed, in the place where He has put His name?
The life in the land is a life full of the enjoyment of Christ, both personally and collectively with the Lord's people
Each one, as a type, is complete and perfect in itself, but the last one, the land, is the all-inclusive and greatest type
The passover lamb as a type of Christ is indeed complete and perfect, yet it is a type of Christ on a much smaller scale
As far as the Lord Himself is concerned He is not circumscribed but as far as our experience of Him is concerned there is such a limitation
At the stage of our experience in which we reach the last item, the all-inclusive land, Christ is unlimitedly great to us
Any manner of work from us can only hinder the enjoyment of Christ in these aspects and would be an insult to God
Every group of believers as a local expression of the Body of Christ must be a corporation, a factory to turn out Christ in mass production
If others ask us what our business is, we should be able to answer that it is Christ, and our firm is Christ Incorporated
From every city the Lord's children can bring the Christ they have produced and have an exhibit of His manifold riches
You will see that the peace offering is an offering to be enjoyed by the one who offers it and to be shared with others and with God
Every time we come together to worship God in Christ with Christ and through Christ we are offering Christ as the peace offering
We must realize that when we enjoy Christ not only in an individual way but in a corporate way, there will be an issue
If you come to a city and wander throughout it day by day, having no certain dwelling place, it will be extremely difficult to locate you
If you settle down in a particular house on a certain street in a certain district, you will have a definite address
He was born in America, he was brought up in America, and he is saturated and constituted with the produce of America
A Christian is one who day by day is eating Christ, drinking Christ, digesting Christ, becoming mingled with Christ
There are certain distinguishing characteristics that mark you out as an American, one of which is the things you eat
If you know what the Chinese people eat, you only need to exercise your sense of smell to discern their origin and constitution
If you are familiar with the diet of both the Chinese and the Japanese, you may distinguish them by using your sense of smell
The Japanese eat certain foods which emit certain odors, and the Chinese eat different foods which emit different odors
When he comes together with other Christians who have done the same thing, he brings Christ and they too bring Christ
It is a group of people mingled with Christ, saturated with Christ, enjoying Christ day by day, and coming together with nothing but Christ
Is it possible for us to be formed as an army to fight the enemy and yet within the army to be fighting with each other?
We must become Christ Incorporated the group of Christians who produce Christ enjoy Christ share Christ and offer Christ to God in worship
May we be faithful to Him and learn by His grace how to enjoy Christ, how to experience Christ, and how to apply Christ to our daily lives
