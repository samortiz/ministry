<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Sealing of the Holy Spirit<br>Being the Divine Dispensing</H2><P>Actually, the sealing of the Holy Spirit is the divine dispensing. The sealing of the Holy Spirit is a saturation, and a saturation is a dispensing. Wherever there is saturation, there is dispensing. This Spirit is the last Adam who has become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Today, Christ has accomplished redemption and has washed away our sins. Now as this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit He is living within us and is continually sealing in us. This sealing dispenses the divine life into us. First, through regeneration He becomes the life in our spirit (Rom. 8:10). Then, this life saturates our mind through our spirit, that the soul to whom the mind belongs may be transformed until there is life in the soul (Rom. 8:6). Finally, this life saturates our body to become the life in our body (Rom. 8:11). The ultimate result is that our body will be transfigured. This is the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BELIEVERS' GROWTH IN LIFE<br>BEING THE INCREASE OF<br>THE ELEMENT OF GOD IN THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>First Corinthians 12:4-11 shows us that all the gifts in the Body of Christ are produced by the operation of the Spirit in the believers and are distributed to each of the believers according to His will. These gifts, and especially the gifts that are for the building up of the church, require the growth in life and even the maturity in life. The growth in life of the believers is a matter of the increase of the element of God in the believers (Col. 2:19b). God is perfect; in Himself He is eternally perfect. But as far as we are concerned, what we have received is only a small amount of God. For this reason, we need to grow. If we desire to grow, we must have the increase of the element of God in us. This is not a matter of whether God is complete or incomplete. This is a matter of how much we have gained God. The reason that many Christians have not grown today is that they have not given God the ground. They are not holding the Head, Christ. This being the case, God has no way to dispense more of Himself into them.</P><P>In His position, Christ is the Head, but in our experience, He is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). The Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). He is now with our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). When we enjoy Him in the spirit, we are holding the Head. Then something will come out from the Head that will enable God to grow in us. This means that more of God's element will be dispensed into us. Through the joints the whole Body will then receive the rich supply, which is the rich dispensing of the life of Christ as the Spirit (Col. 2:19a; Eph. 4:16a). The more we receive the supply, the more we will have the dispensing. Without the dispensing, there will not be any supply. The way we receive the supply and the dispensing is through eating, drinking, and enjoying Christ (John 6:57b; 1 Cor. 10:3-4).</P>
