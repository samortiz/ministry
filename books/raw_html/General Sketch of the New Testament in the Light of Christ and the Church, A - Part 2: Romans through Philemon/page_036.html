<h2 class=head2>Becoming the Ministers of Christ through Sufferings and the Experience of Grace</h2><p>The ministers of the new covenant are described in verses 4 through 10, which say, “But in everything we commend ourselves as ministers of God, in much endurance, in afflicTions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings; in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in a holy spirit, in unfeigned love, in the word of truth, in the power of God; through the weapons of righteousness on the right and on the left, through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true; as unknown and yet well known; as dying and yet behold we live; as being disciplined and yet not being put to death; as made sorrowful yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing and yet possessing all things.”<p>Verse 8 speaks of evil report. Many times the evil reports actually comfort us. We should not think that because we are faithful to the Lord that we will always receive good reports. There may be many evil reports about us. Even the apostle Paul suffered many evil reports about himself. Verse 8 also says that the ministers were considered as deceivers. If we are faithful to the Lord, many times people will say that we are deceivers. Only when we are not faithful to the Lord will everyone praise us as being honest. However, that kind of honesty is not the real honesty; it is a diplomatic honesty.<p>Chapter eleven again speaks of the sufferings and the working of the cross upon the ministers of the Lord. In verses 23 through 29 Paul says, “Ministers of Christ are they? I speak as being beside myself, I more so! In labors more abundantly, in imprisonments more abundantly, in stripes excessively, in deaths often. Under the hands of the Jews five times I received forty stripes less one; three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the deep; in journeys often, in dangers of rivers, in dangers of robbers, in dangers from my race, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers in the sea, in dangers among false brothers; in labor and hardship; in watchings often; in hunger and thirst; in fastings often; in cold and nakedness—apart from the things which have not been mentioned, there is this: the crowd of cares pressing upon me daily, the anxious concern for all the churches. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is stumbled, and I myself do not burn?” Here we see a suffering person. The ministry comes out of this kind of suffering.<p>Verse 7 of chapter twelve says, “And because of the transcendence of the revelations, in order that I might not be exceedingly lifted up, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, that he might buffet me, in order that I might not be exceedingly lifted up.” The Lord knew that even the apostle Paul could be proud and lifted up, so he gave him a thorn in the flesh. In the flesh here refers to the physical sufferings in the body. Verses 8 and 9 continue, “Concerning this I entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from me. And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.” The Lord would not answer Paul’s entreaty to take away the thorn. Instead, the Lord left the thorn there to create an opportunity for Paul to experience more and more of His grace.<p>Verse 10 says, “Therefore I am well pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions and distresses, on behalf of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am powerful.” This is the description of a minister and the ministry. The ministry comes out of suffering and from the real experience of the Lord Himself as grace. The strength and the power is the Lord Himself experienced by us and becoming our grace.<h2 class=head1>MINISTERS OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>The book of 2 Corinthians concludes with, “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all” (13:14). This is to say, the Triune God be with you all. Love is the source of grace; grace is the expression, the emergence, of love; and fellowship is the transmission of this grace to us. The love is in the grace, and the grace is in the fellowship. Moreover, the fellowship is of the Holy Spirit. When we have the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, we enjoy the grace of Christ, and when we enjoy the grace of Christ, we have the love of God. This means that the Triune God has been wrought into us, and we are one with the Triune God. As such, we become the ministers of the Triune God with the ministry of the Triune God. We have not merely a gift but the ministry of the Triune God, and we minister the Triune God to others. This is a sketch of the book of 2 Corinthians.
