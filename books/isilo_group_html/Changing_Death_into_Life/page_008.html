<p>When Nicodemus came to the Lord Jesus, he said, &ldquo;Rabbi,...You have come from God as a teacher&rdquo; (v. 2). These words show his concept and knowledge of the Lord Jesus. He called the Lord Jesus <em>Rabbi.</em> The Jews calling someone Rabbi can be compared to the Chinese calling Confucius a teacher. Nicodemus considered the Lord Jesus to be a teacher. Therefore, he said that the Lord Jesus had &ldquo;come from God as a teacher.&rdquo; Nicodemus had the concept that man needed to be taught and that man could be taught how to be good. He believed that man was bad because man had not been taught. Nicodemus&rsquo;s concern was that man needed to be taught by a good teacher. He thought that the Lord Jesus was a teacher sent from God to teach man how to be good and how to do good. Nicodemus believed that man&rsquo;s problem was related to teaching, that man only needed a good teacher.</p>
<p>Many people today have this concept. They believe that in order to be good, a person must receive a good education. They believe that man can be taught how to be good and that a well educated person will surely be good.</p>
<p>Many moral and thoughtful people are just like Nicodemus. They think that as long as people can be taught how to properly conduct and cultivate themselves, people will be good. The human concept is always focused on man&rsquo;s self-cultivation in order to do good.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S VIEW</h2>
<p>People do not realize that this human concept is wrong. Man cannot be good. Man&rsquo;s need is not teaching. The Lord Jesus did not come to be a teacher. When Nicodemus called the Lord Jesus Rabbi, teacher, the Lord interrupted him and said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&rdquo; (v. 3). Nicodemus had the concept that man needs teaching in order to be good. But the Lord Jesus said that man does not need teaching; rather, man needs to be &ldquo;born anew.&rdquo; Teaching is a matter of behavior, but to be born anew is a matter of life. Nicodemus thought that man does not have proper conduct because man has not been taught. His concept was focused on how to change one&rsquo;s conduct. He did not see that man&rsquo;s fundamental problem is not with conduct but with the lack of life.</p>
<p>For example, let us consider a tree that bears sour fruit. Such a tree may be trimmed and fertilized, but it will still not bear good fruit. Trimming and fertilizing will not make the tree bear good fruit. On the contrary, the more the tree is trimmed and fertilized, the more bad fruit it will bear. Hence, it is not a matter of outward trimming and fertilizing but of changing the life within the tree. This does not mean that trimming and fertilizing are not needed but that trimming and fertilizing are secondary matters. The primary matter is that the tree needs a new life. The original life within the tree bears sour fruit. Trimming and fertilizing the tree do not change the nature of the tree&rsquo;s life. Trimming and fertilizing improve the outward appearance of the fruit, but they do not change the taste of the fruit. The outward appearance will change but not the inward taste.</p>
<p>Similarly, education and self-cultivation can at best change someone&rsquo;s outward conduct and living but not his inward life. Teaching and self-cultivation are not primary matters. The primary matter is that he needs a new life. Therefore, the Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus, &ldquo;You must be born anew&rdquo; (v. 7). This means that Nicodemus needed to be regenerated.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR REGENERATION</h2>
<p>The phrase <em>born anew</em> is very interesting. <em>Born</em> is related to childbearing, and <em>anew</em> means &ldquo;again.&rdquo; Therefore, to be born anew is to be born again.</p>
<p>What should we do if we want a tree to bear sweet rather than sour fruit? Tree cultivators know that they should first cut off the branches of the sour fruit tree. Then they cut off a branch from a sweet fruit tree and graft it into the trunk of the sour fruit tree. After some time, the tree will blossom and bear sweet fruit. Trimming and fertilizing will not cause a sour fruit tree to bear sweet fruit. This can be achieved only by changing the life within the tree.</p>
<p>Nicodemus was a man of self-cultivation, but he believed that he could be a better person. Hence, Nicodemus came to ask the Lord Jesus to teach him how to cultivate himself to become a better person. However, the Lord Jesus showed Nicodemus that what he needed was not outward teachings but an inward change in life. Nicodemus needed to be born again.</p>
<p>The focus of believing in Christ is not self-cultivation but regeneration. I have two friends who have told me that religion is good, that all religions exhort men to be good, and that all religions are the same. This thought may be applied to other religions, but it is incorrect when applied to Christianity. To believe in Christ is not a matter of being exhorted to be good. Rather, to believe in Christ is to acknowledge that man cannot be good. It is impossible for man to bear sweet fruit. Man has the desire to be good and the thought to be good, but the human life does not have the ability to be good.</p>
<p>It is right to be good. But man does not have the ability to be good. The human life is fallen; it is bad and cannot be good. In order to be good, man must have a change in life. He must be regenerated.</p>
<p>Many say that man needs to imitate Christ. But how can man imitate Christ without the life of Christ? In order to truly imitate Christ, man must first be regenerated; he must first have the life of Christ. Only those who have the life of Christ can truly imitate and follow Christ.</p>
<p>Suppose a flock of chicks and ducklings are brought to a small river. The ducklings will jump into the water and paddle, but the chicks will be scared and stay far away from the river. The chicks have a life that fears water. Even if they are pushed toward the water, they will not go in. The ducklings, however, have a life that loves water. They will jump into the water even if we try to prevent them. They are not taught to love water, nor were they taught how to swim. This is a characteristic of the duck life. Swimming in water is an innate ability of this life.</p>
<p>Parents tell their children not to lie, and teachers also tell children not to lie. However, children still tell lies. Children are not taught to lie, but lying is a characteristic of the human life. It is an innate ability of the human life.</p>
<p>People are capable of committing many sins. But no one goes to &ldquo;sin school.&rdquo; Who learned how to sin only after attending &ldquo;sin school&rdquo;? Man does not need to attend &ldquo;sin elementary school&rdquo; in order to know how to sin, nor does he need to attend &ldquo;sin college.&rdquo; Sinning is a characteristic of the human life. Sinning is an innate ability of the human life.</p>
<p>When someone turns twenty, his parents may tell him to preserve his standing and not be reckless. But what is the outcome of such exhortation? After wasting his time, the young person may go to a dance hall and meet bad companions. Scandalous behavior is an indication of the type of human life we have. If human life were good, there would not be bad conduct. Man would not bear &ldquo;sour fruit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is your history good or bad? Every honest person will bow his head and say that his history is bad. If we consider our history and our living, we will agree that our human life is bad. Some may say that a schoolmate or colleague corrupted them, but we should not blame others. If our human life were good, no one would be able to corrupt us from the outside. The problem is not with the outward conduct but with the life within. Our need is not a change in outward conduct but a change in life. We need to be regenerated; we need to be born again.</p>
<p>Each kind of life can understand only the things that are in its realm. Monkeys cannot understand the things of men, because monkeys do not have the human life. A child can learn what is taught in kindergarten and then learn what is taught in elementary school. After elementary school he can continue to take classes in junior high school, high school, and college. However, a young monkey is not able to learn what is taught in kindergarten. A monkey cannot take lessons even in elementary school, not to mention college. A monkey cannot understand the things that a man can understand, and a monkey cannot be taught to understand the things in the human realm. In order for a monkey to understand the things of man, it must first have the human life.</p>
<p>Likewise, human beings cannot understand the things related to God&rsquo;s kingdom. A person who does not have God&rsquo;s life cannot be taught to understand the things of God&rsquo;s kingdom. No matter how educated or knowledgeable someone may be, without God&rsquo;s life he cannot understand the things of God&rsquo;s kingdom. Only God&rsquo;s life can understand the things of His kingdom. A person must have God&rsquo;s life through regeneration in order to understand the things of God&rsquo;s kingdom. Therefore, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&rdquo; (v. 3).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus did not come to the world in order to teach man but to give man His life. The Lord Jesus came to the world not to be man&rsquo;s teacher but to be man&rsquo;s life. Teaching is useful only after man has the divine life. Therefore, teaching is not man&rsquo;s primary need; life is man&rsquo;s primary need. Man must first have the divine life. Man must be regenerated.</p>
<p>Many moral and educated men think that moral and educated people do not need to be regenerated. Such people do not know that moral people need to be regenerated just as immoral people need to be regenerated. Educated people need to be regenerated just as uneducated people need to be regenerated. The immoral do not have the divine life and cannot live out God&rsquo;s image, and the moral also do not have the divine life and cannot live out God&rsquo;s image. Uneducated people do not have God&rsquo;s life and cannot understand the things of God, and educated people also do not have God&rsquo;s life and cannot understand the things of God. Therefore, both the educated and the uneducated need God&rsquo;s life, and both the moral and the immoral need to be regenerated.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Changing Death into Life &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
