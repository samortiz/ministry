   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SUPPLYING MINISTER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the interceding and the executing of the will, this very Intercessor and Executor is the Minister, bringing us whatever it is that we need and serving it to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here on earth I may be having trouble upon trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My situation causes me worry and anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I cannot see any way out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This may be my case on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But, hallelujah, a different situation prevails in the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There the High Priest is interceding for me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Executor is carrying out the provisions of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In addition, the Minister picks up the very peace I need and supplies it to me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This peace was promised to me in John 14:27: Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was promised also in Philippians 4:7: The peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When troubles come, however, I forget these promises, which have become bequests, and remember only my worries.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I forget all about what has been bequeathed to me, but He does not.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He comes as the life-giving Spirit indwelling my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He comes as the heavenly Melchisedec, this time bringing not bread and wine, but peace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This One comes to visit me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Within me, for no observable reason, I am suddenly filled with peace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The worry is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The anxiety has vanished.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How has this change come about?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have experienced Christ s heavenly ministry as the High Priest, as the Executor, and as the Minister.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No doubt you too have had experiences like this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the past, however, you did not understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now the light and knowledge have come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No trial should overcome you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You have a High Priest interceding for you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You have One executing the provisions of His will on your behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And you have a Servant supplying you with the right thing at the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In every situation that arises, this heavenly ministry is acting on your behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After many experiences of His care, you will gradually realize that there is no need for you to worry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ is there ministering in the heavens for you!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is interchangeably called High Priest, Minister, and Mediator in Hebrews 8:1, 2, 6; 9:11, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The High Priest is the Minister, and the Minister is the Mediator.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The term Executor is not explicitly used, but it is implied in chapter nine.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For where there is a testament there must of necessity be the death of him who made it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For a testament is confirmed where there has been death, since it has no force when he who made it is living 9:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ in His death enacted the new covenant and bequeathed it to us as the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After death He entered into resurrection and became the One to enforce the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These four titles High Priest, Minister, Mediator, and Executor all refer to Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>IN THE HEAVENS AND WITHIN</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This very Christ is now the Lord in the heavens and at the same time the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now the Lord is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As Lord, He is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As the Spirit, He is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As the One in the heavens, He is exercising His rulership, headship, and priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He exercises His rulership for the spreading of the gospel, that God s chosen people may be brought in. He exercises His headship to cause all His members to grow and function, that His Body might be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He exercises His priesthood to rescue us from all our troublesome entanglements by interceding, by executing the provisions of the new testament, and by serving us whatever we need; this is how He keeps us from falling.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All these are His activities as Lord in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whatever He carries out as Lord, He applies to us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How are all His heavenly functions to be realized by us?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whatever He intercedes, or executes, or ministers, is transmitted into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As the Lord in the heavens, He is the electricity in the power plant; as the Spirit in our spirit, He is the electricity in this building.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord in the heavens and the Spirit in our spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is a continual transmission between the heavens and our spirit, so that whatever transpires there is immediately applied here.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Notice that this traffic is between the heavens and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our mind does not count.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is our mind that causes us to worry.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the heavenly transmission comes, the wonderful reality strengthens our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then our spirit rises to shout, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The transmission has come to our spirit, not to our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Spirit in our spirit is the very One who is Lord in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Romans 8 confirms that the One who is the Spirit is the very One who is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Verse 26 tells us that the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then verse 34 says that Christ Jesus is even at the right hand of God, Who also intercedes for us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Who is interceding for us?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is the Lord Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the heavens it is the Lord; in us it is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The same is true of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is only one Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the heavens He is the Lord; in our spirit He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Doctrinally, we have no satisfactory explanation for this twofold reality; from our experience, however, we do have the confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You may be coming back from work exhausted, wondering how you will find things at home.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Unexpectedly, while you are thinking, you sense that you are supplied and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What is the source of this supply?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It has come from the very Christ who is both Lord in the heavens and the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He is interceding for you, caring for you, and executing the new testament for you.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Based upon this testament, He picks up the life supply and comes to support you with the very thing you need.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You experience Him as Lord, Spirit, High Priest, Executor, and Minister.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He is also the Mediator, transmitting what you need from God the Father, who is the source, into your spirit to supply and support you.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>THE SUSTAINING PRIEST</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Surely we have all experienced this heavenly ministry of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>How is it that we have been kept from falling all these years?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I can testify that this is what has preserved me for over fifty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In His earthly ministry, He died for me on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Now He is serving me in resurrection; this is His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Its main element is the priesthood for the members of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Of course, He did exercise His rulership to see that I was saved and thus brought to God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He also exercised His headship over me to cause me to grow and function and so be built up in His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But mostly it has been His priesthood which He has exercised again and again to preserve me.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Hallelujah for our heavenly High Priest!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We have been sustained, preserved, and supplied by His interceding, His executing the testament, and His ministering to us what we have needed.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I have had no lack.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>A rich life supply has been my portion.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>His preserving and sustaining of us are fully wrapped up with His priesthood, which is based upon the will.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The will is in our hand, and this High Priest is both in the heavens and in us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In the heavens He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In us He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This Lord Spirit constantly ministers the life supply to us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The supply that comes to us is heavenly, because heaven is its source.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Our High Priest is ministering to us in the true tabernacle, the heavenly Holy of Holies, which is joined to our spirit by Him as the heavenly ladder Gen 28:12; John 1:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>By His ministering to us the heavenly supply, He is making us a heavenly people.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We are a people on this earth living a heavenly life.</S>
