<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEW BAPTIZED ONES LEARNING TO<br>PREACH THE GOSPEL, TAKE CARE OF THEIR MEETING,<br>AND TEACH THE TRUTH</H2><P>After you visit them two or three times, they will join you to knock on doors. They will learn to preach the gospel. In Taipei we even saw some right after baptism following the trainees to go out to baptize people. After half a year they will learn how to take care of the meeting. From the first day, you must tell them that this is their meeting, and you are only coming to help. They should function to take care of the meeting. They must learn how to pray, how to sing, how to call a hymn, how to read the Bible, and how to do many things. After six months, they will learn how to take care of the meeting. Then after another two years, they will be able to teach others. All the new baptized ones will learn to preach the gospel, to take care of their meeting, and to teach the truth. There will be thousands of homes where everyone can function, will function, and does function because they have been ushered into such a practice. Then they will spontaneously be led into the knowledge of the church and the practice of the real church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WHOLE CHURCH COMING TOGETHER</H2><P>If in a certain locality the number is quite big, occasionally the whole church can come together once a month or once every two months. If you do not have a big hall, you can rent a place to get all the saints together. The church in Taipei has decided this year to collect all the saints together once a month, renting a stadium that can take thirteen thousand. Last November we had over thirteen thousand meeting together in this stadium. We expect to have in the next two or three months at least ten thousand meeting there for the whole day. For the rest of the days they can all meet in the homes. This is the way to have the church life.</P>
