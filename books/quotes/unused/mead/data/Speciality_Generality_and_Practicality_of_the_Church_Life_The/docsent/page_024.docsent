   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We also need to practice the universal priesthood Rev 1:6; 5:10 , which means that every believer is a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the practice of the church life, we should not have clergy or laymen, but only priests.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Body of Christ we are members, and in the service to God the Father we are priests.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we not only must function in the meetings; we also must serve.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the church there is much service, and everyone should take part in these services.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Be a serving priest, not just a functioning member.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all must practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>ENDEAVORING TO BEAR FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the church life we all need to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus said, "I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain" John 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not solely to have the outreach by preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nor is it only to have "soul winning."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is to impart life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Matthew 28:19, Mark 16:15, and Luke 24:47 we are told to go and preach, but in the Gospel of John we are told to go and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Gospel of John is a book on life; therefore, the preaching, the outreach, in this book is the impartation of life to others, causing them to become fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Never say that numbers do not mean anything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Acts 11:21 the divine record says, "A great number believed."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If numbers do not mean anything, the Holy Spirit would never have said this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In married life we need children.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If after a long period of time a married couple does not have children, this indicates that something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Also the bringing forth of children is simply to impart the life we have into our children.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We also need some spiritual children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to impart our spiritual life into our spiritual children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the local church in a certain place has fifty this year, the next year fifty-one, the third year forty-nine, and the fourth year forty-five, the church should not try to vindicate itself by saying that it does not care for numbers, but only for quality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A local church needs numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although in a spiritual sense, some members that are brought forth may be crippled, blind, deaf, or lame, it is still good.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In appearance it may be a mess, but it is better than nothing, and something will come out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Physically, some lame fathers have brought forth very strong sons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All local churches must encourage every brother and sister to produce.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the saints must endeavor to bring forth fruit, even remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not be troubled thinking that if we bring forth many, the church cannot take care of them and some will die.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps this is true, but some will remain, and this is better than nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every marriage that is normal produces children.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to stress this very much and put it into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>FEEDING THE LAMBS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The next point is the feeding of the lambs John 21:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Bearing fruit is one thing; feeding the lambs is another.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are proper, on one hand, we bring many unbelievers to the meetings and, on the other hand, we take care of several new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to bear fruit, and we also have to feed the lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In these two matters we should not be special or particular.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church is for everyone, including the young people, the middle aged ones, and the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church is for all kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not know from what direction the Lord will bring people into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>While Peter was suffering persecution in Jerusalem, he might have thought that Saul of Tarsus surely was going to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But beyond Peter's expectation, the Lord turned Saul into an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church is not built up with the persons we intend to have, but with the persons God has chosen before the foundation of the world Eph 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot predict whether our children, our parents, our cousins, our schoolmates, or our neighbors will be the church people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only the Lord knows.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We just go in a general way according to the Lord's leading and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not do anything special, strange, or peculiar, and don't classify people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord may even raise up some good saints from the opposing ones.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Who will be saved, who will be the elders, who will be the spiritual ones, only the Lord knows.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not up to us; it is up to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yet we still have to do our duty to bear fruit and feed the lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is not your work, nor my work, nor even our work; it is the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>SPREADING BY MIGRATION</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Acts 8:1 we see that persecution came against the church in Jerusalem, thus scattering the saints and forcing them to migrate.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Acts 11:19 shows that the scattered ones preached the gospel as they went, and some local churches were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Reports went back to the church in Jerusalem, and it sent Barnabas to have fellowship with them Acts 11:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The spreading of the gospel and the church life in the first century began by the migration of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The going out of the apostles began from Antioch Acts 13:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, a good number of the saints in the local churches should be migrating ones; first migrating from city to city, and state to state within this country, and then migrating to other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For the sake of the Lord's recovery, we should not be narrow sighted and only set our eyes on the local church in the city where we reside.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need a larger view.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The more a church gives up people for migration, the more people it gets.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The more a church keeps, the more it loses.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do not try to keep people.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do your best to give them for the Lord's spread.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do not be narrow sighted, thinking you will lose something.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You will never lose.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even if you lose on this earth, surely you will gain in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Praise the Lord for the way of migration!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A FINAL WORD</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>None of the points that we have covered in the last three chapters are aspects of our Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, all of them should be put into practice; otherwise, a local church could never be strong and prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If all of these points are put into practice, a local church will become strong and prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>These are not items of our Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But they must become part of the practicality of the church life.</S>
