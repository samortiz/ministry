   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Coming Discipline In Principle</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Son of Man is to come...and then He will repay each man according to his doings Matt 16:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Lord returns, He will repay each man according to his doings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the context of this verse, the Lord s word does not refer to His judgment of worldly people; rather, it refers to His judgment of the believers, of the disciples who are following Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When He comes, He will repay each man according to his doings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that He will judge and repay us according to our doings after our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If our actions are pleasing and acceptable to Him, He will give us a reward; if they are not pleasing and acceptable, He will chastise us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is certain, and we cannot deny it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All believers will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ when the Lord returns, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what they have practiced, whether good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we have done good things, we will receive a reward, and if we have done bad things, we will receive punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ones doing good receive a reward; the ones doing evil will receive punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the Lord considers our actions today to be good, we will receive a good recompense, a reward, but if the Lord considers our actions today to be evil, we will receive a negative recompense, a punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is something that we cannot fail to acknowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the two preceding verses, some believers will receive a reward when the Lord returns, and some will receive punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These two portions speak of a principle: if the Lord approves of and accepts a believer s actions today as being good, He will reward the believer when He returns, but if the Lord condemns a believer s actions today as being evil, He will punish the believer when He returns.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the principle, but now we need to see the details associated with this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Detail</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Enter in through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction...Narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to life Matt 7:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have seen that the Lord s teachings on the mountain in Matthew 5 7 speak of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord spoke these words to His disciples, not to unbelieving sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These words do not speak of salvation from perdition for sinners; rather, they speak of entering the kingdom of the heavens for saved believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, the future consequences that are referenced in these chapters do not relate to a person s salvation from perdition but to a person s status in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This applies to the content of verses 13 and 14.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We cannot take verses out of context; we must determine the meaning of these verses based upon the meaning of the Lord s entire teaching on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the Lord s teachings on the mountain, the phrase leads to destruction does not refer to perdition but to being unable to enter the kingdom of the heavens and encountering destruction; the phrase leads to life does not refer to the life obtained through salvation but to entering the kingdom of the heavens to enjoy it as a realm of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is different from John 3:16 which speaks of man receiving either eternal life or perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here it says that we are led to destruction or to life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we believe, eternal life enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, being led to life by following the Lord to take the constricted way is to enter into this life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This refers to our future entrance into the realm of life in the kingdom of the heavens to enjoy it blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since this is the significance of leads to life, the phrase leads to destruction must refer to encountering the destruction of punishment instead of being able to enter into the realm of life in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such destruction will be the end of those believers who are unwilling to enter in by the narrow gate and follow the Lord on the constricted way but who instead enter through the wide gate and follow their own will to walk on the broad way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This destruction will be their punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens...Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And then I will declare to them: I never knew you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness Matt 7:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This word was spoken during the Lord s teaching on the mountain, so it does not refer to unbelievers who will go into eternal perdition but rather to believers who will not be able to enter the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This group is not made up of unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We know they are saved because they call Him their Lord cf.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rom 10:13 , and they serve the Lord and do good works in His name which even the Lord does not deny .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although they are saved, they will not be able to enter the kingdom of the heavens when the Lord comes in that day because they did not work for the Lord according to God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although they did many good things, they did not do them according to the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although they worked in the Lord s name, they did not do God s will; instead, they acted contrary to God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Lord s eyes they are workers of lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This can be likened to a school that has a lights-out rule at ten o clock.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If some students study after ten, they are breaking the school rules, even though they may be doing something beneficial.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the school s eyes, however, they are being lawless.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Similarly, those who do a work for the Lord that is not according to God s will are lawless in His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since their actions are not according to God s will, He does not know or approve of them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Greek for never knew in verse 23 is translated do not acknowledge in Romans 7:15.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the King James Version it is translated allow not, and in Darby s version and Berry s Greek-English interlinear version, which is based on Stephen s Greek text, it is translated do not own.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Romans 7:15 Paul says, What I work out, I do not acknowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to the context of this verse, what Paul works out is not something that he allows, owns, or approves of because what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do v. 15 . Since he does what he hates, he certainly does not allow, own, or approve of it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Similarly, the Lord considers those who are not working according to God s will to be lawless, and He does not acknowledge, allow, own, or approve of them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, they will be refused by the Lord and will not be able to enter the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This will be the end of every worker for the Lord who does not work according to the will of God; it will be the punishment they receive.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He who finds his soul-life shall lose it ; Whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it ; Whoever seeks to preserve his soul-life will lose it ; He who loves his soul-life loses it Matt 10:39; 16:25; Mark 8:35; Luke 17:33; John 12:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have previously seen that these verses, which speak of losing the soul-life, refer to believers not being able to enter the kingdom of the heavens because they were unwilling to allow their soul to suffer in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The coming kingdom of the heavens will be given to those who were willing to give up the enjoyment of their soul in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus, everyone who enters the kingdom of the heavens will experience a marvelous enjoyment in their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Those who cannot enter the kingdom of the heavens will not enjoy its glory and happiness; instead, they will suffer shame and loss.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, their soul will feel a particular suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Those who seek to save or preserve their soul-life today by being unwilling to lose their soul-life for the Lord s sake with respect to their families, desires, or other matters will lose their soul-life when the Lord returns.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They will feel a particular suffering in their soul that will be associated with punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Everyone of you who does not forsake all his own possessions...If even the salt becomes tasteless...It is fit neither for the land nor for the manure pile; they will throw it out Luke 14:33-35; see also Matt 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The believers are the salt of the earth, so they should forsake all their possessions and the world; they should be separated from the worldly people and be full of the pure flavor of salt with its germ-killing power.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But some believers are unwilling to forsake everything and instead lust after worldly enjoyment, so they lose their salty flavor as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although they may not sin, they lose their heavenly flavor as Christians, and they lose their separation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In their living, interests, attire, and adornment, they are not at all different from worldly people, and even the worldly people cannot taste a pure, heavenly flavor in them or sense God s power bringing them out of filthy things.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They love what the worldly people love; they are unwilling to love the Lord above all else.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although they are Christians, they do not have the flavor of a Christian, nor can they fulfill the function of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord says these ones are fit neither for the land nor for the manure pile; He can only throw them out.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In Luke 14:35 the Lord speaks of three places: the land, the manure pile, and outside.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the Bible, land refers to the earth created by God Matt 13:38, 44 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The land here refers to the earth during the restoration of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord will use the overcoming Christians to rule the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The manure pile is a most filthy place.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Since hell is the filthiest place in the whole universe, the manure pile refers to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Outside refers to a place outside the glory of the coming kingdom of the heavens but different from the manure pile.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Christians who have lost their flavor will be unsuitable to rule on the earth in the coming age because they were not faithful, but they will also be unsuitable for the filthiest place because even though they have committed sins, they have been eternally saved.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The only thing left for them is to be thrown outside the glory of the coming kingdom of the heavens, which puts them to shame, because they do not have the flavor of the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This will be the end of all believers who are unwilling to leave everything to follow the Lord today; it will also be their punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Out of your mouth I will judge you, wicked slave ; Evil and slothful slave...Even that which he has shall be taken away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>And cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth Luke 19:22; Matt 25:26, 29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In these verses the Lord spoke of those who have received His gift but do not faithfully and diligently use it to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When He returns, He will condemn them, take away their gift, and cast them into the outer darkness where there is the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Being cast into outer darkness is different from being cast into the lake of fire Rev 20:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The lake of fire is where sinners are punished for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Outer darkness is where the Lord s unfaithful servants are punished when He returns.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Outer refers to a place apart from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When the Lord returns and judges the believers, He will be in His glory, that is, in the light of His glory Matt 16:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>To be outside is to be outside the light of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This outer place is darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Psalm 18:9-12 says that when the Lord returns there will be darkness surrounding His brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Outer darkness must refer to the darkness outside the light of His glory when He returns.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The Lord s faithful servants will be with Him in the light of His glory with joy; the unfaithful servants will be thrown from the light of His glory into darkness to weep and gnash their teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>They weep and gnash their teeth because they are ashamed and suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This will be the end of all those who are not faithful in serving the Lord today; it will also be their punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If that slave says in his heart, My master is delaying his coming, and begins to beat the male servants and the female servants and to eat and to drink and become drunk, the master of that slave will come... and will cut him asunder, and will appoint his portion with the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>And that slave who knew his master s will and did not prepare or do according to his will, will receive many lashes; but he who did not know, yet did things worthy of stripes, will receive few lashes.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>But to everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required from him; and to whom much has been committed, they will ask of him all the more ; Appoint his portion with the hypocrites.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth Luke 12:45-48; Matt 24:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If those who serve the Lord do whatever they want because the Lord delays His coming, if they fight with their fellow servants and indulge their lusts, if they clearly know the Lord s will but do not do it, and if they do not prepare for the Lord s coming and for the settling of accounts with Him, they will be punished when the Lord returns.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The Lord will severely punish them and appoint their portion with the unbelievers and the hypocrites.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Therefore, they will weep and gnash their teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>More will be required of those who have received much instruction from the Lord, who understand more of His will, and who have received a greater commission from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Since the Lord will require more of them, He will punish them with more lashes if they fail to do His will.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>However, even those who did not know these things will receive some lashes if they do things that He condemns.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>However, the number of lashes that they receive will be much less.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Thus, all the servants of the Lord, both those who know and those who do not know, will receive punishment from the Lord if they do things that the Lord condemns.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Although the punishment will differ in its severity, no one will be exempt.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>If one does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up; and they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned John 15:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>A believer must abide in the Lord, just as a branch of the vine abides in the vine v. 5 ; he must have unhindered fellowship with the Lord in order to absorb the Lord s riches and to bear the fruit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>If he leaves the Lord and his fellowship with the Lord is broken, he will lose the function of bearing fruit for the Lord and will not be able to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The Lord said that believers who do not abide in Him, whose fellowship with Him is broken, and who do not have the function of bearing spiritual fruit will come to a certain end, a punishment, like that of branches being cut off, dried up, picked up, and cast into the fire to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>If a believer breaks his fellowship with the Lord and loses his spiritual function in life, the Lord will not only cast him out to dry up but will also have him thrown into the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>This does not refer to being thrown into the lake of fire, which is related to eternal perdition, because anyone who is a member of the Body is a member of the Lord with His life and cannot perish in eternity 10:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>A believer who has the Lord s life and is a member of the Body can never be thrown into the lake of fire to eternally perish simply because his fellowship with the Lord was broken, and he did not bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>If this were the case, it would mean a believer s eternal salvation depended on works.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>But the Bible clearly and assuredly tells us that salvation and the obtaining of eternal life are by faith alone and nothing more.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Thus, the Lord s word about being cast into fire must refer to something else.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>According to 1 Corinthians 3:15, it refers to a punishment that the believers who have broken their fellowship with Lord and who do not bear fruit in this age will receive when He returns.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>If anyone builds...wood, grass, stubble, the work of each will become manifest; for the day will declare it, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one s work, of what sort it is...If anyone s work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire 1 Cor 3:12-13, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Those who serve the Lord must be careful how they work because they can build with gold, silver, and precious stones or with wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Building with gold, silver, and precious stones involves work that is according to the divine nature, in the principle of the cross, and for the expression of God s glorious image.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Building with wood, grass, and stubble is exactly the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>In the Bible wood refers to the human nature Exo 25:10, 23 ; grass refers to the will of the flesh or the flesh 1 Pet 1:24 ; and stubble, according to its nature and condition, refers to what is earthly, lifeless, and worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Thus, to build with wood, grass, and stubble is to work according to the human nature, according to the flesh, and according to the general condition of the earth; it is a work that is full of the self, the will of the flesh, and the flesh, and it also expresses an earthly element.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>When the Lord returns, the nature of the work of each person will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>The work of each one will be manifested and tested by fire to reveal its true nature.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>If one s work has been built using gold, silver, and precious stones, it will remain after passing through the test of fire, and the worker will be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>If one s work has been built using wood, grass, and stubble, it will burn up as it passes through the test of fire, and the worker will suffer loss but not the loss of his salvation, because he himself will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Although he will be saved, it will be as if he has passed through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>This will be a punishment to all the Lord s workers who work according to themselves, according to their flesh, and with an expression of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Paul clearly shows that receiving a reward or suffering a loss has nothing to do with our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Apart from our salvation, we may receive a reward, and apart from our salvation, we may suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Although we suffer loss, we will be saved, but this does not mean that we will have no problems, because we still must pass through something like fire.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Too many of God s children today think that as long as they are saved, they have no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>In their eyes eternal perdition is the only problem, and they think that as long as they are saved, they have no worries.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>But the Bible reveals that eternal perdition is not the only consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Apart from salvation, we still need to be concerned about whether we will receive a reward or suffer a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Salvation is something we receive as soon as we believe in the Lord, and we receive it once for eternity, but in addition to salvation there is the matter of receiving a reward or suffering loss.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>This is a matter that we cannot neglect.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Brothers and sisters, this word is so clear: He will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>I hope we will see that there is still the possibility of suffering loss even though our salvation is eternally secure.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>The reward that believers will receive is an entrance into the kingdom of the heavens; this should stir up our appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>In contrast, the punishment that some believers will receive will be like passing through fire; this should stir up our fear.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>More than ten years ago an elderly brother invited me to eat with some co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>At that dinner there was another elderly believer who knew the Bible very well but who did not believe that believers would be punished in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>He said to one of the co-workers, Some say that Matthew 25 refers to saved ones when it speaks of evil servants being thrown out into outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>Please tell me, how can a saved person be thrown into darkness?</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>When he said this, I knew that his words were really directed toward me because by that time I had written a book The Kingdom of the Heavens, and I had made this point in the book.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>The co-worker also knew that he was really addressing me, so he looked at me and indicated that I should answer the question.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>Since this elderly saint did not directly ask me his question, I did not directly answer him.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>Instead, I asked the brother who had invited us to dinner if the wife of Lot was saved or not in type.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>When he said that he had never considered this question, I asked him to consider it because he knew the Bible very well.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>I said, If you say she was not saved, I would answer that the angels took her out of the city of Sodom before its destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>If you say that she was saved, I would answer that she never reached the city of Zoar with Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>She became a pillar of salt while she was on her way Gen 19:16-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>Please consider, was she saved or not?</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>This brother turned to the one who had originally posed the question and asked him whether he thought Lot s wife was saved or not.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>He could not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>I waited for a moment and then continued.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>I said that most of today s Christians are only concerned about two matters salvation and perdition and only two places heaven and hell.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>They have not seen that the Bible speaks of another matter apart from salvation and perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>Lot s wife did not suffer perdition with the city of Sodom, nor was she saved into the city of Zoar; instead, she was left in a third place as a pillar of salt to be a warning to future generations.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>This warning is especially for us believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>The Lord said, Remember Lot s wife Luke 17:32 ; furthermore, the Lord spoke this word in His warning concerning the possibility of being put to shame when He returns.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>I continued to say that the Bible shows that there can be a third place for us, just as there was for Lot s wife.</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>The Lord spoke of this third place in Luke 14 when He spoke of Christians who had lost their salty flavor because of their love for the world.</S>
   <S PAR='183' RSNT='1' SNO='183'>His word compares believers, who were useless as salt, with Lot s wife, who became a useless pillar of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='184' RSNT='1' SNO='184'>Such ones are fit neither for the land nor for the manure pile, and they must be thrown out.</S>
   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>Being thrown out involves a third place.</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>Then I said that 1 Corinthians 3 also shows the matter of suffering loss, which does not involve either salvation or perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='187' RSNT='1' SNO='187'>I continued by saying that this passage clearly says that some believers will suffer loss when the Lord comes but that they themselves will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='188' RSNT='1' SNO='188'>Even though they are saved, they will still have to pass through something like fire.</S>
   <S PAR='189' RSNT='1' SNO='189'>The two elderly brothers clearly knew this passage in 1 Corinthians 3, so I asked the elderly brother, who was hosting the dinner, which punishment he would choose if he had to choose between being thrown into darkness or passing through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='190' RSNT='1' SNO='190'>He quickly answered that he would choose to be thrown into the darkness because he thought it was a lesser punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='191' RSNT='1' SNO='191'>Then I said that even if being thrown into darkness is a lighter punishment than passing through fire, the Bible still says that some believers will suffer loss as if they have passed through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='192' RSNT='1' SNO='192'>Consequently, if some believers will suffer such a severe punishment, why is it unreasonable to expect that some saved believers will be thrown into darkness?</S>
   <S PAR='193' RSNT='1' SNO='193'>When I got to this point, the host turned to the elderly brother and said, He has answered your question.</S>
   <S PAR='194' RSNT='1' SNO='194'>The other elderly brother then said, That is not really passing through fire because it says so as through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='195' RSNT='1' SNO='195'>When the host heard this, he said, Even if it is so as through fire, it is a considerable suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='196' RSNT='1' SNO='196'>This is a serious matter that we must face.</S>
   <S PAR='197' RSNT='1' SNO='197'>Will we receive a reward or a punishment when the Lord returns?</S>
   <S PAR='198' RSNT='1' SNO='198'>Will we receive the reward of the kingdom of the heavens or will we suffer loss that is like passing through fire?</S>
   <S PAR='199' RSNT='1' SNO='199'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='200' RSNT='1' SNO='200'>We need to take the responsibility to resolve it for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='201' RSNT='1' SNO='201'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='202' RSNT='1' SNO='202'>Whoever will deny Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father who is in the heavens Matt 10:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='203' RSNT='1' SNO='203'>If we deny the Lord before others because we are afraid of being opposed or persecuted by them, the Lord will deny us before His Father when He returns.</S>
   <S PAR='204' RSNT='1' SNO='204'>According to the context of this verse, His denying does not refer to eternal perdition but to receiving a shameful punishment from Him when He returns, because we did not confess Him before others out of fear and shame.</S>
   <S PAR='205' RSNT='1' SNO='205'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='206' RSNT='1' SNO='206'>Whoever is ashamed of Me and of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels Mark 8:38 .</S>

   <S PAR='214' RSNT='1' SNO='214'>Since this is the case, the Lord s warnings to the believers in these epistles must also speak of punishments during the kingdom age.</S>

   <S PAR='220' RSNT='1' SNO='220'>Matthew 10:28 says that we should not fear those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul; instead, we should fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.</S>
   <S PAR='221' RSNT='1' SNO='221'>According to the context of verses 24 and 25, this word was spoken to the Lord s servants.</S>
   <S PAR='222' RSNT='1' SNO='222'>Therefore, the Lord s servants, who are saved ones, will receive such a punishment if they are afraid to die for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='223' RSNT='1' SNO='223'>This does not mean that they will perish for eternity.</S>

   <S PAR='265' RSNT='1' SNO='265'>The first warning, in 2:1-4, is given to warn us to not neglect the Lord s great salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='266' RSNT='1' SNO='266'>In this salvation the Son of God, who has greater glory than the angels, became a man, who was lower than the angels, to be the Author of our salvation v. 10 .

   <S PAR='275' RSNT='1' SNO='275'>If those in the Old Testament were punished for disobeying the law given through angels, should not we receive a greater punishment if we neglect the salvation accomplished for us by the Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='276' RSNT='1' SNO='276'>This word does not refer to sinners, who neglect God s salvation of forgiveness and justification and thus are unable to avoid condemnation and perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='277' RSNT='1' SNO='277'>Rather, it refers to believers since it was written to Hebrew believers at that time who will be condemned and punished for neglecting God s great salvation, which they had obtained.</S>

   <S PAR='310' RSNT='1' SNO='310'>Now we need to build upon the foundation that was laid.</S>
   <S PAR='311' RSNT='1' SNO='311'>The foundation comprises 1 repentance from dead works, 2 faith in God, 3 the teaching of baptisms, 4 the teaching of the laying on of hands, 5 the resurrection of the dead, and 6 the eternal judgment vv.</S>
   <S PAR='312' RSNT='1' SNO='312'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='313' RSNT='1' SNO='313'>We obtained these at the time of our salvation, and now we must grow; we do not need to obtain them again.</S>
   <S PAR='314' RSNT='1' SNO='314'>Verse 3 then says, This we will do if God permits.</S>
   <S PAR='315' RSNT='1' SNO='315'>If God gives us grace, and He has, we must leave the word of the beginning and endeavor to grow to maturity; we must not lay again a foundation but rather grow.</S>
   <S PAR='316' RSNT='1' SNO='316'>This portion explains that we do not need to lay again a foundation, because it is impossible for those who are saved and have once been enlightened, have tasted of the heavenly gift, have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, and yet have fallen away from the Lord s word and way, to renew themselves again unto repentance by crucifying again for themselves the Son of God, which puts Him to open shame.</S>
   <S PAR='317' RSNT='1' SNO='317'>The powers of the age to come refers to the power in the coming kingdom age to cast out demons, heal the sick, and work miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='318' RSNT='1' SNO='318'>These powers will be used in the kingdom age to fully deal with anything that is related to demons, sickness, and suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='319' RSNT='1' SNO='319'>We do not need to lay again a foundation, because we cannot renew ourselves again unto repentance, which is the foundation that has already been laid.</S>
   <S PAR='320' RSNT='1' SNO='320'>Hebrews speaks of not laying again because it is impossible...to renew...again unto repentance vv.</S>
   <S PAR='321' RSNT='1' SNO='321'>1, 4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='322' RSNT='1' SNO='322'>Since the foundation has been laid by God, it is impossible for us to lay it again.</S>
   <S PAR='323' RSNT='1' SNO='323'>Even if we could lay it again, it would not count for anything before God.</S>
   <S PAR='324' RSNT='1' SNO='324'>When a couple gets married, they may fight and not speak to each other for a while, but when they reconcile with each other, they do not need to get married again, and even if they held another wedding ceremony, it would not count for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='325' RSNT='1' SNO='325'>It is impossible for us to renew ourselves again to repentance; we only need to come back to the place from which we fell, confess our sin in falling, and continue to be brought on to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='326' RSNT='1' SNO='326'>If we were to lay again a foundation and renew our repentance, we would need to crucify for ourselves the Son of God, and this would openly put Him to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='327' RSNT='1' SNO='327'>This is impossible, and we should not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='328' RSNT='1' SNO='328'>If we try to lay a foundation and do not build upon the one that has been laid, if we try to renew ourselves again unto repentance for the things we repented of when we were saved, and if we do not grow, we will be like a field that receives rain but does not grow things that are suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='329' RSNT='1' SNO='329'>Thus, we will be disapproved and become near to a curse, and our end will be to be burned v. 8 . This end is not perdition but a suffering of loss.</S>
   <S PAR='330' RSNT='1' SNO='330'>The word disapproved in verse 8 is the same Greek word that is in 1 Corinthians 9:27.</S>
   <S PAR='331' RSNT='1' SNO='331'>There the apostle does not say that he would perish; he says that if he did not run well, he would become disapproved by the Lord and lose the crown and suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='332' RSNT='1' SNO='332'>To become near a curse is different from being under a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='333' RSNT='1' SNO='333'>Unbelievers are under a curse, but believers who do not grow or who are defeated become near a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='334' RSNT='1' SNO='334'>The thorns and thistles that grow up from the earth in Hebrews 6:8 are what is burned, not the earth itself.</S>
   <S PAR='335' RSNT='1' SNO='335'>When believers are judged in the future, their living and work of wood, grass, and stubble will be burned 1 Cor 3:10-15 , and they will suffer loss for their lack of growth and their defeat, but they themselves will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='336' RSNT='1' SNO='336'>Therefore, this portion does not refer to the eternal perdition of false believers who were never saved, as Mr. Scofield and those who follow him assert.</S>
   <S PAR='337' RSNT='1' SNO='337'>We know this because it says that they have 1 been enlightened, 2 have tasted of the heavenly gift, 3 have partaken of the Holy Spirit, 4 have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, and 5 have fallen away from the Lord s word and way.</S>
   <S PAR='338' RSNT='1' SNO='338'>Such ones must be saved because only saved ones have these five qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='339' RSNT='1' SNO='339'>If a person who has these qualifications is not saved, what qualifications must one have in order to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='340' RSNT='1' SNO='340'>This portion also does not refer to saved believers losing their salvation, which some assert is possible; however, we know that this is not possible, because the Bible clearly says that once a person is saved, he obtains eternal life and shall by no means perish forever John 10:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='341' RSNT='1' SNO='341'>To say that a believer can perish because he falls after his salvation goes against the basic truths of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='342' RSNT='1' SNO='342'>This passage does not refer to the eternal perdition of false believers or to the eternal perdition of saved believers who have fallen; it refers to a temporary punishment in the kingdom age for believers who do not grow or who are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='343' RSNT='1' SNO='343'>This portion emphasizes the need to grow, the way to grow, and the end for those who fail to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='344' RSNT='1' SNO='344'>Their end is not eternal perdition but punishment from the Lord in the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='345' RSNT='1' SNO='345'>18.</S>
   <S PAR='346' RSNT='1' SNO='346'>Not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is,...and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.</S>
   <S PAR='347' RSNT='1' SNO='347'>For when we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins, but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fervor of fire, which is to consume the adversaries.</S>
   <S PAR='348' RSNT='1' SNO='348'>Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without compassion on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='349' RSNT='1' SNO='349'>By how much do you think he will be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled underfoot the Son of God and has considered the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing and has insulted the Spirit of grace?</S>
   <S PAR='350' RSNT='1' SNO='350'>For we know Him who said, Vengeance is Mine; I will repay ; and again, The Lord will judge His people.</S>
   <S PAR='351' RSNT='1' SNO='351'>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God Heb 10:25-31, see also vv.</S>
   <S PAR='352' RSNT='1' SNO='352'>19-24, 32-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='353' RSNT='1' SNO='353'>The fourth warning, in 10:19-39, is given to warn us to come forward to the Holy of Holies and to not shrink back to Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='354' RSNT='1' SNO='354'>God s Son, Christ, offered Himself once for all as an eternal sin offering and with His own blood entered once for all into the Holy of Holies in the heavens, accomplishing an eternal redemption for us 9:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='355' RSNT='1' SNO='355'>He established the new covenant with His blood, which is better than the old covenant established with the blood of bulls and goats that could not remove sin eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='356' RSNT='1' SNO='356'>He is in the heavenly Holy of Holies as the Mediator of this better covenant v. 15 . Therefore, the blood of this better covenant can purify our conscience and give us the boldness to enter the Holy of Holies to contact God, serve Him, and participate in the heavenly worship and service 10:19-22 . In this new covenant we also have God s law of life in us which enables us to know God without anyone teaching us 8:1 10:18 . This Epistle warns the Hebrew believers that they should not despise the Son of God and the new covenant He established and that they should not go back to Judaism to serve God with the old covenant offerings of the blood of bulls and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='357' RSNT='1' SNO='357'>In the early days of the church, many Jews who believed in the Lord were still zealous for the law of Moses despite the fact that they believed in the salvation of Christ Acts 21:20-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='358' RSNT='1' SNO='358'>Although they were under the new covenant, they still kept the ordinances of the old covenant, so they were in the church but also in Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='359' RSNT='1' SNO='359'>At the time Hebrews was written sometime after A.D. 60 , Jewish authorities were promoting the persecution of Jewish believers in an effort to force them to abandon the church and return to Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='360' RSNT='1' SNO='360'>These authorities even seized the household property of the believers Heb 10:32-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='361' RSNT='1' SNO='361'>In this situation, some Jewish believers naturally became weak and doubted whether or not they should completely reject Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='362' RSNT='1' SNO='362'>The apostle wrote this letter to bring those in Judaism out of that religion and to call them to stand absolutely in the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='363' RSNT='1' SNO='363'>Therefore, in 8:1 10:18 the apostle shows how Christ and the covenant He established are superior to the old covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='364' RSNT='1' SNO='364'>In 10:25 he exhorts the Jewish believers not to abandon their own assembling together, that is, not to abandon the Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='365' RSNT='1' SNO='365'>If they abandoned the Christian meetings, they would return to Judaism in order to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='366' RSNT='1' SNO='366'>If they abandoned their assembling together, they would be going against the truth that God had established a new covenant and abolished the old, the truth that the blood of bulls and goats in the old covenant cannot take away man s sins, the truth that only the blood of Jesus can take away our sins, and the truth that the offerings of bulls and goats in the old covenant were only shadows of the good things to come.</S>
   <S PAR='367' RSNT='1' SNO='367'>After knowing these truths, if they went back to Judaism to offer sacrifices of bulls and goats according to the old covenant that God had abolished, they would be sinning willfully v. 26 . God wanted them to stand absolutely on the ground of the new covenant to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='368' RSNT='1' SNO='368'>Based on their knowledge, they would be deliberately sinning if they went back to Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='369' RSNT='1' SNO='369'>But even if they went back to Judaism, there still would no longer be a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins because these sacrifices had been abolished v. 26 . In the Old Testament there were daily sin offerings, but in the New Testament a daily sin offering is abolished because Christ accomplished an eternal redemption so that there is no longer an offering for sin v. 18 . In the New Testament age there is no longer a sin offering made by killing bulls or goats, nor is there a need for such an offering.</S>
   <S PAR='370' RSNT='1' SNO='370'>If the Hebrew believers returned to Judaism to offer sacrifices, their offerings would be worthless as a sacrifice and in rebellion against God.</S>
   <S PAR='371' RSNT='1' SNO='371'>In such a condition, there is only a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fervor of fire of the kind that consumes the adversaries v. 27 . Because some believers returned to Judaism to offer sacrifices of bulls and goats, they trampled the Son of God underfoot, placing Him on the same level with bulls and goats v. 29 . They also considered the blood of God s Son, which had sanctified them, as something common by putting it on the same level as the blood of bulls and goats v. 29 . When they did this, they not only considered the Son of God and His blood to be common; they also insulted the Spirit of grace the Greek word for insulted is different from the word blasphemed in Matthew 12:31 . The Holy Spirit was operating in them, leading them to simply believe and trust in the Son of God and in His blood and telling them not to return to Judaism to offer sacrifices of bulls and goats, but they insulted Him by ignoring Him.</S>
   <S PAR='372' RSNT='1' SNO='372'>Therefore, they surely would receive a heavier punishment because the Lord will judge His people and have vengeance on them Heb 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='373' RSNT='1' SNO='373'>If the Lord s people do things against His will and despise His salvation and insult His Spirit, they will fall into the hands of the living God to be judged by Him, and their end will be terrible v. 31 ! This does not refer to eternal perdition but to being disciplined by the Lord in the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='374' RSNT='1' SNO='374'>This section clearly shows that in the future some who are sanctified by the Lord s blood will still be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='375' RSNT='1' SNO='375'>19.</S>
   <S PAR='376' RSNT='1' SNO='376'>See that you do not refuse Him who speaks, for if those did not escape who refused Him who warned them upon the earth, much more we shall not escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven...</S>
   <S PAR='377' RSNT='1' SNO='377'>Therefore receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly with piety and fear; for our God is also a consuming fire Heb 12:25, 28-29, see also vv.</S>
   <S PAR='378' RSNT='1' SNO='378'>1-24, 26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='379' RSNT='1' SNO='379'>The fifth warning, in 12:1-29, is given to warn us to run the race and not fall away from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='380' RSNT='1' SNO='380'>Faith is the unique way to run the race 11:1 , and in previous generations the saints who lived before God did so in faith vv.</S>
   <S PAR='381' RSNT='1' SNO='381'>4-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='382' RSNT='1' SNO='382'>We should be encouraged by all these witnesses of faith to look away to the Author and Perfecter of our faith, Jesus, and to run by faith the course that is set before us 12:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='383' RSNT='1' SNO='383'>This section warns us not to forsake the God who speaks to us and not to turn away from the Lord who warns us from heaven v. 25 . If we forsake Him, if we turn away from Him, it will be difficult for us to escape condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='384' RSNT='1' SNO='384'>He will have to punish us.</S>
   <S PAR='385' RSNT='1' SNO='385'>If we want to receive the unshakable kingdom He desires to give us, we must receive His sufficient grace and serve Him by this grace in piety and fear according to what is pleasing to Him v. 28 . We should fear losing His grace and not being able to enter the kingdom He desires to give us, and we should fear His condemnation and punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='386' RSNT='1' SNO='386'>This means that we should be in fear and trembling and should obey Him and do His will with piety and fear because our God is a consuming fire v. 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='387' RSNT='1' SNO='387'>All these warnings in Hebrews speak of the believers punishment in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='388' RSNT='1' SNO='388'>Thus, according to the Bible, there truly will be a future punishment for some believers.</S>
   <S PAR='389' RSNT='1' SNO='389'>There are enough portions in the Bible that clearly tell us that believers who are sinful, cowardly, fearful, unfaithful, unwilling to forsake everything to follow the Lord, unwilling to pay the price to live for the Lord, disobedient to the Lord s word, or fail in any number of ways will suffer great punishment and loss in the kingdom age when the Lord returns.</S>
   <S PAR='390' RSNT='1' SNO='390'>If believers confess their sins and deal with their failures today, God will forgive them because of the Lord s blood 1 John 1:7, 9 , but if believers do not confess their sins, forsake evil, or deal with their failures today, they will be punished in the kingdom age when the Lord returns.</S>
   <S PAR='391' RSNT='1' SNO='391'>At that time some believers will receive a reward, and some will suffer loss ; some will be rewarded, and some will be punished 1 Cor 3:14-15; Rev 22:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='392' RSNT='1' SNO='392'>Anyone who does not accept the truth of the believers being punished in the future will have difficulty avoiding being loose, lazy, or lustful in his living and actions.</S>
   <S PAR='393' RSNT='1' SNO='393'>We are fallen, and if we do not acknowledge these warnings, it will be easy to be loose and follow our own will, fulfilling the lusts of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='394' RSNT='1' SNO='394'>May we all have a heart of piety and fear, and by the Lord s grace, may we adjust our hearts to be upright in our actions lest we suffer the Lord s punishment in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='395' RSNT='1' SNO='395'>We should not oppose this truth simply because our own actions are bad.</S>
   <S PAR='396' RSNT='1' SNO='396'>This is pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='397' RSNT='1' SNO='397'>May God have mercy on us so that we would not deny His truth.</S>
