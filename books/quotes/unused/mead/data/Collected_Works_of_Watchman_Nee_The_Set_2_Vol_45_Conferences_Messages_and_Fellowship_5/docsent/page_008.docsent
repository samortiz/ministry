   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINE JACOB AND HIS TRIALS Date: 1940</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Unrecorded</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Jacob's life we see two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first section was the time of God's disciplining, and the second section was the time of God's constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 25 through 27 is a description of the first period of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Beginning from chapter twenty-eight, we see the second period of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this period God began to discipline him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During the third period of his life, his natural life was dealt with, and in the fourth period of his life, he brought forth the fruit of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are a few points worth considering about Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, his struggle with his brother while they were in their mother's womb reveals that he was not an upright person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, he wanted to be the firstborn, and he tried to come out of the womb ahead of Esau by holding his heel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Third, God had chosen Jacob before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy Rom 9:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Fourth, although Jacob cheated for the birthright, his motive was proper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Fifth, Jacob escaped because he was afraid that his brother would kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Under such circumstances he was tested, disciplined, and dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sixth, Jacob saw God in his dream.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Seventh, from his encounter with God in his dream during his escape to his uncle, Laban, we see that he feared God, but he did not remember God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All he could remember was food and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He asked God to take care of his physical needs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This shows his bargaining mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He should have realized that God's discipline had stripped him of his clothing and food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eighth, the reward of Jacob's work was Rachel, the one he loved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the reward of our service should be Christ, because Christ is our beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jacob worked for Laban twenty-two years, and Laban changed his wages ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet Jacob persisted, because he had not gained what he wanted yet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The meaning of the name Rachel is a lamb, but Jacob was by no means docile.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, God had to come in to discipline him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jacob suffered all his life for the gaining of Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>JACOB AT PENIEL</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's dealing with man's natural life is a lifelong process.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can see this from the way He dealt with Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jacob spent twenty years learning his lessons under the hand of Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God was gracious to Jacob when he ran away with Laban's belongings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God warned Laban in a dream not to speak good or bad to Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the crossing at Jabbok, God wrestled with Jacob, and God failed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today many believers are as strong as Jacob was in their natural strength, and God has no way to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God did not prevail over Jacob; He could not subdue him, but He touched the hollow of his thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From this time forward, Jacob was crippled.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The hollow of the thigh is the strongest part of a man; it is the very place that God touches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's touching of the hollow of Jacob's thigh meant that Jacob's natural strength was dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jacob's turning point was at Peniel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From there he went on to Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His destination was Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sometimes God can deal with a person's natural constitution without that person realizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Jacob was unaware of the fact that his thigh was touched by God; he still asked God to bless him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only when he began to walk did he realized that he had become crippled.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>JACOB AND ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Throughout his early life Jacob never once confessed that he was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is why God had to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God did not preach to him; He merely came and wrestled with him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When can we say that a man has been touched in the hollow of his thigh?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can know that a man has been touched when he is crippled, powerless, and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This does not mean that he has to have some special kind of joy or that he has to break down in some kind of weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is possible at times for some to have such emotional outbursts, but such outbursts are not crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After Jacob was dealt with by God at Peniel, his name was changed to "Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Jacob did his best to arrange the right time for his wives and children to meet his brother Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He did not realize that God had already touched the heart of Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All of Jacob's labor and plans were futile.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Shechem signifies God's power, while Bethel signifies God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A Christian's natural life must go through some fundamental dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The name Hebron means fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God had no intention for Jacob to remain in Shechem or Bethel, because it is only in fellowship that we receive the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The brightest portion in Jacob's history was in Genesis 47 to 49.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This echoes the word that the path of the just is as the shining light, that shines more and more unto the perfect day, that is, unto noon there is no afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Someone said that it was impossible to deal with Jacob, and that even if changed, he could never reach perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But this was not the way he turned out.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Jacob was a busy man from the day he was born.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At his birth, he held Esau's heel.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He was an active person, and he always came up with schemes to deceive others.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He was a cunning and supplanting person, true to the meaning of his name.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He tried to take advantage of others and have the upper hand in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At the same time he was very diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God brought him through many experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>His beloved Rachel died.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Later, Joseph, the one he cherished the most, also met with calamities.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the end God even took his darling Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>For thirteen years Jacob lived in sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Later, on top of all these sorrows, a famine came.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In his old age Jacob became more sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He no longer reviled others.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He became meek and feared God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He dared not make any decision by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>A person who worships God must be like Jacob, who "worshipped God" for God's leading in his whole life "while leaning on the top of his staff" Heb 11:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Although Jacob was a difficult person to deal with and although he was crafty, God dealt with him anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>After he was broken by the Lord, he became a useful vessel who could bless others.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He blessed all of his twelve sons, and the blessings were all eventually fulfilled.</S>
