   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION TWENTY-FIVE CONCERNING THE CHRISTIAN'S NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Adam was created by God not born of God; Christ was born of God not created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Are we Christians born of God or created by God?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some people claim that they believe in the entire Bible but not in the Christians' regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They say that regeneration is for the Jews and that Christians are created anew but not born again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the Bible says that Christians are born of God and also created anew by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Peter 1:3 says that God "regenerated us...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This reminds us that there is a begetting of the flesh and a begetting of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second Corinthians 5:17 says, "So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever regeneration is mentioned, we are reminded that we once had Adam's life; whenever the new creation is mentioned, it reminds us not to think of the old things but only of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are a new creation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While this refers to our position, it also includes our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Position and experience are different, but they cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Positionally speaking, the believers in Corinth were sanctified and justified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But experientially speaking, they still had jealousy and strife.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even though it is right to say this, if we separate position from experience, we may forget what Christ has accomplished and pay too much attention to our own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more we pay attention to our own experience, the less experience we have.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If our eyes behold Christ, we will be transformed into the image of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must not look at ourselves but at Christ; only then will we have real experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What does it mean to live in ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Living in ourselves is turning to ourselves and thinking about ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we turn inward and think about ourselves, we immediately live in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Being humble is to not think about ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not to think less about ourselves because when we think less about ourselves, we are still thinking about ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our union with Christ is not only a union in position but also a union in life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The same is true with our union in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whosoever looked upon the brass serpent experienced its effectiveness Num 21:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whosoever looks upon Christ only will experience victory.</S>
