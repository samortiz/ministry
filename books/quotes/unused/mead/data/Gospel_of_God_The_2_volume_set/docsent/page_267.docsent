   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD JESUS AS ADVOCATE FOR CHRISTIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The work of the Lord Jesus as Savior is for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The work of the Lord Jesus as Advocate is for Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the Savior, the Lord Jesus accomplished the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the Advocate, the Lord Jesus applies the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The sins of sinners are forgiven through the redemption of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The sins of Christians are forgiven through the advocacy that is based upon the redemption of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This advocacy presents the work of the cross to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It shows God what the Lord Jesus has done, so that God cannot punish man for his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have an Advocate before God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His death is presented to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus has become an Advocate for every Christian who sins, in the same way that He has become the Savior for every sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not that first we repent, believe, and are regenerated, and then the Lord Jesus dies for us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, it was while we were yet sinners that Christ became our Savior Rom 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the same way, it is not that we first repent, and then He becomes our Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, even while we are sinning, He becomes our Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not that He becomes our Advocate when we confess our sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, even while we are sinning, He becomes our Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why John says that if any man sins, we have an Advocate with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He does not say that first we repent, confess our sins, and pray for forgiveness, and then He becomes our Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, John says that if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father already.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever you sin, at that moment the Lord Jesus is already your Advocate before God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that very moment, the Lord Jesus will show God His work of the cross, and God will have to let your sins go.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A Christian can confess and repent because the Lord Jesus is his Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because we have the Lord Jesus as our Advocate, advocating and speaking for us while we sin, we eventually repent, confess our sins, and ask for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus' work of advocacy does not happen at the moment we repent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, it happens while we are sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we sin, the Lord Jesus is our Advocate already.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Afterwards, we are brought to repentance and confession.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus accomplished all the work in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything is included in that work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today the Lord can present this work to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God can no longer punish us, because all the debts have been paid.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the debts, past and future, are paid.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All our sins have been washed away by the blood of Jesus.</S>
