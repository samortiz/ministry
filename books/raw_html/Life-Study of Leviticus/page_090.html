<h2 class=head1>I. THE SIN OFFERING BEING SLAUGHTERED BEFORE JEHOVAH WHERE THE BURNT OFFERING IS SLAUGHTERED</h2><p>“Speak to Aaron and to his sons and say, This is the law of the sin offering: in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered the sin offering shall be slaughtered before Jehovah” (Lev. 6:25a). This signifies two things. First, it signifies that Christ as our sin offering was slain before God. Second, it signifies that Christ was offered to God as our sin offering based upon His being the burnt offering to God.<p>We may think that if we bring an offering to God, we may slaughter it anywhere. However, here God requires His people to slaughter the sin offering before Him in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered. The offering must be presented according to God’s regulations. From this we see that even though we today are enjoying Christ as grace, there are still regulations that we must follow in the enjoyment of Christ.<h2 class=head1>II. THE SIN OFFERING BEING MOST HOLY</h2><p>The sin offering is most holy (6:25b). This signifies that Christ as our sin offering offered to God was most holy in that He dealt with sin in our nature intrinsically and with the whole of our sinful nature. The sin offering deals not only with the sin in our conduct outwardly but also with the sin in our nature intrinsically. This offering deals with the whole of our sinful nature. Therefore, the sin offering is most holy.<h2 class=head1>III. THE PRIEST OFFERING THE OFFERING FOR SIN, EATING IT IN A HOLY PLACE, IN THE COURT OF THE TENT OF MEETING</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Signifying That He Who Serves Sinners with Christ as Their Sin Offering Shares the Enjoyment of Christ as the Sin Offering </h2><p>“The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. In a holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting” (6:26). This signifies that he who serves sinners with Christ as their sin offering shares the enjoyment of Christ as the sin offering. If we serve sinners with Christ, we are serving as priests. When we minister Christ to others in this way, both we and the ones we are serving will enjoy Christ as the sin offering.<h2 class=head2>B. Signifying That He Enjoys Christ as the Sin Offering in a Separated, Sanctified Realm, in the Sphere of the Church</h2><p>The priest’s eating the sin offering in a holy place, in the court of the tent of meeting, also signifies that he who ministers Christ as the sin offering to sinners enjoys Christ as this offering in a separated, sanctified realm, in the sphere of the church.<p>We may think that as long as we are serving others with Christ, we can do this anywhere. However, according to the spiritual rule, we must do this according to God’s regulation.<h2 class=head1>IV. WHOEVER TOUCHES THE FLESH OF THE SIN OFFERING BEING HOLY</h2><p>Whoever touched the flesh of the sin offering was holy (6:27a). This signifies that whoever touches Christ as the sin offering is separated and sanctified, forsaking sin and having his natural flesh dealt with, for Christ as the sin offering has dealt with sin and our sinful flesh on the cross.<p>We need to realize that when we bring Christ as the sin offering to a sinner, this Christ is holy. When a sinner touches this holy Christ, he becomes sanctified and is made holy. Immediately this sanctified one will forsake sin and have his natural flesh dealt with.<p>We need to have such a realization and faith concerning Christ as the sin offering. Then we should bring the gospel—that is, Christ Himself—to others and let them touch Him. The Christ whom we minister to others is the sin offering. On the cross He dealt with the intrinsic sin in our being and with our sinful flesh.
