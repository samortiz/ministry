   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When you put the seal upon a piece of paper, the sealing ink saturates and permeates the paper.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today the sealing within us is going on vertically and horizontally to transform and transfigure us.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit as the pledge of our inheritance is a foretaste of what we shall inherit of God, affording us a taste beforehand of the full inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord within us can be tasted, and His taste is sweet, pleasant, and good 1 Pet 2:3; Psa 34:8 , but this is just a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The full taste is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we are enjoying the foretaste, we realize this foretaste guarantees that God is coming to be our full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit as the pledge of God as His redeemed people's inheritance for their foretaste of Him, guarantees their full taste of Him, unto the redemption of His acquired possession, His redeemed inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is to the praise of God's glory, God's expression Eph 1:14 .</S>
