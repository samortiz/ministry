A few days ago we spoke of the need to check our life, walk, and service, and consider whether or not the spirit was present in these activities and whether we sensed any spiritual feeling in doing these things. Today I will say that in addition to paying attention to having the spirit, we have to pay attention to the quality of our spirit. Luke 9:51-56 speaks of the quality of the spirit. The Lord shows us the kind of spirit the two disciples had. We can draw a precious lesson from this.</p><p>In Luke 9:28-36 the Lord was transfigured on the Mount of Transfiguration. Moses and Elijah were conversing with Jesus about the things that were to come to pass after His departure, which He was about to complete in Jerusalem. God had foreordained that Christ would go to Jerusalem to accomplish the work of redemption. The Lord's pathway was set on the Mount of Transfiguration. Now He embarked on His way. This is the reason He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem. Between the Mount of Transfiguration and Jerusalem there were many stations. The Lord and His disciples had to pass through Samaria and through the city of Jericho. When He was about to enter a village of Samaria, He sent messengers to arrange for lodging. The Samaritans had never liked Jerusalem; they were always against the Jews. When they learned that Christ and His disciples were going to Jerusalem, they refused to receive them. They did not want Jesus' and His disciples' business. During my stay in London, I was returning from Southampton one night, and it was dark. I wanted to find a hotel for the night. I had to go to a few hotels before I found one that would take me, because I am Chinese. When I was in Chicago during the International Exhibition, I went to eight hotels. All of them told me they did not want my business. It may be a common thing to be refused because of being Chinese, but the Lord and His disciples were going to Jerusalem for the gospel and for the crucifixion. This was a great matter. Yet the Samaritans would not receive them. It was a tremendous thing for the Lord to go to Jerusalem. He was going there to accomplish redemption for all men. After His resurrection, the Lord told the disciples to spread the gospel from Jerusalem through Judea, Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth. Yet they were rejected in Samaria.</p><p>Our Lord was meek. When the Samaritans rejected Him, He turned away. The Lord could take this, but the disciples could not. James and John even had the Scriptures to back up their indignation. They respected the Scriptures very much, and they referred to a story in the Scriptures and wanted to resort to a scriptural method to deal with the matter. They thought they would act as Elijah did in 2 Kings 1:1-12, calling fire down from heaven to consume the Samaritans. They thought that here was a man much greater than Elijah. How dare the Samaritans refuse the Lord! James and John asked the Lord if they could perform a sign to show that He was the Christ appointed by God. They had a basis for their indignation; they were not acting blindly.</p><p>But the Lord turned around and rebuked the two disciples. He did not rebuke them because they were scriptural or zealous. He rebuked them for their wrong spirit. A man can love the Lord, walk according to the Bible, and be zealous; he can act according to the teaching and ways of the Old Testament prophets and still be wrong in his spirit. There was nothing wrong with James's and John's love and zeal for the Lord. But their spirit was wrong. The Lord had to rebuke them. They were zealous, and they loved the Lord, but their spirit was wrong.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_073.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_075.html">Next</a> </body></html>
