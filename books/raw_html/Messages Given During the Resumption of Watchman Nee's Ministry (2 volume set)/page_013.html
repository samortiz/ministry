<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE INDWELLING OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SPECIAL CONFERENCE (3)</H1><P>Date:December 29, 1947<br>Place:Hong Kong<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:20; John 15:5; Eph. 3:17; Phil. 2:12-13; Rom. 8:26-27</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHERE IS THE LORD JESUS TODAY?</H2><P>Where is the Lord Jesus today? This is a very interesting question. Some say that the Lord Jesus is at the right hand of the Father in heaven. Others say that He is in our hearts. Let us consider what the Bible says.</P><P>There are four Gospels in the New Testament. Where was the Lord Jesus in the book of Matthew? Where was He in the book of John? In Matthew 26, He was betrayed. In chapter twenty-seven, He was crucified, and in chapter twenty-eight, He resurrected. I remember that when I was in Nanking a brother answered me promptly that in Matthew, the Lord Jesus is in ascension, whereas in John, the Lord Jesus is in the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Being with Us</H2><P>The end of Matthew tells us that the Lord Jesus is "with you all the days until the consummation of the age" (Matt. 28:20). In the book of Matthew, we see two names, Jesus and Emmanuel. Emmanuel means God with man. No doubt God is God, yet He is now with man. It is true that He incarnated, grew up, worked, was betrayed, was crucified, and has resurrected. But today He is still with man. Today the Lord is here with us. He is with us by being within us. Suppose we have two hundred fifty people here today. Our physical eyes do not see the Lord. Today the Lord is not in our midst; He is not the two-hundred-fifty-first person. He is with us by being in us. He is not mingled among us, but He is within us. Outwardly speaking, men see us. But inwardly speaking, there is the Lord. In every age, wherever the Lord's disciples are, the Lord is there. Wherever there are believers, the Lord is there.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Being in Us</H2><P>Where has the Lord gone in the Gospel of John? He has come into us. John does not have chapter twenty-two. In chapter twenty, He was resurrected. Originally, He was God, coming in the flesh and living among men. Now through the Holy Spirit, He enters into man. Today, we do not merely have Jesus among us, but we have Jesus within us. Outwardly we are a man, but inwardly we have God. God was once in Jesus the Nazarene. Today He is in us. The Scriptures reveal to us that God in Christ has come into man. Oh, what a glorious fact! As a little man, I have God living within me. Today I have become a great man. Do you know who I am? I am "great." I am greater than the king of England. This is so much higher than the forgiveness of sins! I wish I could shout. Do you know who I am? The Jesus who is the King is now living in me. The One who is the eternal life has come to live in me. On the one hand, He is in me as life. On the other hand, He is ruling as the King. When I am sad, He comforts me. When I am confused, He enlightens me. When I am in darkness, He shines on me. When I rebel, He disciplines me. Today He is within me.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INDWELLING CHRIST</H2><P>Whether or not you are a proper Christian, and whether or not you carry some spiritual weight with you depends on the way you take care of the Lord. If you take care of Him properly, you will be a proper Christian. If you do not take care of Him properly, you will not be a proper Christian. To be a Christian is fully a matter of your relationship with the Christ who is within you. It is not a matter of how much work you do or how much love you have. It is a matter of having the proper relationship with the Lord.</P>
