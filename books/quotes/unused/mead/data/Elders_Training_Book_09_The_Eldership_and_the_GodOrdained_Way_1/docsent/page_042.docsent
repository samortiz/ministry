   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Negative things can arise among us because we do not see that the church is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If the church is organic, the church does not need to be controlled.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our physical body, strictly speaking, does not need any control.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our body needs to be nourished and cherished.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even an older brother like me needs to be cherished and comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why I asked at the beginning of this meeting if there was any fellowship and any comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not my word, but my quotation of Paul's word in Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The apostle appealed to the Philippians for their encouragement and consolation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He begged them to make his joy full if they had any encouragement in Christ, any consolation of love, any fellowship of spirit, any tenderheartedness and compassions toward him 2:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today I need your encouragement, your consolation, your tenderheartedness, your compassion, and your fellowship to make my joy full.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The day before yesterday many saints went to the airport to greet me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I thought that the brothers arranged this, but I was told that they all went to the airport to meet me spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past year, especially, I have been under the attack of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I came here to Cleveland and saw you all, I was consoled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am not a weeping person, but if I were, I surely would have wept when I saw you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Your warm welcome at the airport was an encouragement, a consolation, and a fellowship of spirit to me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was also your tenderheartedness and compassions toward me to make me joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All these things are included in being cherished.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you went to the airport to greet me, you cherished me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You "put me into your bosom."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All of us need the cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even the apostle Paul needed this kind of cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am glad to see so many leading ones gathered together for this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is an encouragement to me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord in His mercy and grace has put you into your present responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I hope that we all would learn not to control.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, we should learn to nourish and cherish the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Peter's first Epistle, he spoke to his fellow elders.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Peter was an elder in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He charged the elders to shepherd the flock of God 1 Pet 5:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word shepherd nearly equals the two words nourish and cherish.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A good shepherd always loves the flock, and the flock eventually loves this shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They know each other intimately.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To shepherd is not to control.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In John 21 the Lord asked Peter, "Do you love Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then He indicated that if Peter loved Him, he would feed His sheep and shepherd His sheep vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus spoke this to show how we should take care of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should be those who are one with Him to feed, shepherd, nourish, and cherish the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the organic way to care for the church.</S>
