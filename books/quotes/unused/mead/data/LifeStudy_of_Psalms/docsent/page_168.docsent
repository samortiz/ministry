   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Queen Standing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>at the King's Right Hand in the Gold of Ophir</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 9b says, "The queen stands at your right hand in the gold of Ophir."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The queen signifies the church, and her being covered with gold signifies the church's appearing in the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This gold that covers her is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 we are told that God has made Christ to be righteousness to us for our justification, for us to be justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As our righteousness, Christ is our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This covering is altogether divine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is pure gold, "the gold of Ophir."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the first layer of our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>C. The Daughter Hearing and Seeing</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>and Forgetting Her People</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>and Her Father's House,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>and the King Desiring Her Beauty</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 10 goes on to say, "Hear, O daughter, and see; and incline your ear;/And forget your people and your father's house."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The daughter is the queen, who signifies the church, and her father's house signifies the natural relationships of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This word about the daughter's forgetting her people and her father's house corresponds to the Lord's word about denying the natural relationships Matt 10:37; Luke 14:26 and caring for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Throughout the centuries, many believers have been persecuted by their family.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Psalm 45:11a continues, "Thus the king will desire your beauty."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The queen's beauty here signifies the virtues of Christ expressed through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The beauty of the church, her beauty in the presence of Christ, is Christ's virtues lived out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>D. Worshipping the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Because he is your lord,/Worship him" v. 11b . This signifies that as the Lord of the church Christ is worthy not only of her love but also of her worship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>E. The Daughter of Tyre Coming with a Gift,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>and the Rich among the People</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Entreating Her Favor</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"The daughter of Tyre will come with a gift;/The rich among the people will entreat your favor" v. 12 . Tyre, a seaport, was a flourishing, commercial center known for its riches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here the daughter of Tyre signifies the people of the flourishing world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The rich among the people signify the high class.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The rich have great wealth, but they do not have what this verse calls "favor."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The favor they entreat of the queen signifies the grace of God enjoyed by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The grace of God which we have in the church is the real favor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As indicated by this verse, the rich will come to the church to obtain the grace of God.</S>
