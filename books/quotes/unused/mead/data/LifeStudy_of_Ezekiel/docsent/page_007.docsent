   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The next point to consider is the person Ezekiel who saw the visions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Among the Captives</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 1 Ezekiel tells us that he was among the captives by the river of Chebar.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a captive in the land of captivity, Ezekiel was tested and surely must have felt perplexed, distressed, and depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This also may be our experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes when we come together with the brothers and sisters, we sense that we are in the land of captivity and we feel distressed and depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A Priest</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 3 speaks explicitly of Ezekiel the priest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a priest Ezekiel was one who lived in the presence of God, serving God and being mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ezekiel was this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although he was in the land of captivity, he still lived in the presence of God and ministered before God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was by the river Chebar, not in the holy temple, yet as a priest he looked to God, prayed to God, contacted God, fellowshipped with God, and waited for God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because Ezekiel was such a person and contacted God in such a way, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw visions of God v. 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We encourage all the brothers and sisters in the Lord to serve Him as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all need to learn to pray to God, to contact God, to have fellowship with God, and to live before God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we exercise as priests in this way, the heavens will be opened to us, and we will see God s visions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Son of Buzi, yet Strengthened by God</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ezekiel was the son of Buzi.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Buzi means contempt or despised.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ezekiel was a prophet who was very much despised by the people and who was treated with contempt.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In his ministry he received no glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you are an Ezekiel in the Lord s recovery today, you should expect to be a despised person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not think that you will have any glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Others will despise you and treat you with contempt.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Ezekiel means God will strengthen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It also means the almighty One is your strength.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The name Ezekiel ends with the suffix el, which means the mighty One.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, he was the son of Buzi, despised by others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the other hand, he was Ezekiel, strengthened by God, the mighty One.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 3:8-9a the Lord said to Ezekiel, Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was despised and treated with contempt, but he was strengthened by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For Ezekiel to be the son of Buzi meant that he was a son of shame, a son of abasement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We might think that as a prophet his prophetic ministry would have been glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, when we read the book of Ezekiel, we see that in fulfilling his ministry as a prophet, he was constantly disgraced and put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God appointed Ezekiel to be a sign to the people of Israel, a sign of their being put to shame 12:6, 11; 24:24, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God required him to perform certain demonstrations, and in these demonstrations he became a prophet in disgrace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For instance, God told him to lie on his left side three hundred ninety days and on his right side forty days 4:4-6 and to eat bread prepared with cow s dung vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>9-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God also told him to dig through the wall of the city and carry out his stuff through the wall, and Ezekiel did as he was commanded 12:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, one day his wife suddenly died 24:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Ezekiel surely was a son of disgrace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who minister the Lord s word today will also be sons of disgrace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When God s people are in captivity, those who rise up to be God s ministers, serving as His priests and seeing His visions, will have to bear the shame of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because God s captive people are in disgrace, God s ministers will also be in disgrace as they minister God s words.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although Ezekiel was a son of disgrace who suffered shame and disgrace, the almighty God was his strength.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because he was empowered by God, Ezekiel could be strong in the midst of disgrace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a man strengthened and empowered by God, he could bear all the shame and the disgrace in order to fulfill his ministry as a prophet of God, God s oracle.</S>
