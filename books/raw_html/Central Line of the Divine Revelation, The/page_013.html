<P>He lived on earth in this humanity for thirty years, and He worked and ministered for another three and a half years. Who was He? Most of the Jews never knew. The Jews always considered Him merely as a Nazarene. They did not know that He was the very God, the Creator, Jehovah, Elohim, whom they worshipped. But they worshipped a divine God, without humanity. Today we Christians worship God as the One who is both divine and human. Jesus is the One who is the complete God and the perfect man. Our God is different from the Jewish God. The Jewish God is just Elohim, not Jesus Christ. But our God is Jesus Christ, who is the very Elohim and the very Jehovah, with both divinity and humanity.</P><P>This wonderful One passed through human living and went to the cross. By His death He terminated the old creation. After three days, He walked out of death and out of Hades to enter into resurrection. By entering into resurrection, He brought the terminated humanity into divinity. His incarnation and resurrection were a two-way traffic, coming and going. He came with divinity in incarnation to bring divinity into humanity. Then He went back with humanity in resurrection to bring humanity into divinity. He blended the divine with the human and the human with the divine. This blending is also a mingling.</P><P>In eternity past God had neither entered into humanity nor experienced death. But after picking up humanity and living in humanity for thirty-three and a half years, He walked into death. We should not think that He was put to death by man's decision. If He had not been willing to go into death, no one could have put Him to death. When the soldiers from the chief priests and Pharisees came to arrest Him at Gethsemane, He said, "Do you think that I cannot beseech My Father, and He will provide Me at once with more than twelve legions of angels? How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled which say that it must happen this way?" (Matt. 26:53-54). He walked into death and entered into death voluntarily.</P><P>After three days, He walked out of death into resurrection. By entering into resurrection, He brought humanity into divinity. The Bible tells us that resurrection was a birth to Him (Acts 13:33). In divinity He was God's only begotten Son (John 3:16), but in resurrection He brought His humanity into divinity to be born as the firstborn Son among many sons, many brothers (Rom. 8:29).</P><P>In resurrection as the last Adam, Jesus became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). As God He became a man in incarnation (John 1:14). As such a One, He also became the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is the totality of the Triune God, the consummation of the Triune God. As the life-giving Spirit, He is the Son, and embodied in the Son is the Father. Thus, the Father and the Son are here with this life-giving Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God and the totality of the Triune God.</P><P>We may say that the life-giving Spirit is the consummated God, the compound Spirit. The Spirit of God was compounded with man, with Christ's death, and with Christ's resurrection. In eternity past God was merely in divinity. He had not entered into humanity, and there was no all-inclusive death or powerful resurrection in Him. But after going through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the merely divine One was compounded with humanity, with the all-inclusive death, and with the powerful resurrection. Now today our God is a God-man with the element of the all-inclusive death and with the element of the powerful resurrection. He is the life-giving Spirit. He is the Spirit today. This is why I call our God today the processed God, the consummated God. He is the consummated One as the life-giving Spirit to be the totality of the Triune God, the consummation of the Triune God. When I have Him, I have the Trinity&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. When I have Him, I have everything. I not only have the divine and human Triune God but also the wonderful death of Christ and the powerful resurrection of Christ.</P>
