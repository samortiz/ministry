   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE CHRIST BEING EVERYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO THE CHURCH AS THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Col 1:18; 3:4; 1 Cor 12:13; Col 3:9-11; Eph 4:12b-13 THE WONDERFUL BEING OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR THE PRODUCING OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we will consider the last point: Christ is everything to the church as the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the mystery of mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The wonderful being of Christ is for the producing of His Body, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is God who became a man and was crucified on the cross to die and shed His blood for us to be our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then He was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When He enters into us, we are regenerated with the life of God to become the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, every child of God has become a member of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These members added together are the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Body of Christ is not an organization but an organism, a new man, because it has the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is just like the human body, which is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The human body has many members.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the members are parts of the body, an organism, and they all have the same life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since this life flows through all the members of the body, every member is a part of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a whole, the body is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we were not regenerated and did not have the life of God, we could never become the members of the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How can we be regenerated and have the life of God?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is through God s becoming flesh, dying on the cross to shed His blood for the redemption of our sins, and entering into resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit to enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way we can be regenerated to have the life of God and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This life-giving Spirit is Christ, and this Christ is both our Redeemer and our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We, who are many, have Christ as life within and thus become the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Corinthians 12:12 says, For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This tells us that today Christ is not only the Head of the Body but also the Body itself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ as the Head is the individual Christ; Christ as the Body is the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE PRODUCING OF THE CHURCH,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ, who was God in eternity, in time came to the earth to become a man, the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He lived the human life on earth and tasted its different experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then He was crucified on the cross and died by shedding His blood for us to accomplish the work of redemption and become our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, He resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit to be received by those who had been chosen and predestinated by God in Christ before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When one believes in the Lord in his heart and calls upon the Lord s name with his mouth, thereby receiving the Lord as his Savior, the Lord as the life-giving Spirit enters into him to be his life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then this one is regenerated to be a child of God and a member of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the members added together, all those who have Christ as their life, become one Body, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the main subject of the New Testament.</S>
