   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These topics are interrelated, so we must consider them together.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Judgment is a matter of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible shows that God executes His judgment according to His righteousness, by His holiness, and for His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His judgment is the execution of His government in the universe.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this chapter we will focus on God s judgment of man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When some look at this matter in a general way, they think that God s judgment concerns only the matter of whether a man will go to heaven or hell.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But if we carefully examine what God reveals in the Bible, we will see that this is not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Bible speaks of God s judgment on man that is very particular and that has many distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There are at least six kinds of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, we must spend some time to study God s judgments carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This also will help us to understand the Bible and its prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We will look at the six judgments of God on man according to six different aspects: 1 the time of judgment, 2 the place of judgment, 3 the one who is judging, 4 the ones being judged, 5 the basis for judgment, and 6 the result of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we clearly see these six aspects with respect to each type of judgment, we will fully understand each of the judgments of God on man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The chart on the following page will be helpful.</S>
