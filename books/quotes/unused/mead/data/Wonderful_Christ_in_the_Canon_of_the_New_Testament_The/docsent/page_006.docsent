   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LOVABLE JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hallelujah for such a wonderful person!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Don t you love Him?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since I was a little boy, I learned to sing that little hymn, Jesus Loves Me, This I Know, For the Bible Tells Me So.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time I was taught to love Him because He died for me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That is good, but we must not merely love Him because He died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Oh, we love Him because He is so lovable!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If He would throw me into hell, I would still love Him, because He is altogether lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I care more for what He is!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I just love this person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we love Jesus merely because He has done so many things for us, our love is imperfect.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have heard many stories of wives loving their husbands because they had money.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But once their husbands lost their money, the love was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why do we love Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not only because of what He has done, but more because of what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is far, far beyond our description.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A WONDERFUL PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I hope that you will pray-read all the above verses that you may see all the things He is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the seed of the woman that bruised the head of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is the seed of Abraham that all the nations may obtain the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And He is the branch, branching out God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This branch, then, even mingles with us to produce the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is in us, and we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He and we become one people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Where I am, there He is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I simply cannot get away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is such a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then when we all come together, He is there; and we become the church with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is really wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually it is difficult to say who we are.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are parts of this wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And this wonderful person is not only within us, but growing in us, branching in us, bearing fruit in us, and causing us all to be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Isn t this wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And He is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not a matter of behavior, because it is not our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He Himself as such a subjective One in us becomes our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Martin Luther fought for the doctrine of justification by faith, but today we do not need to fight for the doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jesus is the reality of all the doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we have Him, we have everything, including righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE CORPORATE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, if you would ask me who I am, I would at least say that I am part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Philippians 1:21, Paul said, For to me to live is Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And he said in Galatians 2:20, I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Any seed is not only for that seed itself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is for multiplication and reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now Jesus is no longer just a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are now His reproduction and multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>So we are the corporate Christ.</S>
