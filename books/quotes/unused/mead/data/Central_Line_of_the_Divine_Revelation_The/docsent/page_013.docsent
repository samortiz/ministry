   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Who was He?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most of the Jews never knew.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Jews always considered Him merely as a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They did not know that He was the very God, the Creator, Jehovah, Elohim, whom they worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But they worshipped a divine God, without humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today we Christians worship God as the One who is both divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jesus is the One who is the complete God and the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our God is different from the Jewish God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Jewish God is just Elohim, not Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But our God is Jesus Christ, who is the very Elohim and the very Jehovah, with both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This wonderful One passed through human living and went to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By His death He terminated the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After three days, He walked out of death and out of Hades to enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By entering into resurrection, He brought the terminated humanity into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His incarnation and resurrection were a two-way traffic, coming and going.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He came with divinity in incarnation to bring divinity into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then He went back with humanity in resurrection to bring humanity into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He blended the divine with the human and the human with the divine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This blending is also a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In eternity past God had neither entered into humanity nor experienced death.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not think that He was put to death by man's decision.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If He had not been willing to go into death, no one could have put Him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the soldiers from the chief priests and Pharisees came to arrest Him at Gethsemane, He said, "Do you think that I cannot beseech My Father, and He will provide Me at once with more than twelve legions of angels?</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He walked into death and entered into death voluntarily.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By entering into resurrection, He brought humanity into divinity.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In divinity He was God's only begotten Son John 3:16 , but in resurrection He brought His humanity into divinity to be born as the firstborn Son among many sons, many brothers Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In resurrection as the last Adam, Jesus became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As God He became a man in incarnation John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As such a One, He also became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This life-giving Spirit is the totality of the Triune God, the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the life-giving Spirit, He is the Son, and embodied in the Son is the Father.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In eternity past God was merely in divinity.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But after going through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the merely divine One was compounded with humanity, with the all-inclusive death, and with the powerful resurrection.</S>
