<h2 class="head1">RULING OVER THE THREE MAJOR ENEMIES</h2><p>As kings reigning in life, we must subdue the enemies and rule over them. Do not regard your wife or husband as an enemy over whom you must rule. According to both the Gospel of John and the book of Romans, our major enemies are sin, death, and Satan. Not even your temper is one of the primary enemies. If sin, death, and Satan are defeated, your temper will also be defeated and even become something of comeliness. Sin is what makes your temper so distasteful. In the same principle, the reason the self is so ugly is that sin, death, and Satan make their abode within us. If these things were subdued, even our self would be beautiful. Therefore, we have just three major enemies&mdash;sin, death, and Satan.</p><p>Paul deals with these enemies in the book of Romans. In 8:2, which speaks of the law of sin and death, we see two of the enemies, sin and death. Then in 16:20 Paul refers to Satan: &ldquo;Now the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.&rdquo; Do not expect to be a king over your wife or husband. Husbands, the Lord has appointed you to be the head with respect to your wife, but not to be a king ruling over her. Parents should not be kings over their children. But we are to reign as kings over sin, death, and Satan. With respect to the members of our family and to the brothers and sisters in the church, we are servants. But with respect to sin, death, and Satan, we are kings.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD DISPENSED INTO US<br />TO BE OUR PORTION</h2><p>If we would know what it means for grace to reign unto eternal life, we must have a proper understanding of grace. Grace is God Himself given to us in Christ and dispensed into our spirit to be our portion. If we have a thorough understanding of the Bible, we shall realize that God has no intention to give us anything other than Himself. All things other than God are vanity. Solomon, the wise king, said, &ldquo;Vanity of vanities; all is vanity&rdquo; (Eccl. 1:2). In the words of the Apostle Paul, all things apart from Christ are dung (Phil. 3:8). Our unique portion is God Himself, and grace is God as our portion for our participation, experience, and enjoyment.</p><p>If we consider John 1:1 and 1:14 in context, we shall see that grace is God coming to us to be dispensed into us for our enjoyment. John 1:16 says, &ldquo;For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.&rdquo; In Romans 5:17 Paul speaks of receiving not only grace, but the abundance of grace. Because grace is living and growing, it abounds. This abounding grace also reigns. Grace is not a lifeless element; it is a living Person, even God Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO KINGS</h2><p>In Romans 5 both sin and grace are personified. As verse 21 indicates, either sin or grace may reign, grace positively or sin negatively. Sin is the embodiment of the evil nature of Satan in our flesh, and grace is God in Christ embodied in our spirit. Therefore, we have two kings&mdash;sin and grace&mdash;within us. In our flesh we have the king of sin, and in our spirit we have the king of grace. Within us a warfare is raging between these two kings.</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING ABUNDANCE OF GRACE</h2><p>You may be eager to know how you can have the abundance of grace. The only way to have it is to receive it. In receiving we neither labor nor pay a price. We simply receive. Both John and Romans speak of receiving grace. We have seen that John 1:16 says that of His fullness we have received grace upon grace. In Romans 5:17 Paul speaks of our receiving the abundance of grace. We need to come to the very God who is grace and receive grace again and again until we are filled with grace. Only when we are filled with grace can we experience the reigning of grace. When grace is allowed to fill us, it abounds in us and then reigns in us. The reigning grace always follows the abounding grace.</p><p>If we are short of grace, grace cannot reign within us. Only when grace fills us up to the brim and then overflows from us can we experience the reigning of grace. When grace reigns, sin, death, and Satan are subdued and are under our feet, and we become kings in grace. As grace reigns in us, we reign in life.</p><p>Do not consider that the experience of reigning in life by grace is an impossibility. I can testify that it is surely possible for us to reign in life. Whenever we are filled with grace, grace overflows and reigns. Then by grace we reign in life over sin, death, and Satan. We are not only set free from the three major enemies, but we reign over them. The principle of reigning in life is revealed in chapter five, but the experience of reigning in life is in chapter eight. Reigning in life is greater and higher than being saved in the life of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">OPENING TO BE FILLED</h2><p>In this matter doctrine, teaching, and exhortation are of no avail. In a sense, not even our prayer is effectual in enabling us to reign in life by grace. The only thing that works is to come to the divine source and open ourselves from the depths of our being to be filled with God as grace. In order to be filled, we must ask the Lord to remove all insulation and frustration. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am willing for every hindrance to be removed. I want to keep myself directly open to You. Lord, fill me completely with Yourself as grace.&rdquo; Wherever you are, at work, at school, or in your car, stay open to the Lord to be filled with Him as grace. This is what it means to receive the abundance of grace. As you receive grace in this way, you will be filled with grace and eventually grace will overflow from within you. Then you will reign in life by grace over sin, death, and Satan. In your experience these three enemies will be utterly subdued.</p><p>Sin, death, and Satan are still working within us. But if we come to the heavenly source and open ourselves thoroughly to be filled with grace, we shall reign over them in life. This is our need today in the church life. Although I appreciate very much all that is in the Gospel of John, we must go on from John to Romans 5:17 and 21 to receive abundance of grace so that grace may reign within us and we may reign in life.</p>
