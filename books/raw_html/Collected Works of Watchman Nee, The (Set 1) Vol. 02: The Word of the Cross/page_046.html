<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A PREFACE TO<br>MODERN SCIENCE AND<br>THE LONG DAY IN JOSHUA</H1><P>In this age of modern science, it seems that everything must be questioned before it can be believed. Of course, this is very meaningless because the condition for obtaining truth is not skepticism, but impartiality and the lack of prejudice. Skepticism is a form of prejudice. Hence, skepticism does not lead men to the way of truth.</P><P>Today, modernistic Christians think that one should not accept the biblical record blindly, but should first question it. This theory falls into the same trap. Before a person becomes a Christian, he has, of course, the right to choose. But after he has believed in Christ, his position is such that it no longer allows him to doubt the Bible which Christ has uplifted.</P><P>Dr. Rimmer is a modern-day renowned American scientist. His position as the president of Research Science Bureau speaks for his knowledge in science. He is also a Christian. To him the so-called "outmoded" Christian beliefs are not contradictory to science. He often lectures in universities and has opened the eyes of countless young people. He has shed much new light on the problems of the Bible. This message on the long day of Joshua is one of his lectures.</P><P>Realizing that this message will render help to those who are uncertain and who have been shaken by the words of the modernists, I have asked Mr. Chow to translate it into Chinese. Our belief does not need scientific proof. But this may serve to remind those who believe blindly in their own version of science.</P>
