<P>Verse 17: On one hand, the word spoken through Isaiah, that "He Himself took away our infirmities and bore our diseases," was fulfilled at that time when the Lord healed the sick. On the other hand, the actual fulfillment of Isaiah's word was at the time when the Lord was on the cross. There are two groups of people with two extreme views: (1) The scope of the Lord's bearing of our diseases is as wide as the scope of His bearing of our sins. (2) The Lord bears only sins but not diseases. There are errors in both of these views. The Lord today does bear our diseases, but it is different from the bearing of our sins in scope, in degree, and in significance. ("Infirmities" in this verse and "weakness" in 2 Corinthians 12:9 are the same in Greek.) For instance, we may have the same faith concerning the forgiveness of sins and the healing of diseases, yet the results today may be different. When we believe in the forgiveness of sins, our sins are forgiven. However, when we believe in the healing of our diseases, our diseases may not all be healed. The Lord's work of bearing our diseases will not be accomplished until His coming back. The actual fulfillment of verse 17 is on the cross.</P><P>Spurgeon said that every time the Lord heals a sickness, He causes His power to flow to the sick one, and He Himself bears the weakness. In the above four small sections we see the Lord's power and man's intention.</P><P>The section from 8:18 through 9:8 is the second minor section of the third major section.</P><P>Verse 18: "Now when Jesus saw a crowd around Him, He gave orders to depart to the other side." When there were too many people, the Lord always departed. This is the Lord's way. He did not want the curious ones to draw near to Him. On "the other side" there was no one. The Lord was not reluctant to let go of people. Paying attention to people, gaining people for ourselves, and paying attention to having a crowd are great problems to our work. "Depart to the other side." This is the best principle for our work. When we work, we should not try to gain people for ourselves. This is the Lord's work. Once the work is done, we should leave immediately. If we remain, it will be nothing but "strange fire," and perhaps there will be more of man's attraction than of God's command.</P><P>Verses 19-20: The scribe here represents one who is zealous. He came of his own free will and seemingly without condition to follow the Lord. But the Lord told him that He did not have the comfort that the birds and the foxes had. This means that what the Lord had as an enjoyment was inferior to what the birds and the foxes had. Then the scribe withdrew after learning of the hardship involved. Therefore, one can never follow the Lord if he has not counted the cost. The scribe indeed represents those who care only for the building up of themselves. The scribe was not willing to sacrifice himself.</P><P>Verse 21: "And another of the disciples said to Him, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father." "Disciples" are those who have already been called. "Bury my father" is the duty of a son. However, this one had been called yet shrank back.</P><P>Verse 22: "But Jesus said to him, Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead." The first "dead" refers to the dead mentioned in Ephesians 2:1. Here, the Lord has a demand that is more important than burying one's father. Burying one's father can be done by someone else. This demonstrates the principle that the Lord's calling is above everything else. The Lord would not allow anything besides Himself to have control over us or put a demand on us. "Permit me first...." This is a great mistake. The Lord's calling should certainly be above all things.</P><P>The difference between these two is that one does not count the cost, whereas the other overly counts the cost. In the matter of following the Lord, it would be foolish and improper not to count the cost at all. However, it would also be improper to always count the cost and dare not move forward. We should avoid these two extreme mistakes. If the Lord wants us to go, we should count the cost and tell the Lord, "I am willing"; we should let go of everything else. The pathway of obedience takes obedience, not the waiting for problems to be solved, as the end. "Follow Me" is the solution to the problem of "burying the father." If someone has been called by the Lord, although he may consider withdrawing, the Lord will still say to him, "Follow Me."</P><P>Verses 19 through 22 are an inserted section. A similar case is recorded in Luke, but that is probably a different event.</P><P>Verses 24-27: Their prayer was "save us," and the reason was "we are perishing." Because they realized that they would perish, they said, "Lord, save us." Because of their little faith, they said, "Lord, save us." Because of their cowardice, they said, "We are perishing!" Little faith is somewhat better, and somewhat more advanced, than no faith at all.</P><P>In the midst of His busyness, the Lord was still teaching His disciples. It was easier to deal with the winds and the waves than it was to deal with the disciples. All fear and cowardice are due to unbelief. Faith comes from the word of God. The Lord rebuked the disciples for having little faith because He already had said to "depart to the other side." (This is a command as well as a promise.) Yet they still said, "We are perishing!" This shows that they did not believe the Lord when He told them to "depart to the other side." It seems that they thought that the Lord had told them to depart to the bottom of the sea. The Lord's word is linked to faith. From this we see that many prayers are a sign of little faith. It does not mean the more prayer, the better.</P><P>The word "arose" is used twice in this section: "There arose a great tempest in the sea" and "Then He arose...and there was a great calm." Furthermore, "great" is in contrast to "little"â€”"great calm," "little faith."</P>
