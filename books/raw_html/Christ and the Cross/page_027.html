        <h2 class="head1">GOD IN ETERNITY BEING WITH REDEEMED MAN AND<br />
BEING MINGLED WITH REDEEMED MAN</h2>
<p>In eternity God will be with redeemed man, and He will be mingled with redeemed man. The New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle of God with men, that is, the place where God meets with man (v. 3). This is the highest meaning of Emmanuel (Matt. 1:23). It is the complete fulfillment of the type of the tabernacle in the Old Testament. It is the ultimate consummation of the Word becoming flesh and tabernacling among men (John 1:14), and it is the culmination of the expression of God&rsquo;s presence with His people. In the New Jerusalem we will fully experience the reality of God being with man, and we will enjoy the blessing of God&rsquo;s presence. Today such experiences are mysterious and hidden, but in eternity future they will be concrete, evident, and visible.</p>
<p>God is with man in the New Jerusalem because it is the crystallization of the mingling of God with man. God&rsquo;s desire to be with man is not an objective desire; God does not want to be outside of man, merely coexisting with man. His desire is more subjective; He wants to be inside of man and mingled with man as one. This has been God&rsquo;s desire from the beginning. In eternity future the mingling of God with man will be fully manifested in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The number twelve is frequently found in the description of the New Jerusalem. There are twelve foundations adorned with twelve precious stones and inscribed with the names of the twelve apostles. There are also twelve gates made of twelve pearls and inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel (Rev. 21:14, 19-21, 12). The height of the wall is a hundred and forty-four cubits (v. 17), which is twelve times twelve cubits. The length, breadth, and height of the city are equal, each being twelve thousand stadia (v. 16), one thousand times twelve stadia. The tree of life in the midst of the city produces twelve fruits in twelve months (22:2). Except for the one throne, one street, one river, and one tree, signifying the unique God, everything else in the New Jerusalem is related to the number twelve. Twelve is three multiplied by four. Three signifies the Triune God, and four denotes the created beings. The four living creatures represent all creatures. Therefore, the number twelve signifies that the New Jerusalem is the crystallized product of God being multiplied, mingled, with man.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the book of Revelation the number seven is associated with the church (1:11, 20). According to the concluding words of the Lord in the seven epistles to the seven churches, seven is composed of three plus four (see footnote on Revelation 2:29, Recovery Version). This means that God plus man equals the church. Seven, however, is three plus four, not three times four. It is God and man being added together, not God and man being mingled together. The mingling of God with man begins when God is added to man, but it will be completed at the coming of the new heaven and new earth. Then the mingling of God and man will be fully expressed through the New Jerusalem. God will be in man, and man will be in God; God will be man&rsquo;s element, and man will be God&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD AND CHRIST BEING THE CENTER IN ETERNITY</h2>
<p>In eternity the outermost realm is composed of the new heaven, the new earth, and all things. The next realm is composed of the nations on the earth (21:1, 24). The innermost realm is the New Jerusalem. The throne of God and of the Lamb is the center of the New Jerusalem (22:1), where God and the Lamb rule in eternity. Hence, God and Christ are the center in eternity. According to the literal description of the city, God and the Lamb are the throne that is at the center of the New Jerusalem and rules the new universe. The Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are the temple in the city (21:22), indicating that they are the center of worship and service. God is the light, and Christ is the lamp shining forth from the center of the city and penetrating through its wall to illumine the nations on earth (v. 23). The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory to the city (v. 24). In the New Jerusalem God and Christ will be the glorious center of the universe. In eternity God and Christ will be the center of government, worship, illumination, and glory.</p>
<p>According to the city&rsquo;s symbolic significance, in eternity God and Christ will be in the redeemed ones as the center of everything. In the redeemed ones the throne of God and Christ will serve as the center of administration. God and Christ will dwell in the redeemed to be the center of their worship. God will be the light in His people, and Christ will be the lamp that diffuses this light. Thus, God in Christ will be the center of the believers&rsquo; illumination. God will be the light in His people, and Christ will be the lamp. God in Christ will shine in the redeemed and shine forth from them to illumine the nations so that the nations may walk in the light, the shining forth of God in Christ through His people. Hence, in eternity the new heaven and new earth will be the sphere in which Christ is embodied in a group of redeemed people. God will be expressed through Christ. Christ will shine forth through His redeemed to the nations, and the nations will live in the light of this glory.</p>
<p>In eternity future God is the light, Christ is the lamp, and the New Jerusalem shines forth the light in the lamp so that the nations may walk in its light. God is in Christ to be expressed through Christ so that Christ may be glorified, just as electricity in an electric lamp is expressed through the lamp. In the New Jerusalem God is the light, but its lamp is Christ. God is in Christ in order to be expressed through Christ. The light in the New Jerusalem is God as light shining through Christ. The New Jerusalem shines forth the light that is in Christ. Hence, Christ is the content and expression of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Although God is the center of the New Jerusalem, He is in Christ. Christ is the expression of God. Christ is the content of the New Jerusalem at its center and the expression of the New Jerusalem in its circumference. God is in Christ, and Christ is the content and expression of the New Jerusalem. Therefore, in the New Jerusalem Christ is God as well as the city. Christ contains God as the content and expression of the city to be manifested in the universe. Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:11).</p>
<p>God is in Christ, Christ is in His redeemed people, and the redeemed people shine forth Christ to the nations and express the glory of Christ to creation. This is the condition and scene in eternity. Today we are the firstfruits of such a condition (James 1:18). God is in Christ, Christ is in us, and we live out Christ for His expression and glorification. This is God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, and this should be our living today.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
