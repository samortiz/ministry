<div class='line'><b>1</b> I saw great throngs - each was a brother dear,</div>
<div class='line'>Linked with each other in one Body here;</div>
<div class='line'>Each in close union with the living Head,</div>
<div class='line'>The witness-folk, by Jesus' Spirit led.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> At every time, in every clime I found</div>
<div class='line'>Those, not with words of Christ, but Spirit bound.</div>
<div class='line'>He strengthens them with might each day, each hour;</div>
<div class='line'>Through them true works divine are wrought in power.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> This is the Church the Spirit hath begot,</div>
<div class='line'>Elect from every people, Christ their lot.</div>
<div class='line'>They follow where His shepherd-staff doth lead;</div>
<div class='line'>The members of this host are blessed indeed.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> And when on earth they meet His death to show,</div>
<div class='line'>To Him their vows of love they oft renew.</div>
<div class='line'>Some little flock will gather there or here;</div>
<div class='line'>Christ, Head of all, to every soul most near.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> This is the temple which our Lord approves,</div>
<div class='line'>The Church which truly honors Him and loves,</div>
<div class='line'>Whose sacrifice is on the altar bound;</div>
<div class='line'>She soon in glory will His throne surround.</div>
