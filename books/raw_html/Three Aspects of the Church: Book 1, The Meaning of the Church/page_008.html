	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church is the economy of God. It is eternal, out of God Himself, according to the good pleasure of God&rsquo;s will, and in Christ; moreover, it causes us to obtain the sonship, become holy, and be to Himself (Eph. 1:4-5). The last three items include: obtaining the sonship, becoming holy, and being to Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">For Our Obtaining the Sonship, Becoming Holy,<br />
and Being to Himself</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Obtaining the Sonship</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:4-5 contains three crucial phrases: <em>unto sonship, to be holy,</em> and <em>to Himself.</em> In the phrase <em>unto sonship,</em> we tend to focus on the <em>&#150;ship;</em> however, in Greek the emphasis is first on being sons and then on the suffix <em>&#150;ship.</em></p>
<p>According to the meaning of the Greek, God in His plan ordained that we would be His sons; then, having ordained us to be His sons, He ordained us to inherit all that He is. Being His sons is an inward matter related to life in which the life of God enters into us. Inheriting all that He is, is an outward matter related to inheritance in which we enter into all that He is. On the one hand, God wants His life to enter into us, and on the other hand, He wants us to enter into all that He is. When a person inherits everything from his father, it means that he enters into everything that his father has outwardly. Whatever circumstances the father has are the circumstances into which the inheritor enters; where the father is, the inheritor will be also. Hence, the word <em>sonship</em> has two aspects in the original language: on one hand, God&rsquo;s life enters into the church, and on the other hand, the church enters into all that God is.</p>
<p>At this time, the church is on the earth and has not yet entered into all that God is. This means that this is not the time of the church&rsquo;s inheritance. God&rsquo;s life has entered into the church, and we are God&rsquo;s sons; however, our becoming God&rsquo;s heirs and inheriting all that God is will be manifested in the future. In the future, especially when the New Jerusalem appears, we will see the church wholly enter into all that God is, and the church will inherit all that God is. In other words, at that time God will not only be in the church, but the church will obtain all that God is.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan is to obtain a group of people who will become His sons and obtain the sonship. When the Bible speaks of sons, it has two meanings: one is related to life, and the other is related to inheritance. Life enables us to be sons, yet even though we have life, we may not be able to inherit. This is similar to the case of Jacob and Esau, who both had their father&rsquo;s life, yet Esau did not inherit his father&rsquo;s possessions. God, in His plan, desires to have a group of people who become His sons with His life, and He wants them to obtain the sonship, that is, to inherit all that He is. The church possesses God&rsquo;s life in full, and in His life God has fully given Himself to the church. Moreover, God desires that in the future the church would inherit all that He is. According to the aspect of life, it is God&rsquo;s life that enters into us; according to the aspect of inheritance, it is the church that enters into all that God is.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Adam is already dead, but on the other hand, Adam is not dead, because he has given his life to us. Today Adam is still on the earth. Adam is everywhere. Adam has given himself in his life to his descendants. All the descendants of Adam have the life of Adam. They are a group of people to whom Adam has given himself in his life. In like manner, God has given Himself in His life to His sons. This is what it means for a group of people to be God&rsquo;s sons in His plan. We must worship God because God in His life has given Himself to us, and we have received His Son. Those who receive His Son are born of Him, and they have been given the authority to become children of God (John 1:12). We have been born of God. The word <em>born</em> is deep in its significance. For us to be born of God means that God&rsquo;s life, which is God Himself, has been given to us.</p>
<p>God in His eternal plan predestinated us unto sonship, which means that He has determined to give Himself to us in His life. Nevertheless, this is only the beginning. Romans 8:14 says, &ldquo;As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&rdquo; Then verse 17 begins, &ldquo;If children, heirs also.&rdquo; Being sons is a matter of life, and being heirs is a matter of inheritance. The utterance &ldquo;if children, heirs also...joint heirs with Christ&rdquo; means that we inherit God and all the things of God in Christ. What a glorious fact!</p>
<p>Verse 17 continues, &ldquo;If indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.&rdquo; Being glorified is to inherit. We are joint heirs with Christ to inherit all things. This is quite glorious! Today people in the world see us as &ldquo;the scum of all things&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:13), but in that day we will enter into glory with Christ. In that day both He and we will inherit all things. When we are manifested, people will exclaim, &ldquo;These Christians are the heirs of all things!&rdquo; This is sonship.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:5 says, &ldquo;Predestinating us unto sonship.&rdquo; In God&rsquo;s plan we are truly predestinated to be His sons and to obtain the sonship. Being sons is a matter of life; obtaining the sonship is a matter of inheritance. Life enables us to receive God Himself; inheritance enables us to receive all that God is. When the son came home in Luke 15, the father first went out to meet his son, and then all that the father had became the son&rsquo;s. This is what God has determined in His eternal plan. Since this determination was determined beforehand, it is referred to as predestination.</p>
