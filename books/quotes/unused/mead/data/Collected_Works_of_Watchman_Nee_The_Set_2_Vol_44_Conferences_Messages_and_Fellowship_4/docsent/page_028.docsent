   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIMITATION OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you are simply a believer, you can act as you please, but if you are a member of the Body, then you must allow yourself to be limited by the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here we find the necessity of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The cross leads to the Body, and the cross operates in the sphere of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If I am quick and another is slow, I must not insist on keeping my own pace; I must allow myself to be limited by the slow member.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If I am a prophet, then I must give way to the evangelist when it comes to the matter of preaching to the unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I should not feel the need to preach just because I have the gift of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"To each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ" Eph 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is essential for the development of the Body that we each recognize our measure and not go beyond it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a basic requirement for the growth of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Body of Christ is not only a protection to the members but a limitation to all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every Christian is but one member in the Body of Christ and must accept the limitation of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not allow ourselves to go our own way; rather, we should learn to be blended with other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Individual dispositions and peculiarities have no place in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every member should honor the talents of others and be faithful to his own.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, every member should know his own capacity and not consider himself more highly than he should.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If everyone does this, there will be no jealousy, ambition, or craving to do what others can do.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 2 Corinthians 10:14 Paul said, "For we are not extending ourselves beyond our bounds, as if we did not reach you."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet many people have not seen their own capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result they overstep their boundaries.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who over- step their boundaries are trampling others under their feet; they are kicking others, pressing upon others, and usurping the portion of other members.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If members behave this way in the church, some will begin to monopolize while others will withdraw, and the result will be a loss to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not behave in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should turn back and take our place in the Body and be limited by the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do this, the Body will be spared from damage.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE MINISTRY OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fellowship in the Body involves not only receiving help from other members but also giving help to other members.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The functioning of the Body is mutual.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Mutuality is the characteristic of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even when there is ministry from the pulpit, the ministry should never be one-sided.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The pulpit needs the help of the congregation just as the congregation needs the help of the pulpit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Merely being a listener or an onlooker is contrary to the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every Christian should have a part in the meeting and render supply to other members.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kind of supply is the ministry of the members and the function of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is also the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No member should cut himself off from this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you stop this fellowship, life will stop flowing, and you will become a burden to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a person thinks that he does not need to say anything, and that he will be approved of and not cause any trouble as long as he simply, quietly, and politely receives from others, he does not know what the Body of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every member has to render supply to the Body and fellowship and function in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a law of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the physical body no member can cease functioning without there being a loss to the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is also true in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the church meeting every member should function according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First Corinthians 14:26 says, "What then, brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation....Let all things be done for building up."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In spite of this, many people come to the meetings as spectators.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are a heavy burden to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord told the Pharisees that if His disciples did not rejoice and praise God with great shouting, the rocks would cry out.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is abnormal to not function in the meeting, and this is not pleasing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every time you come to a meeting, you should enter into the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With every believer, there should be the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you do not fellowship, you hinder God's life and kill the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have often asked those who come to the bread-breaking meeting whether they are coming as spectators or whether they are coming for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Anyone who hinders God's life is not only bringing death to the meeting but also bringing death upon himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What do you contribute to your fellow members when the church gathers together?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a member fails to function, not only do the other members suffer loss, but the member himself is impoverished.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am enriched by giving to others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When I quench others' thirst, my own thirst is quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is like the Lord's experience with the woman in John 4.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord was thirsty, but His own thirst was satisfied when He took care of the spiritual thirst of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When His disciples brought Him food, He said, "I have food to eat that you do not know about" v. 32 . He was ministered to by ministering to another.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whenever we try to satisfy ourselves, we end up being hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But whenever we satisfy others, we are fed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we bear the burdens of others, our own burden becomes light.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many people complain that this or that meeting is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They do not realize the kind of attitude that they have brought to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Whenever we stop functioning, we frustrate God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we come to the meeting, we have to open our mouth, release life, and participate in the Body ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once I was preaching in a place, and the meeting was very dead.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But one of the sisters rendered a great help by responding to my words.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>She kept saying "amen" to my speaking and responded with much expression on her face, indicating that she was taking in my words.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Because of her response, I was released and God's word was also released.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>May the Lord show us that we all have a share in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is not enough for us to speak about the Body; we have to express the Body in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Body of Christ is not a doctrine; it is a reality in life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God wants us to enter into the Body life, not to have the doctrine of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have received the life of the Body, not a doctrine about the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Martin Luther did not receive the doctrine of justification by faith but the life of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As a consequence his ministry was powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The justification that he spoke of was not a doctrine but a reality in life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Today we all must receive the revelation of the reality of the Body and enter into the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then we will see that we are members of the Body of Christ, that we need the protection and limitation of the Body, and that we need to function in the Body and supply other members so that the life of the Body will flow in an unhindered way.</S>
