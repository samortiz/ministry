   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yi-Yang, Hunan Province</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Dear Brothers Kuo and Liu:</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have been in Yang-Jia-Wan for over a month.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although I do not see the Spirit's obvious work, He is operating here.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, the Spirit has been guiding us in the matter of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now we have meetings practically every evening.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every adult and a few children are opening their mouths to pray in the name of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We believe that our God is a God who answers prayer, and soon He will perform great works.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Second, there are three co-workers here.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They have been enlightened afresh by the Lord and brought to Golgotha, and they have consecrated themselves afresh to the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We ask that you pray for me all the time so that I can stand faithfully for the Lord and have a life and an attitude of crucifixion, preaching "Christ, and this One crucified."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Concerning the matter of divine healing, I do not doubt, nor dare doubt, its reality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Indeed, God's promise of healing is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who have faith to receive it will see the manifestation of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we should realize and be reminded that we are still in the flesh and still carry weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are still restricted by natural laws.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am referring to our daily life after being healed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not overexert ourselves in walking or working.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our Lord rested by the well when He became weary of walking on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This teaches us that though He is God, He was limited by His body...Here I cannot help but consider how excellent is the Lord's coming!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We will see Him as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He will change our body, and we will be like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>O Lord, come quickly!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Peace to you in the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A year ago I was living in Mei-Chuang by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At that time I prayed that God would raise up a work in Ch'ang-Teh.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After a few months God sent His servant Brother Han Fu-shen...In Ch'ang-Teh, we now have a meeting.</S>
