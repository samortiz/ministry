   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Dear ones, drop this kind of attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is in the realm of the Old Testament commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Turn from that way to pay your full attention to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you are going to speak, don't ask, "Lord, is it Your will that I speak?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, what should I say?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather pray in a simple way, "Lord, are You going to speak?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not care for right and wrong, for speaking or not speaking.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In God's economy it is not a question of what to do and what not to do.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The vital question is, who does it you or He?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even love, if it springs from you, is not acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether it is love or hate, it must be Christ who is loving or hating.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why does the tree of life still appear in the closing book of the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God wants to remind us that His intention for man will surely be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man's disobedience caused only a temporary interruption.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What we eat is assimilated by our bodies and becomes part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In a similar way, by receiving God's life into us, He becomes us and we become His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We partake of the tree of life when we open to receive Christ in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is our food and drink even in the New Jerusalem.</S>
