   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Economy of God Universal and Eternal</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The contents of Revelation also include the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s economy is His universal and eternal administration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the book of Revelation we see God s universal and eternal administration which is for the carrying out of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Space-wise His administration is universal and time-wise it is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Seven Seals</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In God s administration the first group of items is the seven seals.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A seal indicates that something is closed, concealed, and not open to the public.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first four seals cover the history of the world from Christ s ascension to the end of this age 6:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This history is briefly yet all-inclusively covered in these four seals.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With the opening of these seals we see four horses, every one of which has a rider.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The rider of the first horse is the gospel preaching, the rider of the second is war, the rider of the third is famine, and the rider of the fourth is death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, in these first four seals we have the gospel, war, famine, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you know the history of the world, you will realize that this has exactly been the situation during the past twenty centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since Christ s ascension, the gospel has been preached.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Throughout the centuries, along with gospel preaching there has been war.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since the Roman Empire sent its armies to destroy the city of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, war has been intensified century after century.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the beginning of this century there was World War I and following that there was a greatly intensified war World War II.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>War always causes famine, and famine brings in death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These four horses are the content of the first four seals.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fifth seal covers the cry of the martyred saints 6:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will occur close to the end of this age and near the beginning of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Due to the preaching of the gospel throughout the centuries, many saints have been martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Close to the end of this age these martyred saints will cry to God for revenge.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sixth seal, taking place very near to the time of the great tribulation, covers the shaking of earth and heaven 6:12-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the opening of the sixth seal, there will be a great earthquake 6:12 which will be a warning to earth s dwellers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some evil ones say, Who is God?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are God!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although they may say that they are God, when the real God comes to shake their dwelling place, then they will know who God is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have met some people who have argued with me, saying, Mr. Lee, you preach about God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Don t you know that we are God?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I answered, Let us see who is God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although God has some amount of toleration, His toleration is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One day you will exhaust His toleration, and His little finger will shake the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then you will know who is God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before the great tribulation begins, God will send forth a warning to all the earth s dwellers reminding them that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the time of the sixth seal, God will not only shake the earth but also the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Revelation 6:12 and 13 say, And there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became as blood; and the stars of heaven fell to the earth as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that time, the earth will no longer be a suitable place for evil men to live boastfully.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The most difficult seal to understand is the seventh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The seventh seal, which will last for eternity, consists of the seven trumpets.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not confuse the seals with the trumpets.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The seals are secret, but the trumpets are public.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When you seal something, you make it secret and private, but when you sound a trumpet, you make something public.</S>
