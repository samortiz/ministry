   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Faith is natural!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It comes spontaneously and without reluctance because we put our trust only in those that we consider trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We do not need greater faith, we need to know the faithfulness and trustworthiness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we realized that God was the source of our faith, we would no longer seek faith in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, we would lift up our eyes to God and seek to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we realize that God is reliable, our faith will spontaneously grow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we know that God is reliable, we will trust Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we consider God to be unreliable, we will not trust Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our faith has a basis because it rests in God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do not believe in ourselves but in God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must make a distinction: what we believe in is not our faith but God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The mistake of some believers is that they believe in their feelings of faith more than they believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If they feel they have no faith, they do not trust in God or commit their things into God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If they feel they have faith, they boldly entrust their things to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not believing in God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is believing in their own faith!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not pay much attention to this faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not ask or search to see if we have faith, and we should not trust in God only when we have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should ask whether or not God is reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If He is --and of course He is --then why do we not trust in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we think, "I am not afraid now because I have faith," then we are trusting in our own faith and not trusting in God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, if we say, "I cannot commit these things to God because I have no faith," it does not mean that we do not believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This only indicates that we doubt our own faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We fail to trust in God not because He is untrustworthy but because we do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The problem is not with God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The problem is with man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It may be true that you do not have faith, but is God unreliable?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If God is reliable, why do you not trust in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You only have to be concerned about God, not yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If God is trustworthy, then spontaneously you will trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Otherwise, even if you have faith, it is futile.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not trust in your own faith; your faith is not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"For I know whom I have believed"; therefore, "I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit" 2 Tim 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible not only tells us that God is the source of our faith; it also tells us that the word of God is the source of our faith: "So faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ" Rom 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why do I first say that God is the source of our faith and then say that the word of God is the source of our faith?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here we see the wonder of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How do we know God?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We know Him by the word He speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word He speaks represents His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we understand His word, we will realize what God has promised for us and what He does and does not want to do.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only through the Word of God --the Bible --can we know God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we know His promise, we will trust in Him according to His promise and beseech Him through prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do not have the word of God, we will have nothing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And how shall they believe into Him of whom they have not heard?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rom 10:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we do not have the promise of God, but mindlessly believe in Him, we will fall into a kind of superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Faith must be based on something.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Mindlessly believing, without a basis, is superstition, and no one will receive anything from this kind of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If my father promises me something, I believe he will give it to me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This believing is solid because my faith is based on the promise of my father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If my father has not promised me anything, but I force myself to believe that he will give me something, then I am not believing but dreaming because I believe in something that is not factual but my own imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From this example, we can see the important relationship between faith and promise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God's promises are only recorded in God's Word, the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To know the promises of God, one must know the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Without the promises of God, our faith is not real faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The promises are in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"So faith comes...through the word of Christ" Rom 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have said that we need to believe in God's faithfulness, trustworthiness, and reliability.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have also said that if we know God, we will spontaneously have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is related to God's promises, that is, to His words.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If God has not promised anything, how can we know that He is faithful?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He must promise something before we can talk about His faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Faith is holding on to what God has said and praying for God's work to be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Faith is believing that God will do what He has said.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Faith is believing that God is faithful and that He will work out what He has said.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whether our faith is great or small is not the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The issue is: if God has promised something, will He lie and change?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The only question we should ask is whether or not we believe that God is honest.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This has nothing to do with our faith being great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We know that God loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, we should have no doubt that He is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Bible shows us at least two aspects concerning His promises: "What He has promised He is able also to do" Rom 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God is powerful and His power fulfills His promises.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our God is not a weak and powerless God who cannot do what He says He will do.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If this were so, what good would His promises be?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All of His promises would be empty words.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But God is not only powerful in promising something, He is also powerful in carrying out His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Whatever He has promised, He is able to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>"He is able" --this is what the Bible tells us about His person.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>"For the Lord is able to make him stand" Rom 14:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>"God is able to make all grace abound unto you" 2 Cor 9:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>"He is able to guard..."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>2 Tim 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Abraham offered up Isaac because he knew that "God was able to raise men even from the dead..."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Heb 11:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God is not only able to do what He has promised to do; He is also intent on doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Even if someone has the ability to carry them out but does not keep his words, the promises are vain.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>God is not only able; He is intent on carrying out His promises.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>"For He who has promised is faithful" Heb 10:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>"If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself" 2 Tim 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God intends that all of His promises, every word and every sentence, be fulfilled in His children.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Whatever He says, He will keep.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Whatever He has promised, He will fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Otherwise, His deity would be threatened.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Since He cannot deny Himself, He must remain trustworthy whatever the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If His promises are vain words, we cannot entrust all things and ourselves to God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>How can we still doubt if He has promised something, since He is faithful and will not break His words?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Therefore, brothers, please learn this lesson today.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>You are not the basis of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Never ask yourselves, "Do I have faith?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Is my faith sufficient?"</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is useless to ask such questions.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The more you ask, the less faith you will have.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Please ask God.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>What is God's promise concerning this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Has His love towards you changed?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Will He break His word of promise?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Is He able to carry out His promises?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Is He trustworthy?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Is He reliable?</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>When you consider more about God, you will not have to manufacture faith.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Faith will come spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Remember, you are not trustworthy, and your faith is also not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Only God is trustworthy.</S>
