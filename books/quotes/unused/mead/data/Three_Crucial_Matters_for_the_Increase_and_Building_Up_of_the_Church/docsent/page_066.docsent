   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FORMING NEW GOSPEL TEAMS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The new gospel teams will now be composed of six people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These six people will spread the gospel in one town.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The brothers coordinating the gospel work in Taiwan decided that every locality where we are spreading the gospel will be given a van.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The brothers are in the process of locating places for the gospel teams to live and are obtaining vans.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We hope to establish at least one hundred localities, and we want every locality to have a van.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There will also be slogans painted on the van that say, God loves the world or Jesus is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we have a large blending meeting, saints from the new localities can come in their gospel vans.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every team will live in a locality for six months.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If five or six local saints can join a team, the team can divide into two teams.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, we should not depend on the local saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is best to let them volunteer to coordinate with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If they do not volunteer, we should continue our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In principle, the six people on a team will split into two groups and knock on doors five days a week.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should immediately establish a home meeting in the homes of the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we will practice this, by the seventh week we will have at least sixty new believers, and we will not need to continue knocking on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must then lead these new ones in the home meetings and the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After meeting with the new ones for four weeks in home meetings and small group meetings, they will be firmly established, and at least two-thirds of them will remain and stand for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we baptize too many people, we will be unable to spend sufficient time to labor on them, and therefore there will be no way to keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to our statistics, about one-fourth of the people who are baptized remain and come to the Lord s Day meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, we may baptize forty people, but less than ten come to the Lord s Day meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The rest of the ones who are baptized do not remain, because we do not have enough serving ones to spend sufficient time to labor on them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, after much consideration we have decided that we must substitute time for manpower.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead of having a team of twenty people spend twenty-five days to preach the gospel in one place, we will have a team of six people spend six months in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the six people laboring in a locality lead sixty people to salvation, they must spend the time to labor on the new ones and raise them up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After half a year they should be able to retain forty or fifty people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then a church will be established, and these forty to fifty people will be remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After meeting with the new ones in home meetings and small group meetings for another six months, the new ones will be perfected and can graduate to do the same things that the team members do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This time there will be a total of sixteen teams.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After half a year each team will send back four people, and two people will remain in the new locality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that sixty-four serving ones will return and thirty-two will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every newly established church should have forty new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, there will be a total of six hundred forty new ones in sixteen localities.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The thirty-two serving ones who remain in the localities will lead the six hundred forty new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This should not be too difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At least thirty new ones in the new localities should be able to do the same things that the full-timers do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, the sisters should not be too concerned as to whether they remain in a new locality or return.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The six people on a team must be built together and strive together for the spread of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They must also support one another, and they must know all the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way, when some of the team members leave, the ones who remain will not be strangers to the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everyone will know everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During the coordination in the teams, the sisters frequently speak too much and have strong opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, we all have this sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, this makes it difficult for the team leaders, and they are troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The team leaders fellowshipped with me about this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Initially, everyone in the team is polite, but as the members spend more time together, everyone s peculiarities are manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, we must exercise to learn the lessons of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The initial time in the teams is a honeymoon.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Consequently, we are able to get along.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, as time goes on we begin to argue and are miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order to avoid the arguing, we must be in life; otherwise, even if everyone signs a contract agreeing not to argue, it will not help.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For this reason, we no longer want to have teams with twenty people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everyone will be reassigned to teams of six people, and each team will have a nice house and a van.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It will not be appropriate for the arguing to continue.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, the brothers must be more polite to the sisters and not lord it over them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The brothers must give the sisters some freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not a problem for the brothers to oversee, but they should not lord it over anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should try this way to see how it works.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If after a period of time things still do not work, we can make further adjustments.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We hope that we can resolve our many practical problems and difficulties so that we will have the peace to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The brothers have made all the preparations for the teams so that the teams can gain the results.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Furthermore, when we go out to spread the gospel, we should take some ministry books with us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These books are not for us to sell and make money but for us to use as tools.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must use the literature as helpful tools because everyone is literate.</S>
