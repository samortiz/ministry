<p>Verse 22 says, &ldquo;He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.&rdquo; <em>Subjected</em> and <em>gave</em> indicate completed actions. We have to join this verse to verse 10. Verse 10 says that all things will be headed up in Christ, and verse 22 says that at the time God raised Christ from the dead and lifted Him to the heavens in ascension, He put all things under Christ&rsquo;s feet and gave Him to be the Head over all things. In writing this passage, Paul referred to Psalm 8:6, which says, &ldquo;You have put all things under His feet,&rdquo; and he quoted from this Psalm again in Hebrews 2:8.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:22 says that Christ is Head over all things &ldquo;to the church,&rdquo; not &ldquo;for the church.&rdquo; This phrase requires our proper study. We need to differentiate between <em>to the church</em> and <em>for the church.</em> If Christ being the Head were only for the church, there would be no identification of the church with Christ, no identification of the Body with the Head. The little word <em>to</em>signifies the identification and oneness of the church with Christ. Christ is the Head over all things, not only for the Body but also to the Body.</p>
<p>Verse 23 continues, &ldquo;Which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; Again, all these words and phrases may be strange to us, and we may easily forget them. If we would try reciting some of the phrases in verses 10, 22, and 23, we will see how difficult they are. <em>To head up all things in Christ, subjected all things under His feet, gave Him to be Head over all things, to the church,</em> and <em>His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all</em> are not ordinary utterances. Who could believe that there is such a language as this upon the earth? To truly know the meaning of these words is not easy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Death Coming into Creation<br />
by Satan&rsquo;s Injection into Man,<br />
Bringing In Darkness and Confusion</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s purpose with the church is to put all things in a divine order under the headship of Christ. When He accomplishes this, His desire will be fulfilled, the enemy will be destroyed and cut off, and all creation will be in a proper order to enjoy the headship of Christ. This will be accomplished in the fullness of the times. God must do something to deliver His creation from the slavery of corruption, vanity, and confusion and bring the confused, damaged creation into an order full of freedom. This is to head up all things under the headship of Christ. The way God works this out is very deep.</p>
<p>God told Adam and Eve, &ldquo;But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo; (Gen. 2:17). Satan brought confusion into the creation by injecting himself into the human race as death. Death is simply Satan. Just as God is the sum total of life, Satan is the sum total of death. When Satan injected himself into the human race, death came into man. Then darkness and confusion came in through death.</p>
<p>The world today is very much in confusion. Every day when I read the newspaper, I say, &ldquo;Look how pitiful the world is. Day by day there is so much confusion.&rdquo; There is confusion in Africa, in Vietnam, in Indonesia, and even in the United States. There is no harmony. The United Nations itself is the very base of confusion; it is a &ldquo;beehive&rdquo; of confusion. The nations there are always fighting, debating, arguing, and in confusion. They are in darkness. All the politicians, professors, and philosophers also are in confusion, because they too have no light. They are in darkness because they are fully under the sway of death. They are full of death and under death, so they are in darkness. Because they have no light, they even consider their kind of confusion to be glorious; those who bring in more confusion become more famous. Satan has damaged the creation of God by injecting confusion into it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Way of Recovering His Creation<br />
Being to Impart Life into Man,<br />
Bringing In the Light of Life</h2>
<p>Now God must recover His creation. The way He does this is by imparting Himself into us. Satan injected himself into us as death, but now God is imparting Himself into us as life. John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men,&rdquo; and in 8:12 the Lord Jesus told the people, &ldquo;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&rdquo; When God comes into us as life, He shines within us as the light of life. This life swallows death, and the light chases away darkness. When we are in life and under the light, we are delivered out of confusion into order, harmony, and oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Life and Light Bringing In<br />
Harmony, Order, and Oneness</h2>
<p>On the one hand, there is Satan, death, darkness, and confusion. On the other hand, there is God, Christ, life, light, harmony, order, and oneness. When we are filled with Christ, we are full of life, and we are wholly under the light; then we have harmony and oneness. If the brothers who live together are not filled with Christ as life, at least to some extent they will be under darkness and in confusion. They can never have harmony in this condition. However, if they all are filled with Christ as life, they will be under the light. Then there will be no need to organize or arrange their situation. Spontaneously under the light of life, they will all be controlled, and there will be harmony and oneness.</p>
<p>Before Satan came in, there was oneness and harmony in God&rsquo;s creation. When Satan came, however, he injected death as the factor of confusion into the creation. Through death darkness came in, and under darkness everything is confused. In today&rsquo;s society, homes, and families, there is much confusion. Everything is confused and upside down. In God&rsquo;s redemption, His way to recover His creation is not the same way as He took in His creation. In creation, God created all things by His power, His mighty hand. In redemption, however, God recovers everything not by His hand and power but by Himself as life coming into us. That is why it seems that God is not doing anything in the present confusion. God is so quiet that it may seem that there is no God. However, we do know that there is a God who is working in a silent but living way. He is putting Himself into some of the confused people as life. Then when we receive Him as life into us, He is the very light, and we are controlled under this light. Spontaneously under this control we have oneness.</p>
<p>Although we are still in the fallen creation, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we do not make trouble wherever we go. This is not merely because we are under the control of the government or the police. It is because we are under the light of life. There is something living within us that shines all the time. Under this light we are controlled day by day in a nice, happy, and joyful way. We do not like to cheat people; if we cheat people, there is no joy within us. Rather, we like to be fair with people and treat them nicely. We are under the light because we have the life, so spontaneously there is a harmony within us. This harmony comes from light, the light comes from life, and this life is God Himself.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
