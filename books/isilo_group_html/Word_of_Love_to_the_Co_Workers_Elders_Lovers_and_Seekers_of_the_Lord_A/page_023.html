Because there are so many co-workers in this area, I feel burdened to speak this word of love as a warning to you. Beware of these four &ldquo;gophers,&rdquo; and be careful about following others. Actually, we should not follow anyone. Concerning following a person, the New Testament only tells us that Paul said, &ldquo;Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ&rdquo; (1 Cor. 11:1). We follow someone because he has the revelation of God, the vision of God. I admit and I am bold to say that God brought me to Brother Nee. I followed him; I admit it. People shamed me, saying, &ldquo;You only speak the things Watchman Nee teaches.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;That is right. That is my glory, not my shame.&rdquo; I never met another Christian preacher who knew the Bible in this way. No one but Watchman Nee ever told me what the vision of God is, so I learned of him. Since coming to this country, I have always tried my best to keep on the central lane of the divine revelation. At times in my speaking I was a little careless, but after my message was polished and I read it again, I changed some of the things which I had said. I have been very careful in putting out my writings. In actuality, our leading is not a person but the divine truth, the divine vision.</p><p>In February 1986 we had an urgent elders&rsquo; conference in which I spoke of the new way. Because the Lord&rsquo;s recovery had become dormant, I was like Gideon, sounding the trumpet to collect a group of people to fight for the recovery. I had no intention to force everyone to follow me in the same way. I told them that they may not follow me, but they should not oppose. The next summer I told the saints that our leading actually is not a person, neither I nor Brother Nee, but it is the Lord&rsquo;s revelation, the Lord&rsquo;s word. Therefore, we have to discern very much concerning the matter of the truth. Then we will not damage the Body, damage ourselves, or damage the one whom we follow.</p><p>You must never try to get people to follow you. That is the serpent. It does not help you; it damages you. This also means that you should never follow any person; simply follow the Lord according to His Word and follow the heavenly vision. To this end, you must study His Word properly, without twisting or any kind of deforming. The full-time trainees must not say that they have come here to follow someone. They have come here to learn how to follow the Lord and to learn His Word in the proper way so that they can discern what are the basic truths and what are the subordinate truths. Some truths are like the trunk of a tree, and some truths are subordinate, like the branches. Moreover, some branches are bigger, while some are smaller. To understand and to accept the basic truths should be governed by God&rsquo;s economy, by Christ, and by His Body. Concerning the subordinate truths, the branches, do not oppose, neglect, or stress any one in particular.</p><h2 class="head1">A TESTIMONY CONCERNING<br />THE WAY TO FOLLOW OTHERS</h2><p>I was together with Brother Nee for eighteen years. For eighteen years I never invited him to eat with me. Similarly, in our whole life together, Brother Nee invited me to his house only once; that was in 1948 when I stayed in his home in Foochow as his guest for one or two weeks. At that time, he invited me to a certain eating place where we could observe the eating habits of the Fukienese, but while we were together, we simply ate and did not speak improperly. In contrast, a certain brother often used to bring his followers to a coffee shop to drink together and speak in an improper way. I warned him about this. We must not have intimacy or friendship. Intimacy is not lovely; intimacy in the typology of the Bible is honey. In the meal offering honey was prohibited. The people could not put honey in the meal offering. Instead, they put in salt, which kills germs (Lev. 2:11, 13). We either do not love each other or we love by our natural life, which is honey. This corrupts us. I also believe that I never gave Brother Nee a gift. He only gave me two sets of books, Darby&rsquo;s <i>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</i> in five volumes and Dean Alford&rsquo;s <i>Greek New Testament.</i> He gave these to me in 1933, and they helped me very much. That was his shepherding and perfecting of me.</p><p>I am simply opening a small window to show you what kind of person Brother Nee was. We never joked together. At most, he once said that a certain brother, who was always in his mind and never in his spirit, may have been &ldquo;saved but not regenerated.&rdquo; Among the saints, there are persons who seem to have a mind but no spirit. They know their mind, but they do not know their spirit. It is as if they have been redeemed judicially but not regenerated organically. Of course, this is not an actual fact, but there is this kind of person. This was Brother Nee&rsquo;s meaning.</p><p>Prayer: Lord, in spite of all these defects and mistakes made by us, we are not disheartened, discouraged, or disappointed. Rather, Lord, we are very much encouraged by You, by what You are, by what You have done, and by what You are still doing. Thank You, Lord, that You are still moving among us throughout the globe. We look unto You for further mercy and further grace. We look to You for further experience of You in our spirit to be our abiding grace. Oh, &ldquo;the Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.&rdquo; We love this word of encouragement. Lord, we have no trust in our self. We are finished with our self-trusting. We trust in You. Lord, do saturate us and soak us to be everything within us, to be our faith, our joy, our peace, our rest, and our comfort. Thank You that You are our Shepherd without, and You are our Comforter as the life-giving Spirit within. We trust in You for Your recovery, for Your move. Lord, remember each one of us. We are on Your heart, and we are even on Your breast. Lord, never forget us. We thank You that You will never forget us. We are really on Your heart. Thank You, Lord, for Your mercy to have all the churches in Southern California. Lord, bless all the saints. Bless Your recovery. Bless all the churches. Bless all of our service in the one work for Your unique recovery. Amen.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>A Word of Love to the Co-Workers, Elders, Lovers, and Seekers of the Lord &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
