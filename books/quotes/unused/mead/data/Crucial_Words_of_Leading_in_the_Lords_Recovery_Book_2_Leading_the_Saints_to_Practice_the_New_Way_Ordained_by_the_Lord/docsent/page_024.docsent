   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ELDERS NEEDING TO PUT IN THE TIME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We will soon have a training for the working saints, and our principal burden is to speak this word to the young saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is absolutely right for us to have an occupation, but we should never fall into its temptation or be ensnared by it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to see that everything related to our occupation, such as making money, promotions, and attaining high positions, is a big temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>People in the world, whether they are going to school or holding a job, all aim for one thing to gain a place in society.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a result, everyone is aggressive, working restlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We too may fall into this condition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot deny that society today is very competitive, and living in it, we must compete, yet we should also know when to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to realize that it is impossible for us to lead the church if we do not put in the time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The rise or fall of the church rests fully with the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As elders, you must put in the time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In regard to the responsible brothers in Taipei, I hope that at least one-fourth would serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, out of over eighty elders, at least twenty should serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If more than twenty elders in Taipei would serve full time, I believe that the church in Taipei would certainly have a new appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everything we do requires time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Consider our literature work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The brothers who serve with me in preparing messages know that often after we have finalized a manuscript, I will change a word the next morning, then in the afternoon I will change another word, and again in the evening I will change another word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Word by word changes are added.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Consequently, the brothers have asked me, Should we wait until all the changes are made before we send it for printing?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In response, I told them that I did not know when I would finish making changes; there is no end to my polishing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is similar to a carpenter making a table; he is able to continually pare the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This paring can be without end and depends on how much money people will pay him; the more money they pay him, the smoother he will pare the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a matter of paying a price; it all depends on how much we are willing to pay and how much time we are willing to spend.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In like manner, there is no end to the literature work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you asked me to polish the hymns I wrote, there would be much to polish; it all depends on our time and skill at refining.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The elders administrating of the church also requires much time; their labor will not be sufficient if they administrate the church in the same way public employees work for the government.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the elders go to their jobs and demand a high performance from themselves in order to compete for promotions and salary raises, and then they rush to take care of the meetings after work, they will not be able to administrate the church well.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is similar to a carpenter paring the wood only a few times.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This will enable him to give the wood a rough shape but not to make it nice and smooth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we labor in this way, the church under our care will be rough and coarse, because we are not serving the church in a way that is proper, thorough, or self-forsaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The way I carry out the literature work is that I almost neglect to sleep and eat.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When meal times come, my wife always urges me to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although I often say yes, I cannot put my pen down.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>My purpose in sharing this is so that the elders would realize that if we do not have time or put in the time, we will not accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is more precious to us today the Lord or other things?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The future depends on how we make the comparison and choice; we need to consider what is worth all of our time and even our whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE VAST NEED TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, according to need, even if half of the elders in Taipei began serving full time, it would not be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The door in Taipei is open so wide that even if all the elders served full time, it would not be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Consider that over four thousand are meeting on the Lord s Day morning in twenty-three different halls.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If all the elders, over eighty of them, were to serve full time, how different the impact would be!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Besides the more than four thousand who meet on the Lord s Day, there are over six thousand who meet in other meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moreover, there are at least twenty-five thousand saints not being cared for.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have gained thirty thousand through door-knocking, but we are able to take care of only eight thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, many people still need our care, and they all have open doors.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the past, when the missionaries came to China to preach the gospel, they would have been overjoyed if they were able to persuade the home of one Chinese family to open to them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today people not only open their doors to us but also let us baptize them in water.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not a small matter, regardless of whether or not they are clear concerning their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If all the elders of the church in Taipei in all the different halls were able to serve full time, they would be able to take the brothers and sisters to visit these ones, and I believe that half of them would be brought back.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The problem is that no one has the time to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The elders need to allot their time; if they do not allot their time, there will be no way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No matter how much they love the Lord, if all of the elders are busy with the affairs of the world, there will not be a way for the church to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The elders need to put in their time, perhaps even all of their time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since they are already in the position of elders, they should do what pertains to their position; the reason that they have not done what they ought to is a lack of time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all need to pray to the Lord that we may give our time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to the present situation, even if there were five hundred elders who served full time, much less the ones we have presently, it would not be enough to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more we stay away from a task, the less there is to do, but the more we get into it, the more there is to do.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For instance, when someone tells me about a certain need, I usually ask him to wait for half a year and I will give him a reply when I have more time; however, when half a year has passed, I find that I am even busier.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can never run out of work; once we engage in a work, we will have more and more work to do.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord has definitely opened a door to us, and many have seen this; in the past twenty years the churches in the Lord s recovery have spread over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps, other people may think that our way of preaching the gospel is superior, but inwardly we sense that we still have a long way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The reason that we are somewhat flourishing today is that the Lord s recovery has the truth, and our truth has the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This ground may be likened to a Chinese saying: Fighting a war with a just cause.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Since Dr. Sun Yat-sen fought with a just cause, he was successful in the Revolution of 1911.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means that when his word went out, no one could refute it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He was right in regard to democracy, politics, and the governmental system.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, everyone listened to him because he truly fought the war with a just cause.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our ground, our truth, and the new way are all proper.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are truly fighting a war with a just cause.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The problem is that we who are fighting in this war have not done enough.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we would do what is adequate, the entire church would be in an excellent condition.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In regard to the church in Taipei, it is not too much for it to gain one or two hundred thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It would be better if we could gain five hundred thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, this is still not even one-tenth of the entire population of Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In other words, less than one in ten Taiwanese are Christians; this is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thus, we need to give more of ourselves and our time to lead people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If, as full-time serving ones, the elders want to be presidents, deans, or department heads in the church, this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the church there is no room for presidents, deans, or department heads; there are no such positions.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, what they can do is knock on doors and find the thirty thousand who were saved recently.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If all of these people were brought back and perfected, many more branches and leaves would be brought forth from them because all of them have relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In this way we can gain another thirty or forty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This chain reaction of bringing people to salvation will be great.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Hence, if all the elders would rise up, their hands would be full.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The time required to take care of these new ones depends on the actual situation; all of these matters take time.</S>
