[1]  In the foregoing messages, we have considered the experience and enjoyment of Christ in the twenty-one Epistles of the New Testament.
[2]  In these messages we have seen one hundred eighteen aspects of the riches of Christ, who we may experience and enjoy for His expression.
[3]  We need to realize that to experience and enjoy Christ is to experience and enjoy the Triune God, for Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God.
[4]  In fact, to enjoy Christ is to enjoy the processed Triune God the processed Father, the processed Son, and the processed Spirit.
[5]  The Spirit of God was processed through Christ s death and resurrection to consummate in the life-giving Spirit.
[6]  The first section reveals Christ in the church, the second section reveals Christ in God s judgment and in His kingdom, and the last section reveals Christ in eternity.
[7]  As God the eternal Father, He was in the past, He is in the present, and He is coming in the future v. 4 . As God the Spirit, He is the sevenfold intensified Spirit for God s operation v. 4 . As God the Son, He is the Witness, the testimony, the expression of God; the Firstborn of the dead for the church, the new creation; and the Ruler of the kings of the earth for the world v. 5 . From such a Triune God, grace and peace are imparted into the churches v. 4 .
[8]  The second of the Divine Trinity in Revelation, the seven Spirits, is modified by before His throne v. 4 . The third of the Divine Trinity, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is modified by the faithful Witness; the Firstborn of the dead; the Ruler of the kings of the earth; Him who loves us and has released us from our sins; made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father; and He comes vv.
[9]  Essentially God s Spirit in existence is one, but economically God s Spirit needs to be intensified to fulfill His function to carry out God s economy.
[10]  In essence God the Son is simply the Son, but in God s economy He is Jesus, Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, the Ruler of the kings of the earth, the One who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood, the One who has made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, and the One who comes to execute God s final government.
[11]  In Revelation 1:5 Christ, the Son of God, is unveiled as the faithful Witness.
[12]  Although He is God, He is also the Witness of God.
[13]  The first God-man, the wonderful all-inclusive Christ, now lives in us as the life-giving Spirit; He is our life, we experience and enjoy Him, we are constituted with Him, and we live Him for His expression 1 Cor 15:45b; 6:17; Gal 2:20; Col 3:4, 10-11; Phil 1:20-21a .
[14]  The book of Revelation is not only a revelation of Christ Himself but also a revelation concerning Christ in His church and in oneness with His church 1:1-2, 11; 22:16a; Eph 5:25, 32 .
[15]  OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED FIVE EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN REVELATION 2
[16]  In this message we will continue to consider our experience and enjoyment of Christ as the last of the Divine Trinity.
[17]  The name Jesus implies the incarnation, and the title Christ indicates that the Lord Jesus is God s anointed One.
[18]  According to Revelation 1:5, Christ, the Son of God, loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood.
[19]  Only the blood of Jesus Christ, whom God judged on the cross Isa 53:8 , is able to wash us from our sins.
[20]  Once we believe that the Lord died and shed His blood on the cross to make propitiation for sins, the Lord s blood causes God to forgive us of our sins and to spare us from the punishment of sin; it also washes away our sins and removes the filthiness of sin from us 1 John 1:7-9 .
[21]  The believers, who have been redeemed by the blood of Christ, not only have been born of God into His kingdom John 3:5 but also have been made a kingdom for God s economy.
[22]  According to God s ordination, all the believers should be under the authority of Christ, should allow Christ to reign, and should be a realm where Christ can exercise His authority.
[23]  Revelation 20 tells us that in the millennium all the overcomers will be co-kings with Christ, and these co-kings of Christ will be the priests of God and of Christ who will reign with Him for a thousand years v. 6 . In the New Jerusalem we will also reign with Christ in the kingship 22:5 .
[24]  Christ made us a kingdom, and this kingdom is the priesthood.
[25]  Revelation 5:9-10 says that we were purchased for God by the blood of Christ out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and we were made priests to our God.
[26]  To serve God is to handle the gospel, and to handle the gospel is to preach the gospel in order that Christ might be imparted to others, dispensed to others, that they might become the members of Christ, that Christ s Body might be constituted, and that many local churches could be raised up for His Body to be expressed in many localities.
[27]  Coming with the Clouds, and Every Eye Seeing Him, Those Also Who Pierced Him, and
[28]  Revelation 1:7 says, Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the land will mourn over Him.
[29]  In Revelation Christ s coming back is revealed in two aspects.
[30]  Christ s becoming the firstborn Son through death and resurrection is for us to become sons of God as heirs to inherit all the riches of what God is, that is, to receive, participate in, and enjoy all the riches of the Triune God.
[31]  In Revelation 1:13-18 Christ is presented as the Son of Man.
[32]  Christ as the Son of Man, in all that He is and does, is for our experience and enjoyment.
[33]  In Revelation, Christ the all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous, mysterious, and wonderful One is unveiled as the Son of Man in chapter 1 and the Son of God in chapter 2.
[34]  In Revelation 1:13 Christ not only is depicted here as the High Priest, as shown by His garment, but also is unveiled as being like the Son of Man.
[35]  Revelation 1:13 says that Christ, the Son of Man, is clothed with a garment reaching to the feet as a priest.
[36]  This long garment is the priestly robe, the garment of a high priest Exo 28:33-35 , signifying the fullness of Christ s divine attributes and human virtues cf.
[37]  In God s administration today, Christ is a Priest in the midst of the churches, taking care of them as lampstands for the shining of God.
[38]  The black hair with which the Lord is depicted in Song of Songs 5:11 signifies His unfading and everlasting strength, but the white hair with which He is depicted in Revelation 1:14 signifies His ancientness.
[39]  In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son of Man.
[40]  His Face Shining as the Sun Shines in Its Power
[41]  In Revelation 1:16 we are told that His face shone as the sun shines in its power.
[42]  In Song of Songs 5:10 and 13 His face appears lovely for His seeker s appreciation of Him, and in the Epistles His face reflects God s glory 2 Cor 4:6 for the imparting of life into His believers.
[43]  Therefore, in His seven epistles to the seven churches, the Lord as the living One presents three promises of eating: the tree of life Rev 2:7 , the hidden manna v. 17 , and a feast full of His riches 3:20 . If we would be living, we need to eat Christ as the tree of life and the hidden manna and to feast with Him.
[44]  m. His Having the Keys of Death and of Hades
[45]  In Revelation 1:18 the Lord also says, I have the keys of death and of Hades.
[46]  In the church life today we are no longer subject to death and Hades, for Christ abolished death on the cross and overcame Hades in His resurrection.
[47]  In Revelation 2 and 3 Christ is revealed as the Priest who trims the lampstands, the churches.
[48]  Then in chapter 8 Christ is revealed as the Priest offering incense at the golden altar: Another Angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given to Him to offer with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne v. 3 . Therefore, in chapter 1 Christ is revealed as the Priest taking care of the lampstands, and in chapter 8 He is unveiled as the Priest offering incense to God.
[49]  out of His Mouth like a Sharp Two-edged Sword
[50]  Christ as the Priest trims the lampstands, the churches, by His speaking Rev 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14; 1:16b .
[51]  In Revelation 2 and 3 the all-inclusive Christ as the Head of the church, walking in the midst of the churches and searching and infusing the churches, speaks to the churches in order to purify them and call forth the overcomers to enjoy Him so that they would overcome the deformed churches to bring in His kingdom.
[52]  In the epistle to the church in Ephesus, the Lord as the Spirit said, To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God Rev 2:7 .
[53]  Here it signifies the crucified implied in the tree as a piece of wood 1 Pet 2:24 and resurrected implied in the life of God John 11:25 Christ, who today is in the church, the consummation of which will be the New Jerusalem, in which the crucified and resurrected Christ will be the tree of life for the nourishment of all God s redeemed people for eternity Rev 22:2, 14 .
[54]  Because of religion s distraction and the church s degradation, the Lord in His wisdom made the enjoyment of Himself in the coming kingdom a reward in order to encourage His believers to overcome religion s distracting knowledge in teachings and return to the enjoyment of Himself as the life supply in the church life today for the accomplishing of God s economy.
[55]  Therefore, we need to continue in the enjoyment of the life supply of Christ in the present church life so that we can be rewarded with the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the Paradise of God, the New Jerusalem, in the millennial kingdom.
[56]  While we are enjoying Christ as our manna, we must take the best portion and offer it to God, offering Christ to God.
[57]  If there is a distance between us and God, we may enjoy the open manna, but we cannot eat the hidden manna.
[58]  If we would partake of the hidden manna, there must be no distance between us and God.
[59]  In the Holy of Holies we enjoy something of Christ that all those who are far off from His presence cannot taste.
[60]  Exodus 16:36 says, Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah.
[61]  If we read Numbers 18:26-30, we will see that the tenth part denotes a special portion that was reserved for the priesthood.
[62]  The inward law of life, the inward working of the Spirit of the Triune God, is operating within us, infusing the element of God into our being and making us a corporate reproduction of Christ as the standard model.
[63]  When we enjoy the hidden manna, we will partake of the budding rod, which signifies our experience of Christ in His resurrection as our acceptance by God for authority in the God-given ministry.
[64]  When we take Christ as our heavenly life supply, Christ as the hidden manna preserved in the divine nature within us causes us to correspond to God s testimony and to fulfill its requirements, thereby making us God s expression.
[65]  The purposeful God has an economy, and in His economy He intends to have a universal incorporation.
[66]  God in His Divine Trinity is an incorporation by coinhering mutually and by working together as one; the three of the Trinity are an incorporation by what They are and by what They do John 14:10-11 .
[67]  The Triune God in eternity past held a council Acts 2:23 to make a decision that the second among Them had to become a man and pass through the processes of human living, death, and resurrection so that all the redeemed and regenerated believers of God would be incorporated into God s incorporation to be an enlarged, divine-human incorporation.
[68]  From this we can see that Christ as the hidden manna is in God the Father as the golden pot; that the Father is in Christ as the Ark with His two natures, divinity and humanity; and that this Christ as the indwelling Spirit lives in our regenerated spirit to be the reality of the Holy of Holies.
[69]  g. As the One Who Has the Seven Spirits of God
[70]  In Revelation 3:5 the Lord said to the church in Sardis that he who overcomes will be clothed in white garments.
[71]  This indicates that Christ is the white garments to clothe the overcomers.
[72]  To the church in Philadelphia, the church of brotherly love, the Lord is the Holy One, the true One by whom and with whom the church can be holy, separated from the world, and true, faithful, to God.
[73]  As the greater David, Christ has built up the house of God, the real temple, and He has set up the kingdom of God, the dominion in which He exercises full authority to represent God.
[74]  If we consider the context of Isaiah 22 and read the context of the word regarding Christ as the One holding the key of David in Revelation 3, we will realize that Christ s holding the key of David is for God s house, God s building.
[75]  Thus, the glory of the Father s house that hangs on Christ as the peg is the children of God as the offspring and the issue descendants of God, and these children of God are the vessels of Christ, who hang on Him as the peg, the holder, in order to contain Him and to minister Him to others.
[76]  Revelation 3:12 tells us that Christ will write upon the overcomers His new name.
[77]  Here He is a new Christ, not another Christ; He is the Christ who is exceedingly ancient yet who is new today, having a new name to write upon the overcomers.
[78]  In Revelation 3:14 Christ is revealed as the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God.
[79]  The beginning of the creation of God refers to the Lord as the origin, or source, of God s creation, implying that the Lord is the unchanging and ever-existing source of God s work.
[80]  Revelation 3:18 goes on to say, I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire that you may be rich, and white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested, and eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see.
[81]  In order to be the overcomers, daily we need to pay the price to buy the gold Christ as our increasing faith to partake of His divine element , the white garments Christ expressed as righteousness in our daily life , and the eyesalve the Spirit as the enlightening ointment to anoint our eyes so that we may see the spiritual things .
[82]  Third, the Lord counsels the church in Laodicea to buy from Him eyesalve to anoint their eyes that they may see.
[83]  The eyesalve needed to anoint their eyes must refer to the anointing Spirit 1 John 2:27 , who is also the Lord Himself as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .
[84]  Christ is the One who will dine with the overcomers and give the overcomers to sit with Him on His throne as He overcame and sat with His Father on His throne.
[85]  We need to be those who dine, who feast, with the Lord in this age so that we can sit on the throne with the Lord in the kingdom age.
[86]  To sit with the Lord on His throne will be a prize to the overcomer that he may participate in the Lord s authority in the coming millennial kingdom.
[87]  Because the Lord Jesus obeyed God the Father and submitted to God s authority in an absolute way, after He was resurrected from the dead, God gave Him all authority in heaven and on earth Matt 28:18 and exalted Him to the throne.
[88]  In Revelation 2 and 3 Christ is the Spirit who speaks to all the churches 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .
[89]  At the beginning of each of the seven epistles recorded in chapters 2 and 3, it is the Lord who speaks to a certain church 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14 .
[90]  In Revelation 2 and 3 the speaking of the unlimited, life-releasing, sevenfold intensified, pneumatic Christ to the seven churches at the beginning of each epistle becomes the speaking of the sevenfold intensified, all-inclusive life-giving Spirit to all the seven churches at the end of each epistle universally.
[91]  Here we see that the speaking Christ becomes the speaking Spirit, the Spirit who speaks to all the churches.
[92]  In Christ, the Triune God has been processed for our enjoyment so that we may be constituted with all that He is to become His ultimate manifestation and expression for eternity.
[93]  The seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 are words spoken by the Lord Jesus, but today when we read them, the seven Spirits of God speak these words to us in our spirit for the purpose of God s administration.
[94]  In Revelation 1 we see many titles for the wonderful One Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, the Ruler of the kings of the earth, the Redeemer, the One who made us a kingdom and priests to His God and Father, the One who comes, and the Son of Man appearing as the High Priest.
