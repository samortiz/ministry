	 <h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO TOUCH A PERSON&rsquo;S INNER FEELING WHEN RECEIVING HIM</h2>
<p>Like every other spiritual matter, the receiving of people is not so simple. When we receive people, the most crucial matter is to sense their inner feeling. Such feelings cannot be imitated. We must develop the ability to sense the feeling within others. Our problem is that we often have difficulty discerning people. Although some people have truly been saved, we fail to sense it and thus do not baptize them. Whereas others are not saved, yet we baptize them because we think that they are saved. This is not a matter of being loose or strict but a matter of being able to discern the spiritual reality within them.</p>
<p>Some brothers might suggest that we need to be strict in the matter of receiving people, lest some unsaved ones &ldquo;sneak&rdquo; in. However, if we are too strict, we will &ldquo;squeeze out&rdquo; those who are truly saved. As a result, some might suggest that we should be more lenient in order to avoid mishandling people. However, once we are lenient, more problems may arise. Hence, this is not a matter of being strict or lenient but of learning to discern the spiritual reality in others.</p>
<p>We must learn to sense what is behind a person&rsquo;s speaking. The brothers in the churches who are responsible for making decisions regarding whom to receive and baptize need to bear the responsibility to learn how to discern a person&rsquo;s inward feeling. They should absolutely not be loose in this matter. To not be loose means that those who bear the responsibility for making decisions regarding whom to baptize have developed a spiritual &ldquo;nose&rdquo; to discern a person&rsquo;s real condition. We may not be able to see or hear a man&rsquo;s inward condition, but we should be able to &ldquo;smell&rdquo; it. For example, a guest may come to your house. After sitting for a while, he may suddenly say to you, &ldquo;There is a certain place which sells good sodas.&rdquo; If you then reply, &ldquo;Yes, I have been there before,&rdquo; this shows that your &ldquo;nose,&rdquo; your feeling, is not sensitive. If your feeling were sensitive, you would immediately serve him a beverage. Even if you do not have sodas, you should at least serve him some water.</p>
<p>Moreover, an opinionated and subjective person should never be involved in the matter of determining whom to receive. One who is responsible to determine whether or not a person can be received and baptized must exercise his spiritual &ldquo;nose&rdquo; and then exercise to be very objective. His attitude must be that regardless of how a certain person may be, he must objectively sense the person&rsquo;s inward spiritual reality before God. If we exercise in this way, our errors will be greatly reduced. If we consider the past, we will realize that most of our mistakes were made due to a lack of spiritual sense and objectiveness.</p>
<p>We must exercise much consideration when assigning a person to be responsible for the matter of receiving people. If the person assigned is not accurate, many unsaved ones will be brought into the church. The matter of determining whom to baptize should not be entrusted to others in a light way. Rather, because this matter is of much importance, we should be strict when choosing and examining those to whom we are considering to entrust it. If the person who makes the judgment is not accurate, the result will be unthinkable, and we will displease the Lord and delay His work. This is a solemn matter. It is not a matter of being loose or strict but a matter of discerning what is true or false.</p>
<p>I hope we will all see that in the church receiving people is a great and solemn matter. It can be likened to a big door, which, if not properly controlled, will allow many who have not been saved to be baptized and brought into the church and will cause many who are truly saved to be shut out. May the Lord have mercy on us so that all the churches may take the matter of receiving people seriously and solemnly. We should not be narrow-minded and closed; rather, we should without bias receive and acknowledge as brothers all those who are saved and who have inwardly contacted God. However, we must be very careful to not let any unsaved ones who have not contacted God enter the church. We must take this matter seriously. Otherwise, in the future more problems will arise in the church because there will be many who are not clearly saved among us. This will not only cause problems, but it is also a mistake before God and an offense to God. We must stress that it is not a matter of being loose or strict but a matter of whether our discernment is accurate or inaccurate.</p>
