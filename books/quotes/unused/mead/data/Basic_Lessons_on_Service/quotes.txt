[3]  LESSON ONE HOW TO MEET Scripture Reading: Matt 18:20; Acts 2:1; 14:27; 20:7; 1 Cor 14:19, 23a, 25b, 26; 11:17; Heb 10:25 OUTLINE The church being the assembly, the gathering of the called-out ones.
[4]  There is only one ministry in the New Testament 2 Cor 4:1 .
[5]  As long as we minister Christ according to the apostles' teaching Acts 2:42 , the teaching of God's New Testament economy 1 Tim 1:3-4 , we are in the one ministry.
[6]  The one ministry is the ministry of Christ to people for the producing and the building up of the church, the Body of Christ.
[7]  We worship God and we serve God in our meetings, and in our meetings we offer our praises and our thanks to God.
[8]  As a basis for realizing the importance of the meetings and how to meet, we need to see that in the most basic sense, the church is the assembly, the gathering of the called-out ones.
[9]  When we meet, we should always exercise our spirit.
[10]  First Corinthians 14 says that when we come together, we all can prophesy one by one v. 31 and that prophesying builds up the church v. 4b . In Exodus 4 Moses told the Lord that he was not an eloquent speaker v. 10 . Then the Lord gave Aaron to Moses to be his co-worker.
[11]  He said to Moses concerning Aaron, "And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do" v. 15 . When Moses would speak to his brother Aaron to put some words into his mouth, God would be with Moses' mouth and with Aaron's mouth.
[12]  LESSON TWO THE LORD'S TABLE MEETING 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 11:17-34 OUTLINE
[13]  In our first lesson on service, we shared about how to meet.
[14]  The first meeting we should come to is the Lord's table meeting.
[15]  The second category of meetings is the church meetings, and the first meeting of the church which we need to consider is the Lord's table meeting.
[16]  LESSON THREE THE LORD'S TABLE MEETING 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 10:16-17; 11:24-34; Matt 26:27-30 OUTLINE To remember the Lord: By eating the bread: 1 To enjoy the Lord as our life supply John 6:35a.
[17]  2 To testify that we live by the Lord John 6:57b.
[18]  In John 6:35a the Lord told us that He is the bread of life, so to eat the bread is to enjoy the Lord as our life supply.
[19]  3 To Have Fellowship in the Blood of Christ
[20]  Drinking the cup also indicates that we have fellowship in the blood of Christ 1 Cor 10:16a .
[21]  Hymn #52 Hymns is a very good hymn on the worship of the Father.
[22]  THE LORD'S TABLE MEETING 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 11:23-25 OUTLINE Remembering the Lord 1 Cor 11:24-25: By praising instead of by praying: Not to ask the Lord to do things for us.
[23]  We do not want to explain what it means to remember the Lord but to say something about the practice of remembering the Lord.
[24]  It would be helpful to itemize some of the main points concerning His person, such as His divinity, His humanity, and His statuses as the Son of God, the Son of Man, the Savior, the Redeemer, the Sanctifier, the life-giving Spirit, the Lord, etc. We have to try the best to point out the different items of the Lord's person so that the saints can be helped in their praising.
[25]  In the section of remembering the Lord, all our praises should be addressed directly to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[26]  THE LORD'S TABLE MEETING 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 26:30; Heb 2:12; Eph 2:18; John 4:23-24 OUTLINE Worshipping the Father: After eating the bread and drinking the cup Matt 26:26-30.
[27]  By praising Matt 26:30: Christ, the Firstborn of God, taking the lead among His brothers Heb 2:12.
[28]  In this lesson we want to see something further concerning the practice of the Lord's table meeting.
[29]  Matthew 26:30 says that after the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the cup, the Lord and the disciples sang a hymn.
[30]  We worship the Father in our spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit and in Christ the Son as our reality who becomes our genuineness and sincerity for the true worship of God.
[31]  We, the many sons of God, follow Christ in praising the Father.
[32]  Now we need to consider our calling of hymns in the section of worshipping the Father at the Lord's table.
[33]  The focus of this lesson can be expressed in the following statement: the worshipping of the Father should be with the Son and in the Spirit John 4:23-24 .
[34]  This refers back to Deuteronomy 12, where God ordained that His people worship Him in the unique place chosen by God and with the rich produce of the good land so that they would not be empty-handed when they appeared before God.
[35]  When we follow the Lord to worship the Father at the Lord's table meeting, we worship the Father with Christ as the rich offerings in the spirit, that is, in our spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit.
[36]  In this lesson we want to continue our fellowship on the practice of the Lord's table meeting.
[37]  In the previous lessons, we fellowshipped about the practice of remembering the Lord and worshipping the Father.
[38]  Now we want to see something concerning the worship we need to offer to the Father in the Son as the reality and in our spirit mingled with the Spirit of God.
[39]  In John 4 the worship to the Father, the worship in the dispensing of God, is related to drinking the living water vv.
[40]  To contact God the Spirit with our spirit is to drink of the living water, and to drink of the living water is to render real worship to God.
[41]  If we do not drink the living water, we do not drink of the Spirit 1 Cor 12:13 , we have no experience of God, and God is not dispensed into us.
[42]  If we are to worship the Father, we first need to be reborn, becoming the Father's children John 1:12; 1 John 3:1a .
[43]  We worship the Father in the Son as the reality John 4:23-24 .
[44]  The Samaritan woman in John 4 tried to contend with the Lord Jesus by saying, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship" v. 20 . The Jews said this based upon Deuteronomy 12, which refers to Jerusalem as the unique place ordained by God for His people's worship.
[45]  Christ is the reality of all the offerings from the riches of the good land, including the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, the wave offering, the heave offering, and the drink offering.
[46]  C. In Our Spirit Mingled with the Spirit of God
[47]  Our worship to the Father in the Lord's table meeting is in the dispensing of the Triune God.
[48]  The focus of this message is as follows: the worship in the dispensing of the Triune God is the worship to the Father by His many sons with His firstborn Son as the offerings and in His Spirit who mingles Himself with our spirit as the unique place for our worship.
[49]  THE LORD'S TABLE MEETING 4 Scripture Reading: Lev 3:1-5, 6-7, 11, 12, 16; 7:11-13 OUTLINE Presenting Christ as the peace offering to the Father: The peace offering being the center of the basic offerings: From God's side based upon: The burnt offering Lev 1.
[50]  Focus: When the problem of our trespass and sin is solved by Christ as the trespass offering and the sin offering, and when God and we are satisfied with Christ as the burnt offering and the meal offering, we can offer Christ to God the Father as the peace offering for our mutual enjoyment in peace.
[51]  The presentation of Christ as the peace offering to God the Father as seen in Leviticus can be fulfilled in reality at the Lord's table meeting.
[52]  In this presentation there are four main parties: God, the offerer, the serving priest, and the congregation of cleansed people.
[53]  When we open up our mouth and function in the meeting, we are the serving priests presenting Christ to God the Father for His enjoyment and our enjoyment.
[54]  The peace offering is for our thanksgiving to the Father Lev 7:12-13 .
[55]  Because we are grateful to God the Father, we offer something of Christ as the peace offering to Him.
[56]  This means we have to experience Christ in these three ways: Christ as the unleavened cakes mingled with oil, with the Spirit; Christ as the unleavened wafers anointed with oil, with the Spirit; and Christ as the cakes of fine flour saturated and mingled with oil, with the Spirit.
[57]  THE LORD'S TABLE MEETING 5 Scripture Reading: Lev 3:3-5, 9-11, 14-17; 7:11-21, 28-34 OUTLINE Presenting Christ as the peace offering to the Father: The portions of the peace offering: To God: From the ox 3:3-5: 1 The fat upon the inwards.
[58]  In this lesson we want to continue our fellowship concerning presenting Christ as the peace offering to the Father in the Lord's table meeting.
[59]  In particular we want to see the significance of the portions of the peace offering as seen in Leviticus.
[60]  The portions of the peace offering which are offered to God are also from the sheep or lamb Lev 3:9-11 .
[61]  The Right Thigh as a Heave Offering unto the Lord
[62]  The right thigh of the peace offering was also given to the priest for a heave offering out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings Lev 7:32-34 .
[63]  The flesh meat of the cattle is the portion to the offerer 7:15-18 .
[64]  The flesh of the peace offering for thanksgiving is good for eating on the offering day v. 15 , whereas the flesh of the peace offering for a vow or a voluntary offering is good for eating for two days vv.
[65]  Leviticus 7:13 says, "With the thanksgiving sacrifice of his peace offering, he shall offer his offering with cakes of leavened bread."
[66]  The other items are for appreciation and enjoyment, whereas the leaven reminds us that we, the offerers and enjoyers of such a holy Christ, are still unholy; we are still leavened.
[67]  THE LORD'S TABLE MEETING 6 Scripture Reading: Lev 3:1-17; 7:23, 25-27, 33 OUTLINE Presenting Christ as the peace offering to the Father: The enjoyment of the peace offering: God's portion: The blood 3:2, 8, 13, 17; 7:26-27, 33: 1 To satisfy His righteous requirements.
[68]  In the previous lesson we saw the portions of the peace offering.
[69]  In this lesson we want to begin to fellowship about the enjoyment of the peace offering.
[70]  The requirements of God's righteousness, God's holiness, and God's glory all need to be met.
[71]  By reading the four Gospels, we can realize that the Lord's thought, His desire, His intention, His love, His likes and dislikes, His emotions, and all the things within Him were very tender and very rich toward God and in the presence of God.
[72]  The net above the liver Lev 3:4, 10, 15 , not the liver itself, was offered to God as the additional inward riches and the covering of this inward part.
[73]  THE LORD'S TABLE MEETING 7 Scripture Reading: Lev 7:11-21, 28-34 OUTLINE Presenting Christ as the peace offering to the Father: The enjoyment of the peace offering: The offering priest's portion: One cake out of each of the following as a heave offering unto Jehovah Christ in His humanity as nourishment in ascension to the serving one 7:14: 1 Unleavened, perforated, thin cakes mingled with oil Christ living a crucified life mingled with the Spirit and easy to be contacted and received 7:12a.
[74]  We have seen that God's portion of the peace offering is mainly of two things: the blood and the fat.
[75]  This is because the Bible reveals that our relationship with God is always based upon three of His attributes: the righteousness of God, the holiness of God, and the glory of God.
[76]  The flesh of the cattle signifies the rich supply of Christ as our nourishment 7:15-18 .
[77]  LESSON ELEVEN THE CHURCH-BUILDING SERVICE Scripture Reading: Eph 4:16, 7, 12; 1 Pet 4:10; Rom 12:7a; 16:1; Acts 6:3; 1 Cor 12:28b; Matt 20:26-28; Col 1:7; 4:12, 7; Eph 6:21 OUTLINE The church being built by itself, not only through the joints of supply but also through each one part Eph 4:16.
[78]  To each one of us grace having been given according to the measure of the gift of Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:7, 12.
[79]  As every man has received a gift, even so minister the same to one another, as good stewards of the varied grace of God 1 Pet 4:10.
[80]  In this lesson we want to see the church-building service, that is, the service which builds the church.
[81]  Our practical service should be as a servant, even as a slave.
[82]  LESSON TWELVE THE GRACE-MINISTERING SERVICE Scripture Reading: Rom 12:4-6a, 7a; Eph 4:7; 1 Pet 4:10; John 1:17b; 1 Cor 15:10; 2 Cor 12:9 OUTLINE All the members of the Body of Christ being gifted Rom 12:6a.
[83]  To serve in the church being to minister Christ as grace to others: First, we need to experience the grace of Christ in our own circumstances 2 Cor 12:9.
[84]  Romans 12:4-6a says that grace is given to every member and that every member has a gift.
[85]  One brother, whom I knew for about thirty years and who is now with the Lord, is a good example of this grace-ministering service.
[86]  He did not speak much in the meetings because he was not assigned with that kind of grace.
[87]  My point in sharing this is that the hall in Chefoo was greatly used and blessed by the Lord because of the practical service poured out by so many saints.
[88]  Every bit of that meeting hall was cleaned and prepared with much love and prayer.
[89]  OF NOT USING OUR GIFT Scripture Reading: Matt 24:48-51; 25:24-31 OUTLINE The danger: Beating our fellow slaves mistreating fellow believers 24:49a.
[90]  In this lesson we want to see the danger and loss of not using our gift.
[91]  The previous lesson tells us that we all have a gift.
[92]  Now this lesson warns us that if we do not use our gift, this is dangerous, and this will be a loss.
[93]  Matthew 25:28 and 29 say, "Take away therefore the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents.
[94]  LESSON FOURTEEN STRANGE FIRE Scripture Reading: Lev 10:1-11; 16:12 OUTLINE The incense should be burned before the Lord with the fire from the altar of burnt offering 16:12.
[95]  The fire on the altar of burnt offering burns out all the natural and negative things before God.
[96]  LESSON FIFTEEN TAKING HEED HOW TO BUILD Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:10-15 OUTLINE The unique foundation having been laid vv.
[97]  Following the previous lesson concerning strange fire, we need this lesson on taking heed how to build.
[98]  Our soul neither receiving the things of the Spirit of God nor being able to know them 1 Cor 2:14.
[99]  Most of the time we remain in the realm of good and evil.
[100]  We do good things not by the spirit but by our natural being.
[101]  But God does not want us to remain in the realm, in the field, of good and evil by using our soul to do good and to reject evil.
[102]  LESSON SEVENTEEN KNOWING THE FLESH Scripture Reading: Gen 6:3a; Gal 3:3; 5:17, 19-21; 1 Cor 3:3-4; Gal 4:29; Rom 7:18a; 8:7-8; Phil 3:3; Gal 6:8a; 5:16, 24 OUTLINE The fallen man becoming flesh Gen 6:3a.
[103]  Genesis 6:3a is the first verse in the Bible which says something concerning the fallen man as flesh.
[104]  Galatians 4:29 says, "But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now."
[105]  Romans 8:8 says that those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
[106]  Because the flesh cannot subject itself to the law of God, it cannot please God.
[107]  LESSON EIGHTEEN FURTHER KNOWLEDGE OF THE FLESH Scripture Reading: Exo 30:31-32; Gal 5:26; 6:12; Matt 20:20-27; Phil 2:14; Matt 12:36; Exo 17:8-16; 1 Sam 15:1-23 OUTLINE The flesh having no share in the holy anointing oil Exo 30:31-32.
[108]  When we use the term self-righteousness, we do not mean self-justice.
[109]  Philippians 2:14 also charges us to do all things without reasonings.
[110]  LESSON NINETEEN THE DENIAL OF THE SELF Scripture Reading: Matt 16:23-26; Luke 9:25; Gal 5:16b, 24; Rom 7:18-21; Matt 19:16, 20 OUTLINE The difference between the self and the flesh: The flesh being the corrupted and transmuted body Gal 5:16b, 24.
[111]  The self being the fallen and rebellious soul Matt 16:26; Luke 9:25.
[112]  THE SELF BEING THE HIDDEN, DAMAGING FACTOR OF OUR SERVICE IN THE CHURCH
[113]  We need to impress the saints that the self is the hidden, damaging factor of our service in the church.
[114]  STRENGTH AND ABILITY Scripture Reading: Exo 2:11-15; Acts 7:22-30, 34-36; Heb 11:28; Luke 22:31-34; John 13:36-38; 18:15-18, 25-27; Matt 26:69-75; 1 Pet 5:5-6 OUTLINE The natural strength and ability having no divine element.
[115]  The most difficult and crucial thing concerning the Lord's service is to take care of these negative points which we have pointed out in these lessons.
[116]  Anyone in the Lord's recovery who is not clear concerning all these negative points cannot render a proper service to the Lord.
[117]  We may even be taking the lead, but if we are not clear about all of these negative factors, we cannot help the saints to do the church service in the profitable way of life.
[118]  C. Being Put Aside by God for Forty Years
