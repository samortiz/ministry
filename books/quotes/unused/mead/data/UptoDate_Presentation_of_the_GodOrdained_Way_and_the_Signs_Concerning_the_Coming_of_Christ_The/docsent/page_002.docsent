   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE PROPER CHRISTIAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>MEETING AND SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever we the believers meet, we have three precious things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, we have the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord said that whenever we are gathered into His name, He is in our midst Matt 18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, whenever we come together, we should believe that the Lord is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His name is our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, we have the Lord's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's Spirit is with us all the time and everywhere, but when we meet together, the Lord's Spirit is doubly present with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Third, we have the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever we meet, we have the Lord's speaking to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, these three things the Lord's name, the Lord's Spirit, and the Lord's word are the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we draw a deep breath by calling, "O Lord Jesus," we feel refreshed in our body and clear in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is neither a superstition nor something of our imagination; it is God Himself coming into us to be our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE INFLUENCE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OF TRADITIONAL CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I would like to tell you a little about our history.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Up to the present time, the Lord's recovery has been among us for almost seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first meeting was started in 1922 in Foochow by Brother Watchman Nee and others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Nee was the first to bring in the Lord's recovery, whereas I was the one who raised up the first church among us in the north, in my hometown, Chefoo, in 1932.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brother Nee and I both came out from the background of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brother Nee's grandfather was a pastor, and my mother was a third generation Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We were alike in that we were born in Christianity, we grew up in Christianity, and we were educated in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, it was not easy for us to escape the influence of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that time we were still young.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was an unstable time the country was segmented by the warlords, the government was corrupt, and the people were suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Seeing the international situation and considering the future of the country, many young people really desired to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time the Lord did a particular work in China and raised up a number of young people who loved the Lord and who lived for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were all our age.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, after a time most of them did not take the way of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By the Lord's mercy, we remained.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We surely saw the revelation of the Lord and knew the deviation of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we determined to have only three things the Bible, the Lord's name, and salvation; the rest we could do without.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although we had made such a determination, there was still the question of how we should meet.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From our childhood we had not seen any kind of meeting outside Christianity; we had already seen enough of the whole order of things in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, when we desired to meet, naturally it was difficult for us to be rid of the "color" of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I can still remember that when I was twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, a meeting was raised up in my mother's home, and I took the lead there.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although I had not studied in a seminary, nor had I been a pastor or a preacher, I had to give a message and lead the prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the way of meeting in Christianity was spontaneously brought over to our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In October of 1933, after I gave up my job, I went to Shanghai to see Brother Nee, and I stayed there.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I very much appreciated some of the things that I noticed in the way they met that we did not practice in the north.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, for the most part, their way was about the same as ours: someone led the meeting, someone gave a message, someone concluded the meeting, and all the rest listened to the message.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It was always like this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE RECOVERY OF PRAYING OVER THE HYMNS, PRAY-READING THE LORD'S WORD,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>CALLING ON THE LORD'S NAME, AND</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>SPEAKING THE HYMNS TO ONE ANOTHER</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 1949 I was sent to work abroad, first to Taiwan, and the next year to the Philippines.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Probably in 1953 or 1954, we began to practice praying over the hymns; that is, after singing a hymn, the brothers and sisters would utter some prayers according to the hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everybody felt that this was very enjoyable, and as a result everyone became living.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Ten years later, I went to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then in 1966 I returned to Taiwan, and it was at that time that the saints in Tainan began to practice pray-reading, joining the reading of the Word with prayer, that is, not only reading but also praying.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because of this, many saints were released, and the situation became very flourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This practice spread rapidly to San Francisco, and when the saints there received it, they too were benefited.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, we have the praying over the hymns and the pray-reading of the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One time, before the Lord's Day morning meeting, while everyone was sitting quietly and waiting, as was our custom, I stood up and said, "Everyone who came to the meeting can say four words."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As I was speaking, I still did not know what the four words were.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>While I was speaking, I was considering.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then I spoke the following four words: "O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everyone practiced this on the spot, and some immediately composed some songs concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then this became prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I knew that this was the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>So at that point we added another item calling on the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At that time we were meeting in Elden Hall in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many saints had moved to the neighborhood of the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the early evening, one could hear the voices of the saints calling, "O Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Everyone was calling calling in the homes, calling on the streets, and calling in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>That fervent situation lasted for a considerable time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In 1968 I was invited to Jakarta, Indonesia.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In a meeting there, I spoke concerning Ephesians 5:19, which says that we can speak to one another in psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Out of this came the speaking of the hymns one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As a result, the meetings became even more living than before.</S>
