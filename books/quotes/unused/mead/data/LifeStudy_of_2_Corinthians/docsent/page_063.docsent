   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What should we do when we realize that our behavior is copper and not gold?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should go to the Lord desperately and say to Him, Lord, now I have the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I see what is You and what is me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The best I can be is bright, shining copper.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But, Lord, You are gold.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I compare myself to You as the gold, I begin to loathe my copper behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I hate my own submission, obedience, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, I need You to be my submission.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, I want to experience You as my obedience and love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, if You don t love in me, I won t love either.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, I don t want to do anything without You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, You live in me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Come in to replace my copper with Your gold.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>O Lord Jesus, replace me!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then, throughout the day we should contact the Lord by calling on Him and allow Him to replace us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Gradually, we shall experience the Lord s living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We shall realize that our behavior does not originate with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, it is the resurrected Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we practice this day by day, we shall be transformed from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, others will notice the difference in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They will see a difference in our submission, obedience, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yes, we are still submissive, but this submission is different in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Formerly, our behavior was copper; now it is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because it is gold, it is much brighter than before.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is even glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope we shall all see the difference between the copper and the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once we were going from copper to copper, but now we are being transformed from gold to gold, from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Over the years I have often said to myself, You are still a mixture of copper and gold.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, I can testify that the copper has been decreasing and that the gold has been increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>WHAT IT MEANS TO BE TRANSFORMED</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all need to be impressed with what it means to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be transformed is to have Christ added into our being to replace what we are so that Christ may increase and our natural life may decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the process of transformation takes place within us, the old element of our natural being is carried away, and the glory, the blossoming Christ, the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit, is added into us to replace the natural element.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today is different from yesterday, and tomorrow will be different from today, for each day we have less of the natural element and more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what it means to be transformed from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I did not acquire this understanding of transformation merely from reading books.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>None of the books I have read helped me to have a thorough understanding of from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Throughout the years, I have learned from my own experience and from my observations in the church life what it means to be transformed from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>More than twenty years ago I could not have given such a message as this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At that time I still did not have a clear understanding concerning Paul s expression from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now I see that the glory here is the blossoming Christ, Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, this Christ as the glory is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, both from my experience and observation I can testify that the glory in 3:18 is actually the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The more we live and walk in this life-giving Spirit, the more glory is added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, we live glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, that is, from the Lord Spirit to the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the experience of everyone who lives Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul was a pattern of this kind of life, and this was his experience.</S>
