   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now let us look at a few verses.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 2:4-5 says, "But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in offenses."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul said that God was rich in mercy because of something.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That something is His great love with which He loved us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without love, there would be no mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In what situation was He merciful to us?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was merciful to us when we were dead in offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His mercy had to do with our present distressing situation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because we were dead in sins, He had mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He had mercy on us based on His love toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What happens after mercy?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 8 goes on to tell us that He saved us by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, mercy was shown to us because we were in a situation of being dead in offenses; then, grace was given to us for our salvation, indicating that we received a new position and entered a new realm.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thank God that there is not only love and grace, but great mercy as well.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1 Timothy 1:13 Paul says, "Who formerly was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insulting person; but I was shown mercy because, being ignorant, I acted in unbelief."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul explains here how he obtained mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His obtaining mercy had to do with his life history.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It had to do with his being a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insulting person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before he was saved, he was in a condition of being a blasphemer, a persecutor, an insulting person, and an ignorant and unbelieving person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While he was in such a condition, God had mercy on him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>So you can see that mercy is negative and has to do with the hard and difficult situations of our past.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Grace, on the other hand, has to do with the positive aspects related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The two must be distinguished and should not be considered the same.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Titus 3:5 says, "Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us..."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no righteousness in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While we were without righteousness and were in a suffering and helpless situation, God had mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thank the Lord that there is mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We saw earlier that mercy originates in love and terminates in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When mercy extends itself, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He had mercy upon us in the condition that we were in, and as a result we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 11:32 says, "For God has shut up all in disobedience that He might show mercy to all."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why did God shut up all in disobedience?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was so that He might show mercy to all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God allowed all to become disobedient and has shut up all in disobedience, not for the purpose of making them disobedient, but for the purpose of showing mercy to all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After He has shown mercy, His next action is to save them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, mercy has to do with your condition, not the condition after you became a Christian, but the condition before you were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But thank God that He did not stop with mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With Him there is also grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is one place in the Bible that shows us clearly that our regeneration is of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First Peter 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All of God's work in grace was planned according to His mercy in love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His grace is directed by His mercy, and His mercy is directed by His love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was according to His great mercy that God regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, both regeneration and the living hope are related to mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because there is mercy, there is grace.</S>
