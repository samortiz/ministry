   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Problem Created</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>by the Spiritual Ministry in the West</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1954 some brothers felt that we needed to invite Brother T. Austin-Sparks, who was well known for his spiritual ministry in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I fellowshipped with the brothers that in terms of knowing a person or a matter, we never pay attention to big things; rather, it is in the small things that we see the true situation of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From the beginning of the Lord s recovery we were enlightened by the Lord to drop Christmas.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, we do not celebrate Christmas, nor do we receive or send Christmas cards.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, this brother in the January 1955 issue of his magazine, A Witness and a Testimony, released an official note of appreciation to those who sent him Christmas cards.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although this was a small matter, it revealed his condition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we invited him, I felt that there could be a problem, and that both sides would be hurt in the process.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It would be safer for us to keep some distance between him and us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Nee stayed with Brother Austin-Sparks for more than a year, from 1937 to 1938.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Nee later told me that although Brother Sparks has a portion in spiritual matters, he did not see nor would he receive any light concerning the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If Brother Nee was not able to convince him concerning the practicality of the church, how could we persuade him?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Initially, the brothers received this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, not long afterward they brought this matter up again, saying that they needed the spiritual portion from Brother Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time, it would have been inappropriate for me to insist on not inviting him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So I wrote an invitation letter in English and formally invited Brother Austin-Sparks to come.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He came in 1955.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During that visit he did not touch the matter of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He ministered according to his portion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were genuinely helped, and everyone felt good.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1957 we invited Brother Austin-Sparks again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This time he stayed with us for a longer time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One day we arranged for Brother Austin-Sparks to speak particularly to the one hundred or more co-workers that we had, and I was the translator.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The brother who requested the time of fellowship asked Brother Austin-Sparks what he thought about our work, since this was his second visit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Upon hearing this question, I knew that this brother had dissenting thoughts; otherwise, he would not have asked someone from a faraway place such a question.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brother Austin-Sparks immediately replied, When I came here last time, I did have some feelings, but I decided not to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This time I came prepared to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Please tell me, why do the brothers who are in the military service put their caps on before they leave the meeting hall?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At that time we had many brothers who were in the military, and they came to the meeting in their uniforms.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When it was announced that the meeting was over, the brothers in the military would put on their caps while leaving their seats.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to Western custom, however, a man should never put on his hat while he is inside a building; there is no exception for the military.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A man can put on his hat only after he leaves the building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the custom in the West, whether or not one is a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After Brother Austin-Sparks s question, a brother explained, According to Chinese custom, soldiers wear their caps everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, when the brothers in the military come to the meeting, according to the teaching in the Bible 1 Cor 11:4, 7 , they do not cover their heads during prayer and the giving of a message.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They put on their caps only at the end of the meeting, after the announcement of the dismissal of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is very appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After Brother Austin-Sparks heard this, he asked, Do you act in accordance to your custom or in accordance to the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although I felt inwardly that his question was unjustified, I translated what he said.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I knew that Brother Austin-Sparks s argument was irrational, because he was keeping the Western custom, which dictates that a man can wear a hat only when he is outside a building, but we were keeping the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brother Austin-Sparks also brought up another issue.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He said that our bread-breaking meeting was in confusion, disorderly, because one person could call a hymn and another person could speak a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Concerning this matter, at his invitation I went to London in 1958 and stayed with his group for four weeks and attended their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Their bread-breaking meeting was taken care of only by Brother Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He prayed, chose hymns, and gave the message.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was only in the last section of the meeting that there were ten minutes of free worship.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The proceeding of the meeting was very proper and was conducted entirely according to his instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The table displayed a row of baskets, containing small pieces of bread, and also small cups.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After he prayed and gave a message, he said, Now is the time we break the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then seven deacons came and stood before him, he passed the breadbaskets to them, and they withdrew.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The breadbaskets were passed to each row, and everyone took a piece of bread and waited.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After all seven baskets were distributed, the seven deacons lined up and returned the empty baskets one by one to Brother Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brother Austin-Sparks received the baskets, took a piece of bread, and said, Now we will partake of this bread together.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After partaking of the bread, they followed the same procedure for distributing and drinking of the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we compare their bread-breaking meeting with our bread-breaking meeting, ours would certainly appear disorderly to Brother Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>During the time of our fellowship, he was very critical of our bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I did not say much at the time, but I knew inwardly that problems would be forthcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>During his visit, we held a conference and a training.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever there was a free evening, some guests from England, America, Denmark, and Hong Kong would come together with a dozen local brothers, and we would have some free fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I had fellowshipped with the brothers in advance and said that it would be better to avoid questions concerning the church with Brother Austin-Sparks, because such questions would not be profitable to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Rather, it would be better to let him carry out his spiritual ministry and render the supply of his portion to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then we could send him off properly and still be able to maintain fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The brothers all agreed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, one evening as we sat in silence, a brother said, Brother Austin-Sparks, suppose there are five groups in Taipei that meet in the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Please tell us which group is right and which is not right?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Upon hearing this question, I knew that this was a bomb.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Brother Austin-Sparks said, None of the groups is absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All five of them are relatively right.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Thus, a debate ensued.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At the time I felt that because I was translating, I should keep a neutral position.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In addition, since I was the one who wrote and invited Brother Austin-Sparks for the second visit, I should be polite to our guest.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hence, I only translated for both sides and did not speak anything of my own.</S>
