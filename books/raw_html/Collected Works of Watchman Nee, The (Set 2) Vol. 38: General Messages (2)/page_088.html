<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">EXPOSITION OF ROMANS 5:12&mdash;8:39</h1><h2 class="head1">ROMANS 5:12-21</h2><p>Romans 5:12-21 says that everyone in the world is a sinner. Man is born in Adam. A man becomes a sinner first, and then he sins. He does not sin and then become a sinner. He sins because he is already a sinner. Romans 1:1&mdash;5:11 speaks of the sins that man has committed; it deals with what man has done, not with what man is in himself. Romans 5:12-21 speaks of what a Christian is; it speaks of the inward constitution of a Christian. Our deliverance is through the cross. This passage of the Scripture says that the sins committed in Romans 1:1&mdash;5:11 are forgiven and that we will rejoice in eternity. However, this does not mean necessarily that our hearts can rejoice at present. Salvation and deliverance are two different things. Salvation refers to God's forgiveness of what we have done&mdash;our sins&mdash;and this is once for all. Deliverance refers to freedom from the power of sin, from what we are inwardly&mdash;our person&mdash;so that we are no longer under any bondage. This is something we can experience day by day and moment by moment.</p><h2 class="head1">ROMANS 6:1-11</h2><p>Romans 6:1-11 shows that God's way of deliverance is to put us into Christ. First, He terminates us. Then He gives us a new life. The way of deliverance is by death and resurrection. The starting point of deliverance is a revelation of our relationship with Adam; it is seeing that we are of Adam and in Adam and are hopeless sinners. All that we are is nothing but sin, and all that we can do is sin. We inherited everything that Adam was and had. This realization of our relationship with Adam and the fact of our hopelessness is the beginning of our deliverance. The realization of our deliverance also comes through a revelation of our relationship with Christ. God has "grafted" the believers into Christ. Through baptism we are "grafted" into the Lord's death, and through resurrection we are "grafted" into Christ's resurrection. This is like the grafting of the fruit tree; the poor tree is grafted into the good tree. A branch of the poor tree is first cut off and then grafted into the good tree. In this way, the poor branch is joined to the good tree and absorbs into itself the nature of the good tree. "Grafting" means the adoption of a new nature, while "crucifixion" is a discarding of the dried branches so that old branches will not grow again. We are grafted into Christ. Our old nature is crucified because we are joined to the death of Christ. We are delivered from the old nature through death. At the same time, we are joined to Christ through resurrection, through our union in life. This is why we have to reckon ourselves dead to sin. Our deliverance from sin is a reality.</p><h2 class="head1">ROMANS 6:12-23</h2><p>Romans 6:12-23 says that from this point on, the believers must consecrate themselves. Consecration means that we are no longer our own. We consecrate because we have died and resurrected. Consecration does not mean that we offer what we originally had to God. It is offering what He has accomplished in us. The result of this consecration is sanctification. Consecration means that we no longer take control of ourselves; rather, we allow God to take control of us. We no longer live; instead, Christ lives for us. If we allow God to take control of us and live for us, the new life will grow and the new nature will be manifested. How beautiful this is!</p><h2 class="head1">ROMANS 7</h2><p>Romans 7 speaks of a man who wants to do good by himself. This brings in trouble. Romans 6 shows that the old man and sin have been dealt with. Romans 7 speaks of the flesh trying to do good. Actually, God has no intention that man do good. His intention is that Christ live within us. He wants Christ to live instead of us, and He wants Christ to work instead of us. Hence, God has no intention that we act according to the law. We must be delivered from the law and not try to please God by keeping the law. The law is God's demand; it demands that man do good. But today, God is not after men who do good. He wants men to do things through the Holy Spirit. God wants us to accept Christ as everything. His intention is that we no longer sin and also that we no longer try to do good. If we do not try to do anything, we will be delivered from sin as well as the righteousness that is according to the law. When the old man dies, we are delivered from the law. When the new man lives, we belong to Christ.</p>
