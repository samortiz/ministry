   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Concerning the Lord's Work</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us consider the relationship of tears to the Lord's work and their place in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jeremiah 9:1 says, "Oh, that my head were waters,/And my eye a fountain of tears,/That I might weep day and night /For the slain of the daughter of my people!"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jeremiah could really weep.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everyone calls him a weeping prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Read verse 18: "Let them hasten and take up a wailing for us,/That our eyes may shed tears/And our eyelids may pour forth water."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 17 of chapter thirteen says, "And if you will not hear it,/My soul will weep in secret places for your pride;/And my eye will weep bitterly and shed tears,/ Because the flock of Jehovah has been taken captive."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If men did not listen to the word of the Lord, Jeremiah would weep.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 17 of chapter fourteen says, "And you shall speak this word to them,/Let my eyes run down with tears/Night and day, and let them not cease;/For the virgin daughter of my people is broken with great brokenness,/A very grievous wound."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He cried because the Israelites suffered a blow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No proper worker of the Lord can be without tears.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All those who do not weep for their work have no heart for their work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All those who have a heart for their work cannot help weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many times when we try to deal with someone and exhaust all means, there is no result.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet there is still one thing we can do: we can weep.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sometimes when no persuasion works, tears become the last persuasion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes in warfare we exhaust all weapons, and there is still no victory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Tears can be the last weapon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Men may resist other weapons, but they have to surrender before the tears.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no lover of the Lord who does not cry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should ache for sinners to the point of weeping for them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should weep because God's glory is challenged, and we should weep in anguish that the enemy is not yet bound.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who have no desire to please the Lord do not have this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All those whose hearts are in the Lord's work surely weep.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jeremiah was a prophet who was greatly used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was such because of his tears.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was anxious and felt responsible for God's children, and he wept for them day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Tears are indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This world needs more tears to wash it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many young believers need tears to nurture them and educate them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our spiritual life is maintained by tears.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many sinners are waiting for our sowing work with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without tears, none of these works can be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today, men's consecrations are too inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many have consecrated their bodies, their energy, their time, and their money, but they have not consecrated their tears.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No wonder many works are not complete and many believers are not properly edified.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we weep for the work, what will be the result?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I can assure you that tears cannot flow on forever; there will surely be a time when they will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Read Jeremiah 31:16: "Thus says Jehovah,/Hold back your voice from weeping,/And your eyes from tears;/For there is a reward for your work, declares Jehovah;/And they will return from the land of the enemy."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we truly weep for the work, God will reward us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Tears are necessary not only in God's work but in our family life also.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can see this from the way a mother deals with her son.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have never seen a good mother who is anxious for her son but never weeps for him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is true even among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The tears that a mother sheds for her son are most effective.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The return of prodigal sons is many times due to the tears of their mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No matter how fallen a son is, and how far he has strayed away from home, as long as he has a good mother who cries for him at home, sooner or later the prodigal son will be brought back by his mother's tears.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is useless to watch one's son turning wayward, and to fret, shout, and even beat him, without weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a mother has all the virtues but lacks tears, she cannot be considered a good mother.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The same is true in dealing with sinners and young believers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is good and profitable that you visit them, help them, and read the Bible to them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But one thing is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You have to have the prayer of Jeremiah, who said, "Oh, that my head were waters, / And my eye a fountain of tears" Jer 9:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Otherwise, your work will not be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many workers of the Lord ask God for eloquence, power, knowledge, and opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All of these are good.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But one thing is indispensable in the Lord's work, which is to have our eyes "shed tears" v. 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Not only are there examples in the Old Testament, but there are examples in the New Testament as well.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Read Acts 20:19: "Serving the Lord as a slave with all humility and tears."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verse 31 says, "Therefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How did Paul serve the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He served in all humility and by shedding tears night and day.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Tears are a good way to work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I say again, no one can be complete without tears.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A person may be good at many things, but if he does not weep, he cannot be considered as complete.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In serving the Lord, we must have tears, both before the Lord and before men.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Of course, such tears cannot be fabricated.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They must flow spontaneously out of our deep feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Paul said that for three years he was in tears for them night and day.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Have you shed tears this way for your work?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All we have to ask a person is whether or not he has shed tears to find out whether or not he is zealous, if he is single for his work, and if his heart of service is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I must say honestly that without tears no work can become prosperous.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we do not do this one thing in secret, the progress of our work will be hindered.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Second Corinthians 2:4 says, "For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not that you would be made sorrowful but that you would know the love which I have more abundantly toward you."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We know that Paul wrote the first Epistle to the Corinthians when he heard from the household of Chloe about the condition of the Corinthian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Paul pointed out all their mistakes and rebuked them with the most severe and frank word.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Now in the second Epistle he told them how he wrote the first Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He said that he did it out of much affliction and anguish of heart and through many tears.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Brothers and sisters, when you hear of a brother or a sister backsliding, would you weep like Paul did?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Weeping is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Both laughing and weeping require strength.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Brothers, do you have the strength to weep?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You saw how severe Paul's words to the Corinthians were; they were like sharp knives.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He said in one place that they should drive out the sinner or else he would do something.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Such words are indeed hard to take.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>One thing is sure: if you want your words to pierce others, they must first pierce you.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If they have never pierced you, they can never pierce others.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Paul was indeed such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>While he was writing the strongest words in the first Epistle, he was doing it in tears.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Before he spoke, and before others felt the pain, he felt the pain.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Therefore, if you want others to feel the pain, you must first feel the pain.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It will never work if you only want others to be sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>For this reason, every worker of the Lord must be experienced in the matter of tears.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In other words, all those who do not shed tears when they see their brothers falling and failing are not worthy to do the Lord's work, and they are not qualified to rebuke or exhort others.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If you want to rebuke a brother, or if you want to tell him about something that he has done wrong, you must first feel the pain and the sharpness of the words before you are qualified to rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It is easy to point out others' shortcomings, but it is difficult to say it with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>However, only those who have tears are qualified to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Thank the Lord that the blood of His Son was shed on earth and was not retracted.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Man can receive salvation through this blood.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Thank the Lord that the tears of His Son were also not retracted.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>They tell us that He is mindful of us, and they also induce us to shed tears before God and before men.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>May we imitate our Lord in our prayers and in our work, and may we shed more tears!</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Psalm 126:5-6 says, "They that sow in tears/shall reap in joy./He that goeth forth and weepeth,/bearing precious seed,/shall doubtless come again with rejoicing,/bringing his sheaves with him."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Do you want to testify for the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This verse tells you how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The seed is the gospel, and the sheaves are the salvation of men.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If you sow the seed, you have to water it with tears before it will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Without water, seeds will not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Do not think that it is easy to bear fruit; you cannot succeed unless there are tears.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Here it says that if you shed tears before God in secret, you will bring in the sheaves with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Many times you consider the preaching of the gospel as something common.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>No wonder there is no sprouting and harvesting.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Tears are most crucial to your work.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Any work that lacks tears is doomed to fail.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Tears speak of your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Where your tears are, there your heart is also.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>It is dangerous to work without your heart being put into it.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>May we be zealous for God's work, and may we have definite tears.</S>
