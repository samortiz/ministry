<h2 class="head1">THE CO-MASTER BUILDER</h2><p>Verse 6 speaks of Bezalel&rsquo;s co-master builder: &ldquo;And I, behold, I have given with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.&rdquo; The name Oholiab means the tent or tabernacle of my father. This signifies that one&rsquo;s whole person cares for God&rsquo;s tabernacle. Ahisamach, the name of Oholiab&rsquo;s father, means a brother of strength or support. This co-master worker was a man for the tabernacle of God with strength and support. However, this co-master builder was of the tribe of Dan, the tribe of the lowest estate. The first master builder, Bezalel, was of the tribe of Judah. Judah is a kingly tribe, the tribe of the Lord Jesus. But the second master builder, Oholiab, came from the lowest tribe, the tribe of Dan. This indicates that the building work must include those of both the high estate and the low estate. No matter whether you are high or low, as long as you are one of God&rsquo;s children, you must be included in the work of building.</p><p>We see the same principle in the building of the temple under Solomon (2 Chron. 2:11-14). The master builder was King Solomon, who was of the tribe of Judah. But the co-master builder was once again of the tribe of Dan. But his estate was even lower than that of Oholiab, for he was the son of a Danite woman and of a Tyrian father. How wonderful the Bible is! With the building of both the tabernacle and the temple the master builder was of the tribe of Judah, a kingly tribe, and the co-master builder was of the tribe of Dan, a lowly tribe. There is nothing coincidental here. This arrangement is according to God&rsquo;s sovereignty.</p><p>Exodus 35:34 indicates that Oholiab&rsquo;s main task was to teach. No doubt, Oholiab was wise. However, he must have received most of his knowledge, understanding, and wisdom from Bezalel. Receiving all this from the master builder, he then went out to teach others. Here we see a beautiful and pleasant coordination.</p><p>Exodus 35:34 says that both Bezalel and Oholiab did the work of teaching. But I believe that most of the teaching was done by Oholiab. This indicates that in the building up of the church there is the need of adequate teaching. We need some to be today&rsquo;s Oholiab to teach the saints concerning God&rsquo;s building according to the knowledge, understanding, wisdom, and skill received from the master builder.</p><p>Exodus 35:35 says of Bezalel and Oholiab that they were filled with wisdom of heart to do every work of the engraver or craftsman, the skilled workman, and the embroiderer in blue, purple, scarlet, and fine linen. What is the difference between an engraver or craftsman and a workman? I believe that an engraver or craftsman has a special gift, whereas a workman does ordinary work with skill. The embroiderers, who may have been female workers, worked in blue, signifying heavenliness; in purple, signifying the kingship or royalty of Christ; in scarlet, signifying Christ&rsquo;s redemption; and in fine linen, signifying Christ&rsquo;s humanity.</p><p>Exodus 35:35 also speaks of the weaver, the doers of every work, and those who plan designs. By all this we can see that the building up of God&rsquo;s dwelling place is a fine, detailed work. The fact that many of the words used to describe the workers are similar in meaning indicates that the work of building up the church is fine, delicate, and detailed.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BUILDERS</h2><h2 class="head2">Wisehearted</h2><p>Exodus 31:6b says, &ldquo;And in the heart of everyone that is wisehearted I have given wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you.&rdquo; Also, 36:2 speaks of &ldquo;every wisehearted man, in whose heart Jehovah had put wisdom.&rdquo; These verses indicate that all the builders of the tabernacle were wisehearted. They all received wisdom and understanding from God. Here there is no mention of knowledge. It is common for people to have knowledge, at least in a general way. But what is needed for the work of building is wisdom and understanding, not only knowledge. If we have wisdom and understanding, we shall be wisehearted persons.</p><h2 class="head2">Stirred Up by the Heart</h2><p>According to 36:2, the builders were those whose heart stirred them up to come to do the work of building. This is to have a heart burning for God&rsquo;s building. This burning heart stirs us up to participate in the building up of the church. We all need such a heart. This kind of heart is an inner motor motivating us to do the work of building up God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
