We did not register ourselves with the government, nor did we hand ourselves over to them. The brothers and sisters continued to preach the gospel. The denominations used to be quite zealous in preaching the gospel, and they were critical of the local church, saying that we were narrow-minded and that we cared only for our own people and would not fellowship with others, nor would we preach the gospel in the rural villages. However, together with the brothers and sisters, we paid attention only to the matter of life and spiritual matters, and we were not affected by their criticisms. One day, when the time came, all the brothers and sisters rose up to preach the gospel, and we baptized one hundred two people. After that time, we had more baptisms. There were twelve or thirteen denominations in our city that met on Sunday, but their total number did not match the attendance of the local church. Three or four of these denominational churches could seat over a thousand people, yet their numbers were still less than ours.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
