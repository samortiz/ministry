<h1 class="title">TURNING FROM EMPHASIZING THE WORD<br />
TO EMPHASIZING THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:63; Eph. 5:18-20; Col. 3:16-17; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; Acts 6:4</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the supply of the Spirit. We have fellowshipped concerning blending in spirit, releasing the spirit, serving with the spirit, and praying in spirit, but we still do not have much knowledge concerning the supply of the Spirit. Therefore, in this chapter we will fellowship concerning the supply of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO MEANS OF SUPPLY&mdash;THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The church receives the supply from the Spirit and from the Word. In times of degradation the church loses the Spirit and the Word of God. In Christianity there are organizations and activities, but there is no Spirit. Sermons are preached, but the supply of God&rsquo;s Word is lacking. Christian meetings have many activities, including singing, praying, preaching, and giving reports, but they lack the Spirit and the Word of God. Since these two means of supply are lacking, the church has become poor and weak and therefore has many problems. This is a clear indication of degradation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s work of recovery in the church begins with the recovery of the Word. This is the principle not only in the New Testament age but also in the Old Testament age. For instance, at the expiration of the seventy years of the captivity of the people of Israel in Babylon, God brought them back to their fathers&rsquo; land and raised up the priest Ezra to read the book of the law (Neh. 8). This was to restore the words of God and present them to His people. Once the people of Israel received and understood the words of God, they were recovered. Likewise, during the Reformation, Martin Luther was raised up by the Lord for the work of recovery. He recovered primarily the truth of justification by faith, and he unlocked the Bible. Previously, only members of the clergy could read the Bible; common people were not allowed to do so. After Martin Luther began the recovery of God&rsquo;s Word, the church began to receive the supply.</p>
<p>God has continued the work of recovery in the church. Whenever there is a recovery, it almost always begins with the Word. Over thirty years ago He began the work of recovery among us in the Far East through our brother, Watchman Nee. This work also began with the recovery of the Word. The Lord gave our brother an immeasurable amount of light from the Word. Those who witnessed this matter and were in the flow of that recovery all felt that the Lord&rsquo;s words released through Brother Nee were immeasurably rich and powerful. He was used by God to carry out a great part of the recovery of the Word in China. This was God&rsquo;s great grace to the church.</p>
<p>The most obvious example in the history of recovery is what began in 1828 among the so-called Brethren in England. The most evident and most powerful aspect of the recovery among the Brethren was also the Word of God. It is not too much to say that Martin Luther gave the church an unlocked Bible, and the Brethren gave the church an opened and interpreted Bible. After Martin Luther the Bible was no longer locked, but as far as light was concerned, it was a closed book, and few believers were able to interpret it. It was not until the Brethren were raised up, in particular J. N. Darby, that the Bible became an opened and interpreted book. Theologians acknowledge that the orthodox doctrines taught in Christianity are based on the light released by the Brethren. Orthodox theology has also been influenced by Dr. C. I. Scofield. However, he did not discover the truths himself. He taught the truth, but nearly everything he taught was discovered by the Brethren. The Brethren recovered the Word of God and enabled the church to receive an enormous supply. To this day we are influenced by the light that the Brethren received.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE WORD BEING<br />
FOR CORRECTION AND ENLIGHTENMENT</h2>
<p>The supply of the church lies not only in the Word but also in the Spirit. Strictly speaking, the supply of the church should come from the Spirit and then the Word; this is the proper sequence. However, in His work of recovery God always recovers the Word, and then the Spirit confirms the Word because God must first open man&rsquo;s understanding. When there is degradation and deviation, the Word is needed for explanation, instruction, enlightenment, and the correction of man&rsquo;s views and concepts (2 Tim. 3:16).</p>
<p>Our spirit is the deepest part of our being. If our thoughts and concepts are not changed, our spirit will be frustrated. There must first be a change in the parts that surround our spirit, particularly our mind with our thoughts and concepts. In His work of recovery, God first releases light, revelation, and visions through His Word to His children so that their concepts may be changed, their understanding may be opened, and their spirit can turn to God. Only at such a time will the Spirit of God be able to work freely in their spirit. God first recovers the Word, and then the Spirit works to confirm the Word.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Spirit and the Building of God &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
