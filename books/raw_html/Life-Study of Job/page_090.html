<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S APPEARING TO JOB<br>WITH THE DIVINE UNVEILINGS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Job 38&#151;41</H1><P>Chapters thirty-eight through forty-one, which we will consider in this message, cover God's appearing to Job with the divine unveilings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. GOD'S APPEARING TO JOB</H2><P>In 38:1-3 and 40:1-14 we have God's appearing to Job.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah Answering Job out of the Whirlwind</H2><P>In 38:1 and 40:6 we are told that "Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind." This whirlwind was something very frightening; it was not a matter of grace. The situation here certainly was not one of coming to the throne of grace to receive mercy and grace to meet the timely need.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah Charging Job<br>to Gird Up His Loins like a Mighty Man</H2><P>Jehovah charged Job to gird up his loins like a mighty man that he might answer God's questions (38:3; 40:7). Such a charge surely was not pleasant.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah's Questioning of Job</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Asking Him about Who Is This<br>Who Darkens Counsel by Words without Knowledge</H2><P>In His questioning of Job, Jehovah first asked him, "Who is this who darkens counsel/By words without knowledge?" (38:2). Would you like to be addressed in this way? This kind of question is neither pleasant nor peaceful but quite threatening. Eventually, Job would have to admit that it was he who darkened counsel by speaking words of nonsense, words without revelation.</P>
