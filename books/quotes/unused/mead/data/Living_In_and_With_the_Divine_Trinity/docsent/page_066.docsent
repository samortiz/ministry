   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Participating in the Love of God,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Grace of Christ, and</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To enjoy the Divine Trinity in full is to participate in the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Again this verse shows that the Divine Trinity is not for the doctrinal study of theology but for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The love of God the Father is the source, and the grace of Christ, God the Son, is the course of the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When love comes out, it becomes grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the transmission, the communication, of the grace of Christ with the love of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Love is God the Father, grace as the outflow of love is Christ the Son, and the fellowship is the transmission of the Holy Spirit to transmit what the Son is as grace and what the Father is as love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Holy Spirit transmits the divine riches into our being, and this transmission is the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today we have the Divine Trinity operating in us in such a wonderful way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the previous chapter, we saw the revelation of God operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This operating of God is very quiet, but very vigorous and efficient.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although electricity flows quietly, it is very vigorous and efficient.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The current of electricity is the operating of the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The love, grace, and fellowship moving within us form a kind of current within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This current is the circulation of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With the Divine Trinity are the source, the course, and the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The source, the fountain, of this circulation is the love of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The course, the outflow, of this circulation is the very grace expressed and conveyed to us by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The grace of Christ comes out of the source of the love of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The flow is the Holy Spirit as the fellowship, the communication, the transmission, the circulation, of the grace of Christ with the love of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have two circulations within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One circulation is the circulation of blood within our physical body, and the other circulation is the circulation of the Divine Trinity in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without either of these circulations we would die either physically or spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second Corinthians 13:14 gives us a detailed description of this inner, spiritual circulation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This circulation is the supply in our Christian life and church life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is similar to saying that the current of electricity is the supply of power to an entire city.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the big cities on this earth today depend upon electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A number of years ago, the current of electricity to the city of New York was cut off for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When that happened, the entire life of the city stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a very good illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must see that the entire church life depends upon 2 Corinthians 13:14.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It depends upon the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Spirit to flow as a current within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times while I am speaking in the ministry of the word, I have the inner sensation that the divine current is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the current within me stops, I have nothing to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we miss the Spirit in our speaking, our speaking is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, if the current within us is cut off while we are listening to the ministry of the word, our listening is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to speak in the flow and listen in the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The flow is the transmission of the Holy Spirit, and this transmission is the fellowship that conveys the grace of Christ the Son as the outflow of the love of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The current of the Divine Trinity within us as revealed in 2 Corinthians 13:14 is our spiritual pulse.</S>
