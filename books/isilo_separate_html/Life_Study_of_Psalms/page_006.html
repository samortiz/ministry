The Son in verse 7 is also Christ as the resurrected One. He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity (John 1:18; 3:16), but He needed to be begotten again in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29). Psalm 2:8 says that the nations and the earth will be given to Christ. The nations will be His inheritance, and the earth will be His possession.</P><P>We need to consider why the Psalms are arranged with Psalm 1 as the first one and Psalm 2 as the second one. Psalm 1 is altogether not related to Psalm 2. David was saying that the one who delights in the law and meditates in the law will be blessed and will prosper in everything he does. While he was declaring this, God came in to make a declaration concerning Christ in Psalm 2, saying, "I have anointed Him and set Him up as the King. He will prosper because He will gain the whole earth as His possession, and He will gain all the nations as His inheritance. Blessed are those who take refuge in Him. You have to kiss Him."</P><P>These two psalms are two kinds of declarations. One is made by the psalmist according to his human concept, and the other declaration is made by God according to His divine concept, concerning Christ as His centrality and universality. We have to say amen to God's divine concept in Psalm 2. In God's eyes, it is not a matter of our keeping the law. In God's eyes, it is a matter of taking refuge in Christ and kissing Him. To take refuge in Christ means to believe in Him, and to kiss Him means to love Him. This is according to the divine concept of the New Testament. We need to believe in Christ and to love Christ. By doing this, we are blessed.</P><P>Have you seen the difference between the two concepts in the Psalms? Through one writer, David, two different declarations came out in Psalms 1 and 2. Psalm 1 was a declaration by David, and Psalm 2 was also a declaration by David. Psalm 1 was declared according to his human concept. Psalm 2 was also his declaration, but according to the divine concept. First, the human concept came out of this one speaker. But while he was speaking humanly, the tone changed! Another speaking came out according to the divine concept.</P><P>Many preachers have spoken on Psalm 1, exalting this psalm. But it is hard to find anyone who has spoken properly on Psalm 2. It seems that not many understand Psalm 2. When we read Psalms 1 and 2 in the past, we may have greatly appreciated Psalm 1. How good Psalm 1 was to us! But Psalm 2 may have been placed into the category of portions of Scripture which we did not understand. We all need to see the two kinds of concepts, human and divine, in the Psalms, as seen in Psalms 1 and 2.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Human Concept of the Holy Writers<br>Uplifting the Law as Their Central Emphasis</H2><P>I hope that we would remember these points concerning the human and divine concepts in the book of Psalms. The human concept of the holy writers uplifts the law as their central emphasis to treasure the law and remain in it for their whole life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Divine Concept of the Unveiling God<br>Exalting Christ as His Central Stress</H2><P>The divine concept of the unveiling God exalts Christ as His central stress to turn the holy writers' human concept from the law to Christ according to the divine concept of the divine revelation.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
