   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR SOME MATTERS RELATED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO FULL-TIME SERVICE 3 CHARACTER AND DISPOSITION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In principle, a person s character determines whether he will be successful and effective in his work or activities.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that whatever a person does cannot escape the influence of his character.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The character of a person determines how he conducts himself and how he works.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many of the problems among those serving the Lord are due to their character.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some men have spiritual problems and some have psychological problems.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the most difficult problems are related to a person s character.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, as we learn to serve the Lord, we need to have much fellowship with the Lord and look to Him for His mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consequently, we must deal strictly with our character.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we ourselves do not bear responsibility for dealing with the problems of our character, it will be hard for the Holy Spirit to do anything in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The way we conduct ourselves and the way we do things are related to our character.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot say that the Holy Spirit never interferes and intervenes, but if we expect the Holy Spirit to build up a good character within us, we are seriously mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Holy Spirit does not do this kind of thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even if the Holy Spirit were to do such a thing, He would still require our cooperation, and we would still have to bear a considerable amount of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A brother s problems often lie in his character.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When something is placed in some brothers hands, it is ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whatever they do is neither thorough nor solid.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It seems that no matter what they do, they always leave something for others to finish.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a matter of character or, we can say, a matter of habit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One who serves the Lord should also have an amiable disposition; that is, he should enjoy contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some people by nature like to contact people, but this is useless because it is natural and not of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only what is in resurrection can be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In our service we must be dealt with by God to the extent that we enjoy contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At a minimum, we must deal with ourselves and compel ourselves to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this training there are several brothers from overseas; however, the young serving brothers from Taiwan have not contacted them on an individual basis.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although the young brothers share the same room with the brothers from overseas, eat with them, and live with them day after day, they have not fellowshipped with any of these brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The young brothers from Taiwan do not know the names of those from Hong Kong or how many have come from Indonesia.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is our situation, and it is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not easy for us to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is as if there is a wall through which even the Holy Spirit cannot break.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is incredible that so many young serving brothers take their meals in the same dining hall and receive the same training in the same classroom, yet have no fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These young brothers should realize that the brothers from overseas have come not only to hear some messages but to seek fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Indeed, the young brothers among us have an obligation to have much fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If these young brothers fulfill their obligation, the brothers from overseas will be able to testify that they received more help from their personal fellowship than from their classes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we would receive more breaking and learn to have a proper spiritual disposition, we will receive more grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Among us, grace is not contagious enough and has not spread adequately because we are too isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even when we contact one another, we do so selectively.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We contact only those whom we like.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How will we be able to do things if we continue to be this way?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our disposition makes it impossible for us to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During the training at Kuling from 1948 to 1949, Brother Nee said that in order to be useful in the Lord s hand, one who serves the Lord must be interested in people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When such a person sees people, he likes to study and contact them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When he sees new ones in the meeting, he will contact them and speak with them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One who serves the Lord must have this kind of disposition; otherwise, his service will suffer a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, a new one came to our Lord s table meeting and brought his whole family, yet none of our brothers and sisters went to speak with this family after the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every servant of the Lord must grasp the opportunity to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should come to the meetings early in order to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It does not matter if we come only five or ten minutes early.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should also contact people when the meeting is over.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If every one of us were to contact one person before and after each meeting, each of us would be able to contact two persons every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this way, if we attend three meetings per week, each one of us would be able to contact six people every week.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some may say that this is unnatural.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, if we have an amiable disposition, a disposition that likes to contact people, we would feel that this is both convenient and spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No matter what kind of meeting we are in, we need to contact people after the meeting; moreover, we should not speak with them casually, but we should minister grace to them inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all should have such a disposition one that desires to contact people and know their spiritual condition before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This does not take too much time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Five to ten minutes are sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some brothers or sisters may have to leave immediately after the meeting, but we can walk with them for a distance or see them off to the bus stop.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>While we walk with them, we can talk with them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It does not matter if all we say is, Brother, how are you?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Where do you live?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do not underestimate the effect of such simple words.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sometimes a few simple words are able to give enormous comfort and encouragement to others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Most businessmen realize that business deals are not made in the office but on a tennis court or in a coffee shop.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, when we contact people, we should not be too formal.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our contact with the Lord is one thing, and our contact with people is another.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The former can never replace the latter.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was engaged in contacting both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We cannot find a single case in the Bible in which the Lord went somewhere but did not contact anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He contacted people everywhere He went.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Sometimes, according to God s leading, He withdrew from a certain place to be alone and purposely did not contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Except on such occasions, He was always in contact with people no matter where He went.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Moreover, His preaching was always flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He spoke certain words to certain people at certain times.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>His speaking was never monotonous, dull, or formal.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He contacted people every time and in every place so that He could impart grace to them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>No matter what kind of people they were, He was able to minister grace to them in a timely way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When the Lord Jesus lived on the earth, He contacted both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He was joined to God at all times and in all places, and He also contacted people at every time and in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If everyone among us, regardless of age, learns and exercises to contact people, the church will be greatly blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>On the surface, contacting people seems to be a small thing, but we do not know how many will be brought in as a result.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Many times after the meeting, we see that the saints, regardless of age, simply get up and leave.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We rarely see any two of them linger and share with one another concerning their enjoyment in the meeting or open to one another regarding their personal condition.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is a great weakness and lack among us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>To talk shop means to speak regarding one s line of work.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>What is our line of work?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We have abandoned our future, given up the world, and forsaken fame and reputation.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We are serving the Lord with our time, effort, and energy, yet we do not speak or do things related to our line of work.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Do we really mean it when we say that we are interested in people?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Please observe the saints who have a job.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>After they get off from work, they hurry home, eat something, tidy themselves up, and rush to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In contrast, the full-time serving ones come to the meetings in an unhurried manner and set their watches accurately so that they will arrive at the meeting exactly at the scheduled time, neither late nor early.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Then, like Mary, they enjoy the Lord quietly in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>After the meeting, in the same manner as the working saints, they simply get up and leave.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The working saints do not care about others and neither do the full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I would like to ask: Is this to behave according to our line of work?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we were fishermen and we were unable to catch any fish, we might simply give up, but how can we be unmoved when some of the fish come to us voluntarily and jump into our boats?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When we see the elderly saints, we need to learn from them, and when we see the younger ones, we need to supply them.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The meeting hall is our fishpond those who attend are the fish, and we are the fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Since fishing is our line of work, we should do the work of fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We should not forget our line of work.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It is sad to see that among so many full-time serving ones not many are practicing their trade.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In the church life all the brothers and sisters should learn to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Our heart for the Lord is precious, but our character presents a great problem.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is the reason that our meetings are low and our church life is dead and dull.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We can no longer let ourselves be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We must gird ourselves up.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
