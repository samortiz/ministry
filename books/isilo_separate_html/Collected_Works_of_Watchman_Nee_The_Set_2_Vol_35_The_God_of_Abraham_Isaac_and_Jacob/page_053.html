After Jacob trusted in the power of the Lord and removed all the things that did not glorify Him, he set out on his journey.</p><p>Verses 6 and 7 say, "So Jacob came to Luz which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him. And he built there an altar, and called the place El-bethel; because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother." At that time, Jacob took another step forward. In Shechem he called the place "El-Elohe-Israel." Here he called it "El-bethel." In Shechem he called God the God of Israel, while here he called God the God of Bethel. He advanced from the individual experience to the corporate experience. In Shechem he knew God as the God of Israel. When he reached Bethel, he knew God as the God of His house. When he reached Bethel, he realized that the vessel God is after is a house, a corporate vessel. God was not only his God, but the God of His house. He was brought to a broadened place.</p><p>Thank and praise the Lord that God is not heaping up piles of isolated stones; He is building a house that expresses Him. There must be the corporate testimony before God's goal can be reached. Individuals cannot satisfy God's heart. Even many individuals working for the Lord will not satisfy God's heart. There is the need of a corporate vessel to fulfill God's purpose and satisfy His heart. Our God is the God of Bethel, the God of the church.</p><p>Here God appeared to Jacob once more. This appearance of God in Bethel was different from His previous appearance in Bethel. The previous time God had appeared in a dream. This time He appeared directly. Let us read verses 9 and 10: "And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and blessed him. And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; and he called his name Israel." At Peniel God began to change his name from Jacob to Israel. At Bethel the changing of his name was actually carried out. What began at Peniel was completed in the house of God. At Peniel God dealt with Jacob's natural life. God worked in him and gave him a mortal blow. After Peniel only a mere vestige of his natural life remained; it was no longer as strong as it once was. When he reached Bethel, that which began with his enlightening at Peniel was perfected in the house of God. Having our natural life touched individually is the starting point of Israel, while knowing the Body of Christ in the house of God is the perfection of Israel. The beginning of the experience of Peniel is the enlightening and the stripping of the natural life, while the completion of the experience of Peniel is Bethel, the house of God.</p><p>God said to Jacob, "I am God Almighty" (v. 11). Jacob heard what he did not hear at Peniel. At Peniel Jacob asked God for His name, and God would not tell him. God told him His name here. "I am God Almighty!" This was one of the names God revealed to Abraham when He appeared to him (17:1). God said this to Jacob to show him not only his own impotence, but God's omnipotence. Not only do we have to know our poverty, but we have to know His riches. "Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land" (35:11-12). This shows that God had secured a new vessel in Jacob. Now there was a people who could fulfill God's purpose on earth. After God spoke this, He went up from him (v. 13). When Jacob met God previously, he erected a stone to be a pillar, poured oil on it, and called the name of the place the house of God. At that time, he was afraid and felt that the place was very dreadful. After Jacob met God this time, he set up a pillar of stone and poured oil as well as a drink offering on it (v. 14). A drink offering is an offering of wine; in the Bible it signifies joy. Now Jacob was no longer fearful but joyful. Previously, he felt dreadful when he met God. Now he was joyful when he met God. This shows us that when we are saved, there is a certain taste in our praise of the Lord, and when our flesh is dealt with, there is another taste in our praise of the Lord. The taste of praise which comes after the flesh is dealt with is something which one can never experience prior to being dealt with.</p><h2 class="head2">Dwelling in Hebron</h2><p>Verse 16 says, "And they journeyed from Bethel." Verse 27 says, "And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arba, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned." Jacob had arrived in Hebron. Once he reached this place, God's work in him was completed. From this point on, he dwelt in Hebron, the place where Abraham and Isaac once dwelt. The meaning of Hebron is to remain in the fellowship. It was not only fellowship with God but fellowship with the other members of the Body of Christ.</p><p>Bethel was not the permanent dwelling place for Jacob. Only Hebron was the permanent dwelling place of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This means that we need to know Bethel as the house of God just as we need to know Shechem as the power of God. However, we do not live in the knowledge of the house of God; we live daily in the fellowship of it.</p><p>From that time on, Jacob realized that he could do nothing on his own. Everything had to be done in fellowship, and nothing could be done outside of fellowship. If the flesh is not dealt with, it will never see the importance of fellowship. Many Christians do not seem to need fellowship. They do not need to fellowship with God, and they do not need to fellowship with other children of God. They are this way mainly because their flesh has never been dealt with. The flesh must be dealt with, and one must know the life of Bethel before he realizes that he cannot live outside Hebron, and that he cannot survive without fellowship. The fellowship we are speaking of refers to the life supply of Christ which comes from the other members. When other brothers and sisters supply us with the indwelling Christ and we go forward through the supply of these other members, we have Hebron and fellowship. God's children are very much in need of this.</p><p>If God's children have not been dealt with in their flesh, they cannot know the life of the Body of Christ. They may understand the doctrine about the Body of Christ, and they may even be able to expound it clearly. But if their flesh is not dealt with, they will not know the life of the Body. Once the flesh is dealt with, they will know the life of the Body of Christ. They will see the importance of fellowship, and they will not be able to live apart from the fellowship. They will not be able to be a Christian at all without the other children of God, and they will not be able to receive any supply of life apart from the help of God's children. Brothers and sisters, the Body of Christ is a fact; it is not a doctrine. We cannot live without Christ, and we cannot live without the other Christians.</p><p>We have to ask God to show us that we cannot be Christians by ourselves. We have to live in fellowship with God, and we have to live in fellowship with the Body of Christ. May God lead us on so that we can truly glorify His name. May God gain not only a vessel in Jacob, but a vessel in us as well.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> </body></html>
