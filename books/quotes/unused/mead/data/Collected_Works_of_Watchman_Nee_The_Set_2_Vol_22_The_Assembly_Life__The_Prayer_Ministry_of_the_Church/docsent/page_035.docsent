   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BOUNDARY OF A LOCAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like you to pay attention to the fact that in the New Testament, the boundary of the local church is the city in which that church is located.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hence, the maximum reach of a local church is the city; no boundary can be larger than the city.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Bible we cannot find a church that rules over one province or county.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible shows us that the city is the boundary of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the beginning the city was the community where men aggregated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should remember that in the complicated situation of our modern life, there are many towns and villages.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the beginning, when families bound themselves together and set up protection, there were cities Gen 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Due to various reasons, men began to dwell in cities.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the first half of the book of Genesis, we see no unit smaller than the city.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By the time of Joshua, men still lived in cities.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of course, by then, there were neighboring villages.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Lord Jesus sent the disciples to preach the gospel, He charged them to go into the cities and villages Matt 10:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is because a city or a village is the smallest unit of human habitation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The scriptural boundary of a local church is the boundary of a city.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesus, Corinth, and Thessalonica were all cities.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The boundary of a local church cannot be larger than a city.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Asia was a big area, and it had seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Galatia was a region, and it had churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Corinth was one city, and therefore, the Bible mentions the whole church coming together in one place 1 Cor 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church in Corinth was one church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the other local churches mentioned in the Bible had the city as their boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is God's wise way to preserve the believers from much confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If God were to make the nation the boundary of the church, such a boundary would be changing all the time because nations often fall.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a nation fell, the boundary of the church would be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If God made a province the boundary of the church, the provincial boundaries would change often also.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the boundary of a province changed, the boundary of a church would have to change as well.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Would this not cause some problems?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why God has not made a province the unit of the church, nor has He made a nation or other political units the boundary of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Dynasties, nations, and provinces all change easily.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God has made the city or village the boundary of the church because the names and boundaries of these places do not change easily.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>National boundaries constantly change, and the names of provinces constantly change.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the boundaries and names of cities and villages are least likely to change with political shifts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are least affected by political changes; we can almost say that they are never affected by political changes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In many instances, a village was called by a certain name a few hundred years ago, and it is still called by the same name today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many cities change hands from one nation to another, yet the cities themselves remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The city and to a greater extent the village is the most stable unit politically.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why God ordained the city to be the boundary of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are advantages to God making the city the unit of a local church, separating the churches by the cities, and not establishing higher, supervisory institutions above the cities.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If one local church becomes sinful or has failed, the sin and failure will not affect other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If God placed seven or eight churches under the rule of a few people, as soon as one or two of these few people fell, the seven or eight churches would fall as well.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If God had established a headquarters in Asia to rule over the seven churches, as soon as the headquarters failed, the seven churches would have failed also.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The seven churches in Asia were directly responsible to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although five of them failed and fell, Smyrna and Philadelphia, who served as God's remnant, did not fail.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God did this in order to avoid such danger.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It protects weak and good churches from infiltration by sin and improper things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE DETERMINATION OF BOUNDARY BY THE CITY</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The concept of the city was not originally in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the beginning God created the garden of Eden, but it was not a city.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the end God will gain the New Jerusalem a city.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, the concept of a city came in after man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before man fell, everything, including the tree of life and all the fruits, was in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The living water flowed out of the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After man fell, God's work was changed from a garden to a city.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A garden does not seem to have a boundary; there is no protection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God made the city for the purpose of protection, so that there were city walls for its boundary and it could be separated from other things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This separation keeps sin out.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Not only does God care for the city today, in the millennium His concern will be only for the city.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the future, some will rule over five cities, while others will rule over ten cities.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Not only will God care for the city in the millennium, but He will care for the city even in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then there will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God exalts the city because a city has a boundary which separates it from other places.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This distinction has less likelihood of confusion, and it is easy to manage.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although we have said that the church sometimes takes a village as its boundary, a village is a miniature city in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God's concept is still the city.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When there are a few believers meeting in a city, that meeting becomes the local church in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Another church from another city cannot come and interfere with this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The boundary of the church in a city is the boundary of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The boundary of a local church is determined by the political boundary of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God has not left the decision of the boundary of a local church to the brothers or the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The responsibility of the church is to follow the division of the government and to take the political boundary as the boundary of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The sphere of a local church is as big as the political boundary of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There are big cities and small cities.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A city as big as Nineveh took three days to circle once Jonah 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But a city like Jerusalem is only six miles in radius.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Bethany is a place which does not belong to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Jerusalem is next to Bethany John 11:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Jerusalem is a city; it has its boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Bethany is a village; it also has its boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the way the Bible distinguishes the churches according to the political boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Although some places are big and some places are small, the church cannot mark its boundary according to its own idea; it must mark it according to the political division.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God has not given the church the liberty to have its own way.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God uses the boundary established by the government.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the basis that the church should accept today.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There is no need to have another way.</S>
