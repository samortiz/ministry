   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Experiences Telling Us That Our Evaluation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Believers in the Church Has Turned Out</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Quite Often to Be the Opposite</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Experiences tell us that our evaluation of the believers in the church has turned out quite often to be the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may think that a certain brother is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, he may not turn out the way that we think he will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may feel that he is good material to be an elder, but after five years he may no longer be attending the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may not think much of another brother, but five years later this brother may become very promising and useful in the Lord's hands.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those of us who have been elders for a while have experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Who is the best material to be an elder?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even after many years of serving the Lord, I would say that I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am saying all of this to show us that we should not trust our own evaluation of people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE ELDERS, ON THE ONE HAND,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>HAVING THE CLEAR SIGHT OVER THE PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>WITH MUCH DISCERNMENT, AND</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>ON THE OTHER HAND,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BEING BLIND SPIRITUALLY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders, on the one hand, should have the clear sight over the people with much discernment, and on the other hand, they should be blind spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Isaiah 11 tells us how Christ carries out God's administration in this way: "He will neither judge by what His eyes see,/Nor decide by what His ears hear./But He will judge the poor in righteousness, / And decide with equity for the afflicted of the land" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3b-4a .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He does not judge by what He sees or hears.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With the poor ones, He exercises His righteousness, and with the suffering, afflicted ones, He decides with equity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This shows us that regardless of what we see or hear about others, we should not forget what our responsibility is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our responsibility is to minister Christ to them just as Christ only ministers righteousness to the poor and equity to the afflicted.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not care much for others' position and condition.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Regardless of their condition, we should still minister Christ to them with Christ's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this we must be persons who are thoroughly dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must be persons who are thoroughly transfused and permeated with God, persons full of the Spirit as Christ was.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we contact people, we should not care for what we see about them or hear about them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must take care of our business to minister Christ with His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whether someone is a "Zaccheus" or an "immoral woman of Samaria," we should do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The only difference is the way we would take with each case.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The goal of ministering Christ is still the same.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Often because of what we see and hear, we become frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We forget to minister Christ with His salvation to people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We pay too much attention to what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Suppose a backslidden brother comes to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we still remember and are deeply impressed with his backsliding, this remembrance will reduce our usefulness in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should forget about his backsliding.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is still a brother, and our duty, our business, in our eldership is to minister Christ to him.</S>
