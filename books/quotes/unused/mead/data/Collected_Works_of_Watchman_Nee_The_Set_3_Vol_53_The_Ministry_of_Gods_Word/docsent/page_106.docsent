   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When we stand up to speak for the Lord, our mind must be pliable and open to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Only then will we know what God is trying to do.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must be prepared mentally to meet all unexpected circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While we are speaking, we should test the Holy Spirit to find out whether our speaking is in the right direction.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should test our own spirit and test God's Spirit as well.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we find that there is some amount of release of the spirit after a few words, we should exercise our mind to facilitate the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may find that the spirit becomes more released when we speak a certain sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should speak more along this line to release more of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While we are speaking, our mind should be keen to touch the high point in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once our mind touches the high point, we should be ready to speak another sentence to release the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A third and fourth sentence, which will release the spirit further, should follow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, whenever the word comes to a point where the spirit is released, the mind should not turn in another direction, and the speaking should not move away.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The mind and the word must move along the same line.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more one speaks, the more the anointing flows, and the more the spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word will become stronger and stronger until it reaches the climax in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sometimes the climax in the spirit coincides with the climax in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But sometimes they do not fall in the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes the spiritual climax comes before the word has reached its climax.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can do nothing about this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if the climax of the speaking has come and the climax of the spirit has not, we have to consider what needs to be done in order to release the spirit in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to exercise the utmost care at such a juncture.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is as if we were looking for a lost needle, probing in every direction as with a magnet.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the magnet comes close to the needle, the needle will be swooped up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A speaker has to test with his words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the spirit does not move when he speaks one way, he has to change.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the spirit remains quiet after he tries another way, he has to change again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He has to watch when the spirit begins to move.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>An experienced person will know as soon as the spirit moves at his word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As soon as the right word is uttered, he has a registration within that he has said the right thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It may be a very fine and delicate move, yet he knows.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As he speaks with his mind, he is testing whether or not the Spirit likes his utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Spirit approves his speaking, he may have a very faint sense initially.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But as he pursues along the same line, the spirit will be released more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At this juncture, his mind should direct his words along this line and strengthen his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He must not turn in a different direction.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He should move his speaking in the same direction.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more the word continues in this same direction, the more the spirit is released, and the more he will touch the spiritual climax of his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to learn to test the Spirit with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to know what kind of word brings out the climax of the Spirit and what kind of word frustrates it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more we touch the peak, the more the spirit will flow, and the more anointing there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more our word hits the right spot, the more anointing we will have, and the more our word will bring us to the spiritual climax, the apex.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we sense the Lord's Spirit and blessing, we can be assured that we have touched the heart of our speaking; this is the spiritual climax of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If our spirit is strong, we can sustain this climax for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If our spirit is not that strong, we will have to turn after a while; otherwise, the climax will shrivel away.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The length of time depends on how strong our spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the spirit is strong, the climax can be sustained for a longer time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the spirit is not strong, the climax will fade away quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot try to sustain it by force.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is entirely a matter of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the spirit is gone and the word is left to itself, the speaker should terminate his speaking on this point.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For this reason, our mind must be in focus and be pliable before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It must be absolutely in focus, and it must also be absolutely pliable.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It must be so focused that it is aware of nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet, at the same time, it must be so gentle that it can accommodate any unexpected event.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should be on the alert that the mind does not become so rigid that we fail to touch the Lord's present word and His climax.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our mind has to be exercised to catch up with God's word and the Spirit's move.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we do this, our word will catch up with the climax of the spirit when we function in the ministry of the word.</S>
