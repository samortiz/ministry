   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Deliverance from the Fallen Aspect</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Death of the Created Aspect</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why did Boaz choose to redeem Ruth?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The answer to this question can be found in Romans 7:2-4.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 2 says, The married woman is bound by the law to her husband while he is living; but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law regarding the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among all of Boaz s relatives, Ruth was the only relative in the land of Israel whose husband had died and who sought to claim her right; thus, Boaz had to redeem her.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If our husband had not died, Christ could not do anything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because our husband, as part of the old creation and Adam, has died, Christ can become our Redeemer and our Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Inheriting the Possession</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From this we see that the Moabite aspect of us is our fallen aspect, whereas the aspect of us that is of the same family as Boaz typifies the aspect created in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The death of the husband typifies that our old man, our natural created aspect, must enter into death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Boaz became Ruth s husband, and Ruth became one with him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All Boaz had was hers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, David the king issued out of them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This typifies that they begot Christ and brought Christ into mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ruth and Boaz, inheriting their lawful blessing together, typify Christ and we becoming one to inherit our lawful blessing together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the story of the redemption of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church is a group of people who were originally created by God and related to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, because of the fall, they acquired the element of Moab.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then they were delivered from their fallen position and the element of Moab when their old husband, their created part, died.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This provided an opportunity for Christ to come in to join Himself to this people and become one with them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They became the counterpart of Christ to inherit the lawful blessing of God with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must bear in mind these five points: 1 the created aspect, the aspect of the husband; 2 the fallen aspect, the aspect of Moab; 3 the need to be delivered from the position of a Moabitess; 4 our husband, our created aspect, needing to die; and 5 Boaz Christ needing to be added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ must replace our old husband and become our new Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through the experience of these points, the church is redeemed to be the counterpart of Christ and to be one with Christ to inherit the lawful blessing of God, the blessing given by God to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This blessing is to reign with Christ in the future and to rule over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Abigail Typifying the Warring Church</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>in the Midst of Sufferings</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>David is the most thorough type of Christ revealed in the Old Testament, covering the longest period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The New Testament also clearly reveals that David typifies Christ Matt 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, David s wife is a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>David had at least three wives: one was Michal, Saul s daughter 1 Sam 18:27b , and one was Ahinoam 25:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These two, however, do not possess any features typifying the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only Abigail v. 42 possesses a feature typifying the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>David typifies the warring Christ in the midst of sufferings; thus, his wife Abigail typifies the warring church in the midst of sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From 1 Samuel 25 onward, Abigail was always at the side of David the warrior and followed him in his wars.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, she typifies the warring church, fighting for God s kingdom in the midst of sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the feature of Abigail as a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Both Ruth and Abigail had a previous husband.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ruth s previous husband shows that our old man is of the same family as Christ, and Abigail s previous husband shows how evil our old man is in forsaking Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Abigail s previous husband was Nabal, which means fool 25:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nabal despised, rejected, and opposed David at the time of his destitution vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This typifies that our nature rejects Christ, despises Christ, and opposes Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day, however, Nabal was struck down, and he died.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This provided Abigail the opportunity to become David s wife.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This indicates that when our corrupted nature, which forsook Christ, rejected Christ, and despised Christ, was struck down, we became Christ s counterpart who follows Him in the midst of sufferings, fighting for the kingdom of God.</S>
