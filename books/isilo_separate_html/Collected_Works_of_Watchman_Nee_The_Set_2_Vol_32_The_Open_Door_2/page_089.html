Any correspondence or publications should be mailed to the address above. I arrived safely through the Lord's leading and am full of thanksgiving! The meeting hall in Bai-Ya-Tan is only a mile or so from my home. I rejoice at the fact that I can meet with the brothers and sisters all the time and fellowship with them. My work has not been too busy, but I ask that you pray much for me so that I will not encounter temptations but will express the fragrance of the knowledge of Christ everywhere I go and glorify His name in all things. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Fang Jia-je, February 8</p><h2 class="head2">Tseng-Mao, Fukien Province</h2><p>I have received every issue of The Open Door. The news in every issue makes me realize the infinite love of the Lord. We thank and praise the Lord for the meeting here in the villages! He has sent His faithful servant to work here. Please pray that the Lord will give us deeper edification and raise up responsible brothers and sisters from the church to strive together for the furtherance of the gospel so that we will not be ashamed in the future. The brothers and sisters have been preserved by the Lord and are living in peace. May glory and praise be to our blessed Lord. Enclosed please find X dollars for The Open Door.</p><p>A weak brother in the meeting in Tseng-Mao,<br />Chuang Wen-shien, February 27</p><h2 class="head2">Wan-An-Chiao, Chekiang Province</h2><p>The Lord has been gracious to us young and weak children in the recent work in the churches in Nan-Sha. He has gathered us as a hen gathers chicks under her wings. The political situation is becoming more and more tense. There were large-scale bombings from February 17-22. All the major towns and cities in Nan-Sha, such as Nan-Yang, Tou-Peng, Gua-Li, and Zhe-Shan sustained high casualties, and much damage was done to the houses. But God has been protecting the believers in a special way. Not one of our hairs was hurt. An older brother, Mr. Shen Chi-jin, was a guest at a shoe store last Thursday in Nan-Yang. There was a bombing that day, and many were tragically killed. During the critical moments, Mr. Shen knelt down by the bed with his daughter and grandchild and prayed, and they hid themselves in the bosom of the Lord. A bomb dropped into the house about six or seven feet away from where they were praying. The house collapsed, and four or five houses next door were turned into rubble, but the brother walked slowly out of the rubble with his daughter and grandchild. They were not hurt at all! This was truly an act of God's love.</p><p>Wang You-gen, Chan Chung-yau</p><h2 class="head2">Chen-Hsia-Kuan, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Enclosed please find X dollars for the publication work of the Gospel Book Room and X dollars for distribution to the brothers in need. We are situated in the border area of Chekiang province and have not been able to communicate much with churches in other places because of its geography. Thank the Lord for the publication of The Open Door, which shows us God's work in every place and tells us of the news and excellent footsteps of all the servants and brothers of the Lord. Our narrow views have been expanded to see the churches of God, and we have been broadened to participate in the communion and supplication of the members. How we thank the Lord for this! Our church began seven or eight years ago. By the grace of God a few dozen people have been saved through us. The Lord's servants have not been able to come because of inaccessibility. As a result we have received little edification, and our spiritual life is immature. We hope that you will pray for us! Brother Hsu Dah-wei came with Brother Chou Shing-yi some time ago. They went to Tai-Shun three months ago to join Brother Chang Kwang-rong. They are now in Ma-Jan. Last Sunday night the town of Ma-Jan experienced a fire, and the shops of four or five brothers were burned. Thank the Lord! Although the possessions were lost, the brothers are still rejoicing in the Lord. Brother Chou Shing-yi has gradually recovered his health. Thank the Lord!</p><p>The church in Chen-Hsai-Kuan,<br />Wu Tze-tzien, Lee Si-ming, Chang Jun-tze</p><h2 class="head2">Makassak, Dutch Southeast Asia</h2><p>Under the Lord's leading we boarded a steamer on December 24 from Kulangsu and arrived safely in Makassak on January 5. On arrival we took lodging temporarily at the house of Mr. Yao. We are learning before the Lord to trust in His leading for our future and our business. May the Lord accomplish His work in His children. We ask all the brothers and sisters who are burdened to pray to remember us weak and useless ones. There are many lovers of the Lord in the denominations here. Unfortunately, they all lack the feeding of the pure milk of the word. May the Lord of the work send His servants so that His testimony can be raised up quickly, the life of the immature ones will grow, and many sinners will be saved from the authority of Satan. May God have mercy on this place.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Hsi Shih-chuan, Yao Ke-ju, January 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_088.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_090.html">Next</a> </body></html>
