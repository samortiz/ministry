   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This leads us to an important question which needs our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the work of the Holy Spirit within man?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What do we know about His engraving work in man?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must realize that the Spirit of God not only resides in man but is doing an engraving and constituting work in man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This constituting work of the Holy Spirit is something that can never be erased.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Holy Spirit is in man and is one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now He is engraving something into man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should never consider that the Holy Spirit s indwelling is like a guest taking hospitality in someone else s house, residing for ten or twenty years and then leaving everything in the same condition when he leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No. The Holy Spirit does an engraving, building, and constituting work in man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Little by little the Holy Spirit constitutes the Lord s character in man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even a house takes on the characteristics of its occupants after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The enduement of gifts upon a person may not produce any change in the person, but the indwelling of the Holy Spirit will surely manifest heavenly character traits when the Spirit bears fruit in man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The very fruit of the Spirit is the changes that are produced in a man s character.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God reconstitutes man s character through the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Spirit operates in man s mind, He changes man s mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the Spirit operates in man s feelings, He changes man s feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Spirit operates in man s opinions and judgments, He changes man s opinions and judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Holy Spirit works and constitutes something in man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The result of this work is a change in man s character.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul did not serve as a minister of God s word merely because he afforded the Spirit the freedom to speak through him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit actually took up his very character.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fruit of the Spirit in the Divine Trinity is the very product produced in man s character.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit operates in man, a little today and a little more tomorrow, engraving and trimming more and more each day, until a certain character emerges.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This character is distinctly man s, yet at the same time, it is distinctly a work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The character fully belongs to man, yet at the same time, it is fully begotten of the Holy Spirit; it is the result of the Spirit s work in man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Spirit builds up something in man, there is a transforming change in man from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must realize that transformation is a basic truth as well as a fundamental experience in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Philippians 3 speaks of one kind of fundamental experience, and 2 Corinthians 3 speaks of another kind of fundamental experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We readily admit that our flesh will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But at the same time, we believe that the Lord will transform us; He will create a new character in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit of the Lord does not reside in us like a man residing in a house; He is in us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is unthinkable that the Lord could dwell in a man, being his life for ten or twenty years, yet the man would remain unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Lord s Spirit abides in us and becomes our life, our mind, feelings, judgments, and opinions all have to change.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our heart and spirit have to change.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Formerly there was nothing within us except the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now the cross has dealt with the flesh and overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is a new constitution and new fruit in our feelings, thoughts, and judgments, as well as in our heart and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What then is the constitution of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is what results from God s building and constituting work within man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will never go away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should realize that the Lord s work within man is always solid, firm, and unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul received mercy from the Lord again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord continued to work in him until he became a faithful one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His faithfulness refers to his attitude towards his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He admitted that he did not have the Lord s commandment, yet he told the Corinthians his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His opinion was the result of the constitution of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul s words were no ordinary inspiration; they were the issue of an inward constitution by God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the end, these words of constitution became words of inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is amazing!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When a man is under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, he is conscious of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When a man speaks under the constitution of the Holy Spirit, he may not have the consciousness that God is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He may feel that he is speaking and expressing his own opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But because the constitution of the Holy Spirit has been wrought into him, his words become the words of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the reason that Paul said, I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need the constitution of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need the Spirit s engraving work upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need Him to work on us to the extent that our opinions, words, thoughts, and feelings no longer contradict God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When this happens, we are qualified to be a minister of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The character which the Holy Spirit constitutes within man is different from person to person.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul s preaching carried his distinctive features.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Peter s message carried his distinctive flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His Epistles are very different in style from Paul s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>John s writings are also different from others writings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Everyone has his own style.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The styles are personal.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yet it is an amazing fact that the Spirit would take up the style of those who have been constituted by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If the sixty-six books of the Bible were all one style, the Bible would be very dull indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God s glory is manifested in man s various styles.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This can only happen when there is the constitution of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A word may be uttered in different ways, but it remains the word of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When a man submits to the discipline of the Holy Spirit, he is given the freedom to express his characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>No two items in God s creation are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Every blade of grass is different.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Every tree is different.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>No two faces are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The glory of one star is different from the glory of another star.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the same way, the constitution of the Holy Spirit is different in different people.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Paul was full of the love of the Spirit, and so was John.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But those who have been taught by God know that the Spirit s love as manifested in Paul was different from that which was manifested in John.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They each expressed the love of the Holy Spirit, but in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God does not need uniformity.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Everyone has his own characteristics, and the constitution of the Holy Spirit is different in everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Brothers, do not misunderstand me.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I am not saying that we can all follow the example of 1 Corinthians 7.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the whole Bible, only 1 Corinthians 7 presents such a noble example.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If the Lord has no leading for us to speak in this way, however, it is a gross error for us to speak this way.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>First Corinthians 7 shows us the kind of person Paul was.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This helps us to understand the books of Ephesians, Colossians, Romans, and Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>First Corinthians 7 reveals the person of Paul; it shows us the person who wrote Ephesians, Galatians, etc. We know that the book of Colossians is very high, but 1 Corinthians 7 tells us about the person who wrote Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Romans contains a clear exposition of the gospel, but 1 Corinthians 7 tells us about the person who wrote Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This is what makes 1 Corinthians 7 precious.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In this chapter we clearly see a man whose feelings, thoughts, opinions, and words were worthy of God s trust.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When God s word was put into him, this word became the highest revelation; it did not suffer any corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If we did not have 1 Corinthians 7, we could only know what the Holy Spirit had done through Paul; we would not know what the Holy Spirit had done in Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>First Corinthians 7 shows us a man whose feelings, thoughts, and words are all trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When God s word came upon this man, there was no frustration to the word, just as there was no frustration during those times when God s word was not active in such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If we are not trustworthy, we become a frustration even when we have God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The Lord cannot commit His revelation and light to some because they are not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He cannot acknowledge them as ministers of the word because their thoughts, feelings, opinions, and words are not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Brothers, some of Paul s Epistles, like Romans, Galatians, and Colossians, show us high revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>His Epistle to the Ephesians even shows us the highest revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Yet in the two Epistles to the Corinthians, we find the kind of person to whom God would commit His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Paul was qualified to receive these revelations because of the kind of person he was.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If we only had his other Epistles, without having 1 Corinthians 7, we would not know the kind of person Paul was.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>He was a faithful and trustworthy person.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>That is the reason that God s revelation did not suffer any corruption in him.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In fact, there was so much glory in his constitution that his style was adopted to perfect God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Paul s personality and idiomatic expressions all contributed to God s word; they made the latter more glorious and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>What a glory that man can be used by God and that his human elements can be used by Him without compromising the perfection of God s word, but instead enhancing its glory, riches, and perfection!</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>May God be merciful to us so that He can use us and release His word through us.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>No need is greater today than the need for the word.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>May all the brothers see that there is a pathway that must be followed in order to be a minister of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We have to beseech God to grant us much light, word, and inner dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We need deep and profound dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We need to be molded deeply, inwardly, and thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Even our most delicate feelings have to be faithful to God.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>When these feelings are expressed, they will be regarded as the Lord s very own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>When our inclinations are expressed, they will be regarded as the result of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Our own love and patience will flow out, yet this love and patience will be the fruit of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>This fruit will be the result of the frequent, deep, and thorough work of the Holy Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Through His operation in us we can bear this fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>When we are constituted with the Holy Spirit, fruit is expressed in a spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Brothers, as the Holy Spirit performs His work in us and as we are being reconstituted by the Spirit, our feelings spontaneously become the Spirit s feelings, our thoughts become His thoughts, and our opinions become His opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>When this happens, God will commit His word to us and allow us to transmit it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Others will acknowledge it as God s word, and God will receive the greatest glory.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>The fundamental question today is whether or not God can commit Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>We have to see that the problem is not with His word but with the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Without the ministers, there is no word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Today God is still speaking just as He did in earlier days.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>He has no intention of annulling the prophetic ministry in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Neither does He have the intention of removing the teaching ministry or the evangelistic ministry from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>The biggest problem today is the scarcity of ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Whether or not there is ministry in the church and whether or not this ministry can be multiplied depend on us; the responsibility is on our shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>May we awake to the fact that the poverty and darkness of the church are related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>May we pledge to the Lord solemnly, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>I am willing to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Break me so that Your word can get through in me.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>May the Lord be gracious to us.</S>
