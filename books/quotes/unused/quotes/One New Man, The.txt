When people spoke concerning the world, they referred mainly to the world around the Mediterranean Sea under the Roman Empire
To see brothers and sisters who represent so many nations of the world stirs up my burden to minister on the one new man
We all have to admit that since the time of the apostles until at least the sixteenth century the church was going downward
By reading church history, you could realize that before Zinzendorf, no one was so clear concerning the church practice
Their practice was a great improvement over that which was practiced under the leadership of Zinzendorf at Bohemia
They began to drop the English term 'church,' because they realized that it had been damaged through wrong usage
At that time fallen Christianity considered the church to be a physical building, perhaps with a 'high tower' and a bell
Even today many parents say to their children on Sunday morning Let us go to church referring to the wood the stone the brick and the glass
Verse 19 mentions the household, while verse 22 says that we are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit
Spiritually speaking, all of God's children at the same time are both God's family and also God's dwelling place
From the assembly, the gathering of God's called ones, they went on to the family of God, the household, and to the habitation of God
Some Christian teachers say that the Body of Christ is merely a parable illustrating how close we are to Christ
You may consider the vine tree in John 15 as a parable, but you cannot say that the church being the Body of Christ is a parable
In the Greek text, the new man here is the same phrase that is used in 2:15-'that He might create the two in Himself into one new man'
In the same chapter, chapter four of Ephesians, this word is used at least twice-a full-grown man and a new man
An assembly may be a group of people having different lives, but a household is a number of persons having the same life of one father
When the members of a family are happy, they stay together, but when they are unhappy they may fight and depart from one another
If you have only seen that the church is an assembly, when you are happy you will stay but when you do not feel happy, you will leave
Even in the household it is the same; once you are unhappy with another member of the family, you may decide to leave
Today many Christians are talking about the Body, but what they are speaking may not be real in their practice
If you would say that you cannot be here because this is not the Body, either you are wrong or the group with which you meet is wrong
In the Body to love one another is a little different from loving one another in the assembly and in the household
If you do have the burden to serve and you do see what the church is, you will have the desire to participate in the church service
As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life; whereas as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person
Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all'
The record of the Old Testament is a record of the old man, and the record of the New Testament is the record of the new man
According to the entire revelation of the Bible, God's intention is to have a man for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose
Chapter three of Genesis begins to speak of the fall of man, but it does not show us the significance of man's fall
After the flood, mankind was divided into nations and was also scattered in different directions to different lands
Different families, different genealogies, different languages, and different lands eventually issued in different nations
By the time of Acts 2 the Triune God had passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
When the time came for the church to be brought forth, they were all gathered together, and in that gathering the church was produced
Ephesians 2:13 says, 'But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have become near in the blood of Christ'
Verse 14 says, 'For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity'
His heaven only covered the Mediterranean and Mesopotamian lands; our heaven today covers all the continents, the entire globe
Human history spans almost six thousand years-four thousand years before Christ and two thousand years after Christ
The first major event of history in the last two thousand years was the founding and establishment of the Roman Empire
Before Christ was born, the Roman Empire was founded to prepare the way for the gospel to be spread to all the peoples under heaven
It was the Roman Empire that made the Greek language the international language of all the peoples around the Mediterranean Sea
When the time came that the gospel should be preached, all the peoples around the Mediterranean were prepared to understand one language
Not only was there the traffic on the Mediterranean Sea, but also there were the highways built on the land by the Roman Empire
By that time the language was ready, the empire was unified, the highways were built, and the peaceful order was maintained
Within less than fifty years the gospel was preached to all the nations under the heaven around the Mediterranean Sea
The reformation of the church and the discovery of the new land liberated man's mentality which had been imprisoned under Catholicism
Through science and industry 'isms' such as capitalism, socialism, and, eventually due to overproduction, imperialism came into being
For the replacement of the old man, the new man must be constituted with every people, every tribe, and every nation
One hundred fifty years ago the Americans and Europeans who went to China were considered by the Chinese to be foreign devils
One hundred fifty years ago some unlearned Chinese came to this country and were looked down upon by the white people
Through these two wars God raised up the United States to be the leading nation and the number one power on the earth
Today we have jet airlines, radio, television, satellites, and telephones not just for domestic calls but also for international calls
By plane today the trip between these cities is very quick, but at that time we had no other way but to take a steamboat
Paul did not have a brother among the American Indians, but in the new man today we do have brothers and sisters from among the Indians
When this new man is perfected, that will be the time of the Lord's coming, and the perfected new man will be the bride
If we would see the vision of the new man, all the ordinances, rituals, different opinions, and all differences will be gone
If we all saw the new man, we would all realize that in the new man all these things have no place, and Christ is all and in all
Such a vision will not only keep us in oneness, but also will deliver us and rescue us from all things other than Christ
Before the time of Columbus, human culture was merely around the Mediterranean Sea, but from this sea, human culture expanded to the ocean
God has brought human culture from the sea to the ocean and above the ocean to the skies for the purpose of perfecting the new man
Before Christ there were four thousand years, and after Christ until now there have been almost two thousand years
The Roman Empire not only prepared the way for the spreading of the gospel, but it also helped in the formation of the gospel
The gospel was formed and accomplished by Christ's death, and Christ's death was through the crucifixion carried out by the Roman Empire
In this way the Roman Empire was used by God, not only for the spreading of the gospel, but also for the formation of the gospel
We need to have the heavenly sight with which to see human history, not from the human point of view but from the divine point of view
When Abraham was called and moved to Canaan on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea, culture went on from the two rivers to the sea
God used the Roman Empire in the formation of the gospel, and afterwards, God used the Roman Empire for the spreading of the glad tidings
Within less than a half century the gospel was spread to 'every nation under heaven' , the countries around the Mediterranean Sea
Although the Roman Empire was actually against God, it was unknowingly used by God for the formation and spreading of the gospel
It was through these two accomplishments that the European culture was carried to other continents, including America and Asia
From the time that the British navy defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, Britain became the leading power on the earth
Britain became Great Britain, and was called the nation without sunset, for throughout the whole earth there were British colonies
Great Britain maintained a peaceful order over the world for the spreading of the gospel in the way of Protestantism
God raised up Britain for His purpose, to send His gospel to Asia, Africa, and many other places, without the dark influence of Catholicism
If China had been too much influenced by Catholicism, the Lord's recovery could not have had such a start there
Britain was not so useful for this end, so through the two world wars, God somewhat put Britain down and raised up the United States
Britain defeated Spain and became the leading power of the world for the spreading of the gospel to every corner of this earth
Since the new immigration law, many thousands have come from China, Italy, Greece, the Philippines, India, and other nations
Geographically speaking, the Lord has raised up a country for His purpose in the very center of the whole inhabited earth
Russia tried as well to use the Suez Canal to get into the Indian Ocean, but God again used Britain and Egypt to close the way
Later, the czars attempted to build the Siberian railway to provide access to the Pacific Ocean, but were not able to
The czars were happy because they had gained access to the Pacific, but they were later driven out of Manchuria in the Russo-Japanese War
Colossians 3:11 says that no one has any place in this new man, but in the unity of ecumenism everything and everyone is there
The life-giving Spirit, Christ, is now in our spirit, and these two spirits mingle together to form the spirit of the mind
Our minds are being renewed through our realization that Christ as the life-giving Spirit is mingled with our human spirit
It is uncommon today to hear a message concerning the mingled spirit or on being renewed in the spirit of the mind
Today is the day to have a new man constituted with all the local churches, including all the saints as one in Christ, who is all and in all
Even certain Bible translators, who were scholars, were veiled in their understanding by the natural and religious concept
In the natural concept of the translators there was not such a thing as to put off the old man and to put on the new man
We must drop the natural concepts which we picked up in our background; these become frustrations, veils, to our understanding of the Bible
Ephesians 422 and 24 speak of the old man and the new man but according to chapter two verse 15 of the same book the new man is corporate
It is also not merely that we have the proper church life, the local church established according to the New Testament economy
All these are proper, but God's intention in His New Testament economy is to have a new man to replace the old man
It is possible for God to save many souls and for many Christians to attain to a certain level of spirituality
Among the believers there are many negative, disappointing, and discouraging elements, and almost no genuine oneness
The Lord today is going to raise up His believers throughout all the world, in so many countries, to seek after Him
What He has been doing, and what He is now doing, is bringing forth the new man with Himself as the life and person
We should all be willing, once a church is established, to follow the Lord's leading to go to still another place
According to traditional teaching, Christ is merely objective and in the heavens to be worshipped, adored, and praised
We are experiencing, enjoying, and partaking of a very subjective Christ who is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit
Wherever you go on this earth, regardless of what kind of people or what kind of language is there, you will hear the same thing
Many have been distracted from Christ to other things, including scriptural, fundamental, and so-called spiritual things
The churches will progress in the divine life to such an extent that eventually we all will be absolutely the same
We do not care for long hair or for short hair, but eventually we will all be the same, even in our cutting of our hair
A brother will know how long his hair should be, not by following another brother, but by fellowshipping with Christ who is his life
We will express the same thing, we will speak the same thing, and we will have one mind and one mouth, glorifying our God and Father
We will be there with Him to rule over the earth to express our Father, the very God, and to exercise His dominion
As a physical person we have two images; one is the physical image, and the other is the intangible, but visible image
Through the Ten Commandments, God revealed Himself as the righteous God, as the holy God, as the loving God, and as the God full of light
Today as the new man the church bears the image of God, that is, God's righteousness, holiness, love, and light
As long as we live Christ out, taking Him as our person, we are expressing righteousness, holiness, love, and light
Such a new man with such an expression will usher in the kingdom of God and will bring Christ, the King, back to this earth
In other words, the man created by God to fulfill His purpose was absolutely destroyed, thus becoming useless in the hands of God
He lived on this earth and died an all-inclusive death on the cross to deal with every negative thing in the universe
In His death on the cross He abolished the enmity between the races, the forms or ways of living and worship, the ordinances
The different ways of living or ordinances became a strong enmity between the races, especially between the Jews and the Gentiles
God created the one new man on the cross, but practically speaking this one new man has not come into existence
The baptism in the Spirit is the first step needed for the one new man, which has already been created, to come into existence
He ascended into heaven and was enthroned there, being made the Lord of all , not only with His divinity but also with His humanity
Our race, our rank in society, our natural background, and our natural position were all buried when we were baptized in the Spirit
Through the baptism in the Spirit all of us become one Body, and our races, nationalities, and social ranks are over
The baptism of the whole Body of Christ in the Holy Spirit is something which is already accomplished and still exists
We are enjoying the baptism in the Spirit and we are in the Spirit, but to drink of the Spirit is another matter
Baptism is to put us into the water; then after being baptized, we have to get the water into us continuously all the time
In order to be healthy, in the evening the water should envelop the skin, and in the morning the skin should envelop the water
For the created one new man to come into existence there is the need of these two stepsto become enveloped in water and to envelop the water
If a person were to stay in a bathtub full of water for thirty days and never drink any water, he would be in serious trouble
We do not just need an outward baptism, but an inward, constant, and instant drinking of the Spirit into our very inward being
It is so hard to pass on the gospel to those of the Arab culture because of the way they were raised up and educated
The Americans are noted for their quick disposition, while the Chinese are very considerate and cautious in what they do
Our national and even natural mentality was educated and built up according to our racial and cultural background
Due to the scientific inventions and the political situations on this earth, the many nationalities and cultures have been brought together
In order for this to happen we must have a thorough, proper, and adequate renewal of our mind which has been built up by our nationality
In America the young people are trained and educated to act independently and also to be ambitious to attain to the highest position
For the new man to come into full existence there is the need of a situation or condition where no one desires to be a leader
You may not need to be an elder because there is someone who could bear the burden for the church in this capacity better than you
You should have the attitude that this is the Lord's recovery and that the burden you are bearing is not your position
We all want to see the Lord go on in His recovery and all the members functioning in the Body according to His pleasure
Colossians 3:10 tells us that the new man is 'being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him'
Such a mind influences our emotion to love the Lord, and the loving emotion effects our will to choose the Lord
Not only is there no natural person in the new man, but there is no possibility, no room, for any natural person
In the eyes of God, the one new man was created two thousand years ago on the cross, in Christ, of two peoples-the Jews and the Gentiles
The creation of the one new man was completed on the cross, but before Pentecost this one new man had still not come into existence
In the last chapter we saw that the first step needed for the existence of the one new man is the baptism in the Spirit
On the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius , Christ as the Head of the Body baptized all the members in one Spirit into one Body
All the different races and people with all different ranks have been put into the Spirit that they all may be one Body
Revelation 5:9 tells us that Christ has purchased to God by His blood 'men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation'
On the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius, Christ as the Head of the Body put all these chosen and called ones into one Body
The baptism in the Spirit was accomplished once for all, but the daily drinking of the one Spirit is still going on
Ephesians 2:15 tells us that the new man was created on the cross, yet Ephesians 4:22 tells us that we have to put off the old man
Because the new man in Ephesians is corporate, the old man, in the same principle, must also be a corporate man
We need to put off the old man not by being taught corrected trained educated or instructed but by being renewed in the spirit of our mind
To be drunk with wine is to be filled in the body, whereas to be filled in the spirit is to be filled with Christ unto the fullness of God
To drink of the Spirit is to open ourselves to the Lord by praying to Him, calling upon His name, and fellowshipping with Him
The more we drink of the Spirit, the more He fills us with Himself, and the more He saturates our mind to renew it for transformation
We have to pray, to fellowship with the Lord, to call on His name, and even to make a thorough confession of our sins
In the new man Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, and freeman have no place
Not only is there no natural person in the new man, but there is no possibility, no room, for any natural person
For people from different races and cultures to get saved is much easier than being renewed concerning their way of living
Romans 12:2 says, 'Be transformed by the renewing of the mind, that you may prove by testing what the will of God is'
Circumcision refers to the observers of the Jewish religious rituals; uncircumcision to those who do not care for the Jewish religion
We need to be renewed in our natural mind, which means that our mind needs to be filled up and saturated with the Spirit
When some of the Pharisees heard the disciples praising the Lord with a loud voice in such a way, they asked the Lord to rebuke them
The worship from the disciples in this particular passage was not something quiet and solemn but loud and rejoicing
Brother Nee was not for such a wild meeting, but he was even the more against the deadness evidenced in many other Christian meetings
Corinthians 12 tells us that the top gift to the church is the word of wisdom and the second is the word of knowledge
By the Lord's sovereignty, due to this modern scientific age and the political situation, the globe has been made small
Even though in this modern era so many races and peoples have been brought together, people still like to keep themselves divided
Whether we are American, British, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, or Japanese, the Lord has made us one
The one new man cannot be realized by our being corrected or taught but by the Spirit of God permeating our mentality
Everything that the Lord is doing in this present age is to usher in the practical existence of the one new man
To drop our natural, religious concepts, our mind needs to be saturated, permeated, possessed, and taken over by our mingled spirit
We may have realized that sin, sins, the old man, Satan, and the world have been dealt with by Christ on the cross
Not many of us have ever been taught that on the cross Christ has abolished all the ordinances of human living
The Jews, the Greeks, the Japanese, the Chinese, the French, and the British all have their ordinances, their particular ways of living
All different cultures have their particular way to cook, which is related to their way of living, to their ordinances
We need to praise the Lord that we have heard the good news that Christ on the cross has abolished all the ordinances
The husband may not like the kind of cooking from Northern China, and the sister may not like Cantonese cooking
It is not only hard to have the real oneness between two peoples, but even between a man and a wife it is difficult
We can say that the New Testament began with Peter, was somewhat completed with Paul, and was fully touched by the Apostle John
Eventually, Peter became the first great fisher for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens on the day of Pentecost
According to the record of the New Testament, Peter caught the fish, gathered the materials, for the building up of the church
A trance refers to a state in which a man passes out of himself and from which he comes to himself , as in a dream, but without sleep
In this trance, Peter saw a vessel like a great sheet descending onto the earth, in which were all manner of unclean animals
For us to rise, kill, and eat means to take in what we do not like, digesting and assimilating it into our being
In Galatians 2 Peter shrunk back from eating with the Gentile believers out of fear of those of the circumcision
In Galatians 3:27-28 Paul told us that those who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ and 'there cannot be Jew nor Greek'
For Paul to speak in such a way with his deep and strong Jewish education, shows the marvelous renewing in his mentality
These Jews were typical believers in Christ, yet they still kept the ordinances, and they heard that Paul was breaking the ordinances
In the book of Revelation John told us that the Lord purchased by His blood 'men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation'
Through John we also see that the churches are the golden lampstands and consummately these lampstands become the New Jerusalem
About twenty centuries have passed since the Lord's death on the cross, but we must ask ourselves where the builded church is
In the United States there are some denominational congregations who will not allow blacks to worship with them
Generally speaking, they will spend a lot of time in their cooking, but hardly any time to take care of their lawn, flowers, and trees
What if a typical Scottish brother and his family were to live next to a typical Chinese brother and his family?
The Scottish character would become a problem to the Chinese, and the Chinese character would become a problem to the Scot
The Chinese brother might even say to his wife that the Scottish brother does not love the church as much as he loves his front yard
He might ask concerning the Scottish brother, 'Does he spend as much time in his Bible as he does to arrange his flowers?
If a person is sloppy in his disposition, he should exercise his spirit to clean his front yard, perhaps once a week
When the Chinese brothers began to speak in Chinese, the Americans got offended and the fellowship was terminated
When we pray, we pray ourselves into the spirit, but we have to keep ourselves all the time in our spirit in our daily life
For this we need to drink of the one Spirit that we may be renewed in the spirit of our mind in every area of our practical, daily life
