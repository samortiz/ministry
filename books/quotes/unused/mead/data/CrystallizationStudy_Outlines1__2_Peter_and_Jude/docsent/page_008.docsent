   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the members of His Body, His mass reproduction and duplication, the believers copy the Lord in their spirit, learning from Him according to His model by taking His yoke the Father s will and His burden the work of carrying out the Father s will ; such a yoke is easy, not bitter, and such a burden is light, not heavy Matt 11:28-30; 1 Pet 2:21; Eph 4:20; 1 Cor 16:10.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Lord offered up Himself as a sacrifice on the cross, He bore up our sins in His body on the cross, the true altar for propitiation; in His resurrection as the pneumatic Christ in our spirit, He is now the propitiation place where God meets and speaks with us and the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls to guide us to walk on the paths of righteousness, that is, to live to righteousness by walking according to our spirit Rom 3:25; 1 Pet 2:24-25; Psa 80:1; 23:3; Rom 8:4: Christ was our Redeemer in His death on the tree 1 Pet 2:24 , and now He is our soul s Shepherd and Overseer in the resurrection life within us v. 25 ; as such, He is able to guide us and supply us with life that we may follow in His steps according to the model of His suffering v. 21 . It is by our holy and excellent manner of life as the reproduction of Christ s life in the midst of trials that the unbelieving ones see our good works with their own eyes and glorify God in the day of His visitation the day on which God will look upon His sojourning people, as a shepherd looking upon his wandering sheep, to become the Shepherd and Overseer of their souls; when God pays us a visit, that is the day of visitation vv.</S>
