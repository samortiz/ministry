<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Second Promise</H2><P>Luke 21:36 says, "But be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man."</P><P>This verse clearly says that we will not see the whole church going through the tribulation. If we want to understand the teaching of Luke 21:36, we have to know what Luke 21 is about. Both Luke 21 and Matthew 24 are prophecies concerning future events. Luke emphasizes the destruction of Jerusalem. Although Matthew also mentions the destruction of Jerusalem, its emphasis is on the coming of the Lord. Jerusalem was destroyed by the Roman prince, Titus, in A.D. 70. Luke not only mentions the destruction of Jerusalem at that time, but specifically says that during the great tribulation, Jerusalem will be trodden by the Gentiles. The prophecy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem will see its complete fulfillment in the future. The destruction in A.D. 70 was only a foretaste for the Jews. Luke refers to the time of Titus, on the one hand, and to the time of the great tribulation, on the other hand. On the one hand, it speaks of what the Jews would suffer under the hand of Titus the prince. On the other hand, it speaks of what they will suffer under the hand of Antichrist at the time of the great tribulation. Therefore, Matthew pays attention to the rapture and the judgment, whereas Luke pays attention to the great tribulation.</P><P>In Matthew 24:3 the disciples asked the Lord three questions: (1) "When will these things be?" This means the time when Jerusalem will be destroyed. (2) "What will be the sign of Your coming?" and (3) "What will be the sign...of the consummation of the age?" Luke 21:7 only says, "When therefore will these things be? And what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?" In Luke the Lord was not asked concerning His coming and the consummation of the age. This shows that there is a difference of emphasis for Matthew and Luke. Matthew emphasizes the Lord's coming, whereas Luke emphasizes the coming great tribulation. Luke shows us what the tribulation will be like. It shows us what the tribulation would be like at the time of Titus and the condition of the coming great tribulation. Luke 21:8-16 speaks about the events that will take place before the end, verses 17-19 speak about the suffering those ones will experience, and verses 20-28 include the two destructions of Jerusalem, one at the time of Titus and the other at the time of the great tribulation.</P><P>We can see that this passage seems to tell us that all Christians will have to pass through the tribulation, because it says that while Jerusalem will experience such and such, they will still be there. They will see the situation, which means that they will be there. "And when these things begin to happen, stand erect and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near" (v. 28). This seems to indicate that Christians will be there. In verses 29-33, the Lord seems to be guaranteeing that such events will surely occur. If the words stopped at verse 33, no Christian would be raptured, and everyone would have to go through the tribulation. However, after verse 33, the Lord changes His tone. Before this verse, the Lord seems to indicate that everyone has to go through the tribulation. But from verses 34 to 36, He changes His tone; it seems that the restriction has been relaxed.</P><P>Verses 34 and 35 say, "But take heed to yourselves lest perhaps your hearts be weighed down with debauchery and drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day come upon you suddenly as a snare. For it will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth." Is there a way out? There is! Verse 36 says, "But be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man." This is the way prepared for us by the Lord; it is the rapture (we will prove this later). Luke 21 shows us the two destructions of Jerusalem and what Christians will go through. But Luke also tells us of a way out. If all the Christians will be raptured, there would be no need for verse 34. On the other hand, if all the Christians will have to pass through the tribulation, verse 36 would not be fulfilled. Therefore, from verses 34 through 36, we see that the rapture is conditional; only those who are watchful at every time and are beseeching will be raptured.</P><P>How can we escape the coming great tribulation? There are only two ways: one is by death and the other is by being raptured. Does the Lord promise that we would escape the coming things by death? No, it is not by death. The Lord promised that we would be able to "stand before the Son of Man." To stand in the original language is "to be placed." We cannot stand before the Son of Man; we are placed there. What is this if it is not the rapture? Surely this refers to the rapture. Death is not a blessing. Is Luke 21:36 telling us to hope for death? Surely it is not.</P><P>Those friends who advocate the belief that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation come into conflict with the words of Luke 21:20-28 because clearly this passage describes the scene of going through the tribulation. But because there is verse 36, we cannot say that the whole church will go through the tribulation; those who practice verse 36 will be raptured before the tribulation. Can we say that all the Christians are watching at every time and beseeching? One older Christian said that every Christian has the work of verse 36 because he has believed in the Lord Jesus and is surely watching and beseeching. But the word of the Bible is specific here. Among all the saved ones, only those who have the work of verse 36 can be placed before the Lord. Moreover, the "watchful at every time, beseeching" does not refer to daily praying and beseechings that we have. In the original language, this expression qualifies what is described afterwards. After the word beseeching there should be a colon. This means that one watches at every time and beseeches by saying, "Lord, deliver me from what is coming, which is the great tribulation." Watching at every time and beseeching does not refer to ordinary watching and beseeching, but to watching and beseeching for deliverance from the coming tribulation.</P>
