We have not corresponded with you for a long time; we are really sorry. We received your letter yesterday and were very comforted. We received great light, and we prayed for you. We hope that Collection of Newsletters can be published soon, so that the Lord may be glorified and all the beloved ones can receive the benefit.</P><P>My disposition (Hsi Lin) is to hide myself, so I usually have an attitude of not wanting others to know but only wanting the Lord to know. So you who are as dear to me as a teacher but who treat me like a fellow student do not know how the meetings here (Kuai Huo Lin Street, Ling Tzu) began, what their condition is, and how the work is, etc. Since receiving your letter, I have had a deep feeling of doing a kind of wrong to the extent that the beloved in the Lord cannot pray for us, cannot thank, cannot correct, cannot give all the glory to God. So I take the opportunity of this day in which we have both been exhorted and encouraged to joyfully mention these things, so that those who love us will know.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Origin of Our Meetings</H2><P>We began meeting in this place almost two years ago. It began as the work of the Holy Spirit in us. We felt we had a burden. We felt that in the corrupted denomination (the denomination in Ling Tzu is Baptist), in the human organization, there was no real worship of God, and there was even less freedom for the development of the truth! However, at the time, there were only two people in one accord, myself and Yuan Ling Shu. (At that time Chin Chou was in Chefoo.) Five months before the meetings began, there were four or five in one accord. The way we adopted for our need at that time was not to let man know but only to tell our Father. Offerings were made voluntarily; we never exhorted anyone to give. Thank the Lord; what He had prepared for us was very complete and appropriate for our number. It was a small courtyard and two dilapidated buildings, one for the brothers and one for the sisters. There were two old tables, one for the brothers and one for the sisters, and four short benches. We met principally to worship God and to study the Bible. By human standards, we would have been satisfied with six or seven people! However, within the first half month of meeting, we had seven brothers and sisters in one accord. With everyone in one accord, we seemed to be moved by one Spirit and joyfully met together; this met the need at that time. On the fourth day of the twelfth month of the Chinese calendar in 1931, we had the first meeting in the Lord's name to "worship God." Although the number was small, we were all very joyful and the sound of thanksgiving was among us. "For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst." The Lord was among us; we were joyful and satisfied. Nevertheless, we did not understand anything of the truth. We knew almost nothing of the matter of the church, so it was difficult to avoid errors. But those meeting with us just had a heart to fear and please the Lord. Thank God; He blessed us, for He had prepared His servant ahead of time to gradually give us the light of all His truths (most of it from Notes on Scriptural Messages) to shine among us. The shining became brighter and brighter, until it shone as the sun at noon. In the end we were led to obey Him. In March of that year (1932), four brothers (Yuan Hsi Ling, Yuan Ling Shu, Yuan Hsi Chang, Chu Lo Yuan) and one sister (Chu Ai Jung) left the denominations. Once we did this, the denominations began to oppose, ridicule, and despise us. (When we first met, they thought it was a game and were not offended.) Their propaganda became stronger, and they said we were only a Bible study group. But our joy was the Lord, and we were obeying the Bible. Therefore, we stood firmly on the Bible. At this time, a wind of heresy blew (Pentecostalism), but the Lord had helped us long ago with the topic of the sealing of the Holy Spirit, so we were not affected.</P><P>During this section of the way, I had two wrong concepts: (1) I looked for help from man, but the help of man cannot be relied upon; God caused me to rely only on Him. (2) In the battle with the denominations, I was secretly trying to glorify myself, but God also let me know that this is a very big sin and is very abominable. Thank the Lord! We overcome by relying on the washing and forgiveness of His precious blood.</P><P>In 1933 two brothers (Yuan Chin Chou, Yuan Hsi Ting) and two sisters (Chu En Chao and the mother of Yuan Ling Shu) gradually left the denominations in order to please the Lord and because they hated sects. In March three brothers and one sister were baptized in the Tzu River (behind the dock at Chao Wang Farm). In May a total of nine brothers and sisters were baptized (behind the dock at the Yu family farm) in the Tzu River. The baptizing one was one who had believed and been baptized. But these thirteen people asked the brother to baptize them; the baptizing brother did not take the initiative to ask them to get baptized.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 25: Collection of Newsletters (1) &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
