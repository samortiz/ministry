   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Among most believers, the body is put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It seems as if God has not provided anything for their body, that all of Christ's salvation is limited to the spirit and soul, and that the body has no share whatsoever in it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They do not pay any attention to the fact that the Lord Jesus healed the sick when He was on the earth, and the apostles continued to experience the power of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The only reason for this is unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Word of God, however, indicates that the Lord is also for the body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord is for the body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All that the Lord is, is for the body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the context that our body is for the Lord, the Lord is also for our body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here we see the relationship between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God gave Himself entirely to us because He expects us to give ourselves entirely to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After we have given ourselves to Him, according to the thoroughness of our giving, He will give Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God wants us to know that He has already given up His body for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He also wants us to know that if our body is truly for Him, we will surely experience that He is for our body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The significance of "the body is...for the Lord" is that we offer our own body completely to the Lord, to live for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The significance of "the Lord for the body" is that the Lord has already accepted our offering with pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord will give His life and power to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He will guard, keep, and nourish our body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our body is weak, defiled, sinful, and mortal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It seems unbelievable that the Lord could be for our body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when we see God's ways of salvation, we will understand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Lord Jesus descended to the earth, He was incarnated in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He had a body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When He was on the cross, He bore our sins in His own body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we join ourselves to Him by faith, our body is also nailed to the cross with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, He releases our body from the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Christ, this body has now been resurrected and ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now the Holy Spirit dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we can say that the Lord is for our body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is not only for the spirit and soul, but also for the body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are several meanings to the words "the Lord is for the body."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, the Lord is for the body because the Lord desires to deliver our body from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Almost all sins are involved with the body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many sinful actions are initiated by the peculiar physiological constituents of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, drunkenness is the result of a craving in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Reveling is the result of the demand of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The wrath of many is influenced by the peculiar constitution of their body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A physiological makeup that is overly-sensitive and provocative easily leads to frigidity, severity, and harshness of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The reason many people have a peculiar disposition is that they are peculiar in their physiological constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many people are especially defiled, wanton, fornicating. and lawless because their physiological constitution is different from that of ordinary people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When they are dominated by their body, they commit all these sins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the Lord is for the body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, if we first offer our body to the Lord and acknowledge that He is the Lord of all, and if we claim His promises by faith, we shall see that the Lord is for the body; that is, He will deliver us out of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, no matter what kind of physiological constitution we have whether it is weaker than others or not we can rely on the Lord to overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Second, the Lord is also for the sickness of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Just as He annihilates sin, He heals diseases.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In all things concerning our body, He is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, He is also for our illnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our illnesses are for the purpose of revealing to us the power of sin on our body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus wants to save us completely.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, whether it is sin or illness, He desires to deliver us out of both.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Third, the Lord is also for our living in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord wants to be the strength and life of our body so that our body would live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In our daily living, He wants us to experience His resurrection power and see that our body also lives by Him on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The above two points will be covered in detail in a separate chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Fourth, the Lord is also for the glorification of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The highest point that we can attain today is to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But this does not involve changing the nature of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the day arrives, the Lord will redeem our body and make it the same as His body of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not neglect the importance of the words: "The body is...for the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we really want to experience that the Lord is for the body, we must first practice having the body for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do not consecrate our body completely to live for the Lord, and if we use our body according to our own desire, to please and enjoy ourselves, it is impossible for us to have the experience of "the Lord for the body."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only when we put ourselves completely in the hands of God, submitting to His orders in all things and presenting our members as vessels to righteousness, can we prove that the Lord is truly for our body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He will give us life and power.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If our body is not for the Lord, we cannot experience the Lord being for our body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 14 says, "And God has both raised up the Lord and will raise us up through His power."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This verse explains the last phrase of the foregoing verse: "The Lord for the body."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The resurrection of the Lord was the resurrection of His body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our resurrection in the future will also be a resurrection of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God has already given resurrection to the body of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God will also give resurrection to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>These two occurrences are facts.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>How can the Lord be for our body?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>With His power, He will raise us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the climax of, "The Lord for the body."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This will take place in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But how about today?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Today we can have a foretaste of the great power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Verse 15 says, "Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Absolutely not!"</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The first question is a marvelous one.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Other passages only say, "Now you are the body of Christ" 12:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Only this passage says, "Your bodies are members of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Indeed, "you," your whole person, is a member of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Why does this verse speak of the body here?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It seems that we only believe that our spirit is the member of Christ, because it is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>How can our physical body be a member of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Here we see a very marvelous fact.</S>
