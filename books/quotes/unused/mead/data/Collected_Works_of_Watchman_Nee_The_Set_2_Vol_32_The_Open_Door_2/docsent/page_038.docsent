   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>3 If the brothers and sisters move to a locality without a meeting, they should meet by themselves, even if there are only two or three, because the Scripture says, "Not abandoning our own assembling together...but exhorting one another; and so much the more as you see the day drawing near" Heb 10:25 .</S>
