CONCERNING SHEPHERDING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being Quick, but<br />
Spending an Adequate Amount of Time<br />
to Shepherd People</h2>
<p>In order to adequately shepherd people, we must not be too quick. Our quick disposition needs to go. We cannot shepherd someone by speaking to them for only a few minutes. Therefore, we must be prepared to spend enough time with people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Positive and Not Sloppy</h2>
<p>Although we should not be too quick, we must be very positive. Very often, positive persons are quick ones, and slow persons are passive, even sloppy and uncaring. If a brother says, &ldquo;Let us go to visit someone,&rdquo; a passive one may say, &ldquo;We should not be so quick. Let us wait for another two weeks.&rdquo; However, if mothers care for their little ones in this passive way, their children will not survive. We should not be too quick, but we must be positive and on time. The secret of a good surgeon is not to be quick but to be positive and not lose any time. We all need to learn the best way. To this end, we need much work of the cross on our disposition. Anyone can do some amount of shepherding, but to have shepherding that is up to a proper standard, we should be very positive, though not too quick.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Listening to Others<br />
in Order to Realize Their True Need<br />
and Real Situation</h2>
<p>We must learn how to listen to others in order to realize their true need and real situation. This requires us to stop our own thought, concept, feeling, and speaking while we are shepherding them. We should be open to others and allow their situation to speak to us. This is not easy; it means that we must be positive but not quick. We should not say too much or make a decision too quickly. Rather, we should stop ourselves and listen to the person under our care, allowing him to say something, trying our best to understand him, and putting ourselves in his place to understand his situation in the same way as he does.</p>
<p>Many times our visiting damages people rather than helps them. It tears down rather than builds up. This is because we are too raw; we have never been &ldquo;cooked.&rdquo; Since we have never been dealt with adequately, we are still too wild. As long as we are raw and wild, we are able only to offend people, not to nourish them. Even if we nourish them to a certain extent, we may offend them to a greater extent, resulting in a net debit. We may feel that we have helped a brother, yet we do not realize that we tore him down even more. Eventually, this kind of shepherding produces a loss. Therefore, we all need to be dealt with. Some may say, &ldquo;In this case, to be a brother or a sister in the local church is too hard. We simply want to go to the meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and enjoy ourselves for an hour by listening to the good singing and speaking. To shepherd people according to a high standard is too great a burden.&rdquo; Yes, this is a burden, but we have no choice. In saying these things, it seems that I am a troublemaker, troubling myself first and then troubling others. However, according to Paul&rsquo;s writings, he was a &ldquo;troublemaker.&rdquo; He gave himself no peace or rest in his care for the churches (2 Cor. 11:23b-28). He troubled himself, he troubled all the saints, and even today he troubles us. If we read his Epistles, we will all be troubled. The church life is a troubling life, but what other way can we take? We are destined to take this way. As human beings, we must believe in the Lord Jesus, and as believers, we have no choice but to take the way of the proper church life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Visiting Others without Saying Much</h2>
<p>We must also learn not to say too much when we visit people. This is the hardest lesson to learn in shepherding. The longer we wait to say something, the better it is. Someone may ask, &ldquo;If we should not say anything, why should we contact anyone?&rdquo; The secret is simply to contact them without saying much. If we speak too much, we will be like the friends of Job. This will waste our time and cause more problems. The best way to shepherd a person is to visit him without saying much. If he asks if we have anything to say, we can simply say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord. Amen.&rdquo; Over forty years ago some of us would go to Brother Nee and say, &ldquo;Brother Nee, I have been invited by the church in a certain place. Please tell me what I should do?&rdquo; He told us, &ldquo;Do not do anything except this: Whenever they ask you something, you should say, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;&rdquo; This answer truly bothered us. We said, &ldquo;If this is the case, we do not need to go. If we do this, they will simply ask us to leave.&rdquo; However, we eventually found that this fellowship rendered us the greatest help.</p>
<p>Because we all assume that we know so much, it is hard to say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Brother Nee taught us to say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; because, strictly speaking, we do not know much, and what we do know, we do not know thoroughly. We should not contact people in order to teach them. We ourselves have a greater need of teaching. We should go to the saints and to the churches to learn of them. We must not consider that we know more than they do. It is likely that they know more than we do. Those who went out to the churches without practicing Brother Nee&rsquo;s principle eventually created many problems. The secret to contacting people is not to say much but to let them say something.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Normal Way of Fruit-bearing and Shepherding for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 29</div><br></body></html>
