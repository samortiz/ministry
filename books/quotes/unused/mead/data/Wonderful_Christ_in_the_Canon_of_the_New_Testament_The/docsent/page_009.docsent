   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROCESSED JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we must see that for God to be our enjoyment, there was the need of the process of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If God was not incarnated, He could never have been our food.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Jesus said that He was the bread of life, He was already processed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was God who was processed to become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second step of the process was after He had become flesh: He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As God, He became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then as the flesh, He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The last Adam was made a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus as God became flesh, and as the flesh, He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Can you see the process?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why we say that our Jesus is a processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our God today is not a raw God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is fully processed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now He is on the dining table for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All good food is processed food.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The cooking is a process.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Praise the Lord that He passed through all the cooking !</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now He is on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everything is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We only need to come and dine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>CHRISTOLOGY</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our Jesus is indeed wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is the seed, the root, the branch, the fruit, and the bread for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the theology of today s Christianity, there are many studies concerning Christology.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the study of who Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Throughout all the centuries, there have been many disputations regarding the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the different concepts have caused great division.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some have said that Christ was only divine, without any humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There were some so-called Christians even in the first century who did not believe that Christ was man as well as God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They could not believe that Christ as God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some others believed that Christ was merely human, without any divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Church history shows us that in the first four or five centuries there was much dispute among the great teachers of Christianity concerning the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>ALL IN ALL</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible gives us an all-inclusive revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is not only one thing, neither a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is everything!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is the Father, He is the Son, and He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I realize that this offends the theology of Christianity, but I have some verses from the pure Word as the ground to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have already read Isaiah 9:6, which clearly says that a Son is given to us, yet His name is called the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Is He the Son or the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is so clear that He is not only the Son, but also the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In John 14, Philip said, Lord show us the Father, and it will satisfy us v. 8 . His request really surprised the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, show us the Father? v. 9 . It is just as if someone came to Brother Benson this morning and said, Brother Benson, please show us Benson Phillips and we ll be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if you have seen Brother Benson, you have seen Benson Phillips.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord said to Philip, Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works v. 10 . The Lord was saying, I speak, but the Father works.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is equivalent to saying that Brother Benson speaks, and Benson Phillips works.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This simply proves that Brother Benson and Benson Phillips are one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is the same with the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For the Son to speak and the Father to work means that the Son and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From these verses we see that Christ is both the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now we must look at the verses which show us that Christ is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have already read 1 Corinthians 15:45b which says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must also read 2 Corinthians 3:17.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now the Lord is that Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These verses tell us clearly that the Lord Jesus is now the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After His death and resurrection, He has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I realize that there are some who will argue with me by asking, If the Son is the Father, how then could the Son pray to the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But this is just mental analysis.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have already seen in Isaiah 9:6 that a child is born to us and His name is called the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means that He is the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then Isaiah 40:9 says, O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All Bible students agree that this verse speaks of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When Christ comes there will be the announcement and declaration, Behold your God!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is clear that the coming Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then Isaiah 53:2 tells us that Christ shall grow up in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If He is God, how can He grow in the presence of God?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Moreover, Isaiah 32:2 says, And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>How can a man be rivers of water in a dry place?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is because this man is also God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In our mental concept we think that if He is God, He is God; if He is man, then He is man.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To say that He is both God and man is not reasonable or logical.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But this is why Jesus is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You can never analyze Him according to logic or reason.</S>
