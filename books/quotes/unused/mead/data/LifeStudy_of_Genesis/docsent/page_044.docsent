   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b Intention</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's dominion not only has a sphere; it also has an intention.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What was God's intention in giving man dominion?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 To Deal with God's Enemy</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first aspect of God's intention is to deal with His enemy, to deal with Satan typified by the creeping things Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Bible, the creeping things are demonic, devilish, and Satanic.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the last message, we pointed out that only four living creatures, representing all creation, are present before the throne of God the eagle, the ox, the lion, and the man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No creeping things such as serpents or scorpions are represented before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Bible, Satan is typified by the serpent Gen 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Revelation 12:9 Satan is called the "ancient serpent."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has become old since the time he first appeared in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In God's original creation, He had only one purpose to express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Due to Satan's rebellion, God now has another purpose to deal with His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God created man, He had both of these purposes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, He created man in His own image that man might express Him and He gave him dominion that man might deal with His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Both of these things must be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need the image of God in order to express God and we need the dominion of God in order to subdue the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to express God and to deal with Satan in our home life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times the husband comes home and immediately the wife does not express God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She expresses the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The wife's face has the appearance of a subtle serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many times the husband also expresses the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have learned this by experience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes, when I saw Satan expressed in the members of my family, I didn't say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I went to my bedroom, knelt down, and prayed, "Lord, bind the serpent."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A number of times I realized that I myself was expressing the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Again I ran away to pray, "O Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Bind the serpent."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On many occasions, the divine authority of God is not exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The evil power of Satan is expressed instead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Recently, I learned that many young brothers are living in the brothers' houses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, I am fearful that even in the brothers' house there is still the possibility that Satan's image, not God's, will be expressed, that the evil power, not God's authority, will be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all must realize that today God has this double goal to accomplish to express Himself and to deal with His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not really your husband who loses his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not really your wife who says something to provoke your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Don't deal with the husband and don't deal with the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not their fault.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must deal with the serpent that is behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Exchanging words can never deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more we argue, the more Satan gains ground.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The only way to deal with Satan is to go on our knees, pray, call on the name of Jesus, and ask Him to bind the serpent.</S>
