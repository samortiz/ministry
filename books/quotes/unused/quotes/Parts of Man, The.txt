The grammatical construction clearly shows that the spirit differs from the soul just as the soul differs from the body
The soul is the soul and the spirit is the spirit, and these two can be separated just as the marrow can be separated from the joints
The Scripture shows us clearly that our heart is composed of the conscience, the mind, the emotion, and the will
Our soul, that is our person or our personality, must be the very organ, as a mirror, to reflect and express the Lord
We contact the physical world by our physical body through the five senses of hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and feeling
Man has been created in three parts in order to contact the three different worlds: the physical, the spiritual, and the psychological
John 4:24 not only tells us that 'God is Spirit,' but also that 'they that worship Him must worship in spirit'
Since God is Spirit, we must worship Him, contact Him, and fellowship with Him in our spirit and by our spirit
We may know that man is composed of the spirit soul and body but to discern the difference between the spirit and the soul is a real problem
To know the difference between the body and the soul is easy, but to discern the spirit from the soul is rather difficult
Our emotion likes it, our mind considers it, and our will chooses it; but something deeper than all these protests
In our spirit we have the spiritual life, that is the divine life, the eternal life, as mentioned in John 3:16
They do not have the eternal life of God in their spirit, because they have not received Christ as life into their spirit
Sometimes they act according to their flesh, and sometimes they do things by desiring, by reasoning, and by choosing
Our soul, the self, has been crucified and put to death, and there is no more 'I,' but Christ that lives in our spirit
We need to discern the difference between the spirit and the soul that we may deny the soul and live by the spirit
By this divine act our deadened spirit is not only made alive, but the life of God with its divine nature is put into it
Our spirit is regenerated and changed, but our mind, emotion, and will are not transformed and still remain the same
We need Christ to continually expand from our spirit into our soul till every part of our soul is transformed into His image
We will have the likeness of the Lord in our practical life, because our soul is thoroughly saturated with His divine elements
As far as the soul is concerned, our way of thinking, our way of loving, and our way of choosing are the same as theirs
If our mind submits to the desire of the flesh, it becomes the mind of the flesh, resulting in spiritual death
If our mind submits to the spirit, it will be controlled by the spirit and become the mind of the spirit, resulting in life and peace
Many times we meet some good Christians, but when we talk with them, we realize that in their mind is nothing of Christ
Undoubtedly they love the Lord; but in their mind, as revealed by their way of talking, there is nothing of Christ
Because their minds are under the control and direction of the spirit, the Lord Spirit has the opportunity to saturate and occupy their mind
Our thinking balances and limits our emotional feelings, and we make decisions according to what we consider, think, and understand
If the mind is saturated and occupied by the Lord, the Lord will certainly take over our emotion and possess our will
It is for this reason we are told in Romans 12 that the transformation of the soul is by the renewing of the mind
We will not submit our thinking, our concepts, our ideas, our thoughts, our reasonings, our knowledge, and our understanding
He is already in our spirit, but He is waiting and seeking an opportunity to spread from our spirit into our mind
In Luke 925 the Lord says gain the whole world and lose himself but in Matthew 1626 He says gain the whole world and lose his soul
Some learn this lesson without much difficulty, but for a great number of brothers and sisters it is not so easy

After two or three years they became very keen in their mind, especially when one shared something of the Lord with them
With those who have little love for the Lord, even though they have a Doctor's degree, there is little comprehension of spiritual things
We must realize, therefore, that it is not the faculties of the mind, emotion, and will that must be crossed out
We need to realize that the natural life of the soul has already been put to the cross and that we must take Christ as our life
There may be two brothers who are very thoughtful, but one is naturally thoughtful while the other is spiritually thoughtful
One brother ministers in the mind, and the other ministers with his mind also; but with the first there is no sense of anything of the Lord
With the second, however, you sense that he is rich in thought, yet strong and fresh in his spirit with something of the Lord
With the first, the source is his mind; but with the second, the source is not his mind, but the Lord in his spirit
One of the best translations of Romans 8:6 is: 'For the mind set on the flesh is death; but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace'
When our mind is used, controlled, and directed by the Holy Spirit with our spirit, it is the mind of the spirit
Paul was so much in his spirit that his mind, emotion, and will were all used by the Holy Spirit with his spirit
If we do this, our spirit in which the Holy Spirit is dwelling will have opportunity to express more of the Lord within us
We must continually learn to care for the inner anointing, the inner registration, the inner sense, deep within our spirit
All the faculties of our soul will be improved and transformed to express the Lord adequately and fully in our daily life
In the way of His salvation, the Lord firstly regenerates us in our spirit that we may have Him within us as our life

All the constituents and elements of our body are exactly the same as those found in dust, such as copper, iron, salt, sulphur, etc
The body is without, the breath of life that becomes our human spirit is within, and the soul is the medium between the spirit and the body
On one hand, the body of fallen man is a 'body of sin,' because it is filled with that evil element called 'Sin'
In regard to the law of God, the will of God, and all the goods things of God, the body is weak to the point that it is a 'body of death'
As far as sin is concerned, man's fallen body is very active, but as far as God's law is concerned, it is dead and powerless
We have pointed out in chapter two that Luke 9:25 and Matthew 16:26 prove that the soul of fallen human beings is the self
After Satan came into man's body, he used it as a base to invade the soul and even mingle himself with the soul
He has come into man's body and has even invaded and taken over his soul, but there is no hint that he has any ground in man's spirit
Man who was created by God with the purpose of being His vessel to contain and express Him, has been completely damaged by the Fall
When we received the Lord Jesus as our personal Savior, we believed in Him as the One who died for our sins and thus received forgiveness
Something more wonderful has happened: Christ, the Lord Spirit, has entered into our spirit as our life to make our deadened spirit alive!
Originally, we only had human life in the soul, and this soulish life was our person, our very being, while our spirit was simply an organ
Our spirit which now contains the divine life has become our person while the soul has become a mere organ which is to be used by the spirit
The soulish life, the 'ego' or the 'I,' has been crossed out, reducing the soul to only a functioning and useful organ for the spirit
When we live in our soul, we are living in the self; thus, we are immediately involved with Satan, sin, and the flesh
When we learn to live, walk, and act in our spirit, we are automatically out of the realm of all these negative things!
By the Lord's regeneration, our heart has also been renewed that we may have a new heart with abundant ability to love the Lord
The purpose of the heart has been fully recovered to love the Lord that our spirit may contact, receive, and contain Him
We do not need to know so many other things which are not of life, but we must know these things related to the inner life
