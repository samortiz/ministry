   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We can also see Jehovah as the Triune God in this psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 2 says, "He makes me lie down in green pastures."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The color green signifies the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we see the green trees and pastures, we see the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the trees are yellow and dried up and the grass is brown, this indicates death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The green pastures signify the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus spoke concerning this in John 10.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He said that His sheep would hear His voice and follow Him out of the fold to enjoy the green pastures as the flock vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>9, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 10, Christ is the door v. 9 , the Shepherd v. 11 , and the pasture v. 9 . Christ Himself is our pasture, our nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is the feeding place for all the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In John 6 Christ said that He is the bread of life v. 35 to nourish us v. 57 . The "bread" for the sheep is the green pasture, so the green pasture is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ can be our green pasture through His incarnation, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After His incarnation, death, and resurrection, He is growing here as the green pasture for our nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Psalm 23:2b says that Christ as our Shepherd leads us to waters of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The waters of rest are the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit is the water, and Christ is the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 5 says, "You anoint my head with oil."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hebrews 1:9 refers to the oil of exultant joy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This oil signifies the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 7:39 says that before Christ's resurrection, the Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that the Spirit was not yet consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit of God has been consummated through Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Christ's resurrection, the Spirit of God became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now He is available to us because He has been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Psalm 23, the Spirit as typified by the waters and the oil signifies the consummated Spirit after Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This psalm also tells us that Christ's shepherding of us is in five stages.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first stage is of the pastures and the waters of rest v. 2 . Pasture and waters are for our nourishment, including cherishing and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The second stage is the stage of the paths of righteousness v. 3 . The paths of righteousness indicate our walk.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After we enjoy Christ, are filled up with Christ, and are nourished by Christ, we walk on the paths of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The third stage is the valley of the shadow of death v. 4 . The valley, the shadow, and death are not pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ's shepherding leads us through the valley of the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The fourth stage is the battlefield v. 5 , where we are fighting against the adversaries.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the battlefield a table, a feast, is spread for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Finally, the last stage is to dwell in the house of God all the days of our life v. 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would like us to consider what stage we are in among these five stages of Christ's shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first stage is the initial stage of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is just like elementary school.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In our educational system there are five stages elementary, junior high, high school, college, and graduate school.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is comparable to the five stages of Christ's shepherding in Psalm 23.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many of us are in "elementary school" while others are in "high school" in their experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A brother who is more mature in the Lord and who has been a seeking Christian for many years may have passed through all five stages of Christ's shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now in his present experience, he may say that he experiences all five stages at various times.</S>
