   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, we should expect persecution for living a godly life in an ungodly situation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as we stand for the Lord's recovery, we shall be condemned, opposed, and attacked.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rumors will be spread concerning us, and our names will be smeared and defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such persecution comes not from the worldly people, but from so-called Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In John 16:2 the Lord Jesus said that the time is coming when those who kill the disciples will think they are serving God.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Being deceived themselves, they will also deceive others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We thank the Lord that, in His mercy, He has brought us into the recovery where we can hear honest and healthy words.</S>
