   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 13 PROPHECY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Outline The King's being rejected 12:1 27:66 The path of rejection 16:13 23:39 Before going to Judea 16:13 18:35 Transfiguration in the miniature of the kingdom 16:28 17:13 The casting out of an epileptic demon 17:14-21 The second unveiling of the crucifixion and resurrection 17:22-23 The application of the revelation and vision of Christ's sonship 17:24-27 Crucial Points</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord's transfiguration was a miniature of the kingdom 16:28 17:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not many Christians realize that Christ's transfiguration was His coming in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Matthew 17:1-2 with 16:28, His coming was His transfiguration, and His transfiguration was His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When He was transfigured, He was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we must see what it means to be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When Christ, who is God, became a man, His divinity was incarnated in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The God hidden within the humanity of Jesus was the very glory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For the Lord Jesus to be transfigured meant that His humanity was saturated and permeated with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may say that His humanity was soaked with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This transfiguration, which was His glorification, was equal to His coming in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we await the coming of the kingdom, we must learn not to rank Moses, Elijah, or anyone else on the same level as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, we need to learn to experience Christ as our Moses and Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is the One imparting the law of life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, as our present, real, subjective Moses He is regulating us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, He is also our present and subjective Elijah, constantly speaking for God and speaking forth God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must listen to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The coming of the kingdom in 16:28 17:2 was simply a miniature and a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we get out of the sphere of the transfiguration, we face the power of darkness outside the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While we are enjoying the transfiguration on the mountaintop, others are in the valley suffering from demon possession.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To deal with the power of darkness there is the need of the exercise of the authority of the heavenly King 17:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can exercise this authority only through prayer and fasting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The transfiguration on the mountaintop was not the full transfiguration; Christ still had to pass through crucifixion and enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, He unveiled His crucifixion and resurrection a second time vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the disciples' mistaken concept, the Christ who had been transfigured on the mountaintop did not need to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, they "were greatly grieved" at His word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No matter how excellent the experience of transfiguration might be, we still need to stay under the killing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By bearing the cross we pass through crucifixion into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 17:24-27 we have the matter of paying the temple tax to the poll tax gatherers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a test to determine whether or not we know how to apply the revelation and vision concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the mountain Peter talked too much, and he was rebuked for it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now when the poll tax gatherers asked him whether or not the Lord paid the temple tax v. 24 , he still had too much to say and did not hesitate to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peter had spoken presumptuously in both situations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever the Lord Jesus says is always right, and whatever we propose to Him is always wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What we say means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is what He says that counts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The meaning of the vision on the mountaintop is that we should hear the Lord Jesus and not anyone else, including ourselves.</S>
