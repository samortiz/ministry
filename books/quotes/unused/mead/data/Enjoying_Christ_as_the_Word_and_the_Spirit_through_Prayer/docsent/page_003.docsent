   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DISCIPLES READING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS THE LIVING WORD IN THE GOSPELS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the four Gospels the disciples received the Word, but they did not yet receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is after the four Gospels, in the Acts and the Epistles, that they received the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that the Word which the disciples received in the four Gospels was transferred into the Spirit, whom they experienced and contacted in the Acts and the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By this time the disciples dealt not only with the Word but also with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the time of the Gospels the disciples did not have the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, they still had and dealt with Christ as the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First John 1:1 says, That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time, what Peter, John, and all the disciples heard, saw, handled, and dealt with was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In his first Epistle, John did not say that they had seen the Son of God or Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, they saw, heard, looked upon, and even handled the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This Word was not a composition written in black and white letters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This Word was a living Person, whom the disciples read day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This Person is the Triune God who was incarnated to be a man by the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This Jesus had many stories for the disciples to read.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John 1:14 says, And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father , full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peter, James, John, and all the early disciples beheld the glory of this living Person, and in this way they read Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From the time Peter, Andrew, James, and John were called, they started to read this living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Wherever they went with this Person, they beheld this Person and what He was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way they read Him for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once on the sea they experienced a violent storm.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were frightened by that storm, but this living Person as the living Word lay there still asleep Matt 8:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When He awakened, He simply gave the order to the air and the water for the storm to stop v. 26 . Then the disciples marveled, saying, What kind of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey Him? v. 27 . What they were doing at that time was reading the living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later, Peter, James, and John went to the mountain with the living Word, where they beheld Him further.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All of a sudden His face was shining like the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Peter said, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tents here, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah 17:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter did not read the living Word clearly, so he began to speak foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then a voice from heaven said, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hear Him! v. 5 . Moses and Elijah disappeared from view, leaving Jesus Himself alone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was the way Peter read the living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When they came down from the mountain, those who took up the temple tax came to Peter and asked him whether or not Jesus paid the tax.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peter replied, saying yes vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When he came into the house, Jesus asked Peter, From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is as if Jesus said, Do the kings on the earth collect tax from their own son?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Did you not hear on the mountain that I am the Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why then did you tell the tax collectors that I, the Son of the King, have to pay the tax?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Peter was corrected by the Lord, he may have wanted to say, Then I am wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You should not pay the temple tax.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, Jesus agreed to pay the tax, but not in a way that was easy for Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Peter had to do something difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord said, But that we do not stumble them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And when you open its mouth, you will find a stater; take that and give it to them for Me and you v. 27 . Peter must have been very troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>While he was throwing the hook into the sea, he may have said to himself, I do not know from what direction the fish will come, and it must be a fish with a coin in its mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I simply cannot believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have to learn the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From now on I should not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I should keep my mouth shut and not get involved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It must have been the Lord s intention at that time to educate the foolish Peter not to say anything when the tax gatherer came.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He simply should have said, Please wait.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let me go ask Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I do not know anything, and I have no ground or right to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Let the Master speak.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this way Peter read much of the living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to the four Gospels, Peter may have read the Lord Jesus more than anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After the Lord s resurrection, when the day of Pentecost came, Peter stood up to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After being educated by the Lord, Peter did much talking, not in nonsense but in the Spirit and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all must learn the way to read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should drop the traditional way of reading.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The old way does not give any revelation; it gives only dead knowledge in black and white letters.</S>
