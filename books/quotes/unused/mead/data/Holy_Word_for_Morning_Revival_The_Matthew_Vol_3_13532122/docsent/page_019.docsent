   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 13 DAY 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 17:14-18, 22-23</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>14 And when they came to the crowd, a man came to Him, falling on his knees before Him and saying,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>15 Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has epilepsy and suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>16 And I brought him to Your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>17 And Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverted generation!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How long shall I be with you?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How long shall I bear with you?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Bring him here to Me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>18 And Jesus rebuked it, and the demon came out from him; and the boy was healed from that hour.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>22 And Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>23 And they will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And they were greatly grieved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Immediately after the record of the Lord's transfiguration on the mountain, we have the record of the healing of a demon possessed person 17:14-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Following this, the Lord spoke to His disciples the second time about His crucifixion and resurrection 17:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we have the incident regarding paying the temple tax 17:24-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we read chapter seventeen, it may be difficult to understand the connection between all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we would understand the Gospel of Matthew, we need to remember that Matthew puts different facts together to reveal a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have pointed out that the coming of the kingdom in 16:28 17:2 was not the coming of the kingdom in full; it was simply a miniature and a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The prophecies concerning the manifestation of the kingdom have not yet been completely fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we get out of the sphere of the transfiguration, out of the atmosphere of the manifestation of the kingdom, we face the power of darkness outside the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Demon possession signifies the power of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the realm of the Lord's transfiguration there is glory, but outside this realm there is the power of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While we are enjoying the transfiguration on the mountaintop, others are in the valley suffering from demon possession.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During an inspiring conference or training, we may have the sense that we are on the Mount of Transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, when we return home, we realize that the power of darkness is still all around us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To deal with the power of darkness there is the need of the exercise of the authority of the heavenly King 17:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can exercise this authority only through prayer and fasting v. 21 . As the heavenly King, the Lord has such authority, but we need to pray, even with fasting, to execute the Lord's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verses 22 and 23 we have the second unveiling of the crucifixion and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The transfiguration on the mountaintop was not the full transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ still had to pass through crucifixion and enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Matthew specifically says that the disciples "were greatly grieved."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the concept of Peter, James, and John, the Christ who had been transfigured on the mountaintop did not need to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, they might have said, "Christ has already been transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why does He still need to pass through crucifixion and resurrection?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because the disciples had a mistaken concept, they were grieved at the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We also may have times when we have a foretaste of the transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Afterward, however, we still need to descend from the mountain and bear the cross in the presence of our husband or wife.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No matter how excellent the experience of transfiguration might be, we still need to stay under the killing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By bearing the cross we pass through crucifixion into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the connection between these three sections of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
