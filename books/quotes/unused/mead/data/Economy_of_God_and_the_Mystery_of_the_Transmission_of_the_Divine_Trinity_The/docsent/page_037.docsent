   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ALL THAT THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT HAVE BEING TRANSMITTED TO US BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After receiving all that the Son has, the Spirit comes to "declare" it to us. this means that He comes to transmit it to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What does the Spirit do when He comes?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He transmits to us all that He has received from the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that all that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit have are all conveyed and transmitted into us by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our Christian living is often like a car that does not start.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is because we have not received enough transmission of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our "battery" is frequently in a low condition, so our engine does not start.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Often when we want to pray, we lack the energy because we do not have the Spirit as the motivating power in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At such a time we need the transmission of the Spirit; we need the Spirit to be transmitted into our spirit and to fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 16:15 we have "Father," "I," "He," and "you."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Father" is the Father, "I" refers to the Son, "He" refers to the Spirit, and "you" refers to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, in this verse four persons are mentioned: the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The riches in the Father are transmitted into the Son; then all that is in the Son is transmitted into the Spirit of reality; finally when the Spirit of reality comes, He transmits into us all that He has obtained and all that He possesses.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are mysterious yet very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In contrast, human beings are very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus was God, yet He became a man a complicated man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not think that we are simple. in fact, it seems that the more spiritual we are, the more complicated we become.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you love the world and commit sin, this is very simple, because there is nothing but darkness in you, and you are totally in darkness and are earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But once you believe in the Lord Jesus, it seems you become quite "unclear."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You do not know whether you are in heaven, on the earth, or in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even you yourself cannot clearly describe your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes you feel that you are full of the Holy Spirit and full of life, and other times you feel that you are heavenly and uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Most of the time, however, you feel that you are so muddled and entirely earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reason we are so complicated is that we are earthly people by nature, but we also have the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once the Spirit comes into us, He brings the heavens to us; the Spirit and the heavens are very close.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if there is not enough transmission of the Spirit within us, then we are far away from the heavens and close to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, you see that there is a wonderful transmitting, a wonderful conveying, in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You may say that it is "the transmitting of the Spirit," "the transmitting of the Lord," "the transmitting of God," or "the transmitting of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In short, it is simply the transmitting of the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Consequently, we become people who are of the Spirit, who are of the Lord, who are of God, and who are of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the spiritual significance of the "transmission."</S>
