   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TREASURE IN EARTHEN VESSELS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us read 2 Corinthians 4:7: "We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to help us realize this verse in a full way, we need to read some verses in the previous context, that is, in chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us read 2 Corinthians 3:6: "Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Who is this Spirit who gives life?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We saw in 1 Corinthians 15:45b that the life-giving Spirit is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we come to 2 Corinthians 3:17: "And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit mentioned in this verse is the Spirit who gives life mentioned in verse 6, in the earlier part of the same chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit who gives life is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Where is the Spirit of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 18 continues, "But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is this Spirit who gives us life, who frees us, and who transforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In these three verses we have three things: life-giving, freeing, and transforming.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All these things are related to the wonderful Spirit, who is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is the Spirit who gives life, who frees us, and who transforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ as the Spirit has given us life and now He is waiting for a chance to free us and transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How can He do this work?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Can He do this by being far, far away from us in heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He can do this work only by being in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By dwelling in us He works to liberate and transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is liberating us from many bondages and transforming us from the natural life into the image of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second Corinthians 4:7 tells us that "we have this treasure in earthen vessels."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ as the wonderful Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, the freeing Spirit, and the transforming Spirit is the treasure in the earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are the earthen vessels, vessels made of clay, the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Just as there is a small receiving part in a transistorized radio to receive sounds, so also within us we have a receiving organ to receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The stomach is the receiving organ for us to receive food.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Within a human being there is also a human spirit which serves as the very receiving organ for us to receive Christ as the treasure into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This treasure is in the earthen vessels, not outside, upon, or above them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that we have to express God, to manifest God, from within.</S>
