   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE TAKING CHRIST AS LIFE Scripture Reading: Col 1:27; 2:2, 15-17; 3:4, 10-11, 16; Eph 6:16-18; John 6:63; 16:8-9 GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the universe there are three parties God, man, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Satan, under God's sovereignty, is the negative party.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The other two parties, God and man, should be identical.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But when man fell, he took a direction other than God's. This was the beginning of the discrepancy between God's economy and man's concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The matter of God's economy is foreign to most Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This term economy, anglicized from the Greek, is not easy to define.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The meaning in Greek is a dispensing, or an administration for dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's economy is to dispense Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That God would dispense Himself into man, and that certain ones would be the recipients of His dispensing, was not a decision made in response to conditions that were going on in time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was not accidental, nor was it determined by circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, it was purposed by Him in eternity past and pertains also to eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This matter of God's economy is made abundantly clear in the four books that form the heart of the New Testament Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I hope you will prize these books, even unto the New Jerusalem!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Ephesians, for example, the Greek word is used in 1:10 and 3:9, where it is translated dispensation, and in 3:2, where it is translated stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Colossians 1:25 it is also translated stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>ORGANIC</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God dispenses Himself into us organically.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The life He imparts to us is not like a set of dentures, which may be worn year after year without ever becoming part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His dispensing is more like the grafting of one piece of skin on another.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The two pieces grow together and within a short time cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They have become organically joined and share a common life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Life is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible tells us that God created man in His image Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man was created in God's image so that He and man could be organically one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not like the kind of oneness formed by putting several volumes of a book next to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is rather the growing together of two like entities.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You may argue that the divine life and the human life are not like entities.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is some truth to this: one is human and the other is divine!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But for man to be in God's image means that the function of both lives is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our relationship to God is likened to grafting in Romans 11:17, 19, 23 and 24.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are the branches grafted into the olive tree.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Two pieces of dry wood cannot be grafted together; they would have to be joined inorganically by a carpenter!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only a living branch and a living tree can be grafted together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Grafting is an organic process.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Christian life is a hybrid life; that is, it is the product or result of the blending of two different lives.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We were born human, but in our second birth we were born of God John 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By the new birth the divine life has been imparted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As sons of God, we are divine dignitaries!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not a small thing for anyone to harm us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are divinely human, and humanly divine!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our life has been grafted into God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is working Himself into us organically.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>John 15 clearly pictures this organic relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The vine and the branches are not united by a carpenter's hammer!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The branches are not like dentures artificially held in place!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are the branches of God, organically one with Him!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are part of God, just as my arm is part of me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some may say that this is heretical teaching; such ones are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are in the light, we shall see and rejoice that as the branches of Christ, we are part of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Organically we are organically joined to God!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is His economy.</S>
