<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE VISION CONCERNING A RAM<br>AND A MALE GOAT WITH ITS SUCCESSORS</H2><P>The vision in 8:3-14 concerns a ram and a male goat with its successors.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Ram</H2><P>Verses 3 and 4 speak of a ram.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Signifying Medo-Persia</H2><P>The ram signifies Medo-Persia (vv. 3a, 20; 11:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Standing before the River</H2><P>The ram was standing before the river (8:3b). This signifies that the ram became strong by the river Ulai.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Two High Horns,<br>One Higher Than the Other<br>and the Higher One Coming Up Last</H2><P>The ram had two horns, and "the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other; and the higher one came up last" (v. 3c). These two horns signify Media and Persia. Persia with its king Cyrus (Ezra 1:1), which came up last, became higher than Media.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Ram Pushing Westward,<br>Northward, and Southward</H2><P>Daniel saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward (Dan. 8:4a). This signifies that Medo-Persia conquered Babylon on the west, Assyria on the north, and Egypt on the south.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. No Beast Being Able to Stand before Him,<br>and No One Being Able to Deliver from His Power</H2><P>"No beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could deliver from his power" (v. 4b). This signifies Medo-Persia's subduing power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Doing As He Pleased and Becoming Great</H2><P>"He did as he pleased, and he became great" (v. 4c). This indicates that Medo-Persia had no fear of God and became arrogant in itself. Eventually, God dealt with Medo-Persia by raising up Alexander the Great.</P>
