<h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING<br />
THE COMMUNITY WORK AND<br />
THE BUILDING OF A LARGE MEETING HALL</h1>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE SPEAKING, NO ONE BEING THE HEAD,<br />
AND MEETING IN EVERY HOME</h2>
<p>The three important matters in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today are begetting, nourishing, and teaching. There is also an urgent need for us to practice three things: everyone speaking, no one being the head, and having a meeting in every home. Some people might say that everyone speaks, and under normal circumstances everyone can speak; however, in the meetings very few people speak. Therefore, we must stand against this situation and encourage everyone to speak in the meetings.</p>
<p>In the natural man everyone likes to be the head. This can be seen even among children; the oldest child in a family always wants to be the head. However, in our service to the Lord, we must stand against the natural man. No one should be the head. There is only one person who is the Head; we have only one Head. The Chinese character for <em>big</em> or <em>great</em> is composed of <em>one</em> and <em>man.</em> Only one man, the Lord Jesus, is great. Apart from Him, no one is great.</p>
<p>We also need meetings in every home. Human beings are social; we like to contact one another. I like to go to your home, and you like to come to my home. However, when it is related to the Lord, very few people want to open their homes and invite people. The three poisons of no one speaking, everyone being the head, and homes without meetings are in us from degraded Christianity.</p>
<p>God wants all His people to be prophets (Num. 11:29). The apostle Paul says that we can all prophesy one by one (1 Cor. 14:31). This is the desire of God&rsquo;s heart. In Matthew 20 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave&rdquo; (v. 27). Acts shows that the early believers opened their homes and met from house to house immediately after they were saved (2:46).</p>
<p>In Taipei there are presently three to four thousand saints who meet regularly and participate in the activities of the church. According to our estimate there are about one thousand households. What would the situation be if these four thousand saints spoke concerning God, the Lord Jesus, and the divine life every day? What would the situation be if they spoke the gospel and the truth every day? If they opened their homes and had a meeting one evening a week for one year, our numbers would double; we would increase from four thousand people to eight thousand people and from one thousand households to two thousand households. In the second year we could increase to twelve thousand people. Those who are saved in the homes will be remaining fruit. Furthermore, they will do the same things that we do because children usually imitate their parents. If we all speak, no one can be the head, and we will open our homes. Then the ones we lead to salvation will be the same as we. In two years there could be twelve thousand people who practice these three things. This would be glorious.</p>
<p>Those in Christianity and even we are dead because no one speaks in the meetings, everyone wants to be the head, and no one opens his home for meetings. May the Lord show us that we must overturn the habits of not speaking and not opening our homes, and we must hate being the head. If we are such people, those whom we lead to salvation will also be like this. They will open their homes, speak in the meetings, and not want to be the head. By diligently practicing these three things, we will bring in a revival to the island of Taiwan. This is the way to gospelize Taiwan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEVELOPING THE COMMUNITY GOSPEL WORK</h2>
<p>Some young brothers and sisters are already going out to the new communities to preach the gospel from door to door, and the results have been very good. Almost every door they knocked on was open to them. People opened their doors to welcome them, and those who received them were blessed with the gospel. Many people invited them to return for a second visit. These homes are for preaching the gospel. This is marvelous. From the time we began preaching the gospel in mainland China, we have not encountered a situation like this. It is truly wonderful.</p>
<p>If we all speak for the Lord, no one can be the head to restrict, rule over, hinder, or control the other saints, and if we are freed from bondage to open our homes for meetings, our relatives, friends, and neighbors will be saved. Before we read the Bible with people or meet with them in our homes, we need to be prepared so that we can lead them to Christ. The Chinese people like to read Proverbs because it is full of wise sayings. Sixty years ago I also liked to read Proverbs, but the more I studied the Bible, the deeper I entered into God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. It is easy for a new believer to appreciate Proverbs. Reading Proverbs can be compared to serving people appetizers to whet their appetite. Proverbs whets the appetite. For example, Proverbs 10:19 says, &ldquo;When there are many words transgression does not cease, / But he who restrains his lips is prudent.&rdquo; When a person hears these words, he will feel that the Bible is a superior book, regardless of his religious background.</p>
<p>There was a co-worker who was two years older than I. He contracted tuberculosis forty years ago at the same time that I did. Our sicknesses were approximately the same in severity, but he went to be with the Lord. I often remember him because we were very close and in one accord. He was from Manchuria, and before his salvation he was zealous for politics. He even contributed most of the wealth that he had inherited to political causes. He also despised Christianity because he thought it was a Western religion and a form of imperialism. He did not believe in anything and was not superstitious. One day he stopped by a small temple on a mountain. In the temple there was a large Bible on the offering table that was opened to Psalm 1. He read verses 1 and 2: &ldquo;Blessed is the man / Who does not walk / In the counsel of the wicked, / Nor stand on the path of sinners, / Nor sit in the seat of mockers; / Rather his delight is in the law of Jehovah, / And in His law he meditates by day and by night.&rdquo; He was drawn to these words and read the rest of the psalm, thinking that the Bible was better than he expected. The more he read, the more he liked it. The words of the Bible touched him, and the Holy Spirit worked within him. Even though no one preached the gospel to him, he repented and began confessing his sins in tears. After his salvation his only desire was to preach the Lord Jesus. I met him after his salvation, and we served the Lord together.</p>
<p>We should all spend time to read the Bible so that our speaking is simple and clear when we preach the gospel. Then it will not be difficult for others to understand us. When we first speak to people, we should not speak about Abraham begetting Isaac and Isaac begetting Jacob or about the prophecy of the seventy weeks. Although we may consider these to be interesting topics, the people we are speaking to will not understand us. We need to read through the Bible several times. The Bible is a treasure store that contains many riches. We also should not speak to people about insignificant matters; rather, we should take the Bible with us and speak its precious words to people everywhere. We should speak what people need to hear.</p>
<p>A mother may speak with us about the problems she has with her children. We can read Mark 10:14 with her, which says, &ldquo;Allow the little children to come to Me.&rdquo; All mothers like to hear verses like this. We can also speak of how the Lord blessed the little children. Because mothers love their children, when we speak in this way, we touch their hearts. We can then preach the gospel by explaining that only the Lord Jesus can help her children; she has no way to help them. The Lord Jesus loves little children.</p>
<p>It is very convenient to preach the gospel in the communities because more than twenty households live in one apartment building. We can take the elevator to their doorsteps. I heard that a Christian group in Seoul, Korea, trains its members to contact people for the gospel. There are many housewives who stay at home with little children in Seoul. When these housewives buy their groceries, they carry their child in one arm and their groceries in the other. They need someone to help them. This Christian group trains its members to wait by the elevator in the apartment buildings and help the housewives carry their groceries into the elevator and to their front door while conversing with them. As a result the housewives invite the believers in for a cup of tea, and the gospel is preached to them. This is a good way to contact people.</p>
<p>If we practice, it will not be difficult to contact people for the gospel. There are over sixty new residential communities being developed within the city limits of Taipei. Young working couples who recently graduated from college live in these communities. Some denominations are already working in these communities, and there are eighty to one hundred people in their meetings. Hence, we should pay attention to the gospel work in these communities. Acts 1:8 says, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; Taipei is our Jerusalem. We must preach the gospel to every part of this city. The first step in gospelizing Taiwan is to gospelize the city of Taipei, and the best way to gospelize Taipei is to labor in the communities. If we labor in the communities, the gospel will spread quickly.</p>
