[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee from October 31, 1982 to June 12, 1983 in Anaheim and Huntington Beach, California, Irving, Texas, and Stuttgart and T bingen, Germany.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE WORD, THE TABERNACLE, THE LAMB OF GOD, THE DOVE, THE STONE, AND THE HOUSE OF GOD 1 Scripture Reading: John 1:1-2, 14, 29, 36, 32, 42, 51
[4]  In giving these messages I take it for granted that you have read through all the messages in the Life-study of John.
[5]  If we do not see the mystery of Christ's redemptive work, we shall not know the significance of the blood and water flowing out from His side.
[6]  Blood is for redeeming, but water is for life-imparting.
[7]  Let us go on from the mysteries of the Word and the tabernacle to the Lamb of God.
[8]  According to John 1:29, John the Baptist said, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"
[9]  THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE WORD, THE TABERNACLE, THE LAMB, AND THE DOVE
[10]  As a sign, what does the Word, the Logos, signify?
[11]  I hope that after reading this message you will be able to tell others how the tabernacle and the offerings have their fulfillment in the Gospel of John.
[12]  Regarding this matter, we should not speak according to our imagination or natural intelligence.
[13]  In the following two messages we shall consider in some detail the extract of chapter one of John as seen in the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God.
[14]  When we have the living Word with the written Word, we have the defined God.
[15]  Because God is abstract, mysterious, and invisible, there is the need for God to be the Word in order to explain Himself, define Himself, reveal Himself.
[16]  John 1:1 and 2 say, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[17]  In this message we shall cover a number of basic matters regarding John's writings, the Gospel of John in particular.
[18]  John's writings are not only conciliatory but also all-inclusive.
[19]  John's writings are books of mysteries because his Gospel, his Epistles, and his Revelation all speak of divine things, and divine things are mysterious.
[20]  CHAPTER FOUR THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SIX SIGNS IN JOHN 1 Scripture Reading: John 1:1-5, 14, 16-18, 29, 36, 32-33, 41-42, 12-13, 51
[21]  In this message we shall consider the significance of the six signs in John 1.
[22]  The house of God John 1:51 signifies Christ increased with the church built up with the believers as stones and with the life-giving Spirit as the oil to be the enlarged house of God Bethel for the fulfillment of Jacob's dream Gen 28:10-19 .
[23]  While the Lord Jesus was on earth as God's tabernacle, no one was able to enter into Him, because the way had not been prepared and the entrance was not open.
[24]  For this reason, after thirty-three and a half years on earth, He suddenly told His disciples that He was going away.
[25]  This troubled the disciples, for they thought that He was leaving them forever.
[26]  CHAPTER FIVE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SIGNS OF CHANGING WATER INTO WINE AND THE RAISING UP OF THE DESTROYED TEMPLE Scripture Reading: John 2:1-11, 18-22
[27]  We cannot exhaust the mysteries of the divine life revealed in this Gospel.
[28]  Three times in chapter one John speaks of "the next day" vv.
[29]  The Lord Jesus went to Cana for the purpose of attending a wedding feast.
[30]  We may say that all of our human life is a "wedding feast."
[31]  Let us now consider the other sign in John 2, the sign of building up the mystical body of Christ.
[32]  We need to realize that the rebuilding of the destroyed temple has already been accomplished.
[33]  Although the building of the church is taking place, we ourselves cannot build the church.
[34]  Some may find this hard to believe and say, "In the past you told us to endeavor to build up the church.
[35]  CHAPTER SIX THE SIGNS OF REGENERATION, THE BRASS SERPENT, AND THE BRIDE 1 Scripture Reading: John 3:1-8, 9-16, 22-36 MYSTERIES AND SIGNS
[36]  In these messages on the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John, it is not our intention to review the Life-study of the Gospel of John.
[37]  Our intention is to concentrate on the extract of every chapter.
[38]  The overall subject of all the extracts in the Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.
[39]  This means that in the extracts we have the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.
[40]  In this chapter we have the signs of regeneration vv.
[41]  This new birth has two elements; it includes being born of water and of the Spirit.
[42]  In 3:5 the Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
[43]  On the negative side, the water terminates us; on the positive side, the Spirit germinates us.
[44]  The Lord went on to say to Nicodemus, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" v. 6 . The Lord spoke this word in reply to what Nicodemus had said in verse 4: "How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born, can he?" In verse 6 the Lord makes it clear that the new birth has nothing to do with the flesh.
[45]  The point we are emphasizing here is that the brass serpent in 3:14 is a sign not only to Nicodemus, but to us all.
[46]  In John 3 the Lord seemed to be telling Nicodemus, "Nicodemus, you are a serpent.
[47]  The third sign in John 3 is that of the bride.
[48]  How marvelous that this chapter takes us from a serpent to a bride!
[49]  At the beginning of this message I would call your attention to John 3:16, a very familiar verse to us all: "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life."
[50]  Please notice that this verse begins with the little word "for."
[51]  We have seen that 3:16 begins with "for" and that this indicates that here we have an explanation of the foregoing word.
[52]  Verses 1 and 2 say, "But there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: he came to Him by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him."
[53]  Chapter one of the Gospel of John reveals that Christ came as the tabernacle 1:14 , and that tabernacle was actually the incarnated God into whom the believers may enter.
[54]  But what is the entrance, the way, into the tabernacle?
[55]  CHAPTER NINE THE SERPENT AND THE BRIDE 1 Scripture Reading: John 3:9-16, 22-36
[56]  The title of this message is "The Serpent and the Bride."
[57]  It may seem strange to put these two matters together.
[58]  The serpent is mentioned in John 3 in such a way as to indicate that we, fallen human beings, are all serpentine.
[59]  We are not only sinners; we are serpentine because we were bitten by the old serpent.
[60]  To be sure, when Nicodemus came to the Lord Jesus that night, he certainly did not have any realization that he was serpentine.
[61]  He probably regarded himself as a God-seeking and God-fearing man, as a man who tried to please God by keeping the law of God and who taught the Scriptures to the children of Israel.
[62]  In 3:5 the Lord was saying to Nicodemus, "You need to be buried in the water spoken of by John the Baptist in his ministry.
[63]  John did not come to teach you how to keep the law of Moses; he came to bury you.
[64]  Do you know why John wanted to bury you?
[65]  It is according to the Scriptures to speak of the serpent and the bride.
[66]  We may say that, considered as a whole, the Bible unveils to us the matter of the serpent and the bride.
[67]  In the early chapters of Genesis we see the serpent and the bride.
[68]  If we read through the Bible in this light, we shall be able to see the story of the serpent and the bride in both the Old Testament and in the New.
[69]  It seems that in the twentieth century everybody wants to be independent.
[70]  In our actual daily living we may not be a newborn person.
[71]  We may still be an old person, even perhaps a good, moral, ethical, religious, God-fearing Nicodemus.
[72]  In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."
[73]  Here Paul is saying that he has been terminated and that now Christ lives in him.
[74]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE SERPENTINE PEOPLE BECOMING THE UNIVERSAL INCREASE OF THE UNLIMITED CHRIST BY THE IMMEASURABLE SPIRIT WITH THE ETERNAL LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6, 8, 14-16, 29-30, 31-36
[75]  In the previous messages we pointed out that the writings of John are concerned with the divine mysteries.
[76]  These mysteries include the mystery of the divine Person, the mystery of the divine life, and the mystery of the divine birth.
[77]  Many Christians have a superficial realization of at least four matters in John 3: regeneration vv.
[78]  Another matter concerning which Christians are very short in their realization is the brass serpent, which signifies Christ in the form of the flesh of sin.
[79]  We may have read chapter three of John again and again without paying attention to the brass serpent in verse 14.
[80]  With few exceptions, most Christians have read John 3.
[81]  However, how many pay adequate attention to the word "bride" in verse 29?
[82]  In our reading of John 3 we need a proper realization and appreciation of five matters: the serpentine human being vv.
[83]  According to 3:31, the unlimited Christ not only comes from above, but also is above all.
[84]  The One who comes from the heavens is above all.
[85]  According to 3:34, Christ as the One sent by God speaks the words of God.
[86]  The Greek word translated "words" is rhema, which means the instant and present spoken word.
[87]  In the previous message we saw that the unlimited Christ is from above, that He is above all, that He is loved by the Father, that He has been given all things by the Father, that He was sent by God, and that He speaks the word of God.
[88]  Let us now go on to consider some other characteristics of this unlimited Christ.
[89]  The unlimited Christ has the bride as His universal increase.
[90]  This universal increase, Christ's bride, is the aggregate of all those who have been regenerated.
[91]  Do you believe that there are two divine Spirits who give life?
[92]  The belief in two life-giving Spirits is contrary to the truth.
[93]  In 1977 I put out a booklet entitled What a Heresy Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods!
[94]  In this booklet we point out that according to 1 Corinthians 15:45, the last Adam, who is Christ, became a life-giving Spirit.
[95]  The all-inclusive Spirit, the immeasurable Spirit, is also the pneumatic Christ 2 Cor 3:6, 17-18; Rom 8:9-11 .
[96]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE TWO TRADITIONAL SIGNS IN JOHN FOUR: JACOB'S WELL AND MOUNT GERIZIM 1 Scripture Reading: John 4:3-34, 39-42
[97]  Our purpose in these messages is to pay attention to the signs in each chapter of the Gospel of John, regarding them as extracts of this mysterious book of divine things.
[98]  What does the well of Jacob in John 4 signify?
[99]  Do you know the difference between the Lord as a fountain and the Lord as a spring?
[100]  When the Lord is outside of us, objective to us, He is the fountain.
[101]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE TWO TRADITIONAL SIGNS IN JOHN FOUR: JACOB'S WELL AND MOUNT GERIZIM 2 Scripture Reading: John 4:3-34, 39-42
[102]  In the foregoing message we began to consider the two traditional signs in John 4: Jacob's well and Mount Gerizim.
[103]  We focused our attention on the sign of Jacob's well and saw that this well signifies that nothing traditional can satisfy the thirst in human life.
[104]  Our thirst can be quenched only by the living Person of Christ, the gift of God.
[105]  In chapter four of John we have a mountain and a well at the foot of the mountain.
[106]  The well is for human living, and the mountain is for the worship of God.
[107]  The Lord Jesus first pointed out to the Samaritan woman that Jacob's well cannot satisfy man's thirst in his human life.
[108]  For more than forty years, I have been fighting the battle concerning the genuine worship of God.
[109]  This battle has not yet been won, for in our meetings we can still see certain traditional things.
[110]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE TRADITIONAL SIGNS IN JOHN FIVE 1 Scripture Reading: John 5:1-47
[111]  The more we consider the signs in the Gospel of John, the more we realize that this book is a word spoken by the Lord concerning divine mysteries.
[112]  I do not believe that the natural mentality is capable of writing such a book.
[113]  Although the terms used in the Gospel of John are deep and profound, Christians have lowered the significance of these terms because of the way they commonly use them.
[114]  For example, in John 14:6 the Lord Jesus says, "I am the way."
[115]  A number of Christian speakers have given messages on Christ as the way, emphasizing that He is the way to deal with persons and matters in our daily life.
[116]  In chapter three John gives us the illustration of Nicodemus.
[117]  For the fulfilling of the tabernacle and the offerings, even such a good man as Nicodemus needed to be terminated and buried and then germinated by the Spirit and with the Spirit.
[118]  The annual feasts ordained by God in His law were times for presenting offerings to God.
[119]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE TRADITIONAL SIGNS IN JOHN FIVE 2 Scripture Reading: John 5:1-47
[120]  In this message we shall continue to consider the traditional signs in John 5.
[121]  The stirring up of the water is also a sign.
[122]  This is a sign of traditional religious practices to make people perfect.
[123]  John 5:39 says, "You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life, and it is these that testify concerning Me."
[124]  It may seem that the record in chapter six of John is easy to understand.
[125]  Actually, this is the most difficult chapter in the Gospel of John from which to obtain the extract.
[126]  Chapter five of John reveals that everything, even things that are good and holy, are empty apart from Christ.
[127]  Only Christ can meet man's need, for no one and nothing other than Christ can enliven us.
[128]  The crucial point here is that even though we may not be sick, blind, lame, or withered, we still are hungry.
[129]  All those around the pool were sick, but those around the sea were hungry.
[130]  In their reading of the Bible, the majority of Christians do not see anything concerning the enjoyment of the Lord by feeding on Him.
[131]  Instead, they see laws, regulations, ordinances, ceremonies, rituals, forms, and practices.
[132]  Eventually, the feeding with Christ's resurrection life and overcoming life results in eternal life.
[133]  This is the reason the Lord speaks in this chapter concerning eternal life.
[134]  In 6:27 He says, "Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides to eternal life, which the Son of Man shall give you."
[135]  CHAPTER NINETEEN THE SIGNS IN JOHN SIX 2 Scripture Reading: John 6:1-21, 26-69 THE BREAD OF LIFE
[136]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that chapter six of the Gospel of John gives many details concerning the Lord Jesus as the bread of life.
[137]  In this chapter Christ first says that He is the bread of life.
[138]  This bread of life is signified by barley loaves.
[139]  However, eventually, the Lord went on to say that the bread which He gives is His flesh v. 51 . At this point, the bread is the flesh.
[140]  In our Christian life, we daily need the experience of contacting the Spirit in a practical way.
[141]  We should not be satisfied merely to read a few chapters of the Bible each day or take a portion of the Word in morning watch.
[142]  Whenever we come to the Word, we need to exercise our entire being, especially our spirit, to contact Christ, who is now the life-giving Spirit.
[143]  CHAPTER TWENTY THE SIGNS IN JOHN SEVEN 1 Scripture Reading: John 7:1-32, 37-52
[144]  In chapter three we have the case of Nicodemus, an elderly religious gentleman.
[145]  This chapter reveals that Nicodemus had a serpentine nature and that he needed to be replaced by Christ as the brass serpent in order to receive eternal life and thereby become part of the universal increase of Christ.
[146]  Between the Passover in chapter six and the feast of tabernacles in chapter seven is another period of time of almost a year concerning which nothing is recorded in this Gospel.
[147]  The Passover was the first of the annual feasts mentioned in Leviticus 23, and the feast of tabernacles was the last vv.
[148]  CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE SIGNS IN JOHN SEVEN 2 Scripture Reading: John 7:1-32, 37-52 CHRIST FOR NOURISHMENT AND SATISFACTION
[149]  The Gospel of John has much to say concerning the Jewish feasts.
[150]  We have pointed out that the feast of Passover, the first of the Jewish annual feasts, implies the beginning of man's life and that the feast of tabernacles, the last feast of the year, implies the completion of life.
[151]  As One who lived a restricted life, a life restricted from doing things for self, the Lord sought the glory of God for God's satisfaction.
[152]  When the Lord Jesus taught in the temple, the Jews marveled and said, "How does this man know letters, having never learned?" v. 15 . The Lord Jesus answered, "My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me. If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from Myself.
[153]  He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but He who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him" vv.
[154]  In this chapter we see that the Lord Jesus is the One who satisfies the thirsty and overflows from within them as rivers of living water vv.
[155]  CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE SIGNS IN JOHN EIGHT 1 Scripture Reading: John 8 THE TABERNACLE AND THE LAMB
[156]  The Gospel of John is a record showing us the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings.
[157]  As we have pointed out, in the first chapter of this Gospel we have the tabernacle and the Lamb of God.
[158]  However, it is not adequate to say that the tabernacle is merely a dwelling for God.
[159]  How can the tabernacle and the offerings, which are the reality of the universe, be realized by us and enjoyed by us?
[160]  First Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."
[161]  CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE THE SIGNS IN JOHN EIGHT 2 Scripture Reading: John 8 A REVIEW OF THE SIGNS IN CHAPTERS ONE THROUGH SEVEN
[162]  From 1:1 and 14 we see that the eternal God became a man.
[163]  With this review in mind, we may go on to consider the signs in chapter eight.
[164]  Have you ever studied chapter eight in the Recovery Version of John?
[165]  As slaves of sin, we are children of the Devil born of fornication 8:44, 41 .
[166]  They said to the Lord Jesus, "We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God" v. 41 . But the Lord Jesus told them, "You are of your father the Devil" v. 44 . As sons of the Devil, they were born of fornication.
[167]  Some may say that because they are saved, they are no longer slaves of sin.
[168]  Through my years in the Lord's ministry, I have learned that if we speak of "Christ in the flesh," people understand that Christ Himself became flesh.
[169]  However, if we speak of "Christ in the Spirit," most do not have a proper understanding.
[170]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that today in actuality and practicality for our experience Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit is the extract of the last Adam, God incarnate.
[171]  Let us now go on to consider the essence of this divine extract.
[172]  As the Emancipator, the Lord releases us from the bondage of sin and makes us sons of God free from death 8:32-36, 51 .
[173]  The Lord is the One who frees us from sin.
[174]  The other three Gospels Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the synoptic Gospels, and they record different aspects of the Lord's humanity.
[175]  The Triune God is the reality of the universe and also the reality of the tabernacle with its furniture and utensils.
[176]  Many teachers of the Bible have pointed out that the tabernacle with its furniture and utensils is a shadow or picture of invisible things.
[177]  This chapter contains an interesting story, a story of the Lord's giving sight to a man who was blind from birth.
[178]  According to verses 6 and 7, the Lord Jesus "spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed his eyes with the clay, and said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam which translated means sent .
[179]  THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD TO HEAL THE BLINDNESS OF MAN
[180]  In verses 4 and 5 the Lord Jesus says, "We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work.
[181]  While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
[182]  To make clay of the spittle signifies the mingling of humanity with the Lord's living word, which is the Spirit.
[183]  The word "anointed" here proves this, because the Lord's Spirit is the anointing Spirit Luke 4:18; 2 Cor 1:21-22; 1 John 2:27 .
[184]  Hence, this compound, this anointing, is formed by mingling the Spirit with the man created by God.
[185]  THE SIGN OF WASHING IN THE POOL OF SILOAM
[186]  According to the Bible, the Lord has done everything for our salvation.
[187]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN THE SIGNS IN JOHN TEN 1 Scripture Reading: John 10:1-39 A BOOK OF SIGNS
[188]  In writing this Gospel John used certain cases from the Lord's ministry, cases that are regarded as signs.
[189]  In 20:30 and 31 he says, "Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name."
[190]  THE DOOR OF THE SHEEPFOLD Thieves and Robbers Coming In Another Way
[191]  Chapter ten of the Gospel of John is the direct continuation of chapter nine.
[192]  If we do not realize that chapters nine and ten are linked, we shall not understand why chapter ten opens the way it does.
[193]  The blind man in chapter nine was among the chosen ones in the sheepfold.
[194]  He may not have been willing to go out of the fold, but the Pharisees, the thieves and robbers, cast him out.
[195]  Some may think that because a sheepfold is something prepared by God we should remain there.
[196]  They may point to chapter ten of the Gospel of John and ask, "Wasn't the Old Testament sheepfold established by God?
[197]  In the foregoing message we saw from chapter ten the significance of the sheep vv.
[198]  In 10:9 the Lord says, "I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture."
[199]  The pasture here signifies Christ as the feeding place for the sheep.
[200]  In verse 28 the Lord kept saying, "And no one shall snatch them out of My hand."
[201]  CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE THE SIGNS IN JOHN ELEVEN 1 Scripture Reading: John 11:1-44
[202]  This Gospel is also deep and profound in the matter of the divine life.
[203]  In these three cases we have the matters of sin, blindness, and death, the three main characteristics of fallen human beings.
[204]  In order to understand the Gospel of John, we need to know all the stories in this Gospel.
[205]  However, it is not sufficient merely to know the stories.
[206]  John himself tells us that in writing this Gospel he selected certain signs performed by the Lord Jesus, signs that reveal different aspects of the divine life: "Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name" 20:30-31 .
[207]  When the Lord wanted to go into Judea, He encountered the frustration caused by man's opinion.
[208]  In other chapters of this Gospel the opposition to the Lord Jesus and the frustration came from those in the Jewish religion.
[209]  But in this chapter the Lord Jesus was in Galilee, far away from Jerusalem, the religious center.
[210]  In verse 32 she said, "Lord, if You were here, my brother would not have died."
[211]  CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE THE SIGNS IN JOHN TWELVE 1 Scripture Reading: John 12:1-50 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NINE CASES
[212]  In chapter twelve we have a conclusion of the first part of the Gospel of John.
[213]  We have pointed out in previous messages that nine cases are presented in chapters three through eleven.
[214]  Let us now consider how these five offerings are fulfilled in the cases recorded in chapters three through eleven of the Gospel of John.
[215]  With the case of Nicodemus in John 3, we have the sin offering.
[216]  Because of the problem of sin, there was an altar near the entrance of the tabernacle.
[217]  There was the need for the problem of sin to be solved in order for fallen people to enter into the tabernacle to meet with God.
[218]  At this point I wish to emphasize the fact that in studying the Gospel of John we should not only read the stories in letters, but get into the depths of all the chapters and see the extracts.
[219]  Here in chapter twelve we see a particular extract.
[220]  This extract is that as the result of the nine cases in which we see Christ as the offerings, there is a house of feasting in Bethany.
[221]  In the previous message we saw that the first sign in John twelve is the sign of the house in Bethany, a house which is a miniature of the church life.
[222]  The third sign in John 12 is the sign of a grain of wheat vv.
[223]  Christ's all-inclusive death was also for the glorification of God the Father.
[224]  In verse 28 the Lord Jesus prayed, "Father, glorify Your name."
[225]  In 12:32 the Lord Jesus said, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself."
[226]  This indicates that Christ's all-inclusive death was for the drawing of all men to Himself.
[227]  CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE THE SIGNS IN JOHN THIRTEEN 1 Scripture Reading: John 13:1-38 THE IMPORTANCE OF CHAPTER THIRTEEN
[228]  With this message we come to chapter thirteen of the Gospel of John.
[229]  It may seem to us that what is recorded in this chapter is not of great importance.
[230]  By the time we come to chapter twelve all the offerings have been fulfilled: the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering.
[231]  Although the ones in the house in Bethany were feasting with the Lord Jesus and were enjoying the peace offering, they were still in the outer court, around the altar.
[232]  John 13:3 says, "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands, and that He had come forth from God, and was going to God."
[233]  This verse says that the Father had given all into the hands of the Lord Jesus.
[234]  In the foregoing message we saw that before the Lord Jesus washed His disciples' feet, He realized that the Father had given all things and all people into His hands, that He had come forth from God, and that He was going to God 13:3 .
[235]  We have also seen that the commission the Lord Jesus received from the Father was to bring fallen mankind into God.
[236]  When the Lord was about to wash His disciples' feet, they had not yet been brought into God.
[237]  The Lord's washing the disciples' feet was a matter of love to the uttermost.
[238]  After He washed their feet, He charged them to do the same to one another: "If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.
[239]  Although we may experience all the matters revealed in chapters three through twelve of the Gospel of John, we still need the foot-washing in chapter thirteen.
[240]  It is not sinful for our feet to be unclean.
[241]  For example, it was not sinful for the leading ones to be bothered by the way that sister prayed in the meetings.
[242]  In 13:17 the Lord Jesus said, "If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them."
[243]  This indicates that to practice foot-washing is to receive blessing.
[244]  In this message we shall see an overview of the ten signs in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John.
[245]  THE TEN SIGNS IN CHAPTERS FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN The Sign of the Father's House
[246]  Let us now go on to have an overview of the ten signs in chapters fourteen through seventeen.
[247]  The first sign in these chapters is the sign of the Father's house.
[248]  The Son's going signifies a great deal, and His coming signifies even more.
[249]  According to chapter fourteen, the Son's going was to die an all-inclusive death to solve the problem of sin, to condemn the world, to destroy Satan, to release the divine life, and to draw all men unto Himself.
[250]  You may be surprised to learn what the eighth sign is in these chapters.
[251]  The eighth sign is the sign of a newborn child.
[252]  In 16:20 the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, "Truly, truly, I say to you, that you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice; you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy."
[253]  The Lord went on to liken the disciples' sorrow to that of a woman giving birth to a child v. 21 . Then the Lord continued, "You therefore now indeed have sorrow; but I shall see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you" v. 22 . Here we see that the disciples are a "woman" travailing to give birth to a "child." This child is the firstborn Son of God.
[254]  Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John are a message given by the Lord Jesus during His last night on earth.
[255]  Knowing that He would be put to death the next day, during the evening He gave this message to His disciples.
[256]  The Gospel of John is an abstract of the entire Bible.
[257]  Whereas the Gospel of John is an abstract of the Bible, the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings is an extract of this Gospel.
[258]  Not many Christians have seen that the tabernacle and the offerings are fulfilled in the Gospel of John.
[259]  However, in the last century certain of the Brethren teachers saw this.
[260]  In John 14 through 17 there are ten great signs.
[261]  If the Father's house in chapter fourteen refers to a mansion in the heavens that the Lord has gone to build, then God has two buildings going on in the universe at the same time.
[262]  These two buildings would be the church and the mansion in the heavens.
[263]  In Matthew 16 the Lord Jesus said clearly that He is building His church.
[264]  In the Old Testament we have Bethel Gen 28:12-13a, 16-19a, 22a .
[265]  We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the Father's house in 14:2 is not a heavenly mansion.
[266]  To bring the thought of a heavenly mansion into the Gospel of John can be compared to adding a foreign element to our physical body.
[267]  In the previous message we covered three illustrations related to the Father's house: Bethel, the tabernacle, and the temple.
[268]  In John 1:51 the Lord Jesus refers to Bethel: "Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."
[269]  This verse indicates that Christ as the Son of Man, with His humanity, is the ladder set up on the earth and reaching to heaven, joining earth to heaven for the house of God, Bethel Gen 28:11-12 .
[270]  This temple is Christ enlarged in resurrection as the house of God, the church.
[271]  We have seen that the sign of the Father's house signifies the mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed people to be a dwelling place for both God and them.
[272]  The ultimate consummation of the Father's house will be the New Jerusalem.
[273]  This sign involves the process of Christ's death and resurrection.
[274]  The Son's going through death was also to terminate the old creation.
[275]  Concerning this Paul says, "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him that the body of sin might be made of none effect" Rom 6:6 .
[276]  John 12:24 indicates that the Lord's going, His death on the cross, was for the releasing of the divine life: "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."
[277]  According to this verse, when the Lord was crucified, He fell into the ground and died as a grain of wheat in order to produce many grains.
[278]  Here we see that the Lord died to release the divine life.
[279]  The sign of the Son's coming signifies His coming as the Spirit in resurrection.
[280]  The Lord's going was His death, and His coming was His resurrection.
[281]  As the Spirit Coming to Enter into the Believers
[282]  This means that Christ not only comes to us He enters into us.
[283]  CHAPTER FORTY THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN 5 Scripture Reading: John 14:4-6
[284]  In this message we shall consider the sign of the way, the reality, and the life as seen in John 14:4-6.
[285]  In verse 4 the Lord Jesus says, "And you know where I go, and you know the way."
[286]  In the foregoing message we saw that, through His death on the cross, the Lord Jesus dealt with sin, the world, and Satan.
[287]  This means that He has cleared away all the negative things, all the obstacles, between us and God.
[288]  Now, having dealt with the negative things, the Lord Himself is our way to the Father.
[289]  The Crucified Jesus and the Resurrected Christ with His Redemption
[290]  Once again we would emphasize the fact that the Lord's crucifixion signifies that sin, the world, Satan, and the old creation have all been dealt with.
[291]  In 14:6 the Lord Jesus goes on to say that He is the life.
[292]  Reality is the divine life, and the divine life, which is eternal life, is the Triune God.
[293]  When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the Triune God comes into us to be our life.
[294]  In the foregoing message we emphasized the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son, is the way to the Father 14:6 .
[295]  We used flying on a jumbo jet as an illustration of the Lord as the way into God, saying that "Jumbo Jesus" is the way to the Father.
[296]  Simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus we are brought by Him and in Him to the Father.
[297]  Throughout the centuries, theologians have been studying the Triune God, and there have been many debates concerning the Trinity of the Godhead.
[298]  Not many Christians have realized that the divine Trinity is not for doctrine, but for our experience.
[299]  Now we come to a very important matter that requires careful attention.
[300]  We have seen that before Christ's resurrection the Spirit was not completed.
[301]  Now we need to see that the Son also was not completed before resurrection.
[302]  THE FATHER The Source, the Originator, the Initiator, the Planner, and the Designer
[303]  In John 16:32 the Lord indicates that the Father came with the Son: "Behold, an hour is coming and has come, when you shall be scattered each to his own, and shall leave Me alone; and I am not alone, because the Father is with Me."
[304]  The Father has also given the Son to us John 3:16 .
[305]  The Son given to us by the Father is the embodiment of the Father.
[306]  Not Only Coexisting but Also Coinhering with the Father
[307]  In John 5:30 the Lord says, "I can do nothing from Myself; as I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me."
[308]  We have seen that the divine Trinity is for the dispensing of the Triune God.
[309]  Concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, we are using three crucial words: source, expression, and realization.
[310]  Do not take this message on the Spirit merely as a doctrine.
[311]  As you are reading this message, you need to consider it in the light of your experience.
[312]  According to your experience, is not the Christian life a life of having the Triune God dispensed into us and mingling Himself with us?
[313]  While the Triune God is dispensing Himself into us, He mingles Himself with us.
[314]  In the three foregoing messages we have been considering the sign of the divine Trinity.
[315]  We have covered a number of points related to the Father and the Son, and three matters related to the Spirit.
[316]  Given by the Father in Answer to the Son's Request
[317]  The Father gives the Spirit in answer to the Son's request.
[318]  This is according to the Lord's word in John 14:16: "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever."
[319]  John 7:38-39 reveals that the Spirit will overflow from within the believers: "He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.
[320]  But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive."
[321]  In John 4:14 the Lord says that whoever drinks of the water that He gives will have in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.
[322]  Thus far, we have covered four signs in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John: the sign of the Father's house, the sign of the Son's going and coming, the sign of the way, the reality, and the life, and the sign of the divine Trinity.
[323]  Let us now proceed to the fifth sign, the sign of another Paraclete 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7 .
[324]  In John 14:16 the Lord Jesus says, "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever."
[325]  John 16:7 indicates that the Spirit of reality comes through the Son's death and resurrection: "I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you."
[326]  As we have pointed out, in these chapters of the Gospel of John, the Lord uses His going to denote His death.
[327]  Concerning the divine Trinity, we covered forty-seven points related to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[328]  In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus says, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him."
[329]  When you fully settle down in your house, the house becomes one with you, and you become one with the house.
[330]  CHAPTER FORTY-SIX THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN 11 Scripture Reading: John 15:1 16:4 A SIGN OF CHRIST'S UNIVERSAL SPREADING
[331]  This sign is related to the spreading of the vine.
[332]  Having seen that the vine in John 15 is the organism of the Triune God, we need to go on to see that this vine, this organism, is the Father's house 14:2 .
[333]  The Father's house is the subject of chapter fourteen, and the vine is the subject of chapter fifteen.
[334]  With the vine we also have the glorification of the Father through the expression of the riches of the divine life in fruit-bearing.
[335]  Fruit-bearing is not the result of a deliberate practice; instead, fruit-bearing is organically natural.
[336]  For many years I was bothered by this portion of the Gospel of John, especially by the Lord's word in verse 21 concerning a man that is born into the world.
[337]  After I was enlightened of the Lord concerning the Father's house in John 14, I began to understand John 16:16-24.
[338]  I was further enlightened to see the meaning of the Lord's word here concerning the man born into the world.
[339]  I began to see that, according to Acts 13:33, the Lord Jesus was begotten in resurrection to be the Son of God with respect to His humanity.
[340]  By the Lord's mercy, now we know who this child, this man, is.
[341]  This man is the very new man spoken of in Ephesians 2:15: "Having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace."
[342]  In this message we shall consider further the sign of the newborn child in John 16.
[343]  In John 2:19 the Lord Jesus said, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
[344]  In the foregoing message we strongly emphasized the fact that the new man was born in the resurrection of Christ.
[345]  However, according to the book of Acts, the church came into existence, or was born, on the day of Pentecost.
[346]  My purpose in giving this further word concerning the sign of the newborn child in John 16 is to prepare you to face those who may oppose this biblical truth.
[347]  You may meet a Bible teacher who will say to you, "How can you claim that the church as the new man was born with Christ in resurrection?
[348]  Luke 16 indicates that in Hades there is a pleasant section, known as Paradise, where believers go when they die.
[349]  According to this chapter, a sinful rich man died and went to a place of torment.
[350]  A poor man named Lazarus also died and was taken by angels to Abraham's bosom.
[351]  According to the Scriptures, when a believer dies, he goes to Paradise.
[352]  Paradise is not a place of labor; it is a place of rest, where believers wait for the physical resurrection.
[353]  Another portion of the Word related to the question of where the departed saints are is Revelation 6:9-11.
[354]  Verse 9 says, "And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and because of the testimony which they held."
[355]  In this message we shall consider the mysterious sign of the divine glorification.
[356]  In order to know the significance of this sign, we need to understand what glory is.
[357]  As we have indicated, the Lord was temporarily glorified in the presence of three of His disciples on the mountain of transfiguration Matt 17:1-4 .
[358]  Matthew 17:2 says concerning this: "He was transfigured before them, and His face shone as the sun, and His garments became white as the light."
[359]  We all have the Lord Jesus within us, and we can boldly testify of this fact.
[360]  As we consider this sign, we need to pay attention to a number of verses in the Gospel of John that speak of glory or glorification.
[361]  We have seen that when the Lord received a warm welcome and the people were about to exalt Him, He indicated to His disciples that the hour had not come for Him to be exalted.
[362]  Rather, it was the time for the Son of Man to be glorified through death and resurrection.
[363]  The basic thought in this section of the Gospel of John is the glorification of the Father in the Son's glorification.
[364]  In this section certain verses tell us what this glorification is.
[365]  THE CONTINUATION OF THE DIVINE GLORIFICATION IN THE CHURCH LIFE
[366]  This glorification began with the Lord's resurrection, and it is still going on.
[367]  Of course, it is easy to see that this book is on life, eternal life, that is, the life of God.
[368]  We have seen that John selects nine cases and arranges them in a particular sequence in chapters three through eleven.
[369]  The first case, that of Nicodemus, is a case of regeneration.
[370]  In my study of the Gospel of John, I first came to understand chapters one through eleven.
[371]  But for a long time I did not know what it meant for the Lord to be glorified.
[372]  In the foregoing messages we have pointed out that the main subject of the section of the Gospel of John from the middle of chapter twelve to the end of chapter seventeen is the divine glorification.
[373]  We have also seen that in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen three main things are covered: the Father's house, the vine, and the new man.
[374]  If certain ones still are not convinced that the Father's house does not denote a heavenly mansion, after considering the subject of glorification in these chapters in relation to the Father's house, you may try to present the truth another way.
[375]  You may say, "Brother, you believe that the Father's house in chapter fourteen is a heavenly mansion and that you will go to this mansion when you die.
[376]  Some believe that even in the New Testament some trace of the distinction between oikos and oikia still exists.
[377]  They would say, and in this way they may be correct, that oikos in 2:16 has a somewhat broader meaning than oikia in 14:2.
[378]  As used in 14:2, oikia may have a more narrow, purified sense than oikos.
[379]  CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN 19 Scripture Reading: John 17:1, 11, 21-23 THE DIVINE GLORIFICATION AND THE CHURCH LIFE
[380]  This means that the glorification, the house, the vine, and the new man are one.
[381]  Apparently the glorification for which the Lord Jesus prayed in John 17 has nothing to do with the Father's house, the vine, and the new man.
[382]  The oneness revealed in John 17 is the oneness in the Father's name.
[383]  Verse 11 says, "I am no longer in the world, and they are in the world; and I come to You.
[384]  In 17:21 the Lord Jesus prayed, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us."
[385]  Here we have the oneness in the Triune God.
[386]  CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE THE SIGNS IN JOHN EIGHTEEN 1 Scripture Reading: John 18:1-40; 12:23-24, 27-28, 31-32; 13:31-32; 17:1
[387]  In this message we come to chapter eighteen of the Gospel of John.
[388]  Apparently it is easy to read and understand this chapter.
[389]  If we would understand the emphasis in the Gospel of John concerning the death of Christ, we need to have a bird's-eye view of the entire Gospel.
[390]  God's Desire to Make His Chosen People His Reproduction
[391]  As a whole, John's Gospel reveals that the Triune God desires to work Himself into His chosen people to make them His reproduction.
[392]  This reproduction is illustrated by a grain of wheat that falls into the ground, dies, and grows in order to be multiplied.
[393]  Concerning the Lord's death, 12:31 says, "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out."
[394]  This verse indicates that through the Lord's death the world, the anti-God system of Satan, has been judged and also indicates that the ruler of this world has been cast out.
[395]  In order to understand this chapter, it would be helpful to compare it with the chapters in the synoptic Gospels Matthew, Mark, and Luke that speak of the Lord in Gethsemane and of His arrest, trial, and judgment.
[396]  In order for the Lord to pass through the process of death, it was necessary for everything and everyone involved in this process to be prepared.
[397]  Judas, Peter, the high priest, and Pilate all had a part in this process.
[398]  Judas betrayed the Lord, and Peter, bold in the flesh to resist, first cut off the ear of a slave of the high priest and later denied the Lord.
[399]  As soon as Pilate ended his conversation with the Lord Jesus, he went out to the Jews and said to them, "I find no fault whatever in him" v. 38b . In the Lord's trial before Pilate there was not actually any judgment.
[400]  Instead, there was a manifestation of the Lord as the King of the kingdom of God and as the living witness to the truth, the universal reality.
[401]  OUR NEED TO EXPERIENCE ALL THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE DEATH PROCESS
[402]  Because we are not willing to die, God in His sovereignty prepares everyone and everything necessary to bring us into death.
[403]  He may prepare a "Judas" to betray you and a good-hearted "Peter," who may think that he is helping you by defending you.
[404]  Although chapter nineteen of the Gospel of John may be very familiar to us, we may not see the reality in this chapter.
[405]  THE SIGN OF THE TITLE WRITTEN IN HEBREW, LATIN, AND GREEK
[406]  John 19:19 and 20 say, "Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross.
[407]  And it was written, JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS. and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek."
[408]  THE SIGN OF THE FIFTH WORD SPOKEN BY THE LORD ON THE CROSS
[409]  When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He spoke seven words.
[410]  Three of these words are recorded in chapter nineteen of the Gospel of John; the other four are recorded in the synoptic Gospels, in Matthew, Mark, and Luke.
[411]  At the beginning of the crucifixion, the Lord was offered wine to drink mingled with gall.
[412]  But after He tasted it, He refused to drink it Matt 27:34 .
[413]  This wine mingled with gall and also with myrrh Mark 15:23 was intended to be a stupefying draught.
[414]  THE SIGN OF THE LORD'S BEHAVIOR IN PASSING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DEATH
[415]  If we pay attention to the details as we read this chapter, we shall see that from the time Pilate scourged the Lord Jesus until the time He stopped breathing and gave up the spirit, there was a process.
[416]  John 19:17 says, "And bearing the cross Himself, He went out to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha."
[417]  When the Lord Jesus was forced to bear the cross Himself, He did not reject it, even though He had not slept the previous night and had not eaten anything.
[418]  He did not protest, as we might have done, saying that He had done nothing wrong or complaining that He had to bear His own cross.
[419]  THE SIGN OF BLOOD AND WATER FLOWING OUT OF THE LORD'S PIERCED SIDE
[420]  John 19:34 says, "One of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water."
[421]  When some hear that the bone in Genesis 2 is a type of the unbreakable resurrection life for the producing of the church, they may say, "Brother Lee, this kind of allegorization of the Scriptures is according to your imagination."
[422]  On the contrary, this teaching has a solid basis in the Scriptures.
[423]  John 3:29 says, "He who has the bride is the bridegroom."
[424]  In previous messages we pointed out that the Lord's death was for His multiplication.
[425]  To Him, death was not a termination; it was a multiplication.
[426]  In 20:1 we are told that Mary came to the tomb early in the morning.
[427]  Here early morning is a sign signifying the freshness and brightness of life in resurrection.
[428]  In this message we shall continue to consider the signs in chapter twenty in the Gospel of John.
[429]  In John 20 the empty tomb also is a sign v. 2 . There is a hymn concerning the empty tomb which indicates that when we see the empty tomb, we should be at rest, for the empty tomb is the sign that God has accepted our Redeemer, our Substitute.
[430]  THE SIGN OF THE LORD'S SECRET ASCENSION TO THE FATHER
[431]  Early in the morning on the day of His resurrection, Christ went secretly to the Father.
[432]  In verse 17 the Lord told Mary the Magdalene not to touch Him, because He had "not yet ascended to the Father."
[433]  THE SIGN OF THE DISCIPLE'S GATHERING ON THE DAY OF THE LORD'S RESURRECTION
[434]  Verse 19 indicates that on the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the Lord's disciples were gathered together.
[435]  This gathering of the disciples on the day of the Lord's resurrection signifies the Lord's brothers meeting as His church.
[436]  The last sign in this chapter is that of the Lord's sending of His disciples v. 21 . As we have already indicated, this signifies that His commission to the disciples is like the Father's commission to Him.
[437]  If we consider this matter carefully, we shall realize that it is a great thing.
[438]  Many years ago I wondered why chapter twenty-one was included at the end of the Gospel of John.
[439]  I thought that this chapter was too simple to be the last chapter in a book that covers profound, divine, and mysterious things.
[440]  But eventually I came to understand that without such a chapter, we would not know how to experience in a practical way the divine and mysterious things revealed in this book.
[441]  In this series of messages we have been considering the signs in all the chapters in the Gospel of John.
[442]  Now we need to see that everything in chapter twenty-one is a sign.
[443]  THE LORD'S TRAINING OF HIS DISCIPLES To Experience His Invisible Presence
[444]  From the time that He breathed Himself into them, He remained in them.
[445]  In John 21 the Lord Jesus was training Peter and other disciples to trust in Him for their living.
[446]  I doubt that Peter prayed to the Lord concerning their living after those two meetings with the resurrected Christ on two successive Lord's Days.
[447]  The disciples did not have the proper spiritual realization, the right spiritual habit.
[448]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that all of John 21 is a sign, an aggregate sign.
[449]  Everything recorded in this chapter is a part of this aggregate sign.
[450]  In verse 15 the Lord said to Peter, "Feed My lambs"; in verse 16, "Shepherd My sheep"; and in verse 17, "Feed My sheep."
[451]  Here the Lord seemed to be saying, "Peter, since you love Me, you should feed My sheep.
[452]  The span of the things covered in the last two chapters of the Gospel of John is very broad.
[453]  It begins with the discovery of the Lord's resurrection and ends with His coming back.
[454]  Between these two events are all the things related to the Christian life during the church age: seeking the Lord with love toward Him; seeing the Lord in resurrection; receiving the revelation of the issue of the Lord's resurrection concerning the brothers and the Father by experiencing His manifestation; meeting with the believers to enjoy the Lord's presence; being breathed on by the Lord with the Holy Spirit and being sent by the Lord with His commission and authority to represent Him; learning how to live by faith in the Lord and trust in Him for our daily living; loving the Lord with the natural strength dealt with; shepherding the flock for the building of the church; and practicing the Lord's invisible presence, in which some follow Him even to death to glorify God, not by self-will, but according to His leading, and some live until He comes back.
[455]  This is the concluding message in the series of messages on the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John.
[456]  In these messages we have considered the signs in the twenty-one chapters of this Gospel.
[457]  In the two foregoing messages on chapter twenty-one, we pointed out that this chapter is actually an aggregate sign, for everything in it is part of a composite sign.
[458]  With the truths in the Bible there are two aspects: an outward, visible aspect and an inward, invisible aspect.
[459]  We have been opposed by those who hold only the outward aspect, the outward view, because we have both the outward and inward aspects.
[460]  Mindful of these two aspects, let us consider once again the scene in chapter twenty of the Gospel of John.
[461]  We have seen that, according to chapter fourteen, Christ is the first Comforter and the Spirit is another Comforter.
[462]  But according to chapter twenty, this second Comforter is actually the breath of the first Comforter.
[463]  Verse 22 says that the Lord breathed into His disciples and told them to receive the Holy Spirit.
