   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is required in the church is the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do not expect to see any change in the brothers, but I do expect to see growth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sometimes you can see growth with certain brothers or sisters, but it seems that there is no apparent change.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not be concerned; the change will appear later.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Change by the growth of life does not come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Outward correction brings swift results, even overnight, but this is not of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Anything of life grows very steadily, yet very slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Anything human is manufactured and is done very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You can make a man of wax in less than two days, but you cannot make me within two days.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you know how long it took to make me as I now am?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It took over sixty years, and I am still in the process of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not expect a brother to change overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If he does, the change is not the change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sometimes I hear Christians testifying of a brother who becomes another kind of person overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in another night, he may become a third kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is too fast.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Life grows steadily, but in a slow way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need patience to go on with those in the church and let them be what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes we may have to wait for more than 24 or even 30 months before we see a real change.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the mothers expect their children to grow, but it takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you look at them today, they seem to be the same as yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you look at them tomorrow, they are about the same as today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But after ten years, there is a great change.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the church, we need the real growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We expect a quick change, but we must be patient and help people to grow, not in the way of teaching, but in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes there are those who really trouble the church; but let them be so troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not be bothered by that.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Be patient, and let them grow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Simply minister life little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After five years, you will see the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the brothers here can testify that in all these past years, we have not exercised much correction.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But praise the Lord, look at the growth in life!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The growth in life is all we need.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It will take care of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It transforms us instead of simply changing us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ephesians 4:15-16 shows us that the real building of the Body is by growth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"But speaking holding the truth reality in love, may grow up into him in all things."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And this " maketh increase growth of the body into the edifying building up of itself in love."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is by this growth that the Body is built up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In every local church, there is a certain amount of problems and troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is because children always cause problems and every local church has so many children.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But we must not be bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To have problems in a family with so many children is normal.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you have four children without any problems, I doubt whether your family is normal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That means that all the children are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The more alive they are, the more troubles you will have.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not be so troubled with the problems in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise the Lord, it is normal!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must learn how to feed on the Lord and how to feed others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We do not need much teaching; so we should not give much teaching to others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By His mercy and grace, we must help others to realize that they need Christ as life all the time in a practical and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then in time, we will see the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>THE TASTE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The content of the church is not any kind of capability or qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the church we do not need those who are capable.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the church we need Christ as life experienced by a group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need those who know only one thing Christ as their life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They may seem so simple, so foolish, and even so troublesome; yet there is the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is rather difficult for you to define it, but there is this sense.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Life can be taken, but it cannot be defined.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We cannot define life, we can only taste it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you can tell people about the church in Los Angeles in a clear, defined way, I am afraid that we are just an organization with many activities, but without life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But if you say, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When I was in Los Angeles, I tasted something wonderful which I cannot define," this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If others ask you what you have tasted, you can only tell them to go and taste for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The church in every locality must have such a taste of life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Others must sense that nothing is here but Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is so living, so enjoyable, and so tasteful.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is the sense, but it cannot be described.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everyone must taste for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, we must not bring anything into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Neither should we create something in the church as a kind of content.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The content of the church is nothing but the living Christ as life to all the members.</S>
