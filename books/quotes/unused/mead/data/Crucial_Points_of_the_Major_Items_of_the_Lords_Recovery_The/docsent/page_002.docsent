   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Divine Trinity the Father,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Son, and the Spirit in the Distribution</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of God into His Chosen People</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the entire revelation of the sixty-six books of the Bible, the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is for God's dispensing, that is, for the distribution of God into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's desire with His strong intention is to dispense Himself into His chosen people as their life, as their life supply, and as their everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To carry out this dispensing He needs to be triune.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Father as the origin is the fountain; the Son as the expression is the spring; and the Spirit as the transmission is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit as the flow is the reaching, the application, of the Triune God for the distribution of Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A fountain is the origin, the source, of a stream, or river; a spring is the emergence, the expression, of the fountain; and the stream or river is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Jeremiah 2:13 God refers to Himself as the fountain of living waters; in John 4:14 Christ is the spring of water that gushes up in the believers into eternal life; and in Revelation 22:1 the Spirit is the flow, the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Father is the fountain, the source, and the Son is the spring as the course to express the source.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This course, this spring, issues in a flow, which is the Spirit as the reaching, the application, of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This shows that God is triune to dispense, or distribute, Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here three things are mentioned: grace, love, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This sets forth the reason why God is triune; it is thus that He can dispense Himself into us, work Himself into us for us to enjoy, and be our all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The love of God, that is, the love of the Father, is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The grace of Christ, that is, the grace of the Son, is the flowing out of the love of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the flowing into us of the grace of the Son with the love of the Father for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit are not three different things but three stages of one thing for us to possess and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Likewise, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three separate Gods but three stages of one God for us to possess and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second Corinthians 13:14 is strong proof that the Divine Trinity is not for the doctrinal understanding of systematic theology but for the dispensing, the distributing, of God Himself into His chosen people.</S>
