THE ELDERS AND THE DEACONS</h2>
<p>There is no rank in the church. The relationship between the elders and the deacons involves everyone fulfilling his respective responsibilities. We have been in human society for so long that we all have the concept of a social organization. Hence, as soon as elders and deacons are mentioned, we spontaneously bring in the concept of a social organization. We feel that the elders are high and the deacons are low, or that the elders give orders and the deacons take orders. This ranking system is not right. As a result of this matter, I have spent time studying the New Testament again in detail, and the Lord has given me clear light to see that there were no leaders in the New Testament. When the apostles were appointed, no one was appointed as a chief apostle among them. When the elders and deacons were appointed, there was no chief elder or chief deacon appointed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having No Distinction of Order or Rank</h2>
<p>In the Bible there is no distinction of rank between the elders and deacons. If there were such a distinction, it would mean that the higher group would rule over the lower one. But this does not correspond with the word of the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew. The Lord said, &ldquo;The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant&rdquo; (20:25-26; cf. 23:11). Based on this truth and principle, the British Brethren were raised up over one hundred years ago. They called themselves merely brothers and did not use any title. Therefore, others called them the Brethren Assembly. Among them there was no order or rank; hence, there was no boss or subordinate.</p>
<h2 class="head2">There Not Being Bosses or Subordinates</h2>
<p>However, the concept of rank from society has invaded the church. We still consider an elder&rsquo;s position to be higher and a deacon&rsquo;s position to be lower. In some churches the manner in which a deacon in the business office contacts the elders is like that of a subordinate reporting to his boss. It is good that the deacons are humble, gentle, and full of love and sweetness when they give a report to the elders. But a deacon is not a subordinate reporting to his boss. A person can be gentle, humble, and kind in their demeanor without the flavor of subordination. We must remove every vestige of this concept in our being.</p>
<p>To a certain extent the elders and co-workers have the attitude that they are a special class in the church, that they are higher than others. Although they do not say this nor do they make a show of it, they still have a superior attitude, according to my observation. This is not right. If I express such a flavor in my going out and coming in among you, please tell me, and I will definitely change and apologize, because it is to my shame.</p>
<p>Paul says, &ldquo;I count myself to be inferior to the super-apostles in nothing&rdquo; (2 Cor. 11:5). He also says that he was &ldquo;less than the least of all saints&rdquo; (Eph. 3:8). The co-workers are the least of all saints. Even though we may accomplish much, we still have to return to the Lord&rsquo;s presence and remember His word in Luke 17:10: &ldquo;When you do all the things which are ordered you, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of the saints we should not be able to boast of anything. There is nothing special about elders and deacons. They are only brothers. The chorus of hymn #251 in Chinese says, &ldquo;I am a sinner saved by grace!&rdquo; We have no position to assume among the brothers and sisters. We are not a special class of people among them; we are sinners saved by grace. Although the elders and co-workers do not flaunt a difference among the saints, their attitude indicates that they are different from the brothers and that they are a little higher than the brothers. May the Lord have mercy on us. We need to remove such a situation from among us. If people who come to the church can tell who among us are the &ldquo;bosses&rdquo; and who are the &ldquo;subordinates,&rdquo; it is to our shame. We must remove the concept of rank.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Responsibilities without Rank</h2>
<p>We must believe that the Bible is absolutely right. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 12:28 that God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, and at the end helps, administrations, and various kinds of tongues. Paul puts the deacons, referred to as helps, ahead of the elders, referred to as administrations. This shows that there is no rank between the elders and deacons and that the elders are not higher than the deacons. They differ only in their responsibilities. However, the responsibilities of leading, managing, shepherding, teaching, and promoting are not higher than the responsibilities of a deacon. In society people who take care of miscellaneous matters are lower, and people who manage are higher. This is not the concept in the Bible. The Bible emphasizes the fact that each member has responsibilities, but there is no distinction as to who is higher or who is lower.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many&rdquo; (Matt. 20:28). We should never think that the Lord Jesus is lower than us since His duty is to serve us. Generally speaking, those who are served are higher, whereas those who serve are lower. This is the case in society without exception. The Bible is the only exception. Those who serve as elders have their responsibilities, but their position is not higher than that of the deacons. Those who serve as deacons have their responsibilities, but their position is not lower than that of the elders. We are all brothers. The only thing that distinguishes us is our responsibilities. Peter says, &ldquo;Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God&rdquo; (1 Pet. 4:10). Among the brothers and sisters there can be differences in gifts but there is no difference in position.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> </body></html>
