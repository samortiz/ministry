   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PERSONAL CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND A PERSONAL REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we do not have a Christ who issues in the Spirit, then to us Christ is merely a historical figure, and His redemption is nothing more than a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For many Christians today, Christ is just a historical Person, and Christ s redemption is only a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They do not have any personal experience of Christ or of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the contrary, to them, Christ and His redemption are strictly objective.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is historically objective, and redemption is doctrinally objective.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I can testify that, before I was saved, I also was a person for whom Christ and redemption were objective matters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time, I did not have any experience of Christ or of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, because Christianity was my family religion, I defended it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I defended Christ and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But one day, I was genuinely saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I contacted the Lord Jesus in a real way, I received Him, and I had a personal experience of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today there are millions of so-called Christians who have Christ only as a historical Redeemer and redemption only as a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They do not have a personal Christ or a personal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you know the reason for this?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reason is that for them Christ and His redemption have been separated from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, in the Lord s recovery we must touch Christ in the Spirit and minister Him in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever we preach the gospel, we must do so in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our grating must have four rings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our redeeming Christ must issue in the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The New Testament is composed in such a way that it reveals the grating issuing in the four rings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the four Gospels we see the redeeming Christ issuing in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the end of the Gospels and in the Acts, we have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, throughout the Epistles the Spirit is emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, Paul charges us to walk by the Spirit Gal 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Finally, in the last book of the Bible, Revelation, we have the sevenfold, intensified Spirit Rev 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to Revelation 22:17, The Spirit and the bride say, Come.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, according to the New Testament, the Spirit is the issue of the redeeming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the grating with the four rings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE MOVE OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>BY THE CHURCH IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we need to say a word concerning the poles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The poles were staves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Both the rings and the poles must have been very strong in order to bear the weight of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Remember, the altar was about seven and a half feet square, and it was made of acacia wood overlaid with bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, it must have been very heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because of the weight of the altar, more than four men must have been needed to carry it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Perhaps as many as sixteen persons were needed to move the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible, of course, does not tell us the number.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The point here is that the carrying of the altar was done by a corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By using the words corporate and body I wish to point out that the move of the cross is by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The company of men bearing the altar signify the move of the cross by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And what kind of church is this?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It must be a church with the four rings, not a church which has been deprived of the Spirit, but a church that remains in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The picture of the altar portrays the redeeming Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not sufficient for the cross of Christ to be preached by individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are individualistic, we lose the power necessary to preach the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The cross of Christ must be preached by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words, it is the Body which carries the cross of Christ, which carries the redeeming Christ in the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As we consider the type of the altar, we see that the altar with the grating, the rings, and the poles signifies the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The New Testament reveals the redeeming Christ, the Spirit, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to the New Testament, Christ, the redeeming One, issues in the all- inclusive Spirit, and in this Spirit, the church, the Body, bears Christ and His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The altar moves by the poles in the rings upon the shoulders of a corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We today are included in the number of those carrying the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have put our shoulders under the poles, and we are carrying the redeeming Christ in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What we need today is the full realization of the redeeming Christ and the genuine experience of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to realize Christ and His redemption, and we need to experience the Spirit who is the issue of the redeeming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then we shall become a living church carrying this testimony to the four corners of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>THE SPIRIT MOVING WITH THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Revelation 5 the seven Spirits, which are the seven eyes of the Lamb, are sent throughout all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, these seven Spirits are not sent alone; the seven Spirits are sent with the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, if we do not go to a certain place, the Spirit will not have a way to go there either, for the Spirit goes in us, with us, and through us, the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If the poles do not go to a certain part of the earth, how can the rings go to that place?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The rings go wherever the poles go.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the poles move, the rings move also.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Likewise, when the poles stop, the rings also stop.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This means that if there were no Christians on earth today, there would be no move of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Spirit moves with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In other words, the Spirit moves with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The church bears the power of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who carried the altar first carried the poles.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When they bore the poles, they also bore the rings, and when they bore the rings, they bore the grating with the entire altar.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the reason I say that the altar with the grating, rings, and poles covers the whole New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As we consider this picture, we need to ask ourselves where we are today.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We all must have our shoulders under the poles that are in the rings bearing the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must be those bearing the redeeming Christ in the all-inclusive Spirit as a testimony.</S>
