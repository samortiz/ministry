   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICING ROMANS 14 TO HAVE THE REALITY OF THE BODY LIFE IN ROMANS 12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the beginning of my ministry in the United States in 1962, I spoke frequently on Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 12 is a chapter on how to have the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, you have to present your body to the Lord v. 1 , then your mind will be renewed v. 2 , and your spirit will be burning v. 11 . With our body presented, our mind renewed, and our spirit burning, we can know the will of God v. 2 , which is to live the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we only practice the truth in Romans 12, however, we cannot have the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Body life actually depends upon Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are going to have the proper Body life, the church life, we must learn how to embrace all the differences between Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The differences between Christians are innumerable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the local churches, there are saints from many different countries and cultures, and this issues in many differences.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even within one country and one culture, there are many differences.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I came to the United States, I traveled to many places to minister the word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I stayed in many American homes, and I was surprised at the different kinds of Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I discovered that the United States was a real melting pot of many different peoples, cultures, and races.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I found out that different parts of the country had different foods and different accents.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I was invited to Tyler, Texas, I heard the word y'all for the first time, and I eventually realized that it was an abbreviated pronunciation of you all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is a wonderful thing that the church life swallows up all the differences.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In all the church meetings in Texas, it is hard to hear the word y'all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many of the brothers have learned to speak in a standard way of speaking English.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Differences in the human race make it difficult to practice the church life in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Chinese saints who came to Taiwan from mainland China came from many different provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although ninety-five percent of the saints were Chinese, they spoke Mandarin, a common Chinese dialect, with many different accents.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Among the provinces in mainland China, there were many differences.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After almost forty years of practicing the church life in Taiwan, however, the differences have been nearly swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, the church life swallows up all the differences.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the other hand, it always creates problems.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A new local church may not have many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the older a church becomes, the more problems it may have.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is why we need the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No other society in mankind requires the oneness as much as the church life does.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the church life, we all have to receive mercy and grace to embrace all kinds of differences.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Romans 14, Paul illustrated how we need to receive all believers regardless of our differences.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some of the saints at Paul's time were vegetarians, while others liked to eat meat v. 2 . Some of the saints in the church life wanted to keep certain days as holy days, while others did not v. 5 . Some probably liked to keep the Sabbath, and others felt that every day was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These different ways of living and worship mostly came from the Jewish people according to the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Biblically speaking, it is all right to eat everything and the practice of keeping the Sabbath was over, but Paul did not teach this in Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul did not justify anyone, and he did not condemn anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead he told us the way to keep the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He said, "One judges one day above another, another judges every day alike.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives thanks to God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul's idea is that as long as the saints do something to the Lord, it should be all right with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I do not think that Paul was too liberal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, he was very generous, and he was not narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we had been Paul, we might have given the saints in Rome three messages on the observing of days: one on the Sabbath day, one on the first day of the week, and one on the Lord's day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These are important terms in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Perhaps we would have given the saints three messages to tell them what day is the right day.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We might have said, "Don't keep the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That was of the Old Testament."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But Paul did not do this, and he knew the Bible much better than any of us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He did not give the saints biblical teachings on these differences.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He just indicated that those who keep a certain day, keep it to the Lord; and those who do not keep a certain day, do this to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They both did something to the Lord in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Would we say that this is all right?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This would be hard for many of us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We would like to say, "This is not scriptural."</S>
