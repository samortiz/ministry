   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WORD TO BE ECSTATIC</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In principle, every New Testament believer must be "crazy," ecstatic.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is according to the teaching of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians 5 charges us to be filled in our spirit with the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Colossians 3 tells us we need to be filled with the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to be filled with these two elements every day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3 say that since we are so full, we will sing and speak in psalms long poems , hymns shorter ones , and spiritual songs the shortest .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we are filled with the word and the Spirit, we are "crazy."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is similar to how a person would feel if he just won a prize of ten million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He would be ecstatic, "crazy."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such a person is different from a formal, religious preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the traditional and religious way of worship, there is no ecstasy, no "craziness," no Spirit, and no word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this old way, the Spirit is "in the heavens" and the word is in the Bible, but they are not in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When these two factors the Spirit and the word are within us, they make us crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We become like an "electrical toy."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the electricity is turned on, the electrical toy becomes "crazy" with electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all need to be crazy people who are electrified by the Spirit and the word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we go to the home of some new believers in this way to have a home meeting with them, we are full of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We will be saying, "Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we get there, we will be singing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The new ones may hear us singing outside their door.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we come in, they can join us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, the home meeting started before we arrived at their house.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With those who have recently been baptized, we should use the time to impress them that the Lord Jesus is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to strengthen their understanding of the Lord's presence within them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In a home meeting, the wife may ask a question concerning a statue of Buddha in her home.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She may say, "Before I was baptized two weeks ago, I was happy whenever I saw that statue.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now I am not happy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is this?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we may respond, "You feel this way because that is an idol, and the Devil is involved with it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is the enemy of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then her husband may ask, "Is this true?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may say, "Surely it's true.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We didn't have a chance to tell you this."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then the husband would make the decision to smash this idol into pieces, and we would encourage him to do so right away.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is an example of what it means to nourish and cherish our spiritual children.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, we can lead the new believers to go with us to another home for a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The ecstatic way, the "crazy" way, will always make people happy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It always cherishes people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The God-ordained way revealed in the Bible saves us from any formality and religious background.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But we have to be filled up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not go out with a "flat tire."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All of our "four tires" must be full of air.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to be like a ball full of air.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If someone touches us, we will "bounce" over them.</S>
