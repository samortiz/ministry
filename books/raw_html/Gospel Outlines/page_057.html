<h1 class="title">TURN, TURN; WHY WILL YOU DIE?</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Ezek. 33:11</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Man is on the pathway of death
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The fall of the first ancestor of mankind brought man to the way of death. Since that time, the entire human race has been on the pathway of death.</li>
	<li>As soon as a man is born, he is on the way of death. Hence, man&rsquo;s life, from beginning to end, is on the pathway of death.</li>
	<li>Death means: to depart from God, turn your back on God, be inclined to sin and evildoing, and yet have no feeling. Even if there is some feeling, it will be too feeble to stop you from what you are doing. This is the meaning of death, and these are also the conditions of death.</li>
	<li>Give practical examples to prove that man has forsaken God, has been committing sins, and how he is walking on the pathway of death.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The result of walking on the way of death
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Death comes from sin. Death also leads to judgment and hell. These four things are mutually related: sin, death, judgment, and hell. Sin brings in death, and death brings in judgment and hell. If a man is walking on the pathway of death, he will eventually be led to judgment and hell.</li>
	<li>There is a death waiting for everyone who is walking on the pathway of death, and this death will be a final verdict, forever.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The call of God&rsquo;s love
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God loves man. <em>Repeat this point.</em><br />
	Although man is not thinking about God, God is thinking of man. Man forgets God, but God remembers man.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s love causes Him to call those who are walking on the pathway of death. You have totally forgotten about God, but today He is calling you: &ldquo;Turn, turn; why will you die?&rdquo; I believe the gospel that I am preaching today is God&rsquo;s calling of love. Maybe you have heard it and still do not want to turn; nevertheless it will stay in your ears. When you are walking in darkness, doing evil things, dancing, playing cards, or even trying to commit suicide, He will be calling you: &ldquo;Turn, turn; why will you die?&rdquo;</li>
	<li>This calling will continue throughout your lifetime, until you receive Him. Maybe at the time you are about to die, He will still be calling you: &ldquo;Turn, turn; why will you die?&rdquo; He may call you for ten or twenty years. If you still do not receive Him, even at the time you are about to die, He will be calling: &ldquo;Turn, turn; why will you die?&rdquo; No one can estimate the result of gospel preaching. You and I are just sowing the seeds. Only God knows its result. While you are getting married or celebrating your birthday, He will be calling you: &ldquo;Turn, turn; why will you die?&rdquo; Gospel preaching should not be too gentle. The more you are released, the easier it will be for the Holy Spirit to work. If you are nice and gentle, no one will be saved.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to turn
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Receive God&rsquo;s call of love.</li>
	<li>Repent and confess your sins.</li>
	<li>Pray right now. Those who want to pray, stand up right now.</li>
	<li>When you pray, receive Jesus as your Savior.<br />
	These points are the strategy and the tactic to defeat Satan. This point is the dividing line between heaven and hell. In preaching the gospel, just as in cooking, you must be skillful. Many who have heard have become indifferent, because you have spoiled them. Please take note that it is easier for those who are hearing the gospel for the first time to be saved.</li>
	</ol></li>
