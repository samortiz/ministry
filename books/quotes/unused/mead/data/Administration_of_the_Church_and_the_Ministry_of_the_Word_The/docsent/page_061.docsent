   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BUILT-UP CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HASTENING THE LORD S RETURN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s blessing is in the Body, His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God gives grace to all believers even to those who are Catholic.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and He sends rain on the just and the unjust Matt 5:45 ; this is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But we cannot say that the believers in Catholicism can satisfy God s heart s desire and need in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same principle, we can save many people and perfect them to become spiritual, but this cannot satisfy the desire of God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The desire of God s heart is to obtain a built-up Body in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is what He is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If God s chosen ones are not built up today, they will still need to be built up one day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are no scattered believers in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, all the believers are built together into a city in which the foundations and wall are precious stones, and the gates are pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not wait for the future to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We might not know how to be built, but God wants His believers to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God tells us clearly that after we are saved, we should be built.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are the house built by God Eph 2:22; 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God gives different gifts for the building up of the Body Eph 4:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we earnestly desire gifts, we should desire the gift of building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God desires a dwelling place, a Body, but He has encountered many difficulties during the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not difficult to lead people to salvation; it is also not difficult to help them to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, it is truly difficult to build up a group of people as a spiritual Body, a corporate dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this reason, not much building has taken place in church history.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother T. Austin-Sparks once asked me my feeling concerning the Lord s second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I responded that my inward feeling was that the Lord s coming was not yet near.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to Revelation 14:15, the harvest of the earth needs to ripen so that it can be reaped.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The ripened harvest and the imminent reaping refer to the Lord s reaping of His mature believers at His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, God s people, His harvest, are not ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are only tender shoots.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord of the harvest cannot return when there is nothing to reap.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This matter involves the rapture of the believers and the maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the church aggressively pursues the building up, the believers will mature sooner, and the Lord of the harvest can return to reap the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who grow rice know that everyone likes to harvest early if the rice is ripened.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, if the fields are still green, there is no way to harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Two thousand years ago the Lord said, Behold, I come quickly 22:7, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He desires to come back, but the harvest on earth is not ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How can He come before the harvest is ripe?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Revelation 14:15 does not depend on a timetable; it depends on life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The quicker our life matures, the sooner the Lord will return.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we require a longer time to mature in life, the Lord will return later.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From the aspect of maturity in life, the church is full of green fields and even desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because there is no building, those who are enlightened will mourn over the desolate situation; they will not rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What makes us most sorrowful is the condition of the church with regard to building.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We mourn daily for this because no one speaks concerning the building up of the church and because there is not much building among us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Surely we should pay attention to the propagation of the work, but we should pay even more attention to the building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Otherwise, the Lord has no way, and our work has no way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we do not have a way, the saints do not have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now is the time when we urgently need the building.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since we are attending to the Lord s work, in everything we do, whether in the administration of the church, the ministry of the word, or visiting the saints, we should hold on to the principle that our work should result in the building up of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should be able to build the believers up one by one into the Body of Christ, into a corporate vessel of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God desires a corporate vessel, not an individual vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If our desire is merely to edify people for their individual spirituality, there is not much more for us to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, if we desire to participate in the work of the building, there are many lessons to learn, and we need to be corrected in many areas.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our administration of the church needs to be corrected, our ministry of the word needs to be corrected, and the way we visit people needs to be corrected.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to diligently learn the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is not much of the element of building in our administration of the church and our ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From now on, the administration in all the churches should focus on people, not only on business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should focus on all the believers, not on specific individuals, so that they might become a corporate vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are being built up in our coordination with others, and we are learning how to administrate and help others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We will learn to make up the lack in some and remove the excess from others, or add to those who have little function and help those who already function to develop in their function even more.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We will also learn to help others to coordinate so that there will be no spiritual individuals who manifest their function individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Instead, all the believers should be joined together to manifest their function in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By doing this, we will prepare an excellent way for the Lord to return.</S>
