<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>The <em>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery</em> series contains messages released by Brother Witness Lee between 1984 and 1989 in Taiwan while leading the churches to practice the God-ordained way. Books 1 and 2 contain messages released during two times of training for elders and co-workers. The remaining messages, beginning in Book 3, are compiled according to chronological order. This book is composed of messages released in 1984.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BASING THE DIRECTION OF THE WORK<br />
ON A CONSIDERATION OF OUR HISTORY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has spread from the Chinese-speaking world, that is, from the Chinese language, to many other languages. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has reached the five continents of the world. In this message we will consider the history of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in Taiwan during the past thirty-five years, beginning from 1949. Before 1948 the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was not fully established in Taiwan; hence, that time should not be considered as the initial stage. It should be considered as before the initial stage.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INITIAL STAGE OF<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY IN TAIWAN</h2>
<p>The initial stage of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in Taiwan began in 1949. Before 1949 local churches were not clearly established in Taiwan, because no elders were appointed prior to this time. Before 1949 there were some small churches, or rather, there were meetings in various places in Taiwan, but the responsible ones who had been spontaneously produced had not been appointed as elders. The first elders were appointed in the church in Taipei.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1949 the ministry in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery began the work in Taiwan with a conference. After this the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in Taiwan began to take shape; that was more than thirty-five years ago, a third of a century. This period, which cannot be considered short, is our history. We must look back and consider those early years in order to learn and to receive practical light instead of being idealistic.</p>
<p>I came to Taiwan in 1949. Before then I had served in more than two churches, and by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, my service was successful. The first church was the church in Chefoo. The success of the church in Chefoo was witnessed by many brothers. After the victory in the Sino-Japanese War in 1945, I met with Brother Nee and fellowshipped concerning what I had practiced in Chefoo, that is, concerning the way I had led the church. Brother Nee encouraged me to be diligent to continue my practice in the other churches. Hence, I was bold to lead the church in Shanghai, and the result was obvious to all. If it had not been for the change in the political situation, the church in Shanghai would have been a great success.</p>
<p>Despite the success that we had in Chefoo and Shanghai, after coming to Taiwan, we felt that some of the things that we had practiced were unnecessary. We therefore dropped the unnecessary items. As a result, the work in Taiwan was a new beginning. We began with about five hundred saints, and by 1956 we had thirty thousand saints. When we invited Brother T. Austin-Sparks in 1957, we had more than fifty thousand saints. But his visit gave rise to a storm among us, and after that storm, all that we had done from 1949 to 1957 was diluted.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE COMPREHENSIVE LEADING AND THE PRACTICE<br />
OF MEETING IN DISTRICTS AND GROUPS</h2>
<p>There were several characteristics of the work that we began in Taiwan. One feature was to hold trainings that were comprehensive in nature. The best training was in 1953; it was a training on truth, life, the church, and the gospel. The aspect of the training that was on the church included service. Those who attended the trainings know that that particular training was comprehensive. As a result, the leading in the church was also comprehensive. We did not overemphasize any point; rather, we paid equal attention to truth, life, the church, and the gospel. These trainings were very successful, and our numbers in the churches increased greatly. As our numbers increased, we began meeting in separate meeting halls, and because our numbers continued to increase, the meeting halls were divided into districts.</p>
<p>At that time we did not use the term <em>group.</em> Even though Brother Nee used the term <em>districts,</em> based on Acts 2:46, which says that the believers met &ldquo;from house to house,&rdquo; he did not have the way to practice it. The turmoil in the church in Shanghai prevented him from putting this into practice. After the turmoil the church stopped meeting. That was in 1942. That same year the church in Chefoo had a great revival. The church in Chefoo put the matter of meeting in districts fully into practice, but we did not have the practice of meeting in smaller groups. During that time our numbers increased but not such that we needed to divide into smaller groups.</p>
<p>When we came to Taiwan, we did not meet only in halls, which were equivalent to what Brother Nee called districts. We divided every hall into smaller groups, which we called districts. Due to the constant increase in our numbers, we had to consider how to take care of the new believers who were being added to us. The Lord reminded us of what He had done in the wilderness when He distributed the loaves&mdash;He had the people sit down in groups (Mark 6:39-40). Based on this principle, we began to further divide the districts into groups, and we met in halls, districts, and groups. In those seven years our numbers increased from five hundred to fifty thousand; that was a hundredfold increase. Once we had a baptism meeting for newly saved ones that began at six o&rsquo;clock on Saturday evening. Even though we were baptizing people in three different meeting halls, we could not finish all the baptisms that night, so we continued baptizing people on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. On that occasion we baptized more than seven hundred people.</p>
<p>If we had continued meeting in halls, districts, and groups, I do not know how many people we would have gained. Five hundred saints increased to fifty thousand within seven years; that is more than a hundredfold increase. From 1957 until today we have passed through four seven-year periods. In the beginning of the four seven-year periods, we met in halls, districts, and groups; however, after Brother Sparks visited us, we were distracted in our practice. If we had not changed our direction, we could have gained at least two hundred thousand in the following seven-year periods. A conservative estimate is that we would have a total of two hundred fifty thousand saints. We increased from five hundred saints to fifty thousand saints. If we use this fifty thousand increase as the base, in another seven years we should have gained another fifty thousand. We believe this would have been possible.</p>
<p>We had some definite experiences in mainland China, and we knew which experiences were useful for the building of the church and which were not. Hence, after the Lord brought us to Taiwan, we continued the useful practices and dropped the practices that were not useful. Not only so, we added a new practice of dividing into groups. Before 1952 only one sister and I were serving full time. In 1952 approximately one hundred brothers and sisters joined us to serve full time. After the comprehensive training in 1953, the one hundred full-timers went to carry out their function in the different halls, districts, and groups. This is the way that our numbers increased to fifty thousand in just a few years.</p>
<p>We invited Brother T. Austin-Sparks because we wanted to receive spiritual help; however, as a result of his visit, our practice was diluted. After 1958 we stopped paying attention to the district meetings, and we did not establish any more district meetings or group meetings. This practice was washed away during that storm. The dissenting ones said that we did not have a vision and that the leading co-workers were finished. This was in 1959. Everyone was influenced by this speaking, and many were carried away to speak of a vision and of spirituality. As a result, our initial practice was set aside, and we returned to the way of Christianity in which we gathered the brothers and sisters either for the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting or to preach the gospel. No one paid attention to meeting in districts or groups. The leading we had in our first seven years was blown completely away like a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>Today, nearly twenty-eight years after 1957, our numbers are less than what they were then. We have decreased, not increased. During these past twenty-eight years some brothers and sisters have passed away, some have become cold, others have backslidden, still others have gone abroad, and there are those with whom we have lost contact. The number of new ones is equal only to the number of brothers and sisters who were lost. We now know the reason for this: we abandoned the practice that we had during our first seven years in Taiwan, and we returned to the traditional way of Christianity, which is to meet to preach the gospel and to listen to messages.</p>
<p>It is an undeniable fact that the way of meeting in halls, districts, and groups is beneficial to the increase of numbers in the church. However, for the past thirty years we have abandoned this practice; hence, our numbers have not increased. This has been a huge loss to us. Moreover, we have not seen any accomplishment in spirituality or in life. We do not pursue the truth, and we fall short in spirituality and in the growth in life. This is not true only of Taiwan; most of the brothers and sisters in the churches in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong are not clear about the truth. Hence, we can say that we are doing an average job in the gospel, we are not strong in the church life, we have no goal concerning the truth, and we have no accomplishments in spirituality and in life. On the contrary, we have abandoned our strong point, our special skill, which is the practice of meeting in halls, districts, and groups. Therefore, our numbers have been reduced. We can say that our loss is greater than our gain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO PAY ATTENTION TO NUMBERS</h2>
<p>We must learn the lesson of paying attention to the truth, to life, to the church life, and to the gospel. We must also pay attention to the number of saints in the meetings. If a church has no quantity, how can it have quality? For this reason, we have not produced many elders or co-workers over the past twenty-seven years. If, instead of neglecting our early practice, we had continued to the present, I believe that we would have produced many elders and full-time serving ones, and our numbers would have increased greatly. Moreover, although we cannot say with assurance that our condition in life would be better than it is today, we believe that it would not be worse. We can also say that concerning the truth, our condition would not be worse than it is today; of course, we do not dare say that it would be better. The same applies to the church life, we dare not say that our condition would be better than it is today, but at least it would not be worse. However, we can say with certainty that we have decreased in numbers. It would be a great thing to have more than three hundred thousand brothers and sisters in Taiwan. This would be a huge asset that would enable us to do many things.</p>
<p>We are studying our past history solely with the view of analyzing it in order to learn some lessons from it. From now on our work must pay attention to numbers, and we must give people the truth. We must train the believers who are added to us in the truth; we must also help them grow in life. Our meeting life, that is our church life, must be strengthened and enriched, and we must pay attention to the gospel to take care of our numbers. As soon as we gain people through the gospel, we must bring them to the meetings in the districts and in the groups. We must learn these things and pay close attention to them.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">BASING THE DIRECTION OF THE WORK<br />
ON A CONSIDERATION OF OUR HISTORY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BLESSING OF THE TRUTH<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>There has been no lack of the Lord&rsquo;s mercy among us; to this day the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is still among us. The greatest proof of this is that the Lord&rsquo;s speaking among us has not ceased. The invention of various means of transportation and the development of various methods of communication, such as the telephone, telegraph, television, and radio have made the world smaller, just like a village. In former days there were less than one hundred homes in a village, and many factors influenced communication. If the village was on a river, when the river flooded, the roads were impassable. People had to wait until the waters receded before they could resume communication. Today, however, news spreads quickly from one place in the world to another. Even though we are in the Far East, what happens anywhere in the world will be transmitted to us; it is very easy for us to receive news from other parts of the world.</p>
<p>We have observed that for the past thirty-nine years, from the end of the Second World War in 1945 until today in 1984, only a few books of spiritual value have been published; this includes those published in English and in Chinese. Many reference books that expound the meaning of words used in the Bible in their original language have been published in America during the last twenty years. The publication of such books has been very helpful. Apart from these reference books, however, there has been a lack of publications with spiritual value. At the end of the last century and at the beginning of this century, there was an abundant supply of spiritual materials; expositions of the Bible were published in great quantities. However, we have not seen such a situation in the past few years.</p>
<p>On the contrary, over the past eleven years the semiannual trainings in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have been trainings on the Bible. This year there will be one more training, from the standpoint of life, in which we will complete the Life-study of the New Testament. We have strong proof that the Life-study messages are warmly received everywhere. We have received over a thousand letters of appreciation from the five continents concerning the Life-study messages. As we have the opportunity, we want to print these letters so that everyone can read the words of appreciation.</p>
<p>For more than fifty years we have printed new books every month. We have observed that during the past fifty years, Christians have begun to treasure the Bible more&mdash;they like to read expositions of the Bible. This shows that Christians desire the truth. Hence, the main direction of our work is to strengthen the truth; the truth among us should surpass our experience in the divine life. We should never say that life comes first; actually, truth should be first. Andrew Murray once said that what a strong minister of the word speaks should always surpass his experience. If his speaking is not higher than his experience, his ministry is not high. In other words, the truth should have preeminence. We must first strengthen the truth among us, then life, and then the church life. Our church life must be uplifted; this requires us to preach the gospel. In order to preach the gospel, we must open our homes and use them for the gospel because the Bible clearly shows that the early believers preached the gospel from house to house (Acts 5:42). Meeting in the homes is the way to gain people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE</h2>
<p>Since the time of the apostles, we are probably the only group of believers who practice the church life by meeting in districts. We are definitely the first group of Christians to meet in small groups. When we were in mainland China, we did not meet in small groups; we met only in districts and in halls. It was not until we came to Taiwan that we began to meet in small groups. First we met in halls, then the halls were divided into districts, and then the districts were formed into groups. This practice is unique among us. We practiced this from 1949 to 1957, and our numbers increased from five hundred to fifty thousand. Based on this, we can say that we were successful. Regrettably, we were distracted and abandoned this practice. As a result, our numbers no longer increased. We regret this fact.</p>
<p>We recently read a book by a Catholic priest that was published in Hong Kong. The book praises our practice of meeting in homes. When people in Hong Kong build houses, they drive beams into the ground for support. Hence, the book implies that if the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches want to be rooted and to spread, they must build with beams; they must pay attention to basic matters. The book makes particular reference to meeting from house to house. It cites the local church in Taiwan and praises us. However, in these few years we have neglected the practice of meeting from house to house. This is regrettable.</p><h2 class="head1">NUMBERS BEING THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORK</h2>
<p>In serving the Lord in the localities, we must understand that people are our capital. How can the work spread if our numbers remain the same for five years? How can we increase? We must learn practical lessons. It is not sufficient just to lead people to study the Bible. We must also pay attention to our numbers; otherwise, we have no foundation. At the time of Pentecost the Lord saved three thousand people in one day through Peter, and on another day He saved five thousand. In a short time there were eight thousand new believers, and they could function. We cannot go to a place and merely lead the saints to study the Bible or help them to be spiritual; neither should we be satisfied with a few saints gathering together. We must realize that according to church history, spiritual giants have failed because they paid attention only to being spiritual; they disregarded everything else. As a result, they had no posterity. We must not take this way.</p>
<p>Let us use our body as an example. Our health is very important. If we pay attention to education and gaining knowledge at the expense of our physical health, in the end we will have nothing. If there are no people in the church, the church has nothing. If we have the same number of people for twenty years, not much can be accomplished or developed.</p>
<p>We were in Taiwan for thirty-five years before we spread to America. I now see our young people whose parents were married after we began the work in Taiwan. When their parents were young, their families were very poor, but today these young people have doctoral degrees. This shows that our young people have potential. If one has descendants, he has hope; having descendants is more beneficial than having a doctoral degree or great wealth. One son of a brother who was a cab driver obtained his doctoral degree in America, and his brother became a medical doctor. This father is very happy. Suppose we only preserve a group of older saints by leading them to study the Bible and be spiritual, and after twenty years we still have the same group of saints but no new ones have been added. Our work will have no spread, no second generation, and no future. Having a second generation depends on our numbers.</p>
<p>If we had continued the work according to our service during the first seven years in Taiwan, our numbers today would be very large. Hong Kong has a population of more than five million people, and the church there has a thirty-five-year history. In 1950 Brother Nee brought in a revival in Hong Kong; that was also the year he arranged for me to go there and serve. In the first few years that I was there, everything flourished. If the church had continued to increase at the same rate, there would be at least thirty thousand saints in the church in Hong Kong. If the church had been willing to follow our early practice in Taiwan&mdash;having meetings in halls, districts, and groups&mdash;it would have at least twenty to thirty thousand brothers and sisters today. We must pay attention to numbers.</p>
<p>We want our numbers to increase, but we cannot use the methods in Christianity, such as speaking in tongues, miraculous healings, and gaining material prosperity. We cannot do these things. We need to serve with the truth, the divine life, the church, and the gospel, and we need to meet in halls, districts, and groups. If we do this, our numbers will spontaneously increase. I am setting this matter before you for our consideration, fellowship, and prayer. We must learn not to be satisfied with our present situation. Brother Sparks is a good warning to us. No one spoke higher than he from the standpoint of spiritual ministry. However, eventually the Lord had no way to go on in his group, because he did not want the church. We are able to maintain a certain number of people, because we have the church life, but if we reject the church life, we will have nothing, not even numbers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECOND GENERATION<br />
OF OUR WORK DEPENDING ON NUMBERS</h2>
<p>Many years ago I did not understand how a ministry as high as Brother Sparks&rsquo;s could come to almost nothing. Now I am clear that it is because he did not care for the church or for meeting in halls and districts. This can be compared to a person who pursues a doctoral degree but does not care for his physical health. He may eventually obtain his degree, but he will lose his health. Even though the brother who was a cab driver never obtained a doctoral degree, he was healthy, and he raised two children who were both very successful. He has a second generation, a continuation.</p>
<p>We should examine our work to see whether there is a second generation. This depends on numbers. We must gain a good number of people and maintain them in order to carry out the work in the way we desire. Our capital lies in our numbers. We must have capital before we can accomplish anything. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy there are two to three thousand saints between the ages of twenty-five and forty in Taipei who have a heart to serve the Lord. We look to the Lord to know how to motivate these two or three thousand saints. We hope that at least one or two hundred full-time serving ones can be produced from among them.</p>
<p>In previous messages we spoke concerning being called. Paul was a full-timer, but he also made tents for a living. This means that we should not think that full-timers cannot have a job. We should not have this concept. Taiwan is peaceful and prosperous, and we have two to three thousand saints who are college graduates. We should encourage them to give some of their time to preach the gospel. In the past, Christianity preached the gospel by establishing a mission board, collecting donations, and hiring the people whom they trained and sent out. Sometimes, however, the people they sent out would preach the gospel for seven to eight years and gain only five or six people. Today Taiwan is full of human capital. Many young people have been constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love, and they desire to be trained and sent out to preach the gospel. Several thousand young people have consecrated themselves for this. I believe that the Lord will surely take care of their living. I also hope we can learn to do a living work, not a dead work.</p>
<p>When I returned to Taiwan in 1966, I was concerned about the number of young people in Taipei. There were over a hundred high schools, colleges, and universities, and there were many brothers and sisters in these schools. We even had more than three hundred brothers and sisters studying at National Taiwan University. This was a time when we needed to know how many brothers and sisters were in the schools in Taipei. In 1966 I suggested that we aim for ten thousand children in the children&rsquo;s work. At present, we do not have even two thousand children in the children&rsquo;s meetings; there may be only five hundred. This situation is not right. We have three thousand five hundred brothers and sisters who regularly attend the meetings. If we consider every couple to be a household unit, we should have more than one thousand households. And if every household has two children, we should have more than two thousand children. But we have only five hundred children in the children&rsquo;s meetings. This proves that there is a big lack in the children&rsquo;s work. We speak concerning spirituality and the divine life every day, but there is no progress in our service. This is not acceptable.</p>
<p>We must rise up to care for these matters. We need to know the number of saints in the church in Taipei, how many households there are, how many children are in the households, and the ages and grades of the children. We should get this information in the shortest time possible. Then we will know how many teachers we need for the children&rsquo;s meetings. If all the brothers and sisters teach the children, we will quickly have four to five thousand children.</p>
<p>We fellowshipped concerning the children&rsquo;s work in 1966; that was eighteen years ago. A child who was twelve years old at that time would be thirty now. In other words, the children whom we cared for in 1966 are at least thirty years old now. If we had worked with ten thousand children in 1966, we would have ten thousand young brothers and sisters today. Some may say that our present situation is according to God&rsquo;s will; otherwise, there might be false believers among us. However, we must have quantity before we can have quality. Of course, not all the children would have remained, but at least sixty percent would have remained; out of ten thousand children at least six thousand would be in the church life today. Now we are busy doing our best to preach the gospel, but the number of people we have saved still has not reached six thousand. Beginning in 1966, if the church in Taipei had focused on only the children&rsquo;s work, there would be at least six thousand brothers and sisters who were properly brought up in the church. We must give this careful consideration.</p><h2 class="head1">ABANDONING THE OLD WAYS</h2>
<p>If these messages cannot be put into practice, they should not be spoken. We frequently waste time and lead the saints the wrong way. We should never repeat the same mistakes. We must abandon our old ways and research in order to conduct our business to make a profit for the Lord. There may be reasons to continue some of the practices from the past, but why should we continue the things that do not work? Should we continue digging a well in the same spot where we have not found water? Can we not find another place to dig a well? Should we continue farming on a piece of land that does not grow anything? Should we waste seed on such land? Rather, we should either find another piece of land or till the soil, but we cannot continue in our old ways.</p>
<p>We must all wake up, evaluate our work, and change our direction. We cannot continue as we have in the past. We need a new start with more Christ, more life, more zeal for preaching the gospel, more people, and more open homes. Receive my exhortation in love and change your old ways. Why do you continue in your old ways that have no result? We must not be foolish. We must seek the Lord in order to improve our way of doing things.</p>
<p>There are benefits to meeting in districts. Even the weak saints will rise up if they form a new district meeting. Initially the district meetings might not be uplifted or high. The children in a family cannot be compared to their older brothers and sisters or to their parents. They must be taught and perfected. We must start where the saints currently are in order to bring them to the level of completion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING COMPREHENSIVELY IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Our work must be comprehensive. Brother Austin-Sparks suffered a loss in his ministry because he focused only on being spiritual. As a result, he had no second generation. Even though we should take this as a warning, we must not focus merely on numbers. We must also have the truth, the divine life, and a proper, transcendent, and living church life. This is our comprehensive leading. During our first seven years in Taiwan, the work was correct because it was comprehensive. Later we were influenced to emphasize the pursuit of spirituality. Although it is not wrong to pursue spirituality, we lost some of the blessing that we had in the beginning because we overemphasized spirituality. Rather than overemphasizing any item, we should be comprehensive. We care for the truth, life, the church life, preaching the gospel, and meeting in districts and small groups to gain people and preserve them.</p>
<p>We must be able to keep the people we gain. This can be compared to building a house&mdash;a person must first obtain the necessary material before he can build. No one expects to build a house with a pile of twenty bricks. That would be impossible. He must have a sufficient number of bricks in order to build a house. Therefore, we must have people to whom we teach the truth and whom we perfect in life.</p>
<p>We have listened to many messages. However, our present need is to analyze what has been our practice for the past thirty-five years to learn what brought us profit and what caused us to suffer loss. We must pick up what is beneficial and drop what caused us to suffer loss. We must have a comprehensive leading, and we must have meetings in districts and in groups. At the same time, we cannot have district and group meetings without paying attention to the truth, life, and the church life. We are the Lord&rsquo;s recovery because we have seen the divine revelation of the Body of Christ and the golden lampstands in every locality.</p>
<p>We have the full assurance that the district and group meetings can preserve the saints. As long as we meet in districts and in groups, we will be able to keep the new believers in the church life, they will become the second generation of the church, and we can educate and perfect them. The ones who receive a good education and are well nourished will be remaining fruit in the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING IN DISTRICTS AND GROUPS<br />
FOR CHURCH SERVICE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE PATTERN OF THE LORD JESUS<br />
FORMING SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord Jesus fed five thousand people with five loaves and two fish (14:14-21). This was a great miracle. The Lord commanded the disciples to have the people sit down in groups by fifties and by hundreds (Mark 6:39-40; Luke 9:14-15). In this way the huge crowd was properly arranged. Since there were about five thousand men in the crowd, not including women and children, there were probably more than ten thousand people present.</p>
<p>When the crowd saw that the Lord Jesus was going to distribute the five loaves and two fish to the people, there could have been chaos if they had not been seated in groups; some of the children might have been trampled to death. Under these conditions it was important to arrange the people to sit down in groups. Otherwise, it would have been difficult to maintain order. There was no possibility for a chaotic situation when the crowd was seated.</p>
<p>In the church service there is the aspect of arranging the saints in groups. The Lord Jesus first gave the loaves to the disciples, who then gave them to the crowd, which was divided into groups. In this way God&rsquo;s miracle was manifested, but it was in an orderly fashion without any chaos. After feeding the crowd, the Lord Jesus commanded the disciples to gather up the leftovers (Matt. 14:20; Mark 6:43). This truly was a sweet service.</p>
<p>In Christianity arrangements are not made according to this principle. Rather, they do things in the way of organization. There is a difference between arranging and organizing. There is no organization in the church, but there are arrangements in church service. When the Lord Jesus distributed the bread, He did not call a meeting of the board of directors to elect a chairman. That is organization and is prevalent in Christianity. The church does not do things in this way; instead, the church makes arrangements according to practical needs. Such arrangements are living and are a tremendous help to the Lord&rsquo;s work. When the Lord distributed the bread, He commanded the disciples to have the people sit down in groups. Moreover, after they finished eating, He did not allow the disciples to end the service in a careless way. He had them pick up what was left over of the broken pieces. When they counted the baskets, there were twelve baskets full. The Lord caused the service to be done in an orderly way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF HAVING ALL THINGS COMMON<br />
AT THE TIME OF PENTECOST</h2>
<p>At the time of Pentecost the Jews were under the Romans. Since most of the saints were poor, there was the practice of having all things common (Acts 2:44; 4:32). If there were no poor saints, that is, if everyone was moderately well-off, there would have been no need to have all things common. The practice of having all things common proves that many of the saints were poor. On the day of Pentecost three thousand people were baptized and added to the church, and some among them were poor. Hence, the Holy Spirit moved and caused the rich to bring forth their possessions to distribute among the poor (2:45). This is entirely different from communism.</p>
<p>Peter and the apostles were not as capable as the Lord Jesus. The Lord knew how to prevent disorder, but the apostles did not. Hence, even though the believers had all things in common, complaints arose when the Jews who spoke Greek, the Hellenists, were neglected in the distribution of food (6:1). Only then did the apostles make arrangements. If the apostles had had the same view as the Lord Jesus, they would have made arrangements for the believers from the day of Pentecost, and there would have been no problem. The fact that the apostles did not do this shows that even though they were filled with the Holy Spirit, they did not have the foresight of the Lord, and they were unable to prevent these complaints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLES OF STEPHEN AND PHILIP</h2>
<p>After the complaints, the apostles chose seven men to serve tables, one of whom was Stephen. The book of Acts does not record how Stephen served tables, but it does record his disputing the truth with the Jews (v. 9). In those days there were many synagogues in Jerusalem, and one of them was called the synagogue of the Libertines. This was the gathering place of the Libertine Jews from Rome. Members of the synagogue of the Libertines and of other synagogues rose up to dispute with Stephen, because they were zealous for the Jewish religion and for the God of their Jewish fathers. Stephen did not merely serve tables; he had a gift to speak for the Lord (7:2-53). The message that he spoke in Acts 7 began with the calling of Abraham and developed in a very logical manner. Stephen was truly bold and courageous when he said, &ldquo;You always oppose the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 51).</p>
<p>Philip was another one of the seven serving ones. This was not the Philip who was among the twelve apostles. In Acts 8:5 Philip left Jerusalem and went down to Samaria to preach the gospel, and in 21:8 he is called Philip the evangelist. He was one of the four gifts mentioned in Ephesians 4:11. Some Bible expositors have said that in the choosing of seven to serve, Philip, who was an evangelist, should not have been chosen to serve tables. Whether or not he was an evangelist, Philip was a person full of the Spirit and of wisdom. If the apostles had allowed others to do this service instead of arranging for ones full of the Spirit and wisdom to serve tables, there would have been more complaints. It was not wrong to choose one who was an evangelist, because he was full of the Spirit and of wisdom. Foolish believers would be unable to carry out such a service. Both Philip and Stephen needed wisdom in order to preach the gospel and teach the word, and this wisdom was a help in serving tables, in managing the distribution of food. This required making some arrangements.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ERROR OF CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>Christianity&rsquo;s belief in organization is based on the apostles&rsquo; appointing seven men to serve tables. The Chinese term for <em>organization</em> does not necessarily imply hierarchy, but in English the term <em>hierarchy</em> is often associated with religious organizations. The development of hierarchy among believers began in the second century when Ignatius, a Bible expositor, erroneously taught that elders and overseers are two different groups of people. This teaching led to the establishing of hierarchy among the believers. In Acts 20:17 Paul called for the elders of the church in Ephesus. In verse 28 he said, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God.&rdquo; This indicates that <em>elders</em> and <em>overseers</em> refer to the same people. <em>Elder</em> denotes a person&rsquo;s condition; he is a person who is somewhat mature. <em>Overseer</em> denotes the function and responsibility of an elder, which is to oversee the church. Ignatius, however, taught that elders were lower than overseers and only responsible for one locality, while overseers were higher and responsible for churches in a region. This erroneous teaching brought in a hierarchy of elders and bishops and eventually archbishops, cardinals, and the pope.</p>
<p>In society it is difficult to form people into a group without organization. But according to history, the formation of the nation of Israel did not depend on organization. Soon after man was scattered in Genesis 11, kings were produced. Hence, kings are a natural issue when humans form nations. Throughout the years of human history, human society has always had kings. However, when the people of Israel were established as a nation, God did not want them to have a king; He did not want them to have organization. He gave them only the priesthood, and they were governed by the priesthood. They also had the five books of Moses as their law and constitution. The nation of Israel was established by their dependence on the books of law in the Old Testament. The books of law do not speak of a national assembly, a king, or members of a cabinet. The nation of Israel had only a unique priesthood who taught the people. When there were problems among them, the high priest would bring the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim into the presence of God (Exo. 28:30). God&rsquo;s leading was revealed by means of light shining through the Urim and the Thummim.</p>
<p>Later the children of Israel followed the custom of the nations and insisted that Samuel appoint a king for them (1 Sam. 8:5, 19-20). Even though Jehovah their God was their King, they wanted another king. This offended God (v. 7; 12:17). It was Jehovah who sent Moses and Aaron to lead their fathers out of Egypt; He also saved them out of the hands of their enemies all around (vv. 8, 11). Therefore, God was the heavenly and living King of Israel. If God were not living, how could the Urim and the Thummim in the breastplate shine? Nevertheless, the people of Israel wanted a king, and in 9:17 God gave them Saul. Saul was a negative king, who was used by God to discipline the people of Israel. After Saul, God established the proper kingship with David. David was not of the tribe of Levi; he was not a priest who was required to wear an ephod or the breastplate, yet he wore a linen ephod (30:7). This implies that David was not like the kings of the Gentile nations. Rather, he was like a priest who wore the breastplate to inquire of God.</p>
<p>This light concerning organization is lacking in Christianity. Many think that when the apostles laid their hands upon people at the time of Pentecost, they were setting up an organization. If this were the case, who organized the apostles on the day of Pentecost? Who appointed Stephen to teach the word or Philip to preach the gospel as an evangelist? Neither of them was appointed by man. They were appointed by the Holy Spirit. This is referred to in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14: the Spirit gives gifts to men. There was no organization at the time of Pentecost.</p>
<p>Some may ask whether the prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch were a form of organization. Was Paul&rsquo;s becoming an apostle not a matter of organization? This had nothing to do with organization. Paul and Barnabas were not appointed according to man&rsquo;s will; they were set apart by the Holy Spirit. According to Acts 13:1-3 the prophets and teachers in Antioch gathered and prayed, and the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&rdquo; This was not organization. Paul and Barnabas were not apostles. It was after they were sent out that they were referred to as apostles (14:4-5, 14). This indicates that they became apostles when they were sent out; an apostle is one who is sent out. This is not a matter of organization.</p>
<p>Ignatius made a big mistake, and based on that mistake the Catholic Church believes that a priest governs only a small church; above priests are bishops, who are over regions; above bishops are archbishops; and above archbishops are cardinals, who are cabinet ministers of the church and form a central governing body called the curia. A person rises from being a priest to a bishop, then to an archbishop, and then to a cardinal. When he becomes a cardinal, he can participate in the election of the pope. When the pope dies, the cardinals hold an election among themselves to choose the next pope from among themselves. The pope is at the top, the cardinals and archbishops are beneath him, next are the bishops, and under them are priests. This is religious hierarchy. But the Lord Jesus&rsquo; asking the disciples to make the people sit down in groups and the apostles&rsquo; arranging for seven men to distribute food to the saints were not related to hierarchy.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE IN TAIPEI</h2>
<p>More than thirty years ago we began the service in Taipei. Our first meeting hall was on Ren Ai Road. In 1949 the number of people in the church increased thirtyfold. We went from a little over thirty saints to nine hundred. This made it impossible to continue meeting in one hall, so we split into districts. Every district met in a separate hall, and we called these meetings district meetings. Later the number of saints continued to increase. It was truly the Lord&rsquo;s leading that in six to seven years we had an increase of one hundred percent; our numbers reached fifty thousand. Regrettably, when Brother Sparks came, he diluted this situation. Our original intention in inviting Brother Sparks was for spiritual help. We never expected that he did not care for the ground of the church and for the practice of the church; he did not even care if there was a church.</p>
<p>A person must take care of his health because his body supports his soul. Then his spirit can be enlivened. The work of Brother Sparks did not take care of this principle; it only cared for being spiritual. This can be compared to caring for a person by educating him but not feeding him. Eventually the person will die. It is better not to risk one&rsquo;s health and posterity merely for the sake of education. Otherwise, a person has no real glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DISTRACTED BY BROTHER SPARKS</h2>
<p>Brother Sparks&rsquo;s mistake was that he did not have a second generation. The brothers among us who were influenced by Brother Sparks have experienced this same end. They said that they saw the vision, but after more than twenty years, we do not see the issue of their vision. They do not have a second generation. Due to the influence of Brother Sparks, we stopped increasing. From 1957 to 1958 our numbers reached fifty thousand. Today there are less than fifty thousand brothers and sisters on the entire island. For the past twenty years our work has been able only to fill in the gaps left by people becoming old and dying or becoming cold and backslidden or emigrating. Our numbers are not even at fifty thousand, because we gave up our initial practice of meeting in districts and groups.</p>
<p>We must see that meeting in homes by districts and in groups is not organization. It is to meet a practical need, and can be compared to the Lord Jesus&rsquo; feeding the five thousand. Groups and homes are referred to in the Bible. Groups are in Mark 6:39-40 where the Lord Jesus told the people to sit down in groups; homes are referred to in Acts 2:46 when the early saints broke bread and met from house to house.</p>
<p>In the church life there is the need for arrangements with respect to service. For example, when we have a conference for more than ten thousand people, we make many arrangements for the needs of the meetings; however, this is not organization but, rather, coordination. We should not say that coordination is not important. It is like a person who eats three meals a day to meet the needs of his body so that he can continue to live. Furthermore, he cannot fail to take a shower and wash his face every day, since these are related to human life. Otherwise, he will have problems. Any arrangement that we make for our existence is not a matter of organization but of necessity. Philip&rsquo;s true ministry was that of an evangelist, but when a temporary need arose, he helped with serving tables. Even if you arrange the meeting place or help with the electrical equipment, you can still function as an apostle, as a prophet, or as an evangelist, just like Stephen and Philip.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE SECRET FROM THE LORD</h2>
<p>On the one hand, we must understand that we do not have organization and that we make arrangements to meet the needs in the church. On the other hand, we must be clear that these practical arrangements are not necessarily related to our gift. For example, after a mother arranges all the meals for her children in the home, she still has to work in her profession; and after the children finish eating their meal, they still must go to school to obtain an education. Some things are done out of necessity, and others are done as our profession. The things that we need to do should not be considered as matters of organization. At the same time, these things cannot really be considered as service. For service, we must learn to function in life, not just out of necessity.</p>
<p>Most Christians do not understand this. They think that our conferences are a matter of organization. Some people even say that I am the best organizer. They say that the main reason our work flourishes and we have large numbers is that I am able to organize people.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, Peter and the apostles baptized three thousand people. At that time there were one hundred and twenty serving ones, including the sisters. We believe that the sisters did not baptize anyone and that only the brothers baptized. How did they baptize three thousand people? We need to learn the secret from the Lord.</p>
<p>In 1950 I went to Manila and lived there for three to four months to lead the saints to preach the gospel. By the spring of the next year more than two hundred young people wanted to be baptized. The elders were worried because they had never baptized so many people on the same day. They wondered how this would be accomplished. Since it took them about fifteen minutes to baptize one person, they felt that they would be able to baptize only about four people in an hour. I trained them to arrange the people into groups, and then while one group went into the water, another group would be changing their clothes. There were also saints who were mopping the floor. In this way we baptized all the young people in less than two hours. This was an example of arranging the people to sit down in groups and giving them bread to eat.</p>
<p>We are here to experience life; however, in the process of experiencing life, we must coordinate practical matters. We thank the Lord that from the early days in mainland China and in Taiwan our practice has been for the saints to serve without organization. Even if a brother is an evangelist, when there is a need, he can serve in the meeting hall and work with electrical equipment. In addition, he can still carry out his spiritual ministry. We all should have such an understanding.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING FORMED INTO AN ARMY<br />
TO VISIT DORMANT SAINTS</h1>
<p>From the speaking of the saints from Taipei, we can see that many of them can quote the Bible and the ministry books. Their constitution has a fragrance of the ministry. Even in the seminaries of America, the top theological country, it is difficult to find believers who can use the words <em>essential</em> and <em>economical</em> when they speak.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENLISTING THE SAINTS INTO AN ARMY</h2>
<p>As we consider the situation in Taiwan, we are forced to confess that we still have a serious lack. There is a Chinese saying: &ldquo;What we truly care about inwardly will be manifested outwardly.&rdquo; I have a heavy burden that I can no longer keep inside myself. On one hand, it is good that we enjoy the Lord, but on the other hand, we must go out to fight. We need to recruit brothers and sisters to join an army that will go out and fight for the Lord. The working saints from the ages of twenty-five to forty-five should be in the army; the older saints as well as the younger ones can also be in the army. We should not consider ourselves to be too old to join the army.</p>
<p>Our enjoyment of the Lord has deepened over the past few years. The prayers and praises in the table meeting are better than they were five years ago. As those who are learning and maturing, we must go out to teach what we have learned. A person must not study without imparting what he knows into others. Similarly, a person learning martial arts must not merely do exercises; he must also engage in a fight. Hence, the time has come for us to go out. We must go out to teach, and we must go out to fight.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei has two thousand high quality, young working saints between the ages of twenty-five and forty-five. The church in Taipei has name cards for twenty-three thousand saints who are living in Taipei, but only a little more than three thousand saints are in our meetings. This means that eighty-five percent of our saints are not in meetings. The saints may come to a meeting once a year or once every two years, but most do not come at all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEKING THE DORMANT SAINTS</h2>
<p>It has been almost twenty-three years since I moved away from Taiwan to begin the work in America. During this time the number of people in the church in Taipei has not increased; instead, it has decreased. When I left, there were more than twenty-three thousand saints in the church in Taipei, and about four thousand were in the meetings. After more than twenty years, the situation is still the same. Some brothers say that our low numbers are because some saints passed away, others moved abroad to study, and still others have backslidden. No matter what the excuse may be, we cannot justify our numbers decreasing, instead of increasing, over a period of more than twenty years.</p>
<p>Even though we can now use terms such as <em>essential</em> and <em>economical</em> in a concise yet powerful manner in the meetings, what should we do about all the saints who are wandering and who are not in the meetings? About three thousand five hundred saints enjoy the meetings, but what will we do about the seventeen thousand five hundred who are not in the meetings? We must form an army and devise a plan to solve this problem.</p>
<p>More than one thousand people came to our last gospel meeting, and less than one hundred of them were baptized, yet we felt this was a large number. In our early years we preached the gospel on Saturday afternoons to three thousand people in the amphitheater in New Park and obtained four to five hundred response cards from every meeting. The next day we distributed the cards to the saints so that they could visit the people. Our baptism records show that the greatest number baptized at one time was more than seven hundred, and we did this in three meeting halls simultaneously. In one day we baptized more than four hundred people, and since we could not finish, we continued the next day and baptized over three hundred more. I want to show you our family history. There is nothing for us to boast about in baptizing less than a hundred people in our last gospel meeting. We must never be like the slave who received one talent and thought that the Lord was a hard Master, reaping where He did not sow and gathering where He did not winnow (Matt. 25:24). I am very happy that more than ninety people were baptized as a result of our gospel preaching, but when we think of our history, we cannot rejoice.</p>
<p>In 1949 when we arrived in Taiwan, there were only three to four hundred saints in our meetings. These were brothers and sisters who came to Taiwan with government agencies or hospitals; very few saints came on their own. In the seven years after 1949, we went from less than five hundred saints to fifty thousand; this was a hundredfold increase. At present only one out of seven brothers and sisters comes to the meetings. This has been our situation since 1965, eighteen years ago. It is as if for the past eighteen years we have been the only persons in our family, while many other brothers and sisters have left home. What should we do? We need to be formed into an army to meet this need.</p>
<p>We must consider a strategy to bring back the seventeen thousand brothers and sisters who have been absent from the meetings for a long time. We all must share this responsibility. We cannot be at peace until we find our brothers and sisters and bring them back.</p>
<p>In a routine church life we may be very busy but still be unable to bring the seventeen thousand saints back to the church life. If we would have the determination to find these saints and bring them back, even if we had to give up our jobs, we will be able to accomplish this. We cannot guarantee that all of them will return, but we will be able to recover at least forty percent&mdash;that is almost seven thousand saints. This would be a sweet endeavor.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this goal we must take the lead to voluntarily join the army. Let us forget our age; regardless of our age, we can still join the army We must be so absorbed in going out to find our brothers and sisters that we would not even care for sleep or meals. If our brothers and sisters do not return, we should never have peace in our hearts. We must not think that we are using too much human effort or that we are compelling people too much. We must recover our lost brothers and sisters back to God&rsquo;s house.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>When I returned to Taiwan in 1966 and in 1967, there were four thousand children in the children&rsquo;s meetings, and I told the brothers to set a goal of having ten thousand children in the meetings. I also asked the brothers to perfect the junior high and high school brothers and sisters to assist in teaching the children. These children would be gospel seeds in junior high school, they would be gospel seeds in high school, and they would be gospel seeds in college. They would be seeds the entire time that they are in school.</p>
<p>Suppose the youngest child in the children&rsquo;s work was six years old in 1967. He would now be twenty-three. If we had had ten thousand children in the children&rsquo;s work, there would be at least five thousand saints in the church life today. These calculations show that our &ldquo;business&rdquo; has failed; we have wasted much time and effort. Even though we have been busy in the church life, there are not more than three thousand five hundred saints in the meetings of the church in Taipei. If we had continued the children&rsquo;s work from 1967 until now, the children who were six years old in 1967 would now be twenty-three, and the ones who were twelve would be twenty-nine. Even if only half of the children came into the church life, we would have four to five thousand saints meeting with us.</p>
<p>At present our children&rsquo;s meetings have less than one thousand children. We have about three thousand five hundred saints in the meetings, and of these numbers there are at least one thousand families. If every family has one child, there should be at least one thousand children. This shows that for the past seventeen years we have not been able to cultivate even our own children. This situation is improper and abnormal.</p>
<p>I have been in the Lord&rsquo;s work for more than half a century. During this time I have studied our situation and the situation of the denominations. The Catholic Church has neither gospel campaigns nor great evangelists, and they never advertise. However, every year they gain more than one million converts from among their own children. Seventeen years ago I exhorted you to work until we had ten thousand children. This would not have been difficult. I also explained that the children&rsquo;s meetings did not have to be in the meeting halls; they could be held in the homes of the saints. They could also be held on any day of the week. This way we could gain the children in our neighborhood. Furthermore, I said that we should perfect the young brothers and sisters in junior high, high school, and college to coordinate as teachers in the children&rsquo;s meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CAMPUS WORK</h2>
<p>In 1965 there were many students in our gospel meetings. Most of them were secondary school students, who came in their uniforms. At that time there were more than one hundred high schools, technical institutes, and universities in the city of Taipei, and some brothers and sisters were in every school. At the peak of the campus work at National Taiwan University, we had more than three hundred brothers and sisters on campus. This shows that we had many brothers and sisters who were either students or teachers in the high schools, technical institutes, and universities. Today, however, we have very few students at National Taiwan University, and we barely have a gospel work there. In other words, our work among the young people and the students is lacking. We have not been successful in the children&rsquo;s work, nor have we been successful in the campus work. We have been busy, but instead of our numbers increasing, they have decreased. This should cause us to be concerned.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPREAD OF THE WORK</h2>
<p>We must wake up, be sober, and make some changes; otherwise, our capital, our family inheritance, will gradually diminish. According to our statistics, from 1949 to 1956 our numbers increased one hundredfold; we increased from five hundred saints to fifty thousand. The brothers and sisters who were saved during those years worked in government agencies, hospitals, and businesses; some were even government officials. This shows how widespread our gospel work was.</p>
<p>The books we publish are welcomed everywhere; there are seeking ones in Asia, India, and even Burma. We recently learned that a meeting has been raised up in Burma, and that the saints there are in contact with the saints in Thailand. The saints in Burma even wrote us letters asking for books. Moreover, a brother from Burma sent us a letter of fellowship, in fluent English, in which he wrote that they have around twenty Christian meetings in Burma. The saints there have asked for permission to translate all the Life-study messages into Burmese. We received another letter, probably from a British missionary in Burma, who appreciated our Life-study messages and asked us for permission to translate them for use with their Bible studies. These letters prove that Burma is open. India is also open. There is a high school teacher in southern India, who contacted us while he was studying in the United States. He plans to return to India and begin the church life there after attending the up-coming winter training.</p>
<p>A month ago some believers in a small country called Zimbabwe in Africa wrote us. In their letter they said that they had started meeting, and they asked us for books. We thank the Lord that the publications are going out, but we feel that this is not enough. The truth must go out in more than a fragmentary, scattered way. Any truly firm and solid work cannot be done in a scattered way.</p>
<p>Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty America has passed a law that relaxes the restrictions on Chinese immigration, and many Chinese have immigrated to America. Many of the saints from Taiwan have also immigrated to America. I have been in America for more than twenty years, and I have not promoted a Chinese-speaking work. But last year we felt to begin a Chinese-speaking work because so many brothers and sisters have immigrated to America. All the brothers and sisters who have immigrated to America have relatives, friends, and possessions there. When we contact them, we are welcomed. We have received much blessing in this area.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CALLING YOUNG WORKING SAINTS<br />
TO BE PERFECTED</h2>
<p>It is now more convenient to preach the gospel in Taiwan. Thirty years ago the average level of education in Taiwan was not high, neither was there economic stability, and transportation and communication were not well developed. Today Taiwan is densely populated, and people are concentrated in small areas. Moreover, people have a high level of education, there are economic resources, transportation is convenient, and public security is good. We can say that it is an opportune time to preach the gospel in Taiwan. Therefore, I hope that two hundred of the two thousand young working saints in Taipei will receive a burden to be perfected. We have the essential Spirit within us, and we have the economical Spirit upon us; we have the Spirit within and without for our move. Now we must produce two hundred young working saints who are willing to be trained and be perfected.</p>
<p>If we had continued our initial practice, we would now have over thirty thousand saints actively meeting with us. This is a projection based not on idealism but on statistics. If we say Amen to this word and if we want the church in Taipei to have thirty thousand saints, we need to recover the seventeen thousand saints who do not meet regularly. The elders must give this thorough consideration. I am speaking these words with an intimate spirit, because we are one family. This fellowship concerns the members of our family. We should consider this matter and change; otherwise, we will waste our family inheritance. This is not an individual matter; it is a corporate matter.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING EDUCATED IN THE TRUTH<br />
AND ELIMINATING OPINIONS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LAYING A FOUNDATION OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p><em>Question: How do we have a deeper study of the truths that require further development, such as the twelve precious stones in the New Jerusalem? And how can we be kept from pursuing the truth in a natural way so that we are not led astray?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is a terrible thing when a person does not know the flesh, yet he pursues the truth and sees visions. We have continually emphasized the importance of the truth, hoping that all the saints would know the truth, but the truth can be useful only in the hands of a person who knows the flesh. To those who do not know the flesh, the truth is merely a tool. Hence, the prerequisite to knowing the truth is to know the flesh, the natural life, and the self and to deal with these things seriously.</p>
<p>In pursuing the truth, the younger saints should not begin with studying the twelve precious stones in the New Jerusalem. You should begin by reading what is already published in our books concerning the truth. This must be your foundation, your base. If you would study the twelve precious stones without a foundation, you will get lost. You should begin with the basics. You should be able to give a clear word concerning justification before you can speak concerning the twelve precious stones.</p>
<p>There are approximately forty-five thousand saints in Taiwan. However, of these forty-five thousand, are there even four hundred fifty who can give a clear, thorough, and logical word concerning the truth of justification that would supply light and life to others? I am afraid that not even forty-five saints can speak such a word. You may think that I am being too pessimistic and that instead we should be optimistic and appreciative of our work. If we think this, can we say that there are forty to fifty saints attending the training who can speak concerning justification? Yet we still may consider this to be too elementary and instead want to speak on something higher, such as the twelve precious stones. We need to lay a firm foundation in our education in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We must begin with the most basic spiritual matters.</p>
<p>Suppose we are asked to describe the condition of man according to the Gospel of John. Can we speak about the nine different kinds of people who are in need of Christ as life? In learning the truth we must first lay a solid foundation before we can begin to build. We have to complete elementary school before we can go to junior high school and then high school; otherwise, we will lack a foundation. In everything that we learn, we must be realistic and start with a good foundation.</p>
<p>When someone who knows how to develop an educational system arrives at a certain place, he will begin by starting an elementary school; after an elementary education becomes widespread, he will start a junior high and then a high school. This takes a minimum of twelve years. A work must have a goal. He will not teach some physics today and mathematics tomorrow. Regrettably, the work in Taiwan is done almost entirely in a scattered way. We teach a little of this here and a little of that there, and this is the reason that it is difficult to have results.</p>
<p>During the long period that I have been away from Taiwan, you should have managed to accomplish some great successes in the work. Who would have imagined that the population of Taipei would increase, but the number of saints in the church would decrease? Before I left Taipei, there were about four thousand saints who attended the meetings in the halls on the Lord&rsquo;s Days; there were never less than at least three thousand saints. During these past twenty to thirty years, even if some of the saints have passed away, moved away, or become cold and backslidden, you should still have increased in numbers. But it seems as if you have done nothing in your twenty-three years of work. First, the statistics show that there has been no advance in the work. Second, the work has lost useful ones in all the places; consequently, the number of co-workers has decreased. In the past there were almost one hundred co-workers in Taiwan, but now their number has been reduced greatly. Third, even though the elders in all the localities have shown some improvement, the overall situation of our work has not improved. The reason for this is that the co-workers pay more attention to giving messages than to practical matters.</p>
<p>In order to run an educational system, it is not enough to simply invite famous speakers to come and speak once or twice a month or even every week. The students would not gain anything from this. We all must clearly see this, and we must go step by step to be sure that we have a foundation. At a minimum, we would have a group of &ldquo;elementary school graduates&rdquo; in six years, and we could continue to teach them. Then after sixteen years we would have a group of &ldquo;university graduates.&rdquo; This is the only way to produce useful saints. We cannot leap high without laying a foundation; we cannot work with our heads in the clouds. We must pay attention to being practical and to laying a good foundation in our work.</p><h2 class="head1">BEGINNING WITH THE BASICS<br />
AND NOT TAKING ANY SHORTCUTS</h2>
<p><em>Question: At the beginning of the one-year training we sensed that the burden of the leading brothers was to gather together ones who have a heart for the Lord from each locality and to lead us in a way that is similar to operating a normal school, such as a school for training teachers. Thus, we thought that the training in all of its process, arrangement, and pursuit would be like the operation of a school. Is this how you envisioned the training?</em></p>
<p>Answer: In order to learn the truth, you cannot skip any grades. You must at least graduate from elementary school so that you can have a solid foundation. Even though you have a wealth of assets, you have not gained any of these riches. Few of us can speak concerning the condition of man, but you are eager to speak about the twelve precious stones. This can be compared to attending graduate school before graduating from elementary school. Some of you have been helped to know how to get material from the ministry. However, you should not wait until you have to speak before you study. This will not work. It is not a matter of whether the ministry is full of riches; we need a basic education in the truth. If you have not even attended elementary school, but you want to attend a school to become an elementary school teacher, you are not being practical.</p>
<p>For the past twenty-three years we have emphasized giving messages, but we have not paid attention to perfecting the saints. In principle, giving messages is the same as preaching in the denominations. We have not done the practical work of building up the saints. We have a great wealth of material, but we do not know how to use it. It has been over twenty-three years since I went to America to begin the work there, and during this time I have been raising a cry of warning concerning the work. Regrettably, this word has not been received; consequently, the saints are not being perfected in the truth. Today we must go back to make repairs.</p>
<p>If during the past twenty years we had faithfully carried out some education, then even if we did not have the teachers, we would have an educational system in place, and the saints would be somewhat built up. But the co-workers in both Taiwan and Southeast Asia have not done an adequate work. Our work should not merely consist of giving messages that inspire the listeners but do not impart something solid into them. All elementary school teachers know that teaching a lesson is not a matter of giving an interesting lecture, but instead it depends on getting the lesson into the students so that they can learn how to apply it. This is the way to carry out a practical education.</p>
<p>We should preach the gospel of God&rsquo;s salvation in a clear way so that people will be saved in the divine life. This is not a matter of being eloquent but of enlivening people&rsquo;s spirits through the truth of the gospel. We should then lead the newly saved believers to follow the Lord, read the Bible, and know the truth. We must teach them sequentially, topic by topic, the basic truths, such as forgiveness, justification, and regeneration. We should all be able to do this. Up to the age of twenty-five is the best time for a person to receive an education. It is relatively difficult for a person to receive more education after the age of twenty-five. Hence, the problems with the work in Taiwan must be solved from their roots.</p>
<p>The saints in the church in Taipei need an elementary education in the truth. In our daily living we must know the flesh and exercise to deal with the flesh. According to my observation, the young people, and even the leading ones, are not in harmony or in one accord. A lack of harmony and one accord are manifestations of the flesh. A divisive element in a locality reveals the presence of the flesh. The reason for lack of harmony and discord is that we do not know the flesh; neither do we know the spirit.</p>
<p>Providing the saints with a practical education in the basic truths requires a labor without opinions. All good teachers labor diligently without opinions. Those with many opinions have difficulty teaching. All the problems in the church life are related to opinions. There are opinions about not receiving this or that person and opinions about honoring this or that person. Paul rebukes such opinions and practices as being according to the manner of man, according to the flesh (1 Cor. 3:3). In 1 Corinthians 1:12 Paul says, &ldquo;Each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.&rdquo; The church life is the same as a family. The children who study diligently and seriously do not have opinions, but the children who like to express their opinions are the ones who do not like to study and do not like to do their chores. They express their opinions about everything, and as a result they never do anything. It is not good for children to have opinions, especially since they do not have responsibility for the family. May the Lord have mercy that we would not have opinions.</p>
<p>It is not sufficient merely to have a desire to serve the Lord; you must be humble and receive the necessary help by beginning with the basics. Even though this appears to be a slow process, the results will come very quickly. If you try to skip grades and enter an advanced school before you have finished elementary school, it will not be helpful at all; besides, it is not practical. You must graduate from elementary school and secondary school before obtaining a university education; there is no shortcut. If you rely on your cleverness and consider yourself to be an advanced student who can skip grades, you will gain nothing. You must spend the time to move forward step by step. Even when you understand a basic truth, you must spend more time to gain additional knowledge. There is no shortcut to the learning process in an educational system.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING PRACTICAL<br />
IN CARRYING OUT SPIRITUAL EDUCATION</h2>
<p><em>Question: If we have not graduated from elementary school, is it all right for us to teach at the kindergarten level?</em></p>
<p>Answer: You should not focus on how to teach others; rather, you should study how to teach yourselves. You want to skip many grades and study the twelve kinds of precious stones; this is unrealistic. The church has been on the earth for two thousand years, and the study of the Bible has not yet reached that level. Concerning the revelation of the twelve precious stones, we have just begun to see a little. Hence, you should diligently study the basic truths, such as the condition of man, justification, reconciliation, and sanctification. Furthermore, you should be perfected under the leadership in the work.</p>
<p>During the Sino-Japanese War, there was an educator named Chang, who founded Nankai High School and later Nankai University. He realized that the only way to save China was through education; therefore, he carried out an educational work. If we also have such a view, our work will certainly be different. When we look at the present world situation, how can any country be well-governed without an educational system? To rule a country, one must first pay attention to education. I do not approve of revolutions; however, in order to have a beneficial revolution, the people must first be reformed inwardly. Such an inward reformation begins with education. If China had gathered together her talented people to develop a strong educational system, the situation in China today would be strong. In violent revolutions people fight and oppose each other, and there is a never-ending, fierce struggle. After China overthrew the Manchu Dynasty, she was always in the midst of a revolution, and this dragged the country into a state of poverty. The result was that the common people had no way to make a living, and they even lost the opportunity to obtain an education.</p>
<p>Today as we preach the Lord Jesus, expound the Bible and spiritual matters, and build up the churches, we must carry out a spiritual education; otherwise, the church will have no future. I pity the ones who created troubles among us. The way that they took did not merely harm them personally but also harmed others. If they had been willing to be content and not overreach but function according to their measure, recognizing the flesh, dealing with the self, following the spirit, and learning the truth, they would have been exceedingly useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hands today. Instead, they were unrealistic and would not carry out a practical work.</p>
<p>The entire world is open to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, but we lack manpower. Hence, I encourage the younger generation to consider carefully the way that you will take and not to be impractical. The truth is the truth, just as two plus two always equals four. And just as there is only one Lord Jesus, one Spirit, and one God, so there is only one church. If another church is produced, it must be a mistake and is not according to the truth. The people who have left the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have a hard time in their daily living, because even though they dare not say that the church is wrong, they are not willing to return to the church. They should come back to the church with a heart of repentance, and they should cease from their inward struggles. Even though they once knew the church, now they say that this is not the church. However, deep in their heart, they know that there is no justification for their stand against the truth. Since they cannot acknowledge the unique oneness, they are not in unity. This is their situation today.</p>
<p>We must take a practical and humble way, and we must do our best to work in a practical way without opinions. The Lord has opened a wide door on the island of Taiwan, but regrettably we have not used the good economy, peaceful society, talented people, and the educational system in Taiwan to cooperate with the Lord&rsquo;s work. We must wake up and begin to research how to make an elementary education wide-spread and successful among us. There are almost one hundred churches in Taiwan, which means there is much work that we can do, and this work can be easily accomplished. However, we must not be unrealistic; rather, we must be practical and begin from the basics. We must begin by teaching the basics, and our teaching should enliven the saints. Do not focus on topics like the twelve precious stones. We should speak the basic truths that bring salvation, such as the condition of man, justification, and forgiveness of sin.</p>
<p>We must also learn to reject our opinions and not to exalt others. In 1 Corinthians Paul says, &ldquo;What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Ministers...So then let no one boast in men, for all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas;...all are yours&rdquo; (3:5, 21-22). Paul did not exalt himself, and we should not exalt others, and I beseech you not to exalt me. The concept of exalting people is deep in our bloodstream. We must root it out. In the same way, opinion is also deep in our bloodstream. Today in Taipei there are many who have dissenting opinions. If in the future they are able to do a small amount in the work, will they not feel even more strongly that they are excellent? If this is the case, they will expose their shortcomings and cast themselves aside. As long as you have opinions, there is no need for others to abandon you; you have already cast yourself aside. Opinions are intolerable.</p>
<p>Over the past sixty years the problems that we encountered in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are the issue of dissent, opposition, and criticism. In the church life we must never dissent, oppose, or criticize others. Rather, we must be encouraging of others. Neither should we think that only the elders and co-workers are capable. We should all do our best to function.</p>
<p>We should never justify ourselves, nor should we try to be unique. In the meetings you should speak according to the speaking of the brothers. If the brothers are speaking on the chapter &ldquo;Clothing and Food&rdquo; from <em>Messages for Building Up New Believers,</em> you should follow them and speak the same thing. The key point is whether or not you have any content. If you lack content and the ability to speak, you should not simply express your opinion. Opinions are useless, and opposing others is also useless; the only thing that is helpful is to be practical and quiet in our work. It does not matter which district meeting you go to, you must stand up to speak for the Lord and supply life whenever you are given the opportunity. You must have something real to give to others.</p>
<p>It does not matter who speaks eloquently and who does not; the important thing is how much you supply the church. Your training must begin with this path so that you will become useful workers. Things that are very high and very deep can be brought in gradually. Taiwan is now a vast field, and no one is cultivating it in a practical way. Everyone is working in a scattered way. I hope that you will wake up and begin to work from the most basic foundation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE TRUTH<br />
FOR THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE</h2>
<p><em>Question: When we react differently to a certain matter and are able to overflow with the Lord&rsquo;s virtues, is this an indication that we have some experiences of transformation?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Life and truth are inseparable. When we hear the truth concerning the condition of man, we should consider whether this is our experience. In this way the truth will become our experience. The subjects that we study in school, such as chemistry, physics, mathematics, or geography, do not always relate to our living. However, the truth that we study must become our living.</p>
<p>When we hear the truth concerning justification, reconciliation, and sanctification, we should ask ourselves whether it is our experience. When the truth becomes our experience, our living, it is the reality of our life, and this transforms us. We may feel that we have grown in life simply by listening to messages. But whoever feels that he has grown in life has not really grown. In our physical life we have been growing since the day we were born, even though we did not feel that we were growing. A person who has growth in life understands the truth and experiences the truth. Our experience of life usually follows our knowledge of the truth. The experience of life comes mainly from the opening of the truth; it is rare to have growth in life without the opening of the truth. A person cannot get saved without hearing the truth of the gospel. If we do not know the truth, it will be difficult for us to experience the truth.</p>
<p>We must make progress in the truth, because our progress in the truth causes us to grow in life. However, if we study the truth without allowing it to work in us, we will merely be engaging in theological research. True growth in life cannot be separated from the truth. If we have no knowledge of the truth, it will be difficult for us to grow in life. Hence, we must study the truth diligently. Furthermore, what we experience must be added to our study of the truth. We should not worry about how transformed we are; rather, we should consider our experience of the truth.</p>
<p>If we have not experienced an item of the truth, we should pray until it becomes our experience. Our experience of life never surpasses our knowledge of the truth; however, our knowledge often surpasses our experience. This means that we first know the truth and then have the experience of life. This is especially true of the ministers of the Word. When their speaking does not surpass their experience, their speaking is weak and poor. If a person speaks a strong, rich word, it is because his knowledge of the truth surpasses his experience. The more his knowledge of the truth surpasses his experience, the stronger and richer his speaking will be. However, his experience must follow. If his experience does not follow, the level of his truth will never increase. In order to raise the level of our truth, we must have the experience of life. Hence, the reality of life depends on having the experience concerning the truth. We must do our best to know the truth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">LABORING WITH NO OPINIONS<br />
AND TAKING THE BODY AS THE GOAL<br />
OF THE SERVICE IN THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>In this message we will consider the way that the church in Taipei should go on. In the early days all our meetings were small; hardly any locality had more than fifty saints when it was established. Most localities began with ten to twenty saints and then gradually increased, but few localities ever reached one hundred saints. In 1933 the church in Shanghai was one of the few localities that had more than one hundred saints. When I first went to Shanghai in 1933 and saw the meetings with more than one hundred saints, I thought it was a very large locality.</p>
<p>In 1940 the church in Chefoo had a sudden increase in numbers. At the time the whole church preached the gospel, and we used the expression <em>the church preaching the gospel.</em> Prior to this, no locality had baptized more than forty people in a meeting. However, in 1940 the church in Chefoo began baptizing more than one hundred people in a meeting, and we continued to baptize large numbers of people every month.</p>
<p>The church in Shanghai stopped meeting during the Sino-Japanese war. After the war, when the meetings were resumed, there were only about one hundred saints at the Lord&rsquo;s table. The church in Shanghai was restored in the summer of 1946, and I returned to Shanghai in 1947. After six months the number of saints in the church in Shanghai increased tremendously. The increase in the number of saints included many brothers and sisters who were restored and also newly saved ones. Due to this increase in the number of saints, we began breaking bread in different districts. Breaking bread in districts, however, began in the church in Chefoo. Before the end of the Sino-Japanese War the church in Chefoo met in four to six districts. In 1947 when the church in Shanghai began to break bread in districts, there were about seventeen districts with a total of one thousand saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<p>It is comparatively easy to meet according to the Scriptures when our numbers are small. The larger our numbers, the more difficult it is to meet according to the Scriptures; it also becomes especially difficult to lead the saints. We have spent much time studying the Bible concerning how to meet, and we have found three main points. First, in the book of Acts, when their numbers increased, the believers in the church in Jerusalem met from house to house (2:46), but the Bible does not give any details of what the believers did when they met. Second, in 1 Corinthians 14:26 Paul gives the principle that in the meetings each one has a portion with which to supply others. Third, in 2 Timothy 2:2 Paul charges Timothy to commit the things which he had heard to faithful men, who are able to teach others also. This shows that besides Timothy others were also commissioned to teach. These are points we discovered in the Bible concerning the way to meet.</p>
<p>The Bible does not give details or methods for Christian meetings. But we received help from Brother Nee to see that in the New Testament the principle for Christian meetings is the Spirit. Brother Nee said emphatically that the New Testament does not present definite ways concerning how to meet. Christian meetings in the New Testament are entirely a matter of the Spirit, not of letters and regulations, even though it is easier to follow regulations. A school, a hospital, or any other social organization must have by-laws in order to operate, but the New Testament only gives the principles of meetings. There is no clear word on how to meet.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR MEETINGS AND<br />
THE LEADING IN THE CHURCH IN TAIPEI</h2>
<p>We examined the way many different denominations meet, but the way they meet was of no use to us, because their meetings are worldly and full of human opinions. When the number of saints meeting in the church in Shanghai was more than one thousand, we had about sixteen districts. Then the political situation forced us to stop meeting. When I moved from Shanghai to Taipei in 1949, there were few local people in the churches in Taiwan. Most of the saints, about five hundred, came from the mainland and worked with government agencies, schools, and hospitals; there were also a few businessmen. These brothers and sisters came from more than thirty provinces in mainland China, and they were scattered throughout the island of Taiwan from Keelung and Yilan in the north to Kaohsiung and Pingtung in the south. I traveled to the different towns and visited these brothers and sisters. Even though we began with only four to five hundred brothers and sisters, in five to six years there were fifty churches established in Taiwan. This was the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. When Brother Sparks came in 1955, there were thirty thousand brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>In 1958 Brother Sparks visited Taiwan a second time. This was a mistake, and as a result, there was an incalculable loss among us. In 1959 we had more than forty thousand saints&mdash;half of whom were in the church in Taipei&mdash;when the dissenting ones began an undermining work.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of Christianity in the Far East, few groups have had a membership of twenty thousand believers with two thousand believers attending their meetings. The church in Taipei can be considered the first Christian meeting with such numbers. This was before we suffered the storm. Our numbers were unprecedented in the history of Christianity in the Far East. In 1961 I went to America and received a burden for America. I did not give up the churches in Taiwan, but the main burden for Taiwan was no longer on my shoulders.</p>
<p>The way to lead the church in Taipei has been a problem for a period of more than twenty years, from 1961 until the present. In other words, for over twenty years we have been unable to find a direction for the churches in Taiwan, especially for the church in Taipei. When I left Taiwan, the church in Taipei met in halls, districts, and groups. In 1961 there were more than twenty districts in Taipei, and every district had several groups. Based on Acts 2:46 we called the meetings in the districts &ldquo;house meetings.&rdquo; According to this verse the believers met &ldquo;from house to house.&rdquo; We also met in groups based on Mark 6:39-40, where the Lord Jesus asked the five thousand people to sit down in groups. By meeting in districts and in groups our need was met; however, our numbers did not increase. Even though I have not been in Taiwan for twenty years, I still have a burden related to the leading of the church in Taipei. We need to consider how to lead the church in Taipei.</p>
<p>The churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery all began with a small number of saints, and we always did our best, seeking light and leading from the Scriptures, to return to the practices in the Scriptures. It is rather easy to practice our meetings according to the Scriptures when there are few saints, but it is not so easy when our numbers increase. Our increase in numbers began in a revival in 1942 in the church in Chefoo. This is when the meetings in the church in Shanghai had stopped due to the Japanese persecution. I learned much during the revival in Chefoo; we had no experience prior to the revival. After the Japanese invasion and my sickness, the brothers asked me to go south to Shanghai and Nanking. After less than a year in Nanking, our numbers increased, and we learned new things. I have been working since then, and I am still learning, even in America.</p>
<p>In 1957 we felt that our meetings needed to go a step further. But due to the storm in 1959, we did not have the opportunity to advance. This was Satan&rsquo;s work, and it occupied all our time and effort. We truly suffered a great loss.</p>
<p>Since I left Taiwan and went abroad, I have been fully occupied with the spread of the recovery. The environment abroad is somewhat similar to our initial situation; there are groups consisting of thirty to fifty saints spread out across America. Some localities have increased to one hundred saints, and a few localities have two to three hundred, but there is not one church with five hundred saints. Therefore, the need in America is not as great as the need in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Anyone who has studied the truth will acknowledge that we must consider our situation when we practice the light of the truth. This is similar to learning to drive. It may be easy when we are training, but when we actually get out on the road to drive, we need to be able to respond to different situations. This is not so easy.</p>
<p>Even though I received a burden to go abroad, my heart was still in Taiwan. I have been observing the situation, and I feel that the problem in Taiwan has never been resolved. The co-workers do not know the proper way to work; they are thus unable to meet the need in Taiwan. It is as if they have a factory, capital, raw materials, a market, and laborers, but they do not know how to manage these resources. If a person wants to be successful in business, he must make plans and work according to his situation. He should use his resources to produce a product that meets the demand in the market.</p>
<p>The number of saints in the church in Taipei has not increased since 1961. We can say that from that time until the present, there has been no progress. I have not been able to give any direction, because I was not able to be personally involved.</p><h2 class="head2">The Absent Saints and the Children&rsquo;s Work</h2>
<p>We learn the proper lessons from studying our past. I have said in the past that we should train the brothers and sisters who plan to go abroad to study or work so that they will not leave the church life due to changes in their environment. Moreover, there are more than twenty thousand saints in the church in Taipei, but less than one-fourth of them actually come to the meetings. It is worthwhile for us to investigate the cause of such a high rate of absence from meetings. We need to find every one of the twenty thousand saints in order to understand the reason they are absent from the meetings. Some brothers must coordinate in order to meet this need.</p>
<p>Concerning the children&rsquo;s work, out of the twenty thousand saints there should be at least five thousand families. Even though many of the parents do not come to the meetings, their children do. If there are two children in every family, we will have ten thousand children. The church in Taipei should have ten thousand children attending its children&rsquo;s meetings during the week. These meetings do not have to be held in the meeting halls on Lord&rsquo;s Day mornings. We can have children&rsquo;s meetings any day from Monday to Lord&rsquo;s Day. These meetings can even be in the saints&rsquo; homes; every home can have a meeting. If the children begin to meet with us when they are six or seven years old, after ten years they will be at least sixteen years old; they will be ready to enter college. Moreover, they will all be saved. Even though we have fellowshipped repeatedly concerning this, the brothers have not received my words; they have not received this burden. They did not reject my words; they simply did not know how to carry them out.</p>
<p>If I had remained in Taiwan from 1961 until the present, we would have had a way to care for the saints who are not in the meetings. We cannot merely use our natural ability. The brothers must consider every saint on our list in prayer in order to know the condition of the saints and of the church in Taipei. We will then know the names of those who have incorrect addresses, those who have passed away, and those who became weak and left the church. We will also know the names of the saints who have a heart for the Lord. These saints might not necessarily meet regularly, but they come to the meetings a couple of times a year. If I had remained in Taiwan, the co-workers and the elders would have prayed and fellowshipped about this to find out how we should care for the twenty thousand saints on our list. This work requires our labor and effort. The way of doing things by convenience does not require any effort. However, we must apply some effort to meet new needs in a new situation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Different Meetings<br />
to Meet Different Needs</h2>
<p>The church in Taipei is a large locality; no other locality has as many halls as the church in Taipei. Taiwan is richer than it has ever been in its history; we therefore do not have financial problems. In addition, we have more than one thousand young working saints. There are not many local churches with more than five hundred saints, including the young ones and the elderly. Hence, the church in Taipei has potential, a large financial capital, and resources. These more than twenty thousand saints must be our goal; we need to consider what meetings can meet their need. We must have different kinds of meetings to care for the different situations of the saints. After we preach the gospel, we must speak the truth of the gospel; therefore, we need a meeting to teach gospel truths. Furthermore, we need a meeting to edify new believers, a meeting to pursue the truth, and a meeting to pursue the divine life. Every week we should have at least five or six different kinds of meetings. They can all be in one meeting hall or in two to three different meeting halls. We do not necessarily need to gather in one place on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. We must spend time to consider these matters seriously according our need.</p>
<p>We need to classify the twenty thousand saints in the church in Taipei by level according to their situation. We also need to study how to lead them in the meetings. It should not be that we use the Life-study messages until we find that they are not adequate and then switch to messages for edifying new believers until we find out that they do not meet the need and then switch to <em>Twelve Baskets Full.</em> If we do things in this way, nothing we use will be appropriate. A school cannot teach only English; it must teach geography, history, and physics also. For this reason, a school has many different classes; all the students are not in one class taking one general course. It takes less effort to do a general work, but we cannot speak concerning spiritual matters in a general way. We must pay attention to particular needs. We need to be practical in what we do. This can be compared to a chef who needs people to set up the kitchen and to help prepare food. The brothers cannot take only one way or do only one thing. They must care for the many different needs.</p>
<p>In principle, the church is a family, and the most important thing in a family is feeding. However, the church is also a school, and the most important thing in a school is education. For this reason, the Bible stresses teaching and teachers. When we perfect and edify the brothers and sisters, we should take the school system as our pattern and begin with elementary school, then progress to junior high school, high school, college, and finally graduate studies.</p><h2 class="head2">Perfecting the Saints<br />
in All Areas of Church Service</h2>
<p>In relation to church service, we should make a list of the needs of the church. For example, the chart should list cleaning, ushering, and other church services. After we pray about the services, we should assign responsible saints to different services according to the need. Then we should hold trainings for the different areas of service to perfect the saints. We have been preaching the gospel in Taipei for nearly thirty years, and now there are approximately five thousand saints who attend the meetings. All the saints who are in the meetings have received some perfecting, but we must study how we can meet their need. We must continually endeavor; it may be that we will not be immediately successful. Nevertheless, we must put our heart, our strength, and our entire being into perfecting the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING ASIDE OUR PERSONAL VIEWS<br />
TO BE IN HARMONY<br />
WITH THE CORPORATE LEADING</h2>
<p>I have a heavy burden concerning the leading in the church in Taipei. The co-workers and the elders are all faithful, they are willing to give themselves, and they are of the same mind. However, they have not put aside their personal views to receive a corporate view for the corporate need. The brothers need to labor according to a corporate view and to function according to their measure. They should cooperate with one other and strive together for the same goal.</p>
<p>We need to set aside our personal views and receive a corporate view. The brothers need to come together to pray until there is no more pride and no self-exaltation. This is the way we will succeed. If we would do this, the Lord will lead us step by step in our prayer and fellowship so that all the needs of the church are met. Otherwise, even though the co-workers are not in division, they will not be in harmony regarding the corporate leading, nor will they be focused in their work. A personal view, no matter how good it is, cannot accomplish anything in the work. When the elders and co-workers are in harmony and have one burden but do not have personal views, the practical needs will be met.</p>
<p>In addition to finding out why so few saints come to the meetings, we also need to consider different kinds of meetings. It is not good to have too many kinds of meetings, but too few meetings may not meet the need. It is best to have only one joint meeting every week when the whole church meets together for a corporate leading. The other meetings during the week do not have to be corporate. During the joint meeting, the different kinds of meetings can be announced and a printed schedule can be passed out to the brothers and sisters. We must allow the brothers and sisters to choose meetings for themselves based on their personal situation and need. We should not force them to go to a particular meeting. If we have a meeting only for new believers, the saints who have met with us for twenty to thirty years will not be interested.</p>
<p>We are soldiers, and we can be useful regardless of our age. If we have ten thousand children meeting with us every week, we will need five hundred teachers. The brothers and sisters in high school and college can be the teachers. In addition, we can train the saints in college to also preach gospel truths. In this way everyone will have the opportunity to be useful. This is the way a country builds up its infrastructure, and it is the only way for a country to be prosperous.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DROPPING OUR OPINIONS<br />
TO CONSIDER THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH<br />
AND NOT REMAINING IN OUR OLD WAYS</h2>
<p>We must beseech the Lord&rsquo;s mercy in order to see that opinions are worthless. When I was working with Brother Nee, I never expressed my opinion. I entered into the work in 1932, which was ten years after some of the other co-workers entered the work. However, only eight years later in 1940, when we were in Shanghai, Brother Nee was already giving me important assignments. I never casually expressed my opinion. Brother Nee always asked me to go to difficult areas; I never chose where to go. I never said that I approved of this or disapproved of that; I never said we should do this or do that.</p>
<p>When I was playing soccer in my junior college, I never expressed my opinion. I told my teammates that I would play whatever position they put me in without any preference. There are many things that we can accomplish when we do not express our opinions. We could have gained at least twenty-six thousand children, junior high students, high school students, and college students. We must be able to pick up this burden.</p>
<p>I have no intention of being a leader in the Lord&rsquo;s work; I merely work diligently without opinions. If someone else has a better way of doing things, I will not argue with him; however, other people always argue with me. We must realize that the blessing depends on the one accord, not on our opinions. We must not express our opinions in the elders&rsquo; and co-workers&rsquo; meetings. We must be practical in our leading, and we must study our situation so that we can meet the need. This can be compared to using the resources, capital, and labor in a factory to manufacture products that meet a need in the market. This is our pressing need, and we must spend time on it.</p>
<p>In our history we have never had a local church with more than three thousand five hundred saints regularly in the meetings. We must learn how to lead the saints, to stir them up, and to motivate them so that the saints can spread. We cannot depend on the corporate meetings to meet this need. To have only three meetings a week&mdash;the prayer meeting, the mid-week ministry meeting, and the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting&mdash;is inadequate. Some of the saints who are not in the meetings may be open to receive a burden for the gospel; hence, we must study and find a way to contact these saints and develop their function in preaching the gospel. This requires much effort.</p>
<p>People are complicated and therefore have many needs. A person has needs in his body, in his soul, and in his spirit. He cannot take care of only one aspect; he must care for all three aspects. If we can speak only of spiritual things and tell people to be spiritual, but we do not care for anything else, then we will have no way to get through. We must remember to be practical in our care.</p>
<p>In our coordination we need saints to preach the gospel, and we also need saints to preach the gospel truths. We cannot merely preach the gospel without speaking the gospel truths; otherwise, the newly saved ones will not be in the meetings after they are baptized. We baptize people every year, but our numbers have not increased because we are unable to keep them. The leading brothers must study how to keep the newly saved ones after they have been baptized. Merely preaching the gospel and baptizing people is inadequate; we must edify the new believers. Hence, the co-workers and elders must come before the Lord and study how they can meet this need. We must be like the widow in the Gospel of Luke who kept bothering the unrighteous judge, asking him to avenge her, until he finally avenged her (18:2-7).</p>
<p>The responsible brothers love one another; but they lack one accord. If the leading brothers are not in one accord, how can the entire church be in one accord? The situation of the church in Taipei depends on the responsible brothers. Taiwan has been blessed by the Lord; the churches are stable because they are kept by Him. But we should not remain in this condition; we must change our practice.</p>
<p>We must bring our situation before the Lord to seek His leading. There are more than twenty thousand brothers and sisters in the church in Taipei. The elders should pray and seek a way to lead and perfect the saints so that all the saints function. When I gave the Life-study training on the Gospel of Luke, I did not merely preach concerning the Gospel of Luke in the meetings. Even while I was resting, I was thinking about the Gospel of Luke. Therefore, I was able to receive light. The responsible brothers in Taipei should not pray and ask the Lord for light on the one hand and sleep peacefully on the other; if they do this, they will not receive light. They should even dream about the church in Taipei. They must continually consider the way to perfect all twenty thousand saints and how to bring the ten thousand children into the church life.</p>
<p>We must dream about the children, the junior high students, the high school students, and the college students. In this way the saints in every meeting hall in the church in Taipei will carry out their function to the highest degree. Some of the elders must receive the burden to dive into these things and to labor on them diligently. If I had returned twenty years ago, this would be our practice in the church in Taipei.</p>
<p>We cannot continue to do things according to the old way. We need to change. If the business community in Taiwan operated according to old ways, Taiwan would have no economy. People in the business world know how to work and make profit. We should be the same. If the elders express their opinions in the church without working, this is a great shame. Opinions nullify our ability to make profit. The Lord&rsquo;s work needs us to work; it does not need us to express our opinions. For example, when others are driving, we do not need to tell them how fast or how slow they should drive. When we drive, we should pay more attention to arriving at our destination with no accidents rather than pay attention to driving at only one speed.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE TRUTH, THE FLESH, AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>I hope that the younger generation will receive this word and pursue the truth, instead of shouting that they have seen a vision. Some people say that they understand the Bible, but they do not know the truth; they have not labored on the truth. Some people accuse us of teaching heresy, but they do not know the difference between heresy and the truth. We must strive to study the truth. In addition, we must learn to know the flesh. Paul preached a Christ who is versus the law, religion, and culture; this Christ is also versus our natural ability and life, our thoughts, the self, and the flesh. We need to know these things, and we also need to experience the truth that Paul preached concerning Christ as the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING HOW TO CONDUCT OURSELVES<br />
IN THE WORK</h2>
<p>Since we work for the Lord, we need to learn how to conduct ourselves in the work. We may go out to preach the gospel in a small town with one thousand families and only eight or nine saints. How do the eight or nine believers increase to be one hundred believers? How do we strengthen the church? We need to spend time to study and to learn the way to carry this out. The church in Taipei has twenty thousand saints; its needs cannot be met by simply studying the truth. We should also learn how to conduct ourselves when we work. When we learn how to conduct ourselves, we will be effective in the work, and we will have good results.</p>
<p>The saints who have dissented and left the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have no way to go on. They have taken the wrong way because they did not know the way to conduct themselves in the work. They thought that they had seen the vision, and they also criticized the way that we were taking. It has been only five or six years since they left us, but they have all withered. If we want to have a future in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must learn how to conduct ourselves. The Lord has chosen and called us, but whether or not we will have a future as a Christian depends on our conduct. It does not matter where the Lord takes us or in what circumstances we find ourselves; we should be able to work in such a way that meets the need in our circumstances. The Lord said that we must be as prudent as serpents but guileless as doves. Then we will not harm others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LABORING IN A PRACTICAL WAY,<br />
HAVING NO OPINIONS,<br />
AND TAKING THE BODY AS OUR GOAL</h2>
<p><em>Question: When we fellowship, we feel that we are clear and that we have a way to go on, but after we return to our localities, we gradually lose our clarity, and we do not know what to do. What do we need to do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We must learn to focus on what we do, and we should not analyze whether or not we are able to accomplish a job. We should not give ourselves the excuse of saying that we do not understand what we are doing. We should simply work, and there will be a result. We should not say that the church in Taipei is too large and that we do not know what to do; we simply need to work. If our service is to clean the restrooms, we should clean the restrooms so that they are spotless. If we are on meal service, what we prepare should be delicious. When I was in Chefoo, I took the lead to clean the restrooms, and I cleaned them in such a way that everyone admired them and tried to keep them clean.</p>
<p>We should not think that it is easy to be successful in taking care of the church in Taipei. It might not be easy for even the apostle Paul to work in a church as large as the church in Taipei. Instead of trying to be successful, we simply need to work. If we are asked to speak concerning gospel truths, our speaking should be very clear, attracting, and inspiring. We should not complain and ask why others are asked to give messages to edify the saints, but we are assigned to speak concerning the truth of the gospel. We should learn to accept in submission and have no opinion concerning any arrangement made by the church. If the brothers ask us to speak concerning gospel truths, we should do it. If they tell us to clean the restrooms, we should clean the restrooms. If they assign us to hall one, we should go there. If every one of us serves in this way, the church will be blessed and strengthened.</p>
<p>Now that we know to pursue the truth in serving the church, we should not say with fear that we will not know what to do when we return to our localities. There is no need to express our opinions. We should simply present the gospel truths in a good way. We need many years of preparation in order to properly present the gospel truths; we cannot prepare overnight. This can be compared to the ancient Chinese scholars who needed ten years of intensive studies to be successful in the imperial examination. Therefore, we should devote our time and energy to study the area of our involvement in the service. What we gain from our studies will be useful.</p>
<p>We need an attitude of being willing to labor. For example, if the brothers tell us to sweep the floor of the meeting hall, we should sweep it thoroughly so that it is very clean. When I was in the church in Chefoo I took the lead to clean the hall. Even though it was an old house, it was kept spotless and attractive. Every guest room had a different color scheme. For example, for the white guest room, every item from the bedding to the decorations was white; for the yellow guest room, every item was yellow. At that time, those who were responsible for taking care of the guest rooms were perfected by me. We should always seek to improve so that there is an atmosphere of freshness. In Chefoo I designed the church&rsquo;s meeting hall, the sisters&rsquo; prayer room, and the brothers&rsquo; prayer room. However, I would often rearrange the furniture in the meeting hall, because I always sought to make improvements. In this way, when people came into the hall, they would have a sense of newness and realize that we had made improvements. This is the proper way to administrate the church.</p>
<p>If we are willing to receive these words, we will be very useful no matter what city or town we go to. Whether or not we can be effective in a locality depends on our person. There is a saying that a person can bring life to a dying business if he knows how to manage it. This principle also applies to a big church like Taipei or to a small church with only eight or nine brothers and sisters. We should never think that we would not have the opportunity to manifest our usefulness if we are in a small town. Such a concept indicates that we do not understand how to be useful. If we cannot be useful in a small locality, we will not be useful in a large locality. It is not a question of whether we are in a big church or in a small church, or whether we are a full-time co-worker or an elder or a responsible brother in the church. Do not think that you must be an elder or a co-worker. If you are not a co-worker, you can function as a co-worker; if you are not an elder, you can be as capable as an elder. Then when you function, you are the same as a co-worker or an elder.</p>
<p>Do not be concerned about whether your locality is small or large, or whether you are a full-timer or a working saint. None of these things matter. We need to see what is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, what is the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, and what the Lord wants. Then we can receive a burden from the Lord to give ourselves to Him, to remain under the killing of the cross in order to deal with the flesh, and to walk according to the Spirit. If we are for the Body of Christ in this way, we will spontaneously be useful. No matter where we are, we will meet people to whom we can preach the gospel, present the truth, and minister Christ.</p>
<p>When the Western missionaries came to China, they had the Lord&rsquo;s grace. They studied the environment and the philosophy of the Chinese people, and they learned the Chinese language. They loved the Lord and were determined to labor in spite of sufferings; hence, they had results. We only regret that the light they saw was inadequate. However, we cannot deny that their love for the Lord and their spirit for the work exceed our love for the Lord and our spirit for the work. We are in a convenient environment, but we are not willing to work hard and study our present situation. When the Western missionaries were sent by the Lord to China, they had to study Chinese philosophy and psychology; moreover, they studied how to preach the gospel in the Chinese society. The principle is still the same today. There are more than twenty thousand saints in the church in Taipei; hence, instead of expressing our opinions we must study how to work in this situation.</p>
<p>In the early days in Shantung, there was an American missionary from the Presbyterian denomination who came to our village to preach the gospel. When people saw him, they said, &ldquo;The blue-eyed, blond man is coming,&rdquo; and they beat gongs so that everyone in the village could quickly shut their doors. After studying the situation, this brother stood with a sturdy stick behind a door so that the person inside the house could not see him. Then when they cracked open the door, he would put the stick in the door and thus enter the house. Upon entering, he would go directly to their gristmill and push it. The country people disliked doing the hard work of pushing the mill, so they let him push it. But human hearts are not made of iron. After he pushed the mill for half a day, they would feel sorry for him and tell their children to give him a cup of water to drink. Then he would continue pushing the mill until the master of the house would give him something to eat. Finally, he would sit down to talk with the family. This was how he opened the door to many households.</p>
<p>There are innumerable stories like this concerning Western missionaries. Some spent the night in Chinese homes and were covered with fleabites the next morning. As a result, they had to thoroughly scrub themselves before they could enter their homes. If Chinese people came to visit them, they received them even though they were afraid of getting fleas. These were obstacles they faced. In some places the Western missionaries were forced to take shelter outside the city walls in the idol temples because the Chinese refused to rent them rooms. They suffered tremendously, and yet they still spent their lives for the gospel in China.</p>
<p>It is worthwhile for us to learn from the spirit of the Western missionaries. When we go to a place, we should study the situation there. We do not only study the truth; we also care for the practical situation. Those who are used by the Lord are humble. The Western missionaries did many things, but they did not have much light. We have seen more light than they saw. However, if we merely shout about seeing a vision, express our opinions and the self, yet lack the Spirit and a proper attitude in conducting ourselves, we will bring in many problems.</p>
<p>Those who created problems in the past were the ones with many opinions. On the negative side, Paul knew that the self is a problem, so he said, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). But on the positive side, he showed that Christ is the Spirit and that our goal is the oneness of the Body (2 Cor. 3:17; Eph. 4:13). We need to remember three points. First, we must understand that the self is a problem in the church and in the work. When the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is terminated, there are no problems in the church and the work. Second, our knowledge and experience of Christ are matters in the Spirit. Third, our goal is the oneness of the one Body, one universal church. Whether in Shanghai, in Taipei, or in America, there is only one church. With only one church, there cannot be many opinions. For our flesh and our self to be dealt with, we must be in the Spirit and take the oneness of the Body as our goal.</p>
<p>We hope that these three basic elements will be in us: the killing of our self, the constant transfusing of the Spirit, and the oneness as our goal. We must have the oneness in the church, among the co-workers, and among the elders. These three factors must become the basic factors of the church and the church life. Otherwise, all our training will bring in problems. Without these three factors, the more training we receive, the more problems there will be. A person who learns the lessons before the Lord must observe these factors. In conclusion, we must be practical, simple, not express opinions, and take the oneness of the Body as our goal.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">AN OVERALL VIEW<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<p>In this message we will fellowship concerning the way that the Lord&rsquo;s work should go forward in Taiwan. In order for us to have a thorough understanding of the work, we must have an overall view of the progression of church history, and we must understand the general situation of Christianity today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROGRESSION OF CHURCH HISTORY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">No Creed but the Bible</h2>
<p>Around the year A.D. 90 the apostle John wrote the last book in the Bible, Revelation. This not only completed the entire New Testament; it also completed the divine revelation concerning the Lord. However, the books of the New Testament had not been collected together, nor had they been formally recognized. At the time of the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325, only twenty books of the New Testament were recognized; the remaining seven books, including the two important books of Hebrews and Revelation, had not yet been recognized. Without these two books, the New Testament would not be complete. Hebrews is one of the writings in Paul&rsquo;s ministry, and Revelation is one of the writings in John&rsquo;s ministry. With regard to the revelation in the New Testament, Paul&rsquo;s ministry is the most important, and John&rsquo;s ministry is the second most important. However, at the time of the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325, the New Testament contained only twenty books. These books were the basis for the creeds.</p>
<p>To this day Roman Catholicism and Protestantism take the creeds as the basis of their confession of the faith. Almost every denomination still recites one of the creeds and the Lord&rsquo;s prayer every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. According to their practice the basis of their confession of the faith is the creed, not the Bible.</p>
<p>Over the past one hundred fifty years, three large Christian groups formally announced that they did not care for the creeds; they cared only for the Bible. The first group that criticized the creeds was the Brethren. The Brethren said that they did not want any substitutes; they wanted only God&rsquo;s divine revelation, which is the entire sixty-six books of the Bible. The next group, which is the largest Christian group in America and even the largest denomination in the world, was the Southern Baptist Church. The Southern Baptists often say, &ldquo;No creed but the Bible.&rdquo; The third group to criticize the creeds was the Church of Christ. The teachings of this group are similar to those of the Brethren. The believers call themselves the Church of Christ, and they sometimes put up signs that say, No Creed but the Bible. Besides these three groups, we also have no creed but the Bible; thus, we can say that we are the fourth group. We were raised up in China. Since our beginning, we have repeatedly asserted that we do not care for the creeds, because they are unreliable and incomplete.</p>
<p>The portion of the Bible that the Council of Nicaea used to formulate the creed in A.D. 325 contained only twenty books. The seven books that were missing were Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, and Revelation. Of the nine books from Hebrews to Revelation, only 1 John and 1 Peter were formally recognized at the time of the Council of Nicaea.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the Council of Nicaea was to decide on the doctrine of the Trinity. However, the council did not use the book of Revelation, which contains important matters concerning the revelation of the Trinity. Revelation 1:4 speaks of the &ldquo;seven Spirits.&rdquo; These seven Spirits are the Spirit in the Trinity. The creed, however, does not refer to the seven Spirits; the creed speaks of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, but it says nothing concerning the seven Spirits. Seven books&mdash;Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, and Revelation&mdash;were not recognized as the canon until A.D. 397 at the Council of Carthage. The entire New Testament was formally recognized only at that time. Hence, we have strong ground to say that the Council of Nicaea was not based on the entire Bible. Hence, we neither accept nor follow the Nicene Creed as a complete statement of our faith.</p>
<p>Since there were still arguments concerning the doctrine of the Trinity, after the Council of Carthage there was a constant succession of councils. After public recognition of the papal system in the Roman Catholic Church, there was no longer a need for church councils; instead, the pope made the decisions. The Catholic Church believes that Peter was the successor of Christ and that he was the Bishop of Rome; therefore, they recognize him as the first pope. The pope is the head of the Catholic Church, and his words represent the Catholic Church. Hence, the Catholic Church teaches that all believers must obey the word of the church. The Catholic Church does not base its teachings on what the Bible says, on what God says, or on what the Lord says; its teachings are based on what the church says. <em>What the church says</em> means &ldquo;what the pope says.&rdquo; Beginning in the sixth century until today, all disputes in the Catholic Church are decided by the pope.</p>
<p>Most Christians today take the sixty-six books of the Bible as the basis of their faith. Some Christians, however, base their faith on the creeds. Other Christians say that their faith is based on the creeds plus the decisions of the church councils, referring to the Council of Nicaea and the other councils that were called to discuss the basic matters of the faith.</p>
<p>In addition to the creeds, some groups do not accept all of the books of the Bible, and others accept more. Some Christian groups say that they believe the four Gospels, but they do not accept the Epistles of Paul. In the Catholic Church some books have been added to the Bible; they are in addition to the sixty-six books of the canon. These apocryphal books are fictitious. The Roman Catholic Church is not the only entity that prints Bibles with these fictitious books; the Bible Society also prints these books. There are even some preachers who quote the apocryphal books in their messages.</p>
<p>We recognize the sixty-six books of the Bible, which includes the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament and the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. We do not accept the apocryphal books that were added by the Catholic Church, nor do we base our faith on the creeds, because they are incomplete and were written without seven books of the Bible. Our faith is based on the entire Bible.</p><h2 class="head2">The Reformation and the State Churches</h2>
<p>Since A.D. 570, after the papal system was established, Roman Catholics have followed the orders of the pope. In the sixteenth century Martin Luther rose up to make reforms. The first point he advocated was that believers did not need to obey the pope in all things. Martin Luther had no intention of coming out of the Catholic Church; he merely wanted to resolve the matter of absolute obedience to the pope. He never intended to leave the church; his only thought was to introduce changes. He had no intention of overthrowing the pope. He advocated obedience to the Bible, not the pope.</p>
<p>Luther&rsquo;s view incited a number of disputes and even started a war. In those days there were numerous small German states, and some of the heads of these states were dissatisfied with the pope&rsquo;s oppression and wanted an excuse to escape from papal interference. Therefore, they united to protect Luther. It was with this action that breaking away from the Catholic Church began. As a result, a group of people came out of the Catholic Church, but they fell into the hands of the state churches that were established in Germany and a number of other countries in northern Europe, such as Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Even today people in Germany pay a church tax, which the government gives to the state church for its use.</p>
<p>The state church in Germany, as well as most other state churches, is Lutheran. In Chinese we call these churches &ldquo;The Justification-by-faith Church&rdquo; because Luther was the first person to advocate justification by faith. However, the state church of England is not Lutheran. The state church of England is the Anglican Church; it is also called the Episcopal Church. <em>Episcopal</em> means &ldquo;of the bishops.&rdquo; Hence, the Episcopal Church of England is a system of bishops. However, the word <em>bishop</em> means &ldquo;overseer.&rdquo; The Episcopal Church inherited the practice of a system of bishops from the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>The practice of a system of bishops, which is a product of the clergy-laity system, is unscriptural. The Bible clearly says that those who oversee are elders; thus, elders are overseers. In Acts 20:28 Paul spoke with the elders in Ephesus and said to them, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God.&rdquo; This proves that elders are overseers.</p>
<p>After the apostles there was a group of Bible teachers who are referred to as the church fathers. The term <em>church fathers</em> is not appropriate, because the Lord Jesus clearly said, &ldquo;Do not call anyone on earth your father, for One is your Father, He who is in the heavens&rdquo; (Matt. 23:9). Ignatius, who was a Bible teacher in the second century and is considered one of the church fathers, made a great mistake when he spoke of the elders and the overseers. Ignatius taught that an elder governs one locality, but an overseer, a bishop, governs a region. Thus, an overseer is considered higher than an elder. This teaching produced a religious hierarchy.</p>
<p>Eighteen centuries have passed since then. During this time a religious hierarchy, or the clergy system, was developed. In the Roman Catholic Church, the priests are on the lowest level. A priest can rise to become a bishop, a bishop can become an archbishop, and an archbishop can become a cardinal. The cardinals serve as the pope&rsquo;s cabinet. The Catholic Church has more than one hundred cardinals around the world. When the pope dies, the cardinals vote and elect the next pope from among themselves. The system of the pope, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, and priests is a religious hierarchy. Of all the religious groups in the world today, the organization of the Roman Catholic Church is the strongest and the strictest.</p>
<p>When Luther left the Roman Catholic Church, he was leaving religious hierarchy, but he fell into the organization of the state churches. The head of every state church is the king of that country. For example, if you are a member of the Anglican Church, you are a subject of the Queen of England. Every member of the Anglican Church is subordinate to the Queen of England because the Queen of England is the head of the Anglican Church. Thus, every native-born Englishman has two statuses: he is a citizen of England and a member of the Anglican Church. This is the organization of the state churches.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Private Churches and<br />
the Recovery with the Brethren</h2>
<p>After the formation of the state churches, in approximately 1500, some private churches were raised up in the regions of central Europe and Germany, based on practices such as the presbytery and baptism. These believers were severely persecuted because they rejected the Catholic Church and the state churches. At that time central Europe was under the control of the Catholic Church, and northern Europe was under the influence of the state churches. The Puritans were also raised up, and were forced to wander from place to place because of the persecution they faced.</p>
<p>Between 1720 and 1730 in a place called Saxony, in today&rsquo;s Germany, there was a brother by the name of Zinzendorf, who was a count and who had a large estate. He also loved the Lord; his beliefs were pure, and most of his practices were according to the Bible. Groups of persecuted believers gradually found their way to his property, and they began meeting together. The largest group came from Moravia by way of Bohemia. Hence, the believers who met with Zinzendorf were called the Moravian Brethren. The believers with Zinzendorf returned to much of the truths in the Bible, and they met according to the Bible. Hence, they were very good in all aspects.</p>
<p>John Wesley was raised up at about the same time as Zinzendorf. Wesley preached the gospel throughout England and was a famous revivalist.</p>
<p>After another one hundred years, in about 1820, the British Brethren were raised up. Their knowledge of the truth surpassed Zinzendorf&rsquo;s, and they received clear light regarding the general practices of the church. We are standing on their shoulders with regard to the deep and profound revelations of the truth. However, because they paid too much attention to doctrines and fell into dead letters, they divided into many different sects. The Brethren Assembly has been divided into more than one thousand different sects. Through these divisions, they lost the Lord&rsquo;s testimony and His presence.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE IN CHINA</h2>
<p>In 1920 the Lord raised us up in China. We did not do something on our own in order to have a unique style. Instead, we studied church history and compared everything with the Bible. In 1922 Brother Nee began the first meeting in Foochow, which is in southern China. That was more than sixty years ago. The meetings in northern China began in Chefoo in 1932. The responsibility for the meetings in northern China fell mainly on me. I have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery from 1932 until today, 1984. That is a total of fifty-two years.</p>
<p>Since 1827 when the Lord raised up the British Brethren, the light of the truth has been pouring out. There were several famous Bible teachers among the Brethren. The most famous Bible teacher was J. N. Darby. The Brethren published many books that have helped countless Christians over the past one hundred years. Spurgeon once praised a teacher from the Brethren named William Kelly and said that Kelly&rsquo;s mind was as great as the ocean. C. H. Mackintosh wrote <em>Notes on the Pentateuch.</em> D. L. Moody once pointed to his personal collection of books and said, &ldquo;You can burn all the books on these shelves except for the Bible and Mackintosh&rsquo;s <em>Notes on the Pentateuch.</em>&rdquo; This proves that the truth that the Brethren received had a great influence on others.</p>
<p>During the last half century, Christianity in America has been influenced mainly by the Scofield Reference Bible. The top American theological seminaries, such as Dallas Theological Seminary and Moody Bible Institute, base their teachings on the Scofield Reference Bible. More than ninety percent of the notes in the Scofield Reference Bible are based on the Brethren teachings. Even though these theological seminaries did not take the way of the Brethren, they fully accepted the teachings of the Brethren.</p>
<p>In 1920 the Lord raised us up in China; that was after the first war in Europe which ended in 1918. At that time many spiritual books were put out in Europe. Not only were the Brethren publishing spiritual books; other believers were also putting out books. The books of Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis were quite influential. There were also books by C. H. Spurgeon. Most of his books were published in England and were highly valued. In America books by A. B. Simpson were published. We have included many of his hymns in our hymnal. A. B. Simpson founded the Christian and Missionary Alliance. Simpson was spiritual, and his messages that contain the basic revelation concerning Christ as our life are well-known.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRISTIANITY NOT MAKING PROGRESS<br />
FOR MANY YEARS</h2>
<p>It has been thirty-nine years since the end of the Second World War in 1945. Based on my knowledge and observation, it is hard to find a weighty spiritual book that was published during this period. Some people might say that I am too much and that Christianity puts out many books and magazines. However, not one of these publications is spiritually weighty in scriptural exposition, in the light of the truth, or in the supply of life.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is the center of Christian publications in Chinese, and for the past several years no publications of spiritual weight have been put out from there. The number of weighty spiritual publications that were put out between 1820 and 1930 cannot be counted. However, very few spiritual publications of weight have been put out over the past thirty-nine years. Many publications have been put out, but not one of them has spiritual weight and value.</p>
<p>For the more than twenty years that I have been living in America, I have been observing the books put out in Christianity; some of the brothers have been helping me. It is difficult to find a book or a message that contains the light of truth or the supply of life. However, a group of scholars have done an excellent work over the past ten years and put out several lexicons for the Greek New Testament. These books have helped us tremendously.</p>
<p>I began to use the Greek New Testament in the winter of 1932, and I have continued using it for the past fifty-two years. Even though I do not understand Greek literature, I can be considered an expert on the usage of Greek words. All the Greek lexicons published in the past cannot compare to the quality of the Greek lexicons that were published during the past ten years in America. However, with respect to light, truth, life, and scriptural exposition, the situation in America is just as poor as everywhere else. Christian publishers in America have no way other than to reprint old books. This is the situation in all of Christianity today. This is the progression of the history of Christianity from after the apostles until the present.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD POURING FORTH LIGHT IN HIS RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Today in every sector and profession in the world there is much progress. This is especially true in technology where there are rapid changes; for example, the computer is becoming more widespread. However, for the past thirty or more years there has been no real progress in Christianity.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, however, the Lord has been pouring forth light. Recently a very influential Christian publication printed an article that said that the best way to read the Bible is to pray-read it. This terminology was invented by us. A book was recently published in Chinese that said that the best way to study the Bible was the &ldquo;life-study&rdquo; method. The Life-study is our publication.</p>
<p>In 1932 Brother Nee began to put out publications that influenced almost all the seeking Christians in China. The publications especially influenced the young people who had a strong desire for knowledge and whose hearts were stirred up to study the truth. I can testify that Brother Nee&rsquo;s messages were influential because the light in them was clear, and they were full of the life supply. As a young believer, over a period of time I bought many books in order to study the truth, but I later threw them away one by one. In 1962 I went to America, and the next year my family came bringing several boxes of my books. As I organized the books, I looked them over and threw away five big boxes of books. I kept only the books that had been helpful to me, and those were the ones by Brother Nee.</p>
<p>In 1949 I was led by the Lord to move from mainland China to Taiwan. For a period of almost two months, I stared at the ceiling and sighed because I was disappointed with the outward environment. Then one day the Lord caused me to see that even though the outward environment was disappointing, there were three to five hundred brothers and sisters who had moved to Taiwan from the mainland. So I decided to take a train trip from the north of the island to the south in order to visit all the saints and the local churches. After the trip I felt that there was work to be done. On August 1, 1949, we held our first conference in the meeting hall of the church in Taipei. That was the beginning of the work in Taiwan. By the end of the year, the number of saints in Taipei increased from thirty to nine hundred.</p>
<p>Due to a need to print hymnals for the saints, we established the Gospel Book Room, and I began writing in my home. We first put out a gospel hymnal and then <em>Hymns,</em> volume 2. Following this we published <em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures.</em></p>
<p>More than one year later, I went to work in the Philippines for a few months. When I returned in 1951, I felt the need to put out a periodical, so we began to publish <em>The Ministry of the Word</em>. We have put out this periodical for a total of thirty-three years. It is hard to find any publication in Christianity that was published for twenty consecutive years, but by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we have been publishing <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> from 1951 until today, 1984. For the first seven or eight years I wrote articles and did the editing. Later another brother joined me in the work. When I went abroad, the editorial responsibility fell onto his shoulders. In the beginning I helped him polish some articles, but in a short time he was able to handle all the work. All the brothers in Southeast Asia know that most of the churches rely on <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> for their spiritual supply, especially for the supply of light.</p>
<p>I went to America in 1961. In 1963 I realized that there was a need, and so I began to put out a periodical in English called <em>The Stream.</em> I also established the Stream Publishers to print books in English. By the second half of 1963 we felt the need to have a hymnal in English. Therefore, I labored with the brothers in America to select about eight hundred of the best Christian hymns that had been written throughout the centuries. We also added over two hundred of our own hymns, and we translated approximately thirty hymns from our hymnal in Chinese. The hymnal we compiled had one thousand eighty hymns.</p>
<p>The American brothers who helped me were good in English, and they understood music and the proper use of words. They made sure that the songs I wrote in English had proper rhyme and that they fit the meter. Because the hymns from Christianity are short in the truth concerning Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church, most of the two hundred fifty hymns written by me were on these topics. Thus, we can say that our hymnal in English was a great help in laying a foundation for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in America.</p>
<p>This hymnal is highly regarded by Christians in America. Some Christians say that in the two hundred years of American history they do not know of a collection like it. A person who spends several years to study this hymnal will attain a certain level of theological knowledge even if he does not study theology. Even the table of contents, with the different kinds of hymns and their categories, shows that the theological knowledge contained in the hymnal is quite rich.</p>
<p>When I returned to Taiwan in 1967, I felt that the Chinese hymnal needed to be revised, so some Chinese-speaking brothers helped me to arrange the hymns according to the hymnal in English. Hence, the numbers of the hymns in Chinese correspond with those in English, but the Chinese hymnal does not have all the songs that are in the English. We put out the hymnal in English not merely for ourselves. We did it to show the Christians in America that we understand the truth, that our theology is comprehensive and balanced, and that we have included the best hymns from various groups. However, when we published the hymnal in Chinese, we felt that there was not the same need, so we simply collected more than six hundred hymns. Now the hymnal in Chinese contains more than seven hundred eighty hymns.</p>
<p>We began the literature work in America in 1963. More than ten years later, in 1974, we felt that if we wanted the work in America to continue spreading, Los Angeles was not an appropriate place for us, and we began to look for a place to move to. We eventually moved to Anaheim. At that time Anaheim was a newly developing city in Orange County with a population that was mostly Caucasian, and there were only three to five thousand Chinese people. During these past ten years, the number of Chinese immigrants in Orange County has increased. There are now close to thirty thousand Chinese people living in Orange County.</p>
<p>We found a piece of land in Anaheim that was two and a half acres; an acre equals 43,560 square feet, so we had a total of 108,900 square feet. We did not spend much money to acquire the land. We built a two-story meeting hall on the property with an area of more than 26,000 square feet on both levels. We saved about 1.3 million dollars in contractors&rsquo; fees, because brothers from many different localities came and offered their time to build the hall. Moreover, many young people gave up six months of their schooling to help. We built the hall in the first half of 1976, and approximately seventy to eighty brothers offered their time in this way. The local brothers and sisters came in the evenings to help us build. Hence, we were able to build the hall in about six months. This is how the Lord gave us a large meeting hall.</p>
<p>After we moved to Anaheim, we began to hold two trainings every year, one in the summer and one in the winter, to expound the New Testament. We also began a new translation of the New Testament, which included footnotes. Every summer and winter I spoke thirty messages during each training. This winter it will be exactly eleven years since we began the trainings, and we will have held twenty-two trainings. The last book will be the book of Acts. By the end of December we will also have finished the translation and footnotes for the twenty-seven books of the Recovery Version of the New Testament. Due to this work, I could not spend much time visiting the churches to care for them. For every six months, I spent three and a half months translating the Recovery Version and writing footnotes. I had two helpers: one to write down what I dictated and the other to help me read the reference books. These three and a half months were also spent in preparation for the semi-annual trainings. I would spend an average of four to five hours a day writing. This schedule was the Lord&rsquo;s grace, because such a work is very strenuous. We have done this for eleven years in order to finish the study of the New Testament.</p>
<p>The Recovery Version of the New Testament is not merely a new translation of the New Testament; it also includes rich footnotes. The Life-studies, which are based on the text, footnotes, and cross references of the Recovery Version, were released as messages. During every training I released thirty messages, but when we edited them for publication, we added more content so that there are forty to fifty messages for every book. At present, the Life-study of the New Testament lacks only the book of Acts. We first printed the fourteen Epistles of Paul in nine volumes, and by the spring of next year, the rest of the New Testament Life-studies will be printed in eight more volumes. Thus, the Life-study of the entire New Testament will comprise a total of seventeen volumes.</p>
<p>Beginning next summer, I have a burden to speak on &ldquo;The Conclusion of the New Testament.&rdquo; We may spend two or three trainings on the conclusion of the New Testament. This will complete the Life-study of the New Testament. I truly believe that this will be a foundational supply to the saints with a heart to pursue the truth, especially to the young people in every locality who love the Lord and are willing to pursue the truth.</p>
<p>Even though Christianity has not published any spiritual books of weight for the past thirty-nine years, the Lord has released many riches among us. We received many riches when Brother Nee was alive, but the light we received in the Life-study messages has become even brighter. For example, the light of the truth in Mackintosh&rsquo;s <em>Notes on the Pentateuch</em> cannot compare to the light in the Life-studies of Genesis and of Exodus.</p>
<p>More than forty brothers and sisters serve full time in the Living Stream Ministry in America and in the Taiwan Gospel Book Room to supply printed materials, videotapes, and audiotapes to the saints. In addition, about forty volunteers serve in America on a regular basis. Our publication work requires many people to carry it out. This work is a great strengthening for the spreading of the Lord&rsquo;s riches.</p>
<p>The meeting hall in Anaheim is more than twenty-six thousand square feet, and most of the first floor is used by the ministry office. In the ministry office in Irving, Texas, most of the first floor is used by the printing section. All our publications are printed in Irving and distributed to the churches in America. One large truck of books goes out every month to the East Coast. This is entirely the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. His light keeps shining on us. For the last two or three years this light has been focused on God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;the Triune God dispensing Himself into us to produce the Body of Christ. This is a high revelation. Even large denominations in Christianity lack knowledge concerning the Body of Christ. However, the Lord has brought us to such a high level.</p><h2 class="head1">A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY<br />
FOR THE CHURCHES TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Since 1961, when I went to America to start the work there, I have returned to Taiwan almost every year, but the situation of the church here is not satisfactory. However, this time when I saw the saints sharing in the conference and heard their responses to the messages, I was surprised. Even the young saints can speak concerning the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit. It seems as though we are children in a scholarly family who can speak the truth. This shows that there is progress in the church in Taipei. The response of the saints has improved, and they are able to express what they receive. The spirits of the brothers and sisters are strong in the meetings. This atmosphere can conquer and subdue people. It is not possible to pretend to have such a spirit. All the brothers and sisters on the island of Taiwan have improved.</p>
<p>In recent years every aspect of society in Taiwan, including education, the economy, and transportation, has made tremendous progress. This has created a golden opportunity for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery; the church is doing well, and there are many useful saints. Some people may say that since the economy in Taiwan is booming and the standard of living has improved, people may not want the Lord. It was not like this thirty-five years ago when we arrived from mainland China, and everything was unsettled. It was easy then for people to receive the gospel. However, there are many factors in the environment in Taiwan today that are better for the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>More than thirty years ago I fellowshipped with the brothers and sisters concerning service. I told them that we need to be faithful, and as an example I used my experience of realizing the need in the Lord&rsquo;s work during my trip from the north to the south of Taiwan. More than thirty years have passed, and that word has been fulfilled. The time of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in Taiwan is ripe. It will be a pity if we do not seize this opportunity, because we will lose a great chance. The ten years ahead of us will be a crucial time.</p>
<p>After the Lord&rsquo;s recovery began in Taiwan in 1949, our numbers increased one hundredfold during the next six or seven years. We began with less than five hundred saints, but by 1956 or 1957 we increased to fifty thousand. When we began the meetings in 1949, the brothers and sisters did not understand much concerning the truth, but today many saints are acquainted with the truth.</p>
<p>Some brothers told me that there are two thousand young working saints in the church in Taipei alone. While I was very happy when I heard this, I felt that we should have several thousand more; we should at least have double this number. Nevertheless, we must consider before the Lord how we can use these two thousand young working saints. Should they be here only enjoying the Lord, like Peter, James, and John, who wanted to set up three tents on the mountain because they thought it was good for them to be there (cf. Matt. 17:1-8)? We should not forget that there are demon-possessed people at the foot of the mountain (vv. 9, 14-21). It may be good for us to be here; we are comfortable sitting in meetings with air conditioning, but are we willing to go &ldquo;down from the mountain&rdquo; to meet the needs of people in the world?</p>
<p>All the churches in Taiwan should move together as one corporate entity. Then the island of Taiwan will receive a great blessing. For the past thirty years, the Lord has been blessing Taiwan for Himself. Many people abroad have said that in thirty short years Taiwan has been converted from an agricultural society to a modern industrial society. If we are faithful, God will multiply His blessing upon this place.</p>
<p>When Western missionaries came to China to preach the gospel, the Chinese were not widely educated, and they could not understand the truth. They could not understand what was justification or what was regeneration; this forced the Western missionaries to establish schools and bring in Western education. But today everyone in Taiwan understands the truth. If we go out to preach the gospel and say, &ldquo;You need to be justified, and after you are justified, you need to receive the Spirit,&rdquo; they will understand us. The Lord has given Taiwan the top blessing of having a superior education system that has produced many people with graduate degrees. In the area of transportation, we can now go from Kaohsiung to Taipei in four or five hours. People live and work in a safe environment and in a stable society. Furthermore, the government has granted the people many freedoms. This is a huge benefit to our preaching the gospel. It is time for us to &ldquo;come down from the mountain&rdquo; because the people in the world need our care.</p>
<p>If the church in Taipei can produce five hundred full-timers, within three years at least thirty thousand people can be brought into the church. From 1949 I led the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel. Even though I was abroad for three or four months a year, in just six or seven years our numbers increased from five hundred to fifty thousand. The five hundred saints were both young and elderly. The church in Taipei now has more than two thousand young people who are up to the standard in every aspect. Why should we not gain thirty thousand people if we preach the gospel for three years? You may say that we need full-timers, and that we need to train them. If you produce five hundred full-timers, I will come and train them.</p>
<p>May we consider the way two thousand years of church history has ended in today&rsquo;s situation and then look at what the Lord is doing among us, that is, at how much light He has given us, and His blessing of us and our environment. The world today seems to be smaller in size than a village was in the old days. In those days, transportation was inconvenient, and the modes of communication were not well-developed. We did not even have the telephone. Today we can make international phone calls to any place around the world. This is a tremendous opportunity. How can we not seize it? We have a history of more than thirty years here in Taipei during which the Lord has blessed us with a solid foundation, brothers and sisters in every level of society, and an environment in which it is easy to preach the gospel. We must seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY<br />
HAVING A BRIGHT FUTURE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIVING WAY WITH A BRIGHT FUTURE</h2>
<p>The way of serving the Lord full time is the way of the cross; it is a way that leads to death, a way without any future. However, the cross issues in resurrection. Therefore, our future is resurrection. The way we are taking does not end with death; our death issues in a living way. Consequently, it is not a way without a future. This way has a bright future.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A TESTIMONY CONCERNING CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>Based on my experience of following the Lord for more than fifty years, I can testify that the Lord is true and living. I was born into a Christian family. My mother belonged to the Southern Baptist Church. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day we all went with her to the service. Even though I heard the gospel many times, I never was saved. One afternoon in April 1925, out of curiosity I went to hear a lady preacher. At that time I was twenty years old. As I listened to her preach, God came to me, and I was caught by Him. As I was walking home after the meeting, I was called to consecrate myself to the Lord. So I stopped, and looking up into heaven, I said, &ldquo;O God, I want You. Even if the whole world is given to me, I do not want it. From now on I would like to be a poor preacher carrying my Bible and going to all the villages to preach the gospel. If there is nothing to eat, I will eat tree roots and dried sweet potatoes; if there is nothing to drink, I will drink water from the mountain streams.&rdquo; This was how I consecrated myself to the Lord.</p>
<p>After this I began studying at an English college that had been established by some Americans in northern China. I thought that I would go to the villages to preach the Lord Jesus when I graduated. The summer I graduated, I fulfilled my vow to God and went out to village after village preaching the gospel. No pastor encouraged me, and no preacher instructed me to do this. I was just a young person who went out to the villages to preach the gospel. The first gospel tract that I wrote was entitled <em>The Wonderful Way for Souls to Be Saved</em>. In those days printing was not well developed, so I used the old style of typesetting and printed on red paper the characters: <em>The Wonderful Way for Souls to Be Saved</em>. I took my Bible and a bundle of tracts and went from village to village passing out tracts to everyone. I felt that this was enjoyable. I wanted to be a gospel preacher for the rest of my life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPREADING OF THE WORK AND ITS BLESSING</h2>
<p>The Lord accomplished His heart&rsquo;s desire, and soon a local church was raised up in my hometown. Afterward, the Lord opened a door and quickly brought me to Shanghai, which was the largest city in China. Later, during the war against Japan, I was in Chefoo. In those days the churches had a number of saints with outstanding abilities and capabilities, and among the brothers in northeastern China, there were several wealthy brothers. They all loved the Lord and gave financially; thus, the Lord&rsquo;s work spread very quickly.</p>
<p>I told the brothers many times that we needed to use the human resources from northern China and the financial resources from northeastern China to spread into northwestern China. Hence, in March and April of 1943 seventy brothers and sisters migrated out of Chefoo to Inner Mongolia in the northwestern region of China. When they went, they consecrated all they had to the Lord. The church provided them with only their traveling expenses plus three months of living expenses. During their first three months, they had to find a way to make a living. Some taught in elementary schools, and some opened small businesses. All those who migrated were apostles. The following year an elder from the church in Chefoo went to visit the brothers and sisters who had migrated and saw that more than forty churches had been raised up.</p>
<p>Prior to the war, Western missionaries had sowed the seed of the gospel and shepherded some believers. During the war, the Western missionaries were held in custody by the Japanese in concentration camps, and the believers in the denominations that they had raised up were like sheep without a shepherd. When these seventy ordinary saints arrived, they did not bring only the gospel; they also brought the truth. They taught the truth and brought the wandering believers onto the way of the truth. Therefore, more than forty groups turned to take the way of the church. The seventy brothers and sisters migrated in March and April of 1943, and by wintertime they had raised up many churches.</p>
<p>In addition to the seventy saints who went to Inner Mongolia in the northwest of China, another thirty brothers and sisters went to the Yalu River region in the northeast. Later, we lost contact with them because of the changes in the political situation, and we do not know what happened to them. Hence, one hundred saints migrated in 1943; seventy of them went to the northwest and thirty to the northeast. This testimony shows that even when it may seem as though we are taking a way that leads to death, a way of termination, in resurrection the Lord opens for us a living way, a way with a bright future.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY FLOURISHING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In America</h2>
<p>I never thought that I would go to America. In 1938 a saint from Beijing sent me two checks; one check was for a round-trip ticket to America, and the other was to cover the living expenses for my wife and children in China for one year. The saint who sent the checks said that she had received the leading from the Lord and wanted me to go to America. I replied that I did not have the burden to go to America, and I asked her what I should do with the checks. She insisted that I keep the checks because one day the Lord would send me to America. In 1958 I was invited to England and Denmark, and I passed through the United States on my way to Europe, but I did not labor in America.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s leading was beyond what I could imagine. In 1949, when the Lord brought me to Taiwan, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was only among the Chinese-speaking saints; there were approximately one hundred churches in Taiwan and Southeast Asia. In 1962 I was led by the Lord to go to America to begin the work there, and in 1963 I began to put out <em>The Stream</em> magazine in English. I also published books in English. Due to these few English publications, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery quickly spread to all five continents. Of course, it first spread in America. Now there are more than ninety churches scattered across America. From the East Coast to the West Coast, the situation is very promising even though their numbers are not large. All kinds of people have been gained, and we can clearly see the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In Europe</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery also went to Germany. Although Germany is not an English-speaking country, German is related to English; hence, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was able to go to Germany by means of the English language. Not long after the recovery went to Germany, it spread to several other countries, such as England, France, Spain, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, and even Finland. There is a small church in Helsinki, Finland. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is still spreading in Europe. Last year and this year, we had trainings in Germany with more than eight hundred brothers and sisters meeting together. Most of them came from Germany, but a few of them came from other nearby countries. It was very encouraging. The saints who went from Taiwan thought that they would encourage the saints from Europe, but in the end they were encouraged by the saints from Europe. This strengthened the European saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In Russia</h2>
<p>In Europe the truths of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have been translated into several different languages. Our books have not only been translated into German, French, and Spanish; they have also been translated into Russian. The book <em>The Economy of God</em> has been printed in Russian and sent to Russia. In addition, approximately ten booklets have also been translated into Russian and sent to Russia. The Lord arranged for a Russian-speaking Jewish scholar to be a professor at a university near Seattle, Washington. He has doctorate degrees in both Russian and English, and he is happy to help us translate our spiritual publications. There is also a Russian sister in America who is helping our translator with the spiritual terms. They are currently translating <em>The Experience of Life</em> and other books of this category. A responsible brother from Seattle recently went to Russia to observe the situation. He discovered that there are many underground churches. The believers in these churches told him that they already have the Bible, but what they really needed was spiritual books like the ones he brought them. I hope that we will pray much for this.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In England</h2>
<p>The University of Manchester in England has a large body of students and a sizable campus. Recently, their librarian wrote a letter to the Living Stream Ministry in America. In his letter he said that he had received a few of the books put out by the Living Stream Ministry, which had been sent to him by the saints in the church in Blackpool. He enjoyed reading the books, and he requested that we send them a set of all our publications in Chinese, English, and any other language. He wants to put our publications in the university library. We immediately sent him copies of all our publications in Chinese, English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Korean, and even Filipino. This was the Lord&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In Central and South America</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has also gone to Central America, South America, and Mexico. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is flourishing in the mountainous region in Mexico. Our work, including our publications and videos, cannot keep up with the demand. They are on fire with zeal, and churches have been raised up in many places. There are now more than fifty churches in Mexico. We sent them six or seven video players, and the localities take turns watching the Life-study training tapes. This has been very effective.</p>
<p>In Brazil there is an amazing desire for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The brothers there purchased a large piece of property in a town that is a two-hour drive from Sao Paulo. In 1981 they finished building a meeting hall that can seat more than one thousand people. Recently, they purchased an old hospital in Sao Paulo, and they converted it into a big meeting hall. This is where the literature and printing work is done.</p>
<p>The testimony in Brazil began in 1959 when a few brothers from Taiwan and the Philippines migrated there. However, it was not until I went there in 1965 that they began to meet as the church. There were many Christians, and the brothers were desirous to meet with them as the local church. But after much consideration we felt that the local believers had a very strong religious, denominational atmosphere and that it was impossible for us to bear the one testimony together with them. Hence, in 1965 we began to meet as the church. In those days there were no Brazilian saints meeting with us; all the saints were Chinese, and the meetings were in Chinese.</p>
<p>I went there again in 1970 and then again fourteen years later in 1984. I was surprised by the progress that had been made. More than eleven hundred brothers and sisters attended the meetings, and more than one thousand of them were local Brazilians. There were only forty or fifty Chinese saints. In addition, there were fifty to sixty from Argentina, and there were others from the neighboring countries of Chile, Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia. Most of the Brazilian brothers and sisters have college degrees; several of them were pastors, ministers, or seminarians before they began to meet with us. Some of the saints are also doctors and medical students. The situation there was similar to what I see this time in Taipei. Their sharing was completely according to the contents of the Life-study messages. This proves that the Life-study messages had done a great work within them.</p>
<p>At present there are at least one hundred and fifty churches from Mexico to Brazil. Colombia, a cultured Spanish-speaking country, also has churches. Some brothers have begun meeting in the capital of Guatemala. Before they took the ground, they sent us a letter inviting the brothers and sisters in America to attend their first meeting.</p><h2 class="head2">In Africa</h2>
<p>In Africa the Lord&rsquo;s testimony began in Ghana. Ghana is on the west coast of Africa. It was called Gold Coast when it was a British colony, and it became the Republic of Ghana when it gained its independence. The Lord&rsquo;s testimony in Africa also began through our publications in English. From Ghana the Lord&rsquo;s recovery went to Nigeria. Nigeria is the largest country in West Africa. Its capital, Lagos, has nine million people. There is a church there. There is also a church in North Africa, in Libya.</p>
<p>In recent years the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has also gone to the Republic of South Africa, which is on the southernmost tip of Africa. Due to amendments in their constitution, Chinese people there enjoy the same rights and privileges as the Caucasians. There are three churches in South Africa, two of which are in the capital Pretoria and in Cape Town. There is also a church in Zimbabwe, which is a country to the northeast of South Africa. Not long ago they sent me a letter asking for permission to translate the Life-study messages. They also want us to supply them with our publications.</p>
<p>These African countries are economically weak, so we have been supplying them with free publications for the past few years. To date we have supplied books and tapes worth over fifty thousand U.S. dollars to Ghana alone. The situation in these countries is encouraging. The testimonies in these countries were not raised up by our going there; they were raised up by the publications. After being helped by the publications, some of the believers attended the trainings in America. Afterward, they returned to their country to raise up the testimony of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In Australia</h2>
<p>When we speak of Australia, we are including New Zealand. The situation in these countries is very encouraging. There are three or four churches in Australia, including churches in Sydney and Melbourne. There are approximately ten churches in New Zealand. We thank the Lord that the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are now in all five continents in the world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In Asia</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been in China for more than sixty years, but there was nothing happening in India or Burma (Myanmar). Many years ago some saints moved to the island of Ceylon, but the situation was not clear. However, over the past year or two the Lord has been working in India and Burma. The first church has been established in Burma, and the church in Bangkok, Thailand has been in contact with them. There is also a local Burmese young man who has been in contact with us by letter. His written English is very good. In his letters he told us that there are approximately nineteen groups meeting in Burma. They are not very clear concerning the way of the church, but he said that they receive much help when they read the Life-study messages. They have requested permission to translate all the Life-study messages into Burmese. He said that he is a young person who loves the Lord and is pursuing theology. We believe that in the future he will be brought into this way. We have also received a letter from another believer; based on his writing, use of words, and his name, he is probably a missionary from England. He said that they have several meeting places and several Bible-study groups. Since he has received much help from reading the Life-study messages, he wants to use the Life-study messages to supply the needs of their Bible studies. He asked for permission to use and translate these messages. These are two good situations.</p>
<p>In the southern part of India there is a brother who is a high school teacher, and he is about forty years of age. He began to fellowship with us because of our publications. He has lived in America for approximately one year. After this year&rsquo;s winter training, he will return to southern India and begin the church life there. I hope that we will all pray for this matter.</p>
<p>In recent years I have been receiving letters from believers in many countries telling me how much help they have received from the Life-study messages. I have saved all these letters, and I hope that one day the letters will be printed in a book entitled <em>Letters of Appreciation.</em></p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S WORK IN TAIWAN</h2>
<p>Some brothers and sisters are ready to go to Italy and India, and there are other brothers and sisters who want to go to Africa, Australia, and northern Europe. Every move involves specific steps, just as every military attack must have a strategy. Fighting a war requires not only skills but also strategies. One must not move too quickly; a desire to do something quickly prevents a person from being thorough. I look to the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit to work in you.</p>
<p>I have been living in the English-speaking world for more than twenty years. During this time I have visited Sydney and Melbourne in Australia as well as several cities in New Zealand; I have also traveled to Europe and to South America. I have a clear understanding of the situation in these places. From my observation of their situation, I feel that the churches in Taiwan have the most potential, because they have a history of more than thirty years. During these more than thirty years, the Lord has truly blessed Taiwan and made it peaceful and secure. The most necessary thing for the gospel work is a secure environment as well as a well-educated population. Then when the Lord&rsquo;s recovery comes with the gospel and the truth, it will be easy to &ldquo;catch fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the first six or seven years, our numbers increased one hundredfold, from five hundred to fifty thousand. Later our increase was interrupted because too much emphasis was placed on &ldquo;spiritual pursuit.&rdquo; The thirty-five years of our history in Taiwan can be divided into five seven-year periods. During the first seven years, the number of saints increased from five hundred to fifty thousand. Due to the interruption, we no longer had a definite direction. Hence, we have not increased in numbers for the past twenty-eight years, or the past four seven-year periods. At present, there are only forty-five to fifty thousand brothers and sisters in all of Taiwan.</p>
<p>A certain group in Hong Kong put out a book with statistics. This book said that in Taiwan the Presbyterian denomination has the largest number of Christians; it has more than eighty thousand people. The second largest group is the &ldquo;Local Church,&rdquo; with forty-five thousand people. The third largest group is the True Jesus Church. This group is mainly in the mountainous areas and has more than twenty thousand people. Our numbers are low because for the last twenty-eight years our work has mainly been to stabilize and maintain; we did not do a work of spreading as we did in the first seven years. Of course, we must thank the Lord for the stability of our present situation.</p>
<p>We confess that we have many weaknesses and shortcomings, but our situation is better than the situation of other Christians groups. We have been equipping many saints for more than ten years. When I returned to Taiwan in 1966, many of the young people wanted to serve the Lord full time, and they wrote down their consecration. That was eighteen years ago. We still have their consecrations. I believe that more than one thousand saints consecrated themselves. What they wrote was a contract with the Lord. Therefore, as one who represents the Lord, I have come to tell you that it is time for you to fulfill your contract.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHINESE-SPEAKING WORK IN AMERICA</h2>
<p>When I began the work in America, I was clear that my burden was not to do a Chinese-speaking work, because if I did such a work, the English-speaking work would be neglected. If we wanted to do a Chinese-speaking work, we should not have gone to America. Since we went to America, we needed to carry the Lord&rsquo;s testimony to the English-speaking world. Hence, for the past twenty years I have worked only among the English-speaking. Praise the Lord that we have seen the Lord&rsquo;s blessing in this matter. The American government changed its immigration laws two years ago and increased the quota for Chinese people immigrating to the United States from twenty thousand per year to forty thousand per year; hence, the number of Chinese immigrating to America has drastically increased. When I observed that many brothers and sisters who immigrated to the United States were not receiving any care, I fellowshipped with the Chinese brothers and told them that we had to begin to pay attention to the work among the Chinese-speaking. There are now five or six highly educated Chinese brothers in America who left their successful careers to serve the Lord full time and work mainly on the university campuses.</p>
<p>The many students from Taiwan who go to the United States to study are on almost every campus in the country. Because these students do very well in their studies and get excellent grades, they have improved the reputation of the Chinese people. The second-generation Chinese children, who grew up in America, are also top students in elementary school, junior high school, and high school. It is difficult to compete with the Chinese students. Even in Great Britain there are Chinese professors in the math department of most universities. In other words, math departments have become the domain of Chinese professors. Two-thirds of the graduate students in the department of computer science are Chinese. A weekly news magazine in America published an article last year saying that America and Japan are competing with each other across the Pacific Ocean in the field of computer technology; however, the competition is not between America and Japan but between the Chinese and Japanese people, because most of the computer people in America are Chinese.</p>
<p>Since we began the Chinese-speaking work by visiting the students on the university campuses, we have discovered that all the campuses have Chinese Christian associations. Every university in America that has Chinese Christians also has a Chinese Christian association. Since most of the leaders in these Chinese Christian associations were raised up among us, when we visit these associations, we are warmly welcomed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOSPELIZING AND TRUTHIZING TAIWAN</h2>
<p>The church in Taipei has been blessed financially and with many competent saints. In addition, the country and society are in a good condition. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we have been on this island for more than thirty years, and our brothers and sisters are in all levels of society. Taiwan today is densely populated; there are almost two million people in the city of Taipei. The people in Taipei can be compared to two million fish swimming around us. We should go out to catch the fish. We have a rare opportunity. All the young saints and middle-aged saints should go out to catch fish.</p>
<p>Our first step is to spread the Lord&rsquo;s recovery all over Taiwan. We should pray and ask the Lord to gospelize Taiwan. The gospel should not be spread merely in Taipei. It should also spread to every town. The entire island of Taiwan must be evangelized, and it must be truthized. We must spread the truths that the Lord has shown us to all the people in Taiwan. We must spread the truth until every household in Taiwan knows the truth. We must let the truth saturate the entire island of Taiwan. According to our calculations, it will take five to ten years to gospelize and truthize Taiwan.</p>
<p>The Gospel Book Room is established and has been publishing books for more than thirty years. Our books are pure; they speak only of the gospel and the truth. These are what the human race needs. We truly believe that the gospel and the truth are two strong factors that will cause God to bless this country and to gain thousands of believers from this country.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters who want to spread the gospel in northern and southern Europe should not be impatient. We must concentrate our efforts on Taipei. Taipei is our Jerusalem. We must be the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses in Jerusalem and then all of Judea, Samaria, and the uttermost part of the earth. We cannot skip Jerusalem and go to the land of Judea. No, we must begin here and then spread out. We believe that one hundred saints going to Africa or three hundred going to South America will not be sufficient. The need in every place is great.</p>
<p>All five continents are open to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, mainly because of the truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Our greatest need is to produce a model in Taiwan for our spreading. Therefore, we must begin in Taiwan and spend three to five years to develop a model. Then we can take this model to other places. Hence, our first step must be in Taiwan, and we must begin with Taipei.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING SERVING FULL TIME</h2>
<p>Serving the Lord requires time and energy; thus, we need some saints who will offer up their time and their energy. This is a must. However, we should not have the concept that as soon as we offer ourselves up, we are a preacher. We do not have preachers among us; we are all the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses. If the Lord moves in our environment so that our living is provided for, then we can serve Him full time. If the Lord does not provide for our living in this way, we must have a job. This is the pattern left to us by the apostle Paul.</p>
<p>Paul was a full-time serving one, but there were times when the churches did not support him; that is, the offerings from the saints were not sufficient. Therefore, he made tents with his own hands to supply not only his own needs but also the needs of his companions. This does not mean that Paul was a preacher for a few years and then opened a tent factory when he was not paid. We should not say that when we are full-time serving ones, we are members of the clergy or that we have entered a religious organization. We do not have a religious organization; we are brothers and sisters just like the other saints. But the Lord has blessed us with the burden to use all our time and energy for the Lord.</p>
<p>Even though some brothers do not serve full time, we cannot say that they are not co-workers or that they are not in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Were Aquila and Priscilla full-time serving ones? It is correct to say that they were full-timers, and it is also correct to say that they were not full-timers. This couple did not only serve the Lord with their time and energy; they also opened their home for the Lord&rsquo;s use. Wherever they went, there were meetings in their home; this was the case in Rome and in Ephesus. In this aspect they served full time. However, in Acts 18:1-3 when Paul was in Corinth, he remained with them and worked, because their profession was also tent-making.</p>
<p>We have fellowshipped in the past about the need for the church in Taipei to produce five hundred serving ones. Two hundred of these will serve full time, and three hundred will serve part time. Some saints are able to offer up all their time, but others cannot give all their time; they can give only part of their time to serve. This is still very good. This helps with finances, it is a good testimony, and it helps bring people to salvation.</p>
<p>We have a desire that our university graduates would not work immediately after graduating or upon completing their military service. Instead, they should fulfill two years of &ldquo;church military service.&rdquo; During these two years, they should spend four hours every morning to read the Life-study messages and the Recovery Version with the footnotes. They will be able to finish reading the Recovery Version with the footnotes in two years. Moreover, they will be able to finish reading all the Life-study messages; this is roughly twelve hundred messages. This is a good education. In the afternoon they will have time to rest and fellowship, and in the evenings they will either attend meetings, go to the campuses to contact people, or go visit people in their homes.</p>
<p>After two years we will see what the Lord has manifested in them and what their desire and burden are. If there is a clear manifestation of the Lord in them, and if their burden is strong, they can continue to serve for one, two, or even three more years. This way we will be able to determine who should get a job. Some brothers and sisters must obey their parents; they cannot make their own decisions. If their parents do not agree for them to be in such a program, the saints should not argue. We hope that through this practice, the church would not be just a home and a hospital but also a spiritual school for the saints to be educated in the truth. This will have a tremendous influence on the churches.</p>
<p>There are four areas that we must develop in Taiwan. First, we must recover the brothers and sisters who have been absent from the meetings for a long time. In Taipei there are at least ten thousand such saints. We need to go and fellowship with them. Second, we must do a gospel work on the campuses. The junior high schools, the high schools, the junior colleges, and the universities all need such a work. We need enough full-time serving ones to do this work. Third, we must actively promote the children&rsquo;s work. We hope that within one year there will be ten thousand children in the children&rsquo;s meetings of the church in Taipei. Fourth, we must preach the gospel in the community. We must take advantage of the people we know, and we must contact our relatives, colleagues, and friends. We need many saints to do this.</p>
<p>We must be clear that this is the Lord&rsquo;s leading, and we must have faith that the Lord will bless His church. The Lord will also bless this country and this society because of this move. We should pray for our country and for our society. We must especially pray for the president and the officials of this country and ask the Lord to give them wisdom so that this country would progress until it is full of the gospel and the truth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TREASURES IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING IN THE &ldquo;CHURCH ARMY&rdquo; FOR TWO YEARS</h2>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s leading, we hope that all of the college students among us will give the first two years after their graduation to the Lord, just as the young men in Taiwan do for military service. This is the most precious time of their lives. When we give to the Lord, we receive from the Lord. The clever children in a family do not ask their parents for things. Instead, they give things to their parents. When they give their parents one item, their parents give them three items in return. Only foolish children continually ask their parents for things without giving anything in return.</p>
<p>When we are touched by the Lord to give a material offering, we feel to give a certain amount, but after considering our offering, we often cut the amount in half. Then if we consider the amount again, we cut it in half once more. If we consider a third time whether or not we should give, we think that there is no need to give at all. But we must realize that whenever we stop giving, the Lord&rsquo;s supply to us will stop also. As a child of God, I can testify that if we give to the Lord, He will definitely give to us. Offering something to the Lord is always a good deal, because we will be blessed by the Lord. Hence, if the young people give two years to the Lord, He will be able to do many things within them.</p>
<p>The largest heretical group in America is the Mormons. Even though they are a heretical group, they are spreading quickly. All their believers, both male and female, must serve for two years. They voluntarily give these two years and even pay for their own expenses. From the time they are children, they are taught in school that they must serve for two years. Their parents cooperate and prepare the children to serve. When it is the child&rsquo;s birthday, the parents give the child some money and tell him to put it in the bank to be used for his two years of service in the future. In this way they are prepared from a young age to serve. After they graduate from college, they use their savings for their &ldquo;military service&rdquo; to their group.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ACTIVELY GAINING PEOPLE BY PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>If the Mormons can gain people for the sake of their religion, should we not do something even higher for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? In the church in Taipei there are five to six thousand people who are practically in the church life. How should we use these six thousand people? Should they simply come week after week to meeting after meeting? We have so much land, but there is no one to till the ground. Who should go to till the ground, and who will plant?</p>
<p>Many brothers and sisters are willing to enter into the burden of the ministry and to go present the truth to others. You will discover that when you present the truth, you learn more. If a person does not teach, he will not know how much education he lacks. Perhaps you are a university graduate with a mathematics degree, but when you begin to teach, you will discover that your knowledge of mathematics is insufficient and that you need some reference books. Even if you have reference books, you need to study them and learn teaching methods. Likewise, if we do not present the truth to people, we will not know how short we are in the truth. As soon as we go out to preach the truth, we will immediately realize how short we are and how much we need to continue learning.</p>
<p>If we love the Lord, the church, and the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we cannot continue to be satisfied with only six thousand saints in the meetings for five years. If we truly love the Lord, we will have five thousand saints one year, eight thousand the next year, and thirteen thousand saints the following year. If we have fifteen thousand saints now, we should have a multifold increase in seven years. According to the Bible, wheat bears at least a thirtyfold increase. This is the word of the Lord Jesus, and it is His minimum requirement of us. Hence, if we have fifteen thousand saints, after seven years we should be able to multiply thirtyfold. We should have four hundred and fifty thousand saints.</p>
<p>Recently, a brother&rsquo;s wife was sick and went to a hospital. The brother discovered that there are more than one hundred brothers and sisters working as doctors and nurses in that hospital. That hospital can be compared to a piece of land. Some &ldquo;farmers&rdquo; should have gone there long ago to work the land. But we only recently found out that more than one hundred brothers and sisters work there. If the Catholic Church were in a similar situation, they would have immediately sent a priest and two nuns to take care of that hospital. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day they would hold mass in the hospital, and the priest would take the bread from the mass to every Catholic in the hospital. When the patient in the bed next to a Catholic asks what is happening, the Catholic would answer that his priest is bringing him the mass. This would touch the other patients, and they would want to join the Catholic Church. This is why the Catholic Church can gain a million new members every year without holding evangelistic meetings. We, however, are like those who go fishing with no bait on the hook. Moreover, our hooks are straight, so it is no wonder that we do not have much increase.</p>
<p>It would be worthwhile to have two co-workers, preferably one brother and one sister, help the saints who are working in the hospital to grow in life and also to care for the patients by preaching the gospel to them. In this way many people will be brought in. If we did things according to this principle, we would need more than five hundred full-time serving ones. In order to go to the many hospitals and the hundreds of schools to properly preach the gospel, we must equip ourselves. We must at least spend the time to finish reading the Life-study of the New Testament. However, this is only a foundation. We must study our publications also.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE TREASURES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Life-studies</h2>
<p>My burden is that we would enter into the truth. We must spend time to get into the Life-study messages. I have the assurance and I strongly believe that the Life-study messages are the best tool for opening the Bible for our understanding. Both those who are young and those who are old should spend two hours a day getting into one Life-study message, including the verses related to the message, and the footnotes and cross references related to the verses. If you are willing to read one message a day in this way for six days every week, in one year you will be able to read three hundred messages, and in four years you will have read all the New Testament Life-study messages. If you are willing to make a strong decision to do this and if you study diligently for four years, you will have a good foundation in the holy Word of God; not only so, you will also grow in life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Basic Truths in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery</h2>
<h2 class="head3">God&rsquo;s Creation</h2>
<p>The first item of the basic truths in the Bible is God&rsquo;s creation. In order to grasp this truth, we must read the first chapter of Genesis. There are several subpoints related to God&rsquo;s creation. First, God created nonliving things. These are the heavens, the earth, light, the atmosphere, and all other myriads of things without life.</p>
<p>Second, God created living things. There are three steps in this point: the creation of things with the lowest level of life, the creation of things with a higher level of life, and the creation of things with the highest level of life. The lowest level of life includes things without feelings or consciousness like plants, the next level of life includes animals such as fish and birds, and the highest level of non-human life includes beasts like monkeys and horses.</p>
<p>Third, God created the life that resembles Him, and this refers to the creation of man. God created man in His image and according to His likeness (v. 26). God created all things. We must remember these points and spend time to get into the Bible to study them. We should also refer to our books to learn the main items related to these points.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Man&rsquo;s Fall</h2>
<p>The second item of the basic truths is man&rsquo;s fall, which is recorded in Genesis 3. This item consists of two points. First, man transgressed and became a sinner, a transgressor before God; he was condemned by God&rsquo;s law (Rom. 3:23). Second, in his transgression man&rsquo;s inward nature became sinful. When man fell, he not only broke God&rsquo;s law, which is outward, but also received Satan&rsquo;s poison, which is inward. In this way Satan entered into human nature and became man&rsquo;s sinful nature (7:17, 20). Hence, as a result of man&rsquo;s fall, man has both sinful deeds and a sinful nature; his outward deeds are sins, and his inward nature is sin. These are the results of man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<p>God saves fallen human beings by resolving the problem of sins and by dealing with our sin. The hymn &ldquo;Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #1058) is a good Christian song. It is a valuable, classic Christian hymn. The key point of this hymn is found in the last lines of the first stanza: &ldquo;Let the water and the blood, / From Thy riven side which flowed, / Be of sin the double cure, / Save me from its guilt and power.&rdquo; Guilt is due to our outward sinful deeds and shows that we have received eternal punishment; power refers to the power of the sinful nature within us. How can we resolve the problem of sin and sins? It is through the water and the blood which flowed from the Lord&rsquo;s riven side. The blood redeems us from the eternal punishment related to our sins, and the water saves us from the power of sin. This is the double cure mentioned in this hymn. Therefore, this hymn is well written, and the truth in it is very clear.</p>
<p>This shows that we must have a thorough knowledge of the truth. &ldquo;Let the water and the blood, / From Thy riven side which flowed, / Be of sin the double cure, / Save me from its guilt and power.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s blood washes away our outward transgressions and saves us from the guilt of eternal punishment. The water denotes the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life, which enters into us and is the power to deliver us from the power of sin. In Romans 7:24 Paul said, &ldquo;Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of this death?&rdquo; He is speaking of our inward, sinful nature. In 8:1 Paul says, &ldquo;There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; The condemnation here does not refer to being condemned to go to the lake of fire but to the condemning within us. Many husbands do not want to lose their temper with their wife. They set their will and pray, but they still lose their temper. After getting angry, they condemn themselves for being wretched, and they wonder who can save them. However, there is now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, because the law of the Spirit of life has freed us from the law of sin and of death (v. 2). This is what is referred to in the line of the hymn &ldquo;Save me from its...power.&rdquo; The blood redeems us outwardly, and the life saves us inwardly. Redemption delivers us from our sinful deeds, and salvation delivers us from our sinful nature.</p><h2 class="head3">God&rsquo;s Redemption</h2>
<p>The third item of the basic truths is God&rsquo;s redemption. In Christianity there are many writings concerning God&rsquo;s redemption. Although they may be correct, they are incomplete. Hence, we need to fellowship concerning the points of God&rsquo;s redemption. Man was created by God, but he fell out of God&rsquo;s hands. God was not willing to give man up; He wanted to save man back to Himself. But God had to pay a price in order to accomplish this salvation; thus, there was a need for redemption. It was not sufficient for God merely to save man; His salvation needed to include redemption. This can be compared to an item being taken to a pawnshop. If you want the item back, you need to redeem it with money. In the fall we sold ourselves. In God&rsquo;s view, however, this sale was not final; we were redeemable. Hence, God came in to redeem us. In order for God to save us, He first had to redeem us. This is the purpose of redemption.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s redemption we must pass through seven steps for its completion. The first step is the redemption from sins (Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14). The Lord redeemed us from our sins. Strictly speaking, this is redemption, but it is only the first step of redemption. The Lord cleared up our sins and redeemed us from the condemnation of the law. The second step is the forgiveness of sins (Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14; Acts 2:38). Luke 24:47 says, &ldquo;That repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed.&rdquo; Hence, one aspect of the gospel is that it is the gospel of the forgiveness of sins. The third step is the cleansing from sins (1 John 1:7, 9). The Lord does not merely forgive us our sins; He also washes away every trace of our sins from us so that it is as if we never sinned at all.</p>
<p>The fourth step of redemption is sanctification (Heb. 10:29). First Corinthians 6:11 says that we were washed, we were sanctified, and we were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God. Theology mainly teaches that we are first justified and then sanctified, but some verses in the Bible say that we are first sanctified and then justified. Sanctification refers to the fact that God has separated us unto holiness. God redeemed us from our sins, forgave us our sins, and cleansed us from our sins. Then God said that we are sanctified, we are different from everything else, and we no longer belong to this world. This sanctification is objective and positional.</p>
<p>The fifth step of redemption is justification (Rom. 3:24-25). After sanctifying us, God justifies us. The sixth step is reconciliation (5:10; Eph. 2:16; Col. 1:20, 22). God causes us to be reconciled to Himself. The seventh step is acceptance (2 Cor. 6:2; Luke 15:22-24). Second Corinthians 6:2 says, &ldquo;Behold, now is the well-acceptable time.&rdquo; God is happy when He accepts us. Just as in the parable of the prodigal son, He is happy when a son returns home, because the son who was lost has been found. Being lost and found again is part of redemption. Hence, the seven steps of God&rsquo;s redemption are redemption from sins, forgiveness of sins, cleansing from sins, sanctification, justification, reconciliation, and acceptance.</p>
<p>These seven steps of God&rsquo;s redemption are completely objective. When most people in Christianity speak of God&rsquo;s salvation, they speak only of the aspect of redemption, which was accomplished by the Lord&rsquo;s blood. The Lord&rsquo;s blood redeems us; it redeems us from our sins, forgives us of our sins, cleanses us from our sins, sanctifies us, justifies us before God, reconciles us to God, and causes us to be accepted by God. This is redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head3">God&rsquo;s Dispensing</h2>
<p>The fourth item of the basic truths is God&rsquo;s dispensing. This is the theology of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The theology outside of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery does not have this item. Most believers in Christianity speak only of God&rsquo;s redemption, which is entirely objective and refers to God&rsquo;s redeeming us through the blood. God&rsquo;s dispensing, however, is very subjective. There are seven points in God&rsquo;s dispensing.</p>
<p>The first point is regeneration (John 3:3). Through regeneration God gives us His life after He has redeemed us. In other words, God plants Himself as the seed of life into us, causing us to receive His life. As soon as we obtain God&rsquo;s life, we are regenerated in our spirit. This means that we are born of God. This is the first step of the Triune God&rsquo;s dispensing of Himself into us.</p>
<p>The second point in God&rsquo;s dispensing is sanctification (1 Thes. 5:23). This sanctification is not outward; it is inward. It is subjective, not objective. It is dispositional, not positional. In this sanctification the Lord does not sanctify us with His blood; rather, He sanctifies us by dispensing His life into us.</p>
<p>The third point in God&rsquo;s dispensing is renewing (Rom. 12:2; Titus 3:5). When God sanctifies us with His divine life, His life renews us inwardly.</p>
<p>The fourth point in God&rsquo;s dispensing is transformation (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18). Transformation is not an outward change. At the most, philosophies and doctrines can change us, but they cannot transform us. Change is mainly an outward matter, just as people wear make-up on their faces. If my complexion is pale, and I put on some powder and then apply some reddish cosmetics, my face will become rosy. This is change, not transformation. What is transformation? Transformation is metabolic. My complexion is pale because my body lacks nourishment. Therefore, if I eat nourishing food every day, after one or two months my body will be transformed, and my face will exhibit a healthy, ruddy glow. This is not a matter of putting on make-up but of an inward transformation. This is a metabolic process.</p>
<p>Inorganic objects do not have metabolic processes; only living things have metabolic processes. Animals and plants all have metabolic processes, just as humans do. People with a good metabolism are always healthy; people with a poor metabolism are usually sick. The divine life in every Christian involves the highest process of metabolism. Every day the Lord supplies us with a new element, and this new element metabolically discharges the old elements within us. This is transformation.</p>
<p>We should not expect to be able to change our temper. A person with a bad temper should not try to change it, because the more he tries to suppress his temper, the worse it will become. Instead, he should constantly eat Jesus. The Lord Jesus said that He was the bread of life which came down from heaven and that those who eat Him will live because of Him (John 6:35, 51, 57). We must take the Lord as the bread of life and eat Him every day. When we eat Him, we will be supplied inwardly; we will receive a new element that will metabolically discharge our old elements. This is transformation.</p>
<p>The fifth point in God&rsquo;s dispensing is conformation. God wants us to be conformed to the image of His Son (Rom. 8:29). Transformation is a matter of essence, and conformation is a matter of image. When Adam was created, he had God&rsquo;s image, but he did not have the essence of God&rsquo;s life. However, when we are saved, we receive the essence of God&rsquo;s life. The nature of this life essence is to transform us inwardly day by day, causing us to have God&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>Every kind of life has its own life element, life essence, life law, and life shape. When a peach tree grows and matures, it spontaneously produces peaches; this is according to its life. This also applies to animals; every kind of life has its own shape or form. The cat life produces the likeness of a cat, and the dog life produces the likeness of a dog. We have God&rsquo;s life, and this life is growing inside of us, transforming us, and conforming us to God&rsquo;s image. Since it is the life of God, it produces the image of God. This is conformation.</p>
<p>The sixth point in God&rsquo;s dispensing is glorification (v. 30). Glorification does not mean that we glorify God but that God glorifies us. According to the general concept in Christianity, we glorify God by doing good deeds; these good deeds allow people to see that we are Christians, and as a result, they praise God. This is the general concept concerning what it means to glorify God. We dare not say that this is wrong, but this is very shallow. God is glorified when He lives out from within us. God&rsquo;s dispensing is God coming to glorify us. God is constantly dispensing Himself into us, and His element of life glorifies us.</p>
<p>We are not speaking about <em>glory,</em> which is a noun; we are speaking of <em>glorifying,</em> which is a verb. God does not merely want to regenerate us, sanctify us, and renew us; He also wants to transform us, conform us, and in the end to glorify us. One day we will be in glory. It seems as though we will enter into glory. However, glory will be expressed from within us. This can be compared to a seed that is planted into the earth and grows. After the seed sprouts, it grows until it blooms. When the roses in a garden are in bloom, we see rose blossom after rose blossom. The flowers are the glory of the rose bush. We all have a &ldquo;rose seed&rdquo; within us&mdash;God Himself. On the one hand, He is growing within us, and on the other hand, He is sanctifying, renewing, and transforming us. The more we are transformed, the more we will be like Him. The more we are like Him, the more glory we express. This is the true meaning of glorification.</p>
<p>Finally, the seventh point is the ultimate manifestation of God&rsquo;s dispensing&mdash;the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2). God&rsquo;s dispensing begins with our regeneration, and it continues to its ultimate manifestation. In eternity we will become the New Jerusalem for God&rsquo;s expression and His magnification.</p>
<p>This is an outline of the theology in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It spans from creation to the ultimate consummation in the New Jerusalem. We can say that our theology includes all sixty-six books of the Bible.</p><h2 class="head2">Some Important Terms in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery</h2>
<p>In addition to studying the Life-study messages and the basic truths, we must study some important terms in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head3">God</h2>
<p>We must study God; that means we must study the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;Jehovah God. This topic is great. For the past twenty centuries no one has studied the Triune God as thoroughly as we have. We have expounded almost every verse in every chapter in the Scriptures that refers to the Triune God&mdash;to the Father, to the Son, and to the Spirit. Some of us may have been in Christianity for many years without ever hearing that when the Lord Jesus came to the earth, He came with the Father. When I was a young person in Christianity, I heard only how God so loved the world that He sent His Son to the earth but that God remained in heaven on His throne. If we were to ask the theologians in Christianity, I am afraid that they would say the same thing. After spending much time to study this matter, I can say that in the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus repeatedly said that He came from the Father and with the Father (7:29; 8:29). When the Lord Jesus came, He was the Son of God, who was sent by God and who came from God; however, He also brought the sending Father with Him. Hence, in the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus repeatedly said that the Father was with Him and that the Father never left Him (v. 29; 16:32). John 14 records how Philip asked the Lord to show the Father to the disciples, and the Lord Jesus said to Philip, &ldquo;Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?&rdquo; (vv. 9-10).</p>
<p>In verse 10 the word <em>in</em> is not merely to be &ldquo;with&rdquo;; rather, it is to be &ldquo;within.&rdquo; For example, if a brother is with me from morning to evening, we are with one another. However, I cannot enter into him, nor can he enter into me; we cannot be within one another. But the Son is in the Father, and the Father is in the Son (10:38). No one can describe this type of being &ldquo;in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some people may ask whether this means that the two are one. Yes, They are one, but They are also two. Modalism annuls the distinction between the Father and the Son by saying that the Father and the Son are one entity. However, scriptural theology teaches that the Father and the Son are one by the Son being in the Father and the Father being in the Son, yet the two are clearly distinct. This is a mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ</h2>
<p>We must know Christ. If we would know Christ, we should know that Christ is all-inclusive. In the table of contents of our hymnal, under the category &ldquo;Praise of the Lord&rdquo; there is a sub-category &ldquo;His All-inclusiveness.&rdquo; We need to know Christ not only in His love, His grace, His light, and His power; we should also know His all-inclusiveness and His unlimitedness. Even if we were to give ten million messages on the riches of Christ, we would not be able to exhaust the riches of Christ. We must pursue to know Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Spirit</h2>
<p>We need to know the Spirit. For two thousand years, almost nothing has been spoken in Christianity concerning the seven Spirits, but the last book of the Bible refers specifically to the seven Spirits. Matthew 28:19 says, &ldquo;Go...baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Then Revelation 1:4-5 says, &ldquo;Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth.&rdquo; Did you hear about the seven Spirits when you were in the denominations or in the Catholic Church? Did you ever see a book on the seven Spirits? The creed that was instituted by the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325 is incomplete because it does not reflect the book of Revelation; it does not mention the seven Spirits. We must study the items concerning the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Believers</h2>
<p>We must study the believers. The believers are the saved ones. We must study about ourselves to see what we are. We know that we are saved, but what are we? Those who are not saved do not know what Christians or believers are, and even the believers do not know what they themselves are. Thus, we must read through the New Testament to study ourselves.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Church, the Kingdom, and<br />
the New Heaven and the New Earth</h2>
<p>We must study the church, and we must study the kingdom, which is the coming millennial kingdom. Moreover, we must study the new heaven and the new earth, in which is the New Jerusalem. These are the important terms in the Bible: <em>God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, the church, the kingdom,</em> and <em>the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem.</em> We must thoroughly study all of these items.</p>
<p>Three treasures we possess are the Life-studies, our theology from creation to the New Jerusalem, and the important terms in the Bible&mdash;<em>God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, the church, the kingdom,</em> and <em>the new heaven and the new earth.</em> If we spend time to study these treasures, we will definitely receive a good foundation in the truth.</p><h2 class="head2">Life</h2>
<p>Life is another item of the treasures in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I did not place life further up on the list, because life is related to experience; it is not a doctrine. Life depends upon our experience; hence, we must study our experiences to see how we were regenerated, how we are being transformed, how we will mature, and so forth. We cannot understand this point merely by studying the Bible. We must match what we read in the Bible with our experience.</p>
<p>If we are willing to spend the time to study life, we will certainly be enriched. When we contact people, we will not be short of things to say. On the contrary, the more we speak, the more we will have to say. This is what is spoken of in Matthew 13:52: &ldquo;Every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.&rdquo; If we are full of spiritual riches, they will pour out of us like rivers of living water. John 7:38 speaks of &ldquo;rivers of living water.&rdquo; There is not just one river; there are many rivers. In other words, many rivers will flow out of our innermost being.</p>
<p>If we would all function normally, our society and country will be greatly blessed. Furthermore, the local churches will be brightly shining golden lampstands, preaching the gospel on the one hand and teaching the truth on the other. In this way Taiwan would not only be gospelized but also truthized. How great a blessing this would be! I hope that you remember these words, because they will be your compass and your guide.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Hymns</h2>
<p>In addition, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has a hymnal. Hymns and spiritual songs are not ordinary compositions. A person&rsquo;s ability to compose determines his ability to write good hymns. You must therefore pursue the knowledge of the Bible so that what you know can be composed into a hymn. For example, based on an accumulation of sixty years of Bible study and on my knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, I wrote <em>Hymns,</em> #501. This hymn does not only contain knowledge, but it is knowledge that produced this hymn.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>O glorious Christ, Savior mine,<br />
Thou art truly radiance divine;<br />
God infinite, in eternity,<br />
Yet man in time, finite to be.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God mingled with humanity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives in me my all to be.</li>
</ol>
<p>The parallelism in the hymn is very good&mdash;&ldquo;God...yet man&rdquo; and &ldquo;infinite...finite.&rdquo; This makes ordinary knowledge into poetry.</p>
<ol class="decimal" start="2">
<li>The fullness of God dwells in Thee;<br />
Thou dost manifest God&rsquo;s glory;<br />
In flesh Thou hast redemption wrought;<br />
As Spirit, oneness with me sought.<br /><br /></li>
<li>All things of the Father are Thine;<br />
All Thou art in Spirit is mine;<br />
The Spirit makes Thee real to me,<br />
That Thou experienced might be.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The Spirit of life causes Thee<br />
By Thy Word to transfer to me.<br />
Thy Spirit touched, Thy word received,<br />
Thy life in me is thus conceived.<br /><br /></li>
<li>In spirit while gazing on Thee,<br />
As a glass reflecting Thy glory,<br />
Like to Thyself transformed I&rsquo;ll be,<br />
That Thou might be expressed thru me.<br /><br /></li>
<li>In no other way could we be<br />
Sanctified and share Thy vict&rsquo;ry;<br />
Thus only spiritual we&rsquo;ll be<br />
And touch the life of glory.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Thy Spirit will me saturate,<br />
Every part will God permeate,<br />
Deliv&rsquo;ring me from the old man,<br />
With all saints building for His plan.</li>
</ol>
<p>This hymn contains the truth. I hope that the young brothers and sisters will all learn to write hymns, because it can raise the level of their knowledge and experience of life. We need to study and to learn the truth, after which we will be able to write hymns. The situation in most of Christianity is that believers rely on the clergy and think that in order to serve in the church, a person must study theology and graduate with a degree to be a pastor or minister. This is not our way. Instead, we believe that the church is the Body of Christ and that every believer as a member of the Body is able to function. Hence, every one of us is a member of the priesthood (1 Pet. 2:9).</p>
<p>In 1963 and 1964 with much effort I compiled a hymnal in America. One of the hymns that was included is &ldquo;Drinking at the Fountain That Never Runs Dry&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #322). I admire this hymn because it speaks of human experience. The writer thoroughly examined the experience of human life and turned human experience into a hymn. If your grandparents, parents, or classmates have not yet believed in the Lord, you can sing this hymn to them and then, based on this hymn, preach the gospel and speak the truth to them. This hymn is excellent and very inspiring.</p>
<p>In addition, you can use #715 in the Chinese hymnal to preach the gospel. I wrote this hymn, and it is very simple, but its descriptions are very appropriate. This hymn should be sung with expression; it should not be stiff or formal.</p>
<p>The first stanza says, &ldquo;You are fallen in a world of sin; / Why don&rsquo;t you repent now and escape? / You are walking in the way of wickedness and snares; / Why don&rsquo;t you turn back before you fall into the abyss?&rdquo; And the chorus says, &ldquo;The Lord wants to save you! He is waiting for you! / Why don&rsquo;t you let Him save you today?&rdquo; The entire hymn is a good gospel message with four main points: sin, Satan, death, and the Lord&rsquo;s redemption. The students can sing this hymn to eight or ten of their classmates. After they finish singing, they can tell them, &ldquo;Do you not see that you are like a fish or a bird caught in a net? You are like a patient on the operating table, allowing the surgeon, the world, to do whatever he wants.&rdquo; Such a gospel will be moving. We must be inwardly filled with the truth, and we must experience the truth so that we can write hymns. Then our preaching of the gospel will be effective.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE MULTIFACETED CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<p>The Gospel of John and the book of Colossians are two books in the Bible that speak of Christ as life in a clear and definite way. These two books use plain words, not types or parables, to speak concerning life. In the Gospel of John the Lord said, &ldquo;I am...the life&rdquo; (11:25). The Lord did not say, &ldquo;I am your life.&rdquo; Hence, in this verse He spoke of life from an objective aspect, not according to the subjective experience of the believers. However, in Colossians Paul says, &ldquo;Christ our life&rdquo; (3:4). This is not only a fact; it is also related to the subjective experience of the believers.</p>
<p>When we consider our history, we see that, according to scriptural principles, the Lord has led us along a comprehensive path. Not only are there facts, but there are also subjective experiences. In this message I am not emphasizing facts; I am emphasizing experience. For many years the Lord has given us a comprehensive leading. We have studied many Christian groups to see their strengths and their weaknesses. When we compared our observations to our experience, we learned that the Lord&rsquo;s way, which is the same as the way shown in the Bible, is multifaceted.</p>
<p>The revelation contained in the sixty-six books of the Bible is multifaceted. For example, the four living creatures mentioned in Ezekiel are also in Revelation. Each of the four living creatures has four faces: at the front is the face of a man; on the right, the face of a lion; on the left, the face of an ox; and at the back, the face of an eagle. What are the four creatures? Are they men, lions, oxen, or eagles? Based on the revelation in the Bible, we can say that the four living creatures are multifaceted.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES<br />
THE PROBLEMS IN THE CHURCH BEING DUE TO<br />
A LACK OF MULTIFACETEDNESS</h2>
<p>Christians throughout the centuries, especially Christian leaders, have been prone to make the mistake of not being multifaceted. Christians can be compared to the four living creatures; they have the aspect of being a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle. Some Christians, however, emphasize only the aspect of being a man, and they kick aside the lion, slaughter the ox, and chase away the eagle. Anything that such a Christian suggests is disapproved by the believers who are lions, opposed by those who are oxen, and denied by those who are eagles. In the end, only the believers who emphasize being a man accept this narrow emphasis. Similarly, some Christians are lions, and they devour, chew up, and even step on everyone else. The result of this is only failure. We need to see the problems in church history so that we may appreciate our need to be multifaceted.</p>
<p>Seven or eight years ago I finished writing the biography of Brother Nee in English, but because of the Spirit&rsquo;s forbidding, I delayed its publication. In 1981 I held trainings in Hong Kong and in Taipei on church history. As I stood at the podium, I realized that there were many things that I could not speak about, because I would expose the errors and weaknesses of many saints. I had no feeling in my spirit to mention many names or events, even though these were things that I had personally experienced, seen, and even suffered. They were not things that I had merely heard about. The purpose of these events in our history was for no other reason than to allow us to see light and to learn many lessons. Many of the problems that we have experienced in our history were because some of the brothers did not have the view of being multifaceted.</p>
<p>Brother Nee was saved in 1920, and in 1922 he began to have the church life. He continued in the church life until he was imprisoned in 1952. He practiced the church life for about thirty years. Most of the experiences that I passed through were with him. I saw saints enter the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and within a very short time they had problems. Some saints did not have problems, but they left and started their own groups. In 1949 I came to Taiwan, and in 1952 I began to hold formal trainings until 1982. That was another thirty years. During those thirty years I did not merely observe problems and storms. I experienced them and even became the target of the storms, because all the arrows were directed at me. During our first thirty years, Brother Nee was the target of the storms, and I was shielded under him as a great umbrella. But after thirty years the umbrella was gone, and I became the target. All the storms were centered on me. I have experienced many situations.</p>
<p>These storms occurred because there was a lack of being multifaceted. All the ones who created problems, who came into our midst and then went out from us, loved the Lord. However, some were men, some were lions, some were oxen, and some were eagles. They could not come together with one another. Humanly speaking, how can a man and a lion stay together? How can lions and eagles get along? It is impossible. But in Christ all things are possible. The center of the four living creatures is Christ. In Christ, men, lions, oxen, and eagles can all come together and be one. Christ is the center, and He is multifaceted.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH EMPHASIZING<br />
BEING MULTIFACETED&mdash;<br />
HAVING CHRIST AS THE CENTER</h2>
<p>When we serve in the church, we must remember the word <em>multifaceted.</em> This is what we have gained from our experience and from our observation. Our leading is multifaceted. We are not teaching the saints only to be a lion with the face of a lion. We need to have the head of an eagle and the backbone of an ox. Of course, most importantly, we have to be a man. The man, the lion, the ox, and the eagle are all present, but they do not have any problems, because Christ is the center. This is being multifaceted. In the trainings that began in 1952, our leading was always multifaceted. If you read the outlines of the trainings, you will see four main points: truth, life, the church, and the gospel. This can be compared to each of the four living creatures having four faces. The four items&mdash;truth, life, the church, and the gospel&mdash;may be likened to a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle, and Christ is their center. To have four sides is to be multifaceted.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OLDER SAINTS AND THE YOUNGER SAINTS<br />
COORDINATING TOGETHER</h2>
<p>There is a problem with the character of the Chinese, which is that they seem very soft, but they are very hard. Sometimes even dynamite cannot open the hard Chinese character. This outwardly soft and inwardly hard character causes problems in our coordination. Such a character causes the older ones to look down on the younger ones. This is even difficult to avoid in the church. The younger ones like to be with the other young ones. They like to listen to young people, and they dislike listening to those who are older. When such a situation is brought into the church, it affects the coordination. Sometimes the older saints can imperceptibly form one group, and the younger saints form another group. When the older ones come together, they may say that there is nothing that they can do with the young people because they are so young. And when the young people get together, they may complain that there is nothing they can do with the older saints because they are so old. The older saints have no way with the younger ones, and the younger saints will not go to fellowship with the older ones. At the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, everyone has the instant grace to shout, &ldquo;O Lord, we are one in Christ. Lord, we are one!&rdquo; We are bold to shout the word <em>one,</em> but we may not have the reality. After the meeting, the older saints gather with other older saints, and the younger saints want to be with other young saints. The older and younger saints are no longer one. As long as we remain in ourselves without Christ, we cannot be one.</p>
<p>For the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to spread and gain people, we must be in coordination. The Christ revealed in the New Testament does not have only one aspect; He has many aspects. In this message we have mentioned at least four aspects. Hence, we should not wish that there would be only older saints in the church and no young people; neither should we wish that there would be only young saints in the church and no older ones. In other words, we should not wish that the saints would be the same as we are. Regardless of how gifted a person is or how rich his ministry may be, as long as he insists that others be the same as he is, he will not last very long. He will not remain in the church for a long time. Those who can remain with their gifts and ministries must be multifaceted.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NORMAL SITUATION&mdash;<br />
INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND CHURCHES<br />
BEING MULTIFACETED</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Example of the Human Body</h2>
<p>God created man as a multifaceted being because he has a spirit, a soul and also a body. The human body needs at least four things: to breathe, to eat, to sleep, and to exercise. It is easy for the young people to pay attention to their souls while neglecting their bodies. The older ones, however, know that they have to take good care of their bodies. They know that in addition to breathing, eating, and sleeping, they need sufficient exercise. When they exercise, their body is stronger. When I was young, I did not waste any time; I spent all my time reading the Bible and writing. But I have learned the lesson: I must take care of my spirit, soul, and body; I must be multifaceted. Hence, no matter how busy I am, I usually walk for at least an hour a day. I would rather sleep less than not walk. If I do not exercise, my body will suffer. Thus, we must spend the time to exercise and thus take care of our body. However, we must not only take care of our body; we must also care for our soul and our spirit. If we do not fellowship with the Lord, open to the Lord, or spend time with Him, we will suffer a great loss. God does not want the man whom He created to be idle. He wants man to take care of his soul, his body, and most of all of his spirit.</p>
<p>The developed countries in the world try to ensure that their citizens have a life of abundance and that they can obtain all kinds of things for their bodies. Governments also open schools to teach people many things, thereby developing their souls. But the greatest shortcoming is negligence in caring for people&rsquo;s spirits. We preach the gospel and teach the truth in order to care for people&rsquo;s spirits and to fill up this great lack. If we want to be a normal person, we must have a healthy body, a prosperous soul, and a strong spirit. By taking such multifaceted care of ourselves, we will become healthy people.</p>
<p>Likewise, the church cannot be single-sided; it must be multifaceted. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the churches in Taiwan have a history of more than thirty years. They have a good foundation, and they have been blessed much by the Lord. However, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must advance. Many saints in the churches must come forward to serve, even to serve full time, but we are concerned that in the future problems will arise in the churches. It may be that there will be problems in the localities between the elders and the young people. Or the young people who come out to serve full time may question the leading of the elders. Thus, even though the young people have a heart to serve full time, they must pay attention to being multifaceted in their practice. Only then can they avoid complaints about the leading brothers. Likewise, the elders who take the lead must remember to be multifaceted in their leading. This is the only way for the church to be strong. The older saints as well as the younger saints must all exercise to be multifaceted.</p><h2 class="head2">The Example of the Family</h2>
<p>Suppose in a family there is only a sixty-year-old couple and their eighty-year-old parents. These two generations of four elderly people will just sit and look at each other. Without a child, their life has no meaning. Such a home will be very clean and scheduled, but it will have no future when both couples pass away. A normal family has three or four generations; this includes noisy young children. Even though the children might not be well behaved, they are full of vitality. Their home might be somewhat disorderly, which causes the older ones to suffer, but it will be full of youthful spirit, and it will have great hope. There is a saying that our progeny is our blessing. However, along with the blessing there is suffering. If we want to have children, we must accept some suffering. This is true not only in the family but also in the church.</p>
<p>In many families the older generation causes the younger generation to suffer, and the younger generation causes the older generation to suffer as well. For example, my grandchildren are afraid of me, but I am afraid of them even more than they are afraid of me. I like it when they come to my home, but it is a great trouble because afterward I must clean up the mess they leave. Hence, it is a blessing to have a second generation, but it is also a suffering. These examples show that the church life is multifaceted. The younger ones need the older ones, and the older ones need the younger ones.</p>
<p>Men cannot live without women, and women cannot live without men. It is the same in a family and in the church. We need to be multifaceted. However, in the church the sisters are frequently dissatisfied with the brothers and therefore complain. It is impossible for sisters not to complain. This is the nature of women. The brothers are also difficult. This is according to their nature. When a couple is newly married, the husband may often mop the floor, but after a while he gives his wife a difficult time, insisting that she polish his shoes and mop the floor. Brothers and sisters both need to be multifaceted.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Example of the Spreading of the Church</h2>
<p>Just as a country needs strong young men when it goes to war, the church also needs strong young ones for it to spread. If the church is to preach the gospel and spread the truth, we must have young people. It is a hardship for an elderly person to preach the gospel to people on a bus. But when a young person speaks, all the people around him can hear because he has a strong voice. The young saints and the older saints should not place requirements on each other; the older saints should not insist that the young ones change, nor should the young saints insist that the older ones change. Even if the older saints are wrong, the young ones should respect them as their older generation. It is often unavoidable for the young saints to make mistakes. As long as we pray more and exercise our spirit more, we will go forward together step by step, and the church will have a bright future.</p>
<p>In the church some saints are shy by nature and other saints are bold by nature. Whether we are shy or bold, we must be multifaceted and avoid conflicts. The bold saints like to go out to preach the gospel; they can preach the gospel boldly every day. The shy saints who think that the bold ones are too crazy are not multifaceted. God did not make us all shy by nature, nor did He make us all bold. He made some of us shy and some of us bold so that we could be multifaceted&mdash;able to take care of every situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO CARE FOR TRUTH, LIFE,<br />
THE GOSPEL, AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>For the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s work, we must gain people. Even though we have thousands of brothers and sisters, we still need to spread. We must first gain people in &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; (cf. Acts 1:8). Taiwan is our Jerusalem. While we spread, we should never forget that the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are His golden lampstands. Hence, they must bear the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. The first item in bearing the Lord&rsquo;s testimony is to preach the truth. We must therefore spend time laboring on the truth. All the brothers and sisters in the churches must be like the children in a scholarly family. Not only should they understand the truth, but they should also be able to use simple words to teach others the truth. It is a tremendous matter for us to be trained and constituted with the truth.</p>
<p>Suppose ten thousand saints in Taiwan know the truth and speak the truth every day. This society and this country would be blessed, because that is what the Lord wants. The Lord requires that we not only shine as lampstands to be the light of the world but that we also be the salt of the earth to kill germs and prevent decay (Matt. 5:13). As the salt of the earth, we kill the germs and deal with the corruption of sinners. This is a great influence. Furthermore, we must live out the truth. To live out the truth is to live out Christ and to live out God&rsquo;s life. Hence, we must pursue the growth in life.</p>
<p>Because the church is multifaceted, the older saints must bear with the younger ones, and even more importantly the younger saints must respect the older ones. Not only so, the brothers must take care of the sisters, and the sisters must accommodate the brothers. Then there will be no problems when we coordinate together. Our testimony will not merely be that we are zealous for the gospel, clear concerning the truth, and rich in life; it will also be that we live a corporate church life. If our testimony includes these four aspects of being rich and clear concerning the truth, matured in life, corporate in our church life, and zealous for the gospel, we will have the true testimony of the Lord in the local churches.</p>
<p>For the past two thousand years of church history, the Lord has not had a rich testimony. Some believers, such as the inner-life believers, have placed much emphasis on the matter of life. In the end, however, they veered far off course and did not have a second generation. Some among these believers emphasized the spirit and the soul at the expense of their physical health. There have also been believers in the evangelical movement who only emphasized preaching the gospel and setting up mission boards; however, they had no foundation in the truth, were inadequate in life, and had no church life. Some even opposed the matter of the church.</p>
<p>We have spoken boldly concerning the ground of the church&mdash;one church in one locality&mdash;for many years. However, if we do not have the truth as our support, the ground of the church becomes an empty slogan. Not only so, without life, everything is empty. If we are not zealous for the gospel and do not bring in new ones, in a very short time the only brothers and sisters on the local ground will be old people, and it will not be long before there is no one left to continue standing on the ground. Therefore, we must gain people and bear children and grandchildren; we must also teach them to stand on the ground. This is why we must be multifaceted and have truth, life, and the church when we go out to gain others. In this way we will spontaneously produce a second generation.</p>
<p>Of these four aspects, the most crucial is the aspect of life. If we do not have life but only have the truth, we merely have empty doctrine. Once we lack life, the truth becomes empty, the church life is poor, and we have no support for the gospel. A church life that is without life is without Christ and is merely religious activities. In the same way, if there is no life, we have no reality when we preach the gospel, and our speaking will merely be doctrine. Even though a person is saved, without life he will have no salvation in his daily life. Paul says, &ldquo;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling&rdquo; (Phil. 2:12). This means that in our daily living, we must live out Christ as life.</p>
<p>We have emphasized life for many years, because we felt that life is crucial. Even our study of the Bible is called the Life-study of the Bible. By constantly emphasizing life, we have turned everyone&rsquo;s attention to life, but we have neglected the gospel. However, when we pay attention to life, we should go out to preach the gospel. When we preach the gospel, we are also paying attention to life.</p>
<p>In order to keep our bodies healthy, we must exercise daily. If we eat nutritious food daily without exercising, the food will poison us. Even when we eat nutritious food, we must be active and exercise. Proper exercise and nutritious food are both necessary to make our bodies healthy. Therefore, we should not emphasize life and neglect preaching the gospel, nor should we overemphasize the gospel and neglect life. We must pay attention to both life and the gospel and not neglect either of them. We need to be multifaceted. Life is Christ. If we live Christ, we will be multifaceted. As soon as Christ has the ground within us, we will be multifaceted. When we grow in life, we live Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEING THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST IN COLOSSIANS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being Rooted in Christ,<br />
Taking Christ as the Base in All Things</h2>
<p>If we want to grow in life, we must be rooted in Christ (Col. 2:7). The book of Colossians reveals the experience of Christ. In Colossians Christ is our life (3:4). He is also the God-allotted portion of the saints, and this portion is an inheritance (1:12). For example, in a large household the parents can allot a house to each son. Christ as our portion is our inheritance from God. Colossians also says that Christ is the mystery of God (2:2). In other words, Christ is the story of God. Christ is our life and our blessed portion; He is also the story of God. Furthermore, all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily; He is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead (v. 9).</p>
<p>We must remember that Christ is our portion, He is the mystery of God, and all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily. Such a Christ is our life, and we must be rooted in Him in all things. We must not take anything else as our base. Our living must take this all-inclusive Christ as its base. Husbands must not take their love for their wives as the base for their living, and wives must not take being submissive to their husbands as the base for their living. We must take Christ as our base in everything. A husband must love his wife with the love that comes out of Christ, and a wife must submit to her husband with the submission that comes out of Christ. Our living is not based on Chinese ethics or on ancient teachings; rather, Christ is our base in all things. We must take Christ as our base in all things, because He is our source.</p>
<p>If we see this and practice it, our living will change. In order to do anything with Christ as our base, we need to have much fellowship with Him. If we fellowship with Christ, we will discover that ninety percent of the time we do not take Christ as our base. Instead, we take ethics, ancient teachings, customs, feelings, and tastes and preferences as our base. On the surface some ancient teachings and family traditions appear to be the same as Christian teachings, but they are not Christ. We must turn away from all ancient teachings and family traditions. As saved ones, we have Christ as our life, so we must be rooted in Him in all things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Enjoying Christ and<br />
Growing with the Growth of God</h2>
<p>Christ is our life. He is all-inclusive, He is the embodiment of God, and He is our God-allotted inheritance, so we should enjoy Him every day. Christ is in the Word, and He is the Spirit. The Spirit is the reality of the Word, and the Word conveys the Spirit. Daily we must read the Bible, which is the milk of the word. We must drink of the milk of the word daily to receive nourishment from the Bible (1 Pet. 2:2). However, we should not merely read the Bible; we must open our spirit to fellowship with the Lord. We must pray-read, and through our pray-reading we will receive the element of Christ. In this way the divine life within us will grow.</p>
<p>As a result, we will not change our behavior, nor will we rely on the cultivation of a preacher. Instead, God, who is within us, will give us more life. God Himself is life, and when the element of God increases within us, we grow in life (Col. 2:19). Due to our growth in life, we are brought into Christ in all things. This is what it means to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things (Eph. 4:15). When everyone grows, the issue is the Body of Christ, which is Christ&rsquo;s household and God&rsquo;s temple, the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST</h2>
<p>We must also preach the gospel to bring in new ones. Strictly speaking, it is a shame to bring only one person to the Lord in a year. It would be very strange if a peach tree produced only one peach in a year. In other words, a tree is usually laden with fruit. In the same way, we should bear abundant fruit. A sister once declared that she would bring eight to ten people to salvation in one year. As a result, in only six months she brought more than ten people to the Lord. In 1966 there were many junior high school and high school students, in their uniforms, in the audience of a large gospel meeting. It should be easy for teachers to bring others to the Lord. Those who teach in either junior high or high school have a good opportunity. The students they teach should be their &ldquo;targets.&rdquo; If a teacher has thirty students and is able to bring one-third of them to salvation every year, by the end of seven years many will be saved. This is a great undertaking. Every saint who is a teacher should not only learn how to educate his students; he should also learn how to gain them. Then his students will become his fruit hanging from him as a branch.</p>
<p>Leading people to salvation may be compared to a mother giving birth to a child. After giving birth, the mother still has to raise and educate the child. After we lead someone to salvation, we need to nourish him, and we also have to teach him. This is the way to have much fruit. If we are faithful to practice this, after seven to ten years, we will gain one million people in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This is not a difficult undertaking.</p>
<p>However, we cannot merely produce numbers without the truth; otherwise, the new ones will be immature with no way to grow up, and the church life will suffer a great loss. Such a work would be of wood, grass, and stubble, and it would never be pleasing to God. For our work to spread, we must have the truth and life; we must also have the church as a support and as a home where the new ones can be brought. If we work in this way, there will be strong and living churches on the island of Taiwan that do not merely have large numbers but also have a proper testimony. There will be bright and shining lampstands. Moreover, the saints will be salt, and they will have a germ-killing function at every level of society. As a result, our country and society will be blessed. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would be able to render our proper cooperation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN ADDITIONAL WORD</h2>
<p>We need to have some fellowship concerning how to meet. When the time given for sharing in the meeting is too long, it is like giving people a large plate of dessert that is too sweet for them to eat. Hence, it is best to sing a hymn. We should sing with expression; we should not be too loud or too soft. Everyone must exercise to sing. Sometimes we can sing loudly, and at other times we can sing softly. However, we should not be habitual in our hymn singing. We must sing in order to bring out the flavor of the hymns. I hope that the brothers and sisters will know not only the Bible but will also know the hymns. Hymns are the crystallization of the truth. The young people in particular must learn how to sing the hymns. They should even memorize the hymns. Some of the hymns are on the central line of God&rsquo;s economy. We must sing these ones more often, such as <em>Hymns,</em> #499: &ldquo;Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!&rdquo; There are eight <em>what</em>s in this hymn, and we should learn to sing them with expression. For example, the first two phrases of the first stanza can be sung in a strong way, and the third and fourth phrases can be sung softly. When we sing &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s no longer I that live&rdquo; the first time, we should sing it a little softer, and when we repeat it, we can sing it stronger. If we practice this, our hymn singing will be living, and the entire meeting will also be living.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE</h1>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is multifaceted, and it requires us to care for the truth, life, the church, and the gospel. In this message we will cover the gospel. Concerning the preaching of the gospel, there are three basic requirements: being beside ourselves, being thick-skinned, and opening our homes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS<br />
FOR PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>The first basic requirement for gospel preaching is that we need to be beside ourselves. Prayer makes people beside themselves (2 Cor. 5:13). A person who has prayed thoroughly cannot help but be beside himself when he preaches the gospel. Even in other things, he will be beside himself, crazy, after he has prayed thoroughly. In addition to being crazy, we need to be thick-skinned.</p>
<p>The basic requirements for preaching the gospel can be summed up in two words: <em>crazy</em> and <em>thick.</em> We say this from our experience. If we are not crazy or if our skin is not thick, all our efforts will be in vain. We must learn to be crazy, and we must exercise to have a thick skin. We must also be practical and open our homes. The Holy Spirit was poured out upon all flesh long ago, but the shortage is that we are not crazy, our skin is not thick enough, and our homes are not open. We would like to fellowship concerning opening our homes. Even though opening our homes is not easy, it is the easiest thing we can do for the gospel. Furthermore, it is very effective. Opening our homes is very important.</p>
<p>Before we fellowship concerning opening our homes, we will study a few hymns.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT LIVING <em>FOR</em> JESUS<br />
BUT LIVING <em>BEING</em> JESUS</h2>
<p>The hymn &ldquo;Living for Jesus&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #456) was written by a famous American brother within the past fifty years. When the brothers in Shanghai translated this hymn in 1949 or 1950, the truth in the translated version was more advanced than the truth in the original. The first stanza of the original hymn says,</p>
<p class="hbody">Living for Jesus a life that is true,<br />
Striving to please Him in all that I do;<br />
Yielding allegiance, glad-hearted and free,<br />
This is the pathway of blessing for me.</p>
<p class="hbody2">O Jesus, Lord and Savior,<br />
I give myself to Thee,<br />
For Thou, in Thy atonement,<br />
Didst give Thyself for me;<br />
I own no other Master,<br />
My heart shall be Thy throne,<br />
My life I give, henceforth to live,<br />
O Christ, for Thee alone.</p>
<p>In our translation we corrected all the inaccuracies concerning the truth that were in the original. But I would ask you, is this hymn really that good? This hymn is good, but it is not good enough, because Paul says, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21). In the Bible to live <em>for</em> Jesus is second best; to live <em>is</em> Christ is the best thing.</p>
<p>Regrettably, however, Christianity does not understand &ldquo;to live is Jesus.&rdquo; This is a point of debate between Christianity and us. Christianity is in the realm of <em>for</em> Jesus. Their realm is <em>for</em> Jesus, not <em>is</em> Jesus. I would ask which is higher, <em>for</em> Jesus or <em>is</em> Jesus? Which is easier, <em>for</em> Jesus or <em>is</em> Jesus? Those with experience can testify that <em>for</em> Jesus is very difficult, but <em>is</em> Jesus is much easier. This is because in &ldquo;to live is Jesus,&rdquo; everything is just Jesus. It is not I but He who does everything. It is He who makes the plans; it is not I who endeavors.</p>
<p>The greatest weakness of this hymn is that it is not written according to God&rsquo;s central lane. Believers in Christianity are encouraged to give themselves to preach the gospel after every revival meeting. When I was young, we would sing &ldquo;Must I Go, and Empty-handed&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #930) at revival meetings because this hymn encourages people to give themselves to preach the gospel. However, this is for Jesus. It is not wrong to be for Jesus, but there is a shortcoming. We are not according to God&rsquo;s central lane if we are only for Jesus. Being for Jesus causes people to veer off from God&rsquo;s central lane.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s central lane is Christ as life, which is the Triune God dispensing Himself into us, His chosen people. Hymn #377 in the Chinese hymnal is on Christ as life. The first stanza reads, &ldquo;Glory! Glory! Christ is life to me, / Glory! Glory! The Spirit leads me; / Weakness turns to power, / Darkness turns to light; / Glory! Glory! Christ is life to me.&rdquo; This hymn is very simple, but it is on the central lane of God&rsquo;s economy.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD DYING FOR ALL<br />
AND THEREFORE ALL DYING</h2>
<p>When we sing <em>Hymns,</em> #456, we will certainly set our will to live for the Lord. The second stanza says, &ldquo;Such love constrains me to answer His call, / Follow His leading and give Him my all.&rdquo; This speaks of a religious life in Christianity. Some people may say that 2 Corinthians 5:14 says, &ldquo;The love of Christ constrains us.&rdquo; This is true, but the entire verse says, &ldquo;The love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died.&rdquo; It does not say that One died for all; therefore, all were forgiven and redeemed. Rather, it says that all died. Christ died for us so that we would all die, not so that we would live for Him. Romans 6:5 says, &ldquo;If we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONSECRATING OURSELVES NOT AS A NATURAL MAN<br />
BUT AS A NEW CREATION</h2>
<p>There are some things that are right in traditional theology, but within those items there is always some hidden error, which is leaven. Let us take <em>Hymns,</em> #456 as an example. All the things spoken of in this hymn are proper, but there is also something hidden. If we sing this hymn repeatedly, everyone will set their will to &ldquo;live for Christ&rdquo; and &ldquo;follow His leading and give Him my all.&rdquo; Have we ever considered what our all is? According to Paul&rsquo;s word in Philippians 3:8, our all is just refuse, and it is not at all precious.</p>
<p>The book of Leviticus, in the Old Testament, speaks of many matters concerning the offerings. None of the offerings recorded in Leviticus typify us. The sin offering typifies the Lord Jesus, the trespass offering typifies the Lord Jesus, the meal offering typifies the Lord Jesus, the peace offering typifies the Lord Jesus, and the burnt offering typifies the Lord Jesus (chs. 1&mdash;7). Where is the offering that typifies you and me? In the picture of the types, we do not offer ourselves; instead, we offer the Lord Jesus. When we feel that we are corrupted and sinful, we offer the Lord Jesus as our sin offering or as our trespass offering. We offer Him as food for God and for us as the meal offering. We also offer Him as the peace offering and the burnt offering. But when do we ever offer up ourselves?</p>
<p>Some people may say, &ldquo;Romans 12:1 speaks of presenting our bodies as a living sacrifice.&rdquo; However, we must understand the entire book of Romans in order to comprehend the words <em>bodies</em> and <em>living sacrifice.</em> Romans 1 speaks of man&rsquo;s corruption, and chapter 5 speaks of the source of our corruption. Death and sin are our portion because we are in Adam. Chapter 6 then speaks of our death and resurrection with Christ&mdash;we are not the old &ldquo;I&rdquo; but the resurrected &ldquo;I.&rdquo; Chapter 8 says that the Holy Spirit is in us and that the work of the Holy Spirit is to sanctify, renew, and transform us. By this Spirit we need to put to death the practices of the body (v. 13). We do not put to death only the evil practices of the body; we need to put to death all the practices of the body. Only then does Romans speak of presenting our bodies in chapter 12. This word is not spoken in chapter 1. It is spoken only after we have become those who are renewed, transformed, and worked on by the Holy Spirit. The apostle did not exhort us to present our corrupted bodies. He exhorted us to present our bodies after they have been transformed and worked on by the Holy Spirit. The bodies that are presented have Christ and the Spirit within them.</p>
<p><em>Hymns,</em> #456 gives us a natural understanding that we should live for Jesus, because stanza 2 says, &ldquo;Living for Jesus, who died in my place, / Bearing on Calv&rsquo;ry my sin and disgrace.&rdquo; However, on the cross, the Lord Jesus did not only bear our sins and disgrace; even more, He terminated us. The apostle Paul&rsquo;s word says, &ldquo;The love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:14). We have been terminated; now we are a new creation, and what we offer to Him is the new creation. But this hymn does not have this concept. It says only that the Lord Jesus died on the cross for us, bearing our sin and disgrace. This is entirely objective; it is not subjective. By the end of the hymn, what we offer up is altogether a natural man. Such a consecration is difficult to accomplish because it must be done with clenched teeth.</p>
<p>Paul says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). We must consecrate to the Lord the &ldquo;I&rdquo; who has Christ living within. A. B. Simpson wrote a hymn that says, &ldquo;Oh! it is so sweet to die with Christ,... / Oh! it is so sweet to live with Christ&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #482, chorus). &ldquo;To live for Jesus&rdquo; is an awful thing, and it is a suffering, but &ldquo;to live is Jesus&rdquo; is an enjoyment without suffering. &ldquo;To live for Jesus&rdquo; is altogether a suffering, whereas &ldquo;to live is Jesus&rdquo; is altogether an enjoyment. Living for Jesus gives people the wrong understanding and makes them think that they have to do something in themselves for the Lord. In reality, however, He does not want us to do so many things for Him; He wants us to simply let Him live out of us.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT GIVING OURSELVES TO THE LORD<br />
BUT DENYING OURSELVES</h2>
<p>The chorus of <em>Hymns,</em> #456 says, &ldquo;O Jesus, Lord and Savior, / I give myself to Thee, / For Thou, in Thy atonement, / Didst give Thyself for me.&rdquo; There is also a problem with the chorus. It is difficult to find a verse in the Bible that says the Lord wants us to give ourselves to Him. On the contrary, the Lord wants us to deny ourselves. Not only does the Lord not want our self; He even tells us that we should not want our self. Why would we give the Lord something that He does not want? Why would we give the Lord something He wants us to give up? Even though this hymn is very poetic, the truth contained in the poetry is not very high.</p>
<p>We should never think that discerning the truth is an easy matter. In Matthew 16:21 the Lord Jesus said that He must go to Jerusalem to be killed and on the third day be raised. When Peter heard this, he took the Lord aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, &ldquo;God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!&rdquo; (v. 22). If we had been there, we would have shouted Amen and thought that Peter was right. But the Lord answered, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan!&rdquo; (v. 23). Then He continued, &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself&rdquo; (v. 24). Hence, the Bible clearly tells us to deny ourselves; it does not want us to give ourselves to the Lord.</p>
<p>Perhaps some would say that Romans 6:13 says, &ldquo;Neither present your members as weapons of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as alive from the dead, and your members as weapons of righteousness to God.&rdquo; They think that this verse speaks of presenting ourselves to God, but if we consider the context of this verse, we will see that <em>yourselves</em> does not refer merely to us as those who have been raised from the dead; it refers also to our members. Our members are part of our body. Romans 6 deals with the problem of sins. Sinning is mainly a matter of the body. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves.&rdquo; This chapter refers to our bodies being put to death by the cross. Hence, <em>yourselves</em> in Romans 6 refers to our bodies. The Scripture is clear about this to the extent that it mentions not only &ldquo;body&rdquo; but also &ldquo;members.&rdquo; This means that <em>yourselves</em> in this chapter does not refer to the soul, the self.</p>
<p><em>Myself</em> in the chorus of <em>Hymns,</em> #456 refers mainly to the person in our soul, not to our body. Strictly speaking, we cannot give ourselves to the Lord; we must instead put ourselves aside. This is what Paul says in Galatians 2:20: &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; The I, the self, in this hymn does not refer to the body but to the person, which is our natural I, the soul-life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LETTING CHRIST LIVE IN US</h2>
<p>If we do not have a basic knowledge of the truth when we read this hymn, we will gain a wrong understanding. The hymn says that we must give ourselves to live for Christ. To live for Christ is an erroneous concept. It is not that we live for Christ; it is that we let Christ live in us. Then, in our bodies we need to cooperate with the Lord and allow Him to direct us. According to what is written in Romans 6, when we present our bodies to be under His direction, we are offering our members to God (v. 13).</p>
<p>If we do not have the light of the truth when we sing this hymn, we will offer ourselves to God and think that we can do something great for Him. One of the problems in Christianity is that before believers give themselves to God, they do not have many difficulties. But as soon as they consecrate themselves to God, they have problems that result in divisions and produce many sects. Therefore, we must remember that we must not bring our &ldquo;self&rdquo; with us when we love the Lord. We should never think that after we have consecrated ourselves, we must live for Jesus from then on, nor should we want to accomplish something for Him. If we do this, we will fall into trouble, and after ten years the full-time serving ones would be divided into five or six different groups.</p>
<p>We should not consider living for Christ; instead, we must realize that we have already been crucified with Christ, that we have died, and that it is Christ who lives in us. We should not be persons who live for Christ; rather, we should be persons to whom to live is Christ. &ldquo;Because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:14). If we have died, how can we still live? We must remember that we have all died. However, every way that we take in resurrection is a living way with a tremendous future because Christ is living in us. In ourselves, we are at a dead end. However, because Christ is living in us, we are full of hope and have a bright future.</p>
<p>If the young people have the slightest misconception concerning <em>Hymns,</em> #456, they will get into trouble. Anyone who is sixty-five years and over, however, will have a heart filled with so much gratitude that they will think it is sufficient just to have the opportunity to love the Lord, and they will be satisfied simply to serve Him in the church. The older ones do not really want to go out and do something great. Those who have been called by the Lord to serve Him full time for their entire lives have a wonderful testimony. Just as Judges 5:15 and 16 say, they have great resolutions in heart and great searchings of heart. But when we see some with such a lofty desire, there is also some concern because we fear that as &ldquo;wild oxen&rdquo; and &ldquo;wild asses&rdquo; they will desire to live for Jesus and want to accomplish something great. We fear that they will destroy the church. I say this because of lessons we have learned in the past.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING WARNINGS FROM OUR HISTORY</h2>
<p>In 1949 we came to Taiwan to start the work. Before then I was in Shanghai, where we had gained a group of young people, most of whom were students, and some had been saved through my preaching of the gospel. Later, when the political situation in the country changed, I was sent to Taiwan according to the arrangement in the work. At that time, Brother Nee fellowshipped with me that if at all possible, he wanted the group of young people who were under my leading in Shanghai to go to Taiwan. As transportation became available, more than ten of those young people came to Taiwan to receive my leading.</p>
<p>Around 1958 these saints felt that their wings had grown and that they could fly, so they told people, &ldquo;Brother Lee is finished, and the brothers who serve with him are ready to be put into coffins.&rdquo; When I later returned to Taiwan after visiting England and Denmark, these saints were busy meeting in secret, but on the surface they pretended to be under my leading. Many saints were not clear about what they were doing, and even I was not clear.</p>
<p>One of the brothers who served with me in Taipei went to visit the church in Chiayi, and while he was there, this group seized the opportunity to meet with him and tried to persuade him to stand with them. When he returned to Taipei, he fellowshipped with a second brother, and the two decided to invite the young brothers to Taipei. When the young brothers were in Taipei, they were even more open and bold in their attempt to persuade the two brothers to join them in their rebellion. During this time Sister Lee was critically ill, so the two brothers did not tell me anything. In April 1959, after Sister Lee had passed away, as I was preparing to visit the Philippines, the two brothers from Taipei came to see me. They did not feel that it was right for me to leave for the Philippines without knowing the situation with those young brothers. After listening to their fellowship, I told them that according to the principle of the work, those brothers should be stopped from participating in the work. This did not mean that they would be excommunicated from the church; they would still be brothers in the church. However, since they were under my leadership in the work, I had the position and responsibility to stop them from continuing in the work.</p>
<p>I immediately called a meeting in May 1959 of all the co-workers in Taiwan and fellowshipped with them concerning my fellowship with the two brothers from Taipei. I said, &ldquo;Among us one hundred co-workers, there are some who strongly disagree with the work and want to take another way. I would like to tell you that the way I am taking and the work under my leadership will continue; I will absolutely not make any change. If you feel that you have seen something, and if you feel that your way is superior, I hope that you will take your way and not stay here waiting for me to change. I cannot and will not change. I hope you are all clear that we are all brothers in the Lord, and even though I was the one who led you in the beginning, we are still all brothers. But I ask you not to remain here pretending that you are one with me. My position and my resolve are that I will not change. I will continue taking this way. This is the way that Brother Nee helped me to walk, and I will continue to take this way. This is my position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the meeting the two brothers who had fellowshipped with me asked me to be merciful toward the young brothers, saying that because they were still young, they should be given another chance. Some of the older brothers also felt that I should be broad toward the young brothers and give them some time. Hence, I left for the Philippines without any further dealing related to this matter.</p>
<p>At the end of 1959, I held a training in Taipei on the Life-study of the Gospel of John. We had one or two conference meetings a week. During this training I spoke only concerning the first two chapters of John, after which I felt that I should not speak further. As a conclusion I said, &ldquo;In John 2:19 the Lord said, &lsquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rsquo; I know for sure that there are several co-workers here who are doing a destroying work. I would like to tell you that if the work in Taiwan is the Lord&rsquo;s, He will rebuild this work in resurrection, regardless of how much you destroy it.&rdquo; From that day on, I did nothing more&mdash;I tolerated them.</p>
<p>In 1960 I went to America, and I visited several places the following year. I stayed in America for quite some time. After a great deal of consideration, I realized that the Lord had given me a burden, and that He wanted me to stay in America to begin the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there. I stayed in America from 1961 through 1965; that was a period of about four years. During those four years, the two brothers from Taipei wrote me every one or two weeks concerning the dissenting brothers. In response I always told the brothers to be at peace and to allow the dissenting brothers to do what they could to tear down the work.</p>
<p>In April 1965 the letter I received from the two brothers in Taipei was different from their previous letters. They said that I was the only one with the standing to say anything, and that all the co-workers felt that there was no way for them to continue in the work. I immediately wrote them saying that I would return to Taiwan in September to deal with the matter. In my letter I asked the brothers to make arrangements for me to hold a co-workers&rsquo; meeting the day after I arrived. The first item on the agenda for that meeting was to deal with the problem.</p>
<p>I returned to Taiwan in September, and on the following morning there was a meeting of all the co-workers in Taiwan. At the beginning of the meeting I said, &ldquo;Four of you sitting here have been doing a subversive work ever since I left Taiwan. Hence, I am asking you four to withdraw from the work as of today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At noon the following day, two of the four came to speak with me at the workers&rsquo; home. I said to them, &ldquo;Brothers, what is there to speak about?&rdquo; They insisted on speaking with me, so the three of us sat down and talked in a small sitting room. One of them said that they did not have any problems with the work, nor with the way of the church, nor with my leadership, nor my authority in the Lord&rsquo;s work. I responded, &ldquo;Brother, is this really true?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;We have no problems.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;This is hard to accept because more than eighty co-workers say that you have a problem.&rdquo; He responded, &ldquo;The two brothers from Taipei made up all the stories about us, and they asked you to come back so that you would be forced to do this to us.&rdquo; This troubled me. They had been undermining the work for many years, and now they were trying to blame others. I asked myself how the church could accept this. Their words confirmed my initial feeling to stop them from participating in the work.</p>
<p>Since the two dissenting brothers insisted that they had no problems with anything in the churches, I asked them how they could explain that the four localities in which they served&mdash;Taipei, Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung&mdash;had not sung any of the eighty-five new hymns for the past four years, even though all the other localities enjoyed these hymns. This question muzzled their mouths. They were also unable to answer other questions. Hence, I said, &ldquo;Brothers, this situation is a fact. I ask you brothers to withdraw from the work from now on, but you may still attend the church meetings and function as brothers.&rdquo; They brought up the matter of the eldership, and I told them that they also had to withdraw from the eldership; otherwise, the problems would not have a clear resolution. They could stand in the position of brothers and do their best to be good brothers. If they would give the Lord some time, He would vindicate them.</p><h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>It is precious to consecrate ourselves to serve full time, but we must not bring in our natural life. There used to be many co-workers. After we were raised up by the Lord, none of us had any desire to do anything for ourselves. We all had only one goal&mdash;the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Therefore, we did not have any problems, and no one played tricks in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I led the church in a certain locality, building up the church there, but I never felt that the church was built up by me, or that it was in my pocket. I did not have such a feeling. We all had such a spirit, following the footsteps of Brother Nee&rsquo;s leadership.</p>
<p>However, with time there were some who had difficulties. Some saints came into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, expecting to find an opportunity to promote themselves. When they were unable to promote themselves, they left us and became preachers in Christianity. Several of the famous Chinese preachers were with us for a time and then turned away to establish their own work. I believe they know that the way they are taking is not right. They know that there is only one church. But they were forced to begin another work because they wanted to do something for themselves.</p>
<p>In 1965 I spoke a word of warning to a few brothers who wanted to leave the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I told them that not long after they leave they would divide again and again, because they rejected the ground of the church. My warning to those brothers has been fulfilled. They did not just separate themselves from others, they also divided among themselves again and again. All of you who serve full time must know that your serving is truly of the Lord, and it is precious that you have received grace and are willing to serve full time. However, you must take this warning and be inoculated. You should not think that you can consecrate yourselves to live for the Lord; you should not have great resolutions or great searchings in yourselves. On the contrary, you must always remember that the Lord has only one work on this earth, and that work is to build up His Body. There is only one church in the universe, and there is only one expression of that church in a locality.</p>
<p>You can do your best to develop the gifts that you have received from the Lord, and there is absolutely no restriction in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery concerning this matter. However, you must adhere to the one principle of not doing any other work and not using gimmicks in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. You should only carry out your function. Do not say that you have built up a church, and do not consider any church as your church. Every church is the Lord&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy the church in Chefoo was built up mainly through my ministry; however, I never considered the church in Chefoo to be my personal church. At a certain point in time, the Lord raised up an environment that forced me to leave Chefoo. When I left, I did not give anyone instructions concerning the church and the work. I simply told the responsible brothers that I had to leave, and I left. After China won the Sino-Japanese War, the Lord led me to Shanghai, and I ministered there for two and a half years. This brought in a revival to the church. Even though I was taking the lead, none of the church affairs were in my hand. Hence, when the time came for me to leave, I got on a plane and left. That was also the situation when I left Taiwan to go to America. No matter where I am, I always serve in coordination with the local brothers.</p>
<p>We must always remember this principle: we are here only to labor and to expend our energy in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to build up His Body. We want to explain this matter clearly to the young people because we hope that you will not have ambitions or great aims. We hope that you would simply be faithful and live Christ in every circumstance. You must gain people for the Lord, build them up, and perfect them. Everything you do must be for the church in your locality. No local church belongs to you or to me. Every local church belongs to Christ, to God, and to the saints. In the New Testament there are three designations for the church: the church of God (1 Cor. 1:2; 10:32), the church of Christ (Rom. 16:16), and the church of the saints (1 Cor. 14:33). No church belongs to an apostle, no church belongs to an elder, and no church belongs to a co-worker. The church belongs to the saints, and we should only take the position of being one of the many saints enjoying the church. Perhaps some churches were raised up through our work, or some saints were saved through our work, but those churches are still the churches of the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROMOTING THE GOSPEL IN THE HOMES<br />
BY PREACHING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE</h2>
<p>Acts 5:42 says, &ldquo;Every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ.&rdquo; Recently, a Roman Catholic organization put out a publication that praised us, because we practiced serving in homes and in small groups before 1958. The author felt that such a practice is very effective.</p>
<p>Before 1958 every move we took in leading the church was according to the Bible. We had home meetings based on the expression <em>from house to house</em> in Acts 5:42 and 2:46. In Shanghai and in Chefoo we met in the homes, but we did not meet in groups. Later, when we came to Taiwan, the number of saints increased rapidly, and it was not enough to divide into homes; we also had to have groups. The practice of meeting in groups is based on the record in Luke 9 where the Lord fed five thousand people with five loaves and two fish. In that chapter the Lord said, &ldquo;Make them recline in groups of about fifty each&rdquo; (v. 14). The Greek word for <em>group</em> refers to a small unit or company.</p>
<p>When the church in Taipei first began to practice meeting in groups, there were not many saints in each group; there were only about twenty. Then later, the numbers gradually increased until a group had as many as one hundred saints. After much practice and observation, we needed to reduce the numbers in our groups. According to the Bible, twelve people can be considered a group, because the first group of early disciples was the twelve apostles. There are about fifteen thousand saints in the church in Taipei, and about five thousand of these meet regularly. There are usually three or four thousand saints meeting every Lord&rsquo;s Day. If we were to form groups of twelve, the entire church in Taipei could meet in three to four hundred groups. The groups should not be formed according to the spiritual level of the saints but according to their residential location. The principle of meeting from house to house is to split up into groups. As soon as we are in groups, it is easy to shepherd, teach, and care for others in a detailed way. This is the basic unit for our future development.</p>
<p>Acts speaks of preaching the gospel from house to house. When the early disciples preached the gospel, they did not preach only in the temple but also in the homes. Every brother and sister opened his or her home for the preaching of the gospel, and they invited their relatives, friends, and neighbors. Every household preached the gospel. If we cannot preach the gospel every week, we should do it at least every other week or once a month.</p>
<p>At this point we must commend the sisters, because the gospel in the homes is built on the sisters for the following reasons. The brothers are busier during the day because they go out to work; their hearts are not necessarily concerned with the homes. The sisters are the stronger ones in the church in the matter of loving the Lord. The Bible records two instances of sisters anointing the Lord with fragrant ointment; one is in Luke 7:36-39, and the other is in Matthew 26:6-13. The brothers were rational, cold, and calculating, so they thought that the fragrant ointment could be sold for much money, which could be given to the poor. Hence, the gospel in the homes should not be committed to the brothers. We must let the sisters take care of it. We must motivate the sisters. Furthermore, people are more likely to refuse an invitation from the brothers, but they will feel somewhat embarrassed to refuse an invitation from the sisters. Hence, we must emphasize the function of the sisters in promoting the preaching of the gospel in the homes until every home is open for the gospel.</p>
<p>The brothers who serve with the name lists of those in the church should tell us how many household units there are. If the church in Taipei has twelve hundred households, it means that there are twelve hundred gospel stations in the church. If every one of these twelve hundred homes can gain an average of three people per year, then the entire church can save thirty-six hundred people in a year. I have the assurance that if all the saints faithfully receive this commission, the church in Taipei will be able to double its number in the near future.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOSPEL WORK IN THE SCHOOLS</h2>
<p>We also need to take care of the work in the schools. The city of Taipei has about one hundred twenty thousand university students, eighty thousand technical college students, fifty thousand high school students, and one hundred forty thousand junior high school students. This adds up to a total of almost four hundred thousand students. The young brothers and sisters who serve full time should be assigned to preach the gospel in the schools. They do not need to do anything else. They need to do only this one thing: preach the gospel from morning to night on the campuses. It is easy for one household to save three people in a year. But how many people can a full-timer serving on the campus save? If every full-timer saves an average of ten people in a year, four hundred full-time brothers and sisters will be able to save four thousand people in one year. By doing only the campus work, we should be able to gain four thousand new believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S GOSPEL WORK</h2>
<p>Another item is the children&rsquo;s gospel work. We should assign at least ten full-time serving ones to concentrate on the children. It would be best for most of them to be sisters. At present, no more than five hundred children come to the meetings. We hope that we can increase this number to one thousand. The children&rsquo;s meetings should be carried out in the homes. There should not be more than twelve children in a class, and they can have three high school sisters or brothers as their teachers. The full-time co-workers should promote this work, prepare the teaching materials, and take care of all the other matters.</p>
<p>Every children&rsquo;s home meeting should frequently preach the gospel and invite their relatives and the children of their neighbors. Even though some parents will not come, they will allow their children to come. We believe that many people will be brought in through the children&rsquo;s gospel work. I hope that we will have two thousand children by next spring, three thousand by the summer, and four thousand by next fall. There is a great future in this work. If we take this way, there will be ten thousand children in the church in Taipei within two to three years. At least two to three thousand children out of the ten thousand will not be the children of the saints. The children&rsquo;s meetings will open up a way to gain people, especially the parents of the other children.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOSPEL WORK AT ALL LEVELS OF SOCIETY</h2>
<p>In addition, we can gain people from different professions in society, such as those who work in hospitals, government offices, factories, and businesses. It is very probable that we can add five to ten thousand people every year. This requires us to maintain the two great pillars of preaching the gospel from house to house and preaching the gospel in the schools.</p>
<p>Apart from these ways to preach the gospel, we must use the small groups to recover the dormant brothers and sisters. There are approximately ten thousand dormant saints. If we are faithful, within six months we will recover one-third of them. This can bring in another three thousand people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OPENING EVERY HOME FOR THE UNIVERSAL<br />
SPREADING OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We must pay particular attention to opening the homes for the gospel. Opening one&rsquo;s home to preach the gospel must become a universal practice. Every saint&rsquo;s home must be open for the gospel. Even a newly baptized saint can open his home for the gospel. The saints who have recently been baptized are fresh, and they have many friends and relatives. If they invite their friends and relatives to their homes, it will be easy to gain them.</p>
<p>We must change our concepts and not think that a &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; household will be more effective in preaching the gospel. This is not necessarily true. On the contrary, sometimes a household that is too spiritual does not bear fruit. In general, people have children when they are young and strong. Hence, our view must change. We must see that even newly saved ones can preach the gospel to gain others. Of course, we are not saying that the saints should not be spiritual, nor are we encouraging the saints to love the world. We are saying that there is no need to be tied down by conventions. We should not be influenced by different situations; rather, we should just do our best to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>We must come to the Bible to see how the Lord Jesus preached the gospel. The Lord Jesus went to the homes of tax collectors and sinners. He did not go merely to preach the gospel; He also sat down to eat with the tax collectors and sinners. He said, &ldquo;Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill&rdquo; (Matt. 9:12). The Lord was saying, &ldquo;Pharisees, if you think that you are not ill, I can have nothing to do with you. If you feel that you are sick and that you are a sinner, come to Me. You must know that you are great sinners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For this reason we must change our view. When we go to the homes of the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel, we should not judge the saints. We should not measure the heart or the appearance of the saints to determine whether their household is qualified to preach the gospel. We must believe that when the gospel is preached in their home, their household will change. The New Testament shows that the gospel was preached in the homes of sinners and in the homes of God-fearing people. Even though Zaccheus was a sinner, because he was a chief tax collector, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house...Today salvation has come to this house&rdquo; (Luke 19:5, 9). Cornelius, a God-fearing man who gave many alms to the poor and frequently prayed to God, invited Peter to his home to preach the gospel to his friends and relatives (Acts 10:1-8, 24-43). We must go to both kinds of households.</p>
<p>We must do whatever we can so that open homes for the gospel is a universal practice. It does not matter whether a person is experienced; as long as he is saved, he should open his home for the preaching of the gospel. We are calling out to the saints, and we want every household to answer this call. Everyone, the old and the young, must preach the gospel. Let us put this to practice. When we preach the gospel, we should not worry about how to preach. We simply need to bear the responsibility of opening our homes and inviting our relatives, neighbors, and friends. We must also prepare some snacks; occasionally, we can even have a love feast. However, it is better to keep things simple and inexpensive. When the saints come together, they must practice speaking for the Lord by giving testimonies of how they were saved. The gospel meetings in the homes must not be turned into worship services.</p>
<p>Because believers in Christianity follow the customs of the nations, they cannot avoid the rituals in worship services. However, according to the record in the Scriptures, the Lord Jesus never used rituals for worship when He was in someone&rsquo;s home, yet people were always willing to repent and receive Him. This is the true worship sought by the Father. True worship is not prostrating oneself on the ground. John 4 reveals that the true worshippers of the Father are those who drink the living water (vv. 14, 23-24). Luke 15 records the return of the prodigal son. The father saw the prodigal son from afar and ran to meet him, kissed him, and ordered the servants to put the best robe, a ring, and sandals on him. Then they slaughtered the fattened calf and called everyone to eat and rejoice together (vv. 11-24). When the son enjoyed what the father prepared, the father was worshipped. In the same way, the Lord does not want us to bow before Him; His delight is that we eat Him and receive Him. Hence, true worship is to use our spirit to receive the Lord as life, to eat the bread of life, and to drink the water of life.</p>
<p>In the past many Christians thought that breaking bread to remember the Lord was to meditate quietly upon all that the Lord passed through. I also practiced this for many years. I finally gained a true understanding of what the bread-breaking meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day is supposed to be when I left mainland China. Then I wrote <em>How to Break Bread.</em> When the Lord established His feast, He took the bread and blessed it. Then He broke it and gave it to His disciples, saying, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body.&rdquo; Then He said, &ldquo;Do this in remembrance of Me&rdquo; (Matt. 26:26; Luke 22:19). What the Lord wants us to do is to eat. Eating is the true remembrance of the Lord. Hence, to remember the Lord we must know that He is the bread of life and then take and eat Him in true remembrance of Him. Before I had this realization, I used to pay much attention to kneeling in prayer; after I had this realization, I began to pay attention to whether or not my spirit was open and exercised and to whether or not I had touched the Lord. There should be no outward rituals in remembering the Lord. According to the Bible, we should return to our spirit. Everything depends on the spirit, not on letters.</p>
<p>In promoting the home gospel meetings, we do not want to give the saints a natural understanding or a religious concept. We must throw these things away. As long as a saint has a home, that home should be open for the gospel. Everyone should give his or her testimony and speak concerning the Lord Jesus. We should not speak too long; we should give a short word concerning our salvation. In this way, we will gradually produce many more saints who are able to preach the gospel. Preaching the gospel in the homes is a fountainhead from which we can draw much water. As long as we dig the well deep, the number of people who get saved in the homes will constantly increase.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FOUNDATION FOR THE SPREAD<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE BEING MOBILIZED TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>For many years the number of saints meeting regularly in the church in Taipei has been around four to five thousand. The spiritual life of the saints has been maintained through their meeting regularly, and they have grown in life. This is a positive situation. Many brothers and sisters are growing, and many new brothers and sisters are being brought into the church life. However, it is time for us to change from merely maintaining our situation to taking action. The church in Taipei must rise up. Even though four to five thousand is not a large number, if the saints rise up to move corporately, it will be significant and profitable, and we will be able to accomplish something.</p>
<p>According to the present strength of our meetings, it should not be a problem to increase our numbers. It should be easy to double our numbers by next year, and we should also be able to quadruple them. I say this because at least three thousand five hundred saints stood up in the meeting to express their desire to bring one person to the Lord every year. This means that next year we can add a minimum of three thousand five hundred new ones. If every saint brings at least one person to the Lord in the next year, we will double our numbers. In addition to this, we should strengthen the preaching of the gospel in our homes and among the students. By adding these two aspects, we should be able to quadruple our numbers next year. If we want to gain people, we all, including the older and the younger saints, must rise up and coordinate together. The Lord&rsquo;s leading is for everyone to be mobilized as a soldier and to carry out his or her function.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOCUS OF OUR WORK BEING<br />
BEGETTING, NOURISHING, TEACHING,<br />
AND ADMINISTRATING</h2>
<p>In this message we will emphasize three matters: truth, life, and the church. With respect to the gospel, as long as we all preach the gospel, we will have good results. It is not difficult to beget children, but nourishing the children is not so easy. Teaching or educating children is even harder, because we must be educated first. We encourage all the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to beget children; it is good to have many new ones. However, after children are born, we cannot discard them on the side of the road, nor can we abandon them in a nursery school. We must raise them up by nourishing them and giving them an education. Furthermore, we must bring them to the proper path. If we beget five thousand children next year, it will be a huge problem to nourish and educate them. How can we teach them if we are uneducated? In ancient China it was rare for women to receive an education. After they were married, they stayed at home to raise children. Even though the children received their mother&rsquo;s love, they did not receive any education from their mother, because their mother was not educated.</p>
<p>In contrast to the situation in ancient Chinese households, the situation in Taiwan today is quite different. Nearly all young females receive a good education, one that is not inferior to the education received by males. Most young women today have graduated from high school. Therefore, they can bear the responsibility to both nourish and teach their children.</p>
<p>In order to keep the children whom we beget through preaching the gospel, we must educate them. Many do not know much about God, Christ, or redemption. We should know how to teach them these matters, because we have been taught the truth for many years. Not only do we have to beget, nourish, and teach; we also have to administrate. After we beget someone, we need to nourish and teach him. We must also lead him to participate in the proper church life and to function with the saints in the church. Then he will also be able to beget, nourish, teach, and administrate, and we will be able to continue to gain new ones. For this reason, we must learn how to beget, nourish, teach, and administrate.</p>
<p>When a couple gets married, they beget children. When the children are born, the couple will have no peace. Some people who get married today do not want to have children. This is not according to God&rsquo;s will in His creation of man. Likewise, some Christians do not want to beget new ones. After being saved, they want to pray, fellowship with the Lord, read the Bible, and be spiritual. But they do not want to beget and nourish children. To them, begetting children is a suffering as well as a blessing. Some brothers refuse to be an elder or a deacon, one who takes care of the saints and bears responsibility in the church. They want only to be a simple Christian who is not bothered or troubled by anything. We cannot be like this. We must beget new ones, and we must nourish them. We cannot ask the elders to nourish our children, nor can we put our children in a nursery school. We must nourish them ourselves.</p>
<p>From our experience we know that begetting is easy, but nourishing, teaching, and administrating are not so easy. We have been begetting people for many years, but we lack adequate care and nourishment. It seems as though we either leave them at home, or we throw them out on the street. Some of our children die from the cold, some starve to death, and some are taken away by other people. Hence, we must change this situation. We must care for the people whom we beget through preaching the gospel, and we must nourish and teach them in order for them to be sustained. After teaching them, our care for them must be proper; we must bring them along the proper path, which is to live the proper church life and to function in the church. This must be the focus of our work.</p><h2 class="head1">PURSUING AND EXERCISING<br />
IN TRUTH, LIFE, AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I have been serving Him for more than fifty years. I have gained much experience during these years, but there are three items that are unresolved. First, how do we support the new believers so that we do not lose them after they are saved? Second, how should we cultivate them so that they will grow like young green sprouts? Third, how do we care for them? How do we care for a church when the number of saints increases from five thousand to ten thousand? It is simple to care for a small church with only thirty to fifty saints, but suppose the church in Taipei doubled its number from five thousand saints to ten thousand; how would we care for its administration? To support, cultivate, and administrate are three issues that need to be resolved.</p>
<p>If we follow the way of the world, we could support, cultivate, and administrate through organization, but the church is not an organization. We must therefore spend some time to consider these matters. According to our experience, supporting, cultivating, and administrating depend on all the saints. In other words, every brother and sister must exercise in the truth, in life, and in the church; then the new ones will spontaneously be supported, cultivated, and cared for. If we are unclear concerning the truth, do not have growth in life, and do not participate in the church life, the result of our leading people to be saved will be the abandonment of many babies along the roadside. When a family has a baby, the parents do not leave it for the grandmothers to raise. We cannot lead people to salvation and then rely on the full-timers or co-workers and elders to support, cultivate, and care for them. Even though children are burdensome and troublesome, God gave all mothers a particular love. If we can lead five people to salvation in a year, that is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy; however, we must support them after they are saved. All mothers put their children first. Regardless of how busy a mother is, she will care for her children. Spiritually, this matter depends on our level of life. In order to resolve how to support, cultivate, and provide care, we must stop expecting others to take care of things for us; rather, we must do them ourselves. Therefore, we must know the truth, grow in life, and have a normal church life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Laboring to Pursue the Truth</h2>
<p>Most young women now receive a proper education. When they become mothers, they are able to educate their children. This principle also applies to us. We hope that all the brothers and sisters, including the co-workers and elders, would receive this word. We should not worry about how to support, cultivate, or administrate. Rather, we must pursue the truth, life, and the church. We need to labor in the truth; we should not be afraid of laboring on the truth. We must spend time in the truth. We should study the truth not only for the sake of our children but also for our own sake. Preaching the gospel requires labor&mdash;reading the Bible and studying the truth, including the Life-study messages. If a student does not labor, he will not get good grades at school.</p>
<p>In order to get into a good university, the young people in Taiwan all labor in their studies. Likewise, if we want to be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hands, we must labor when we read the Bible. We cannot read the Bible as if we are reading a newspaper or a novel. We must spend the time to labor in and research the Bible by getting into every word. We should even study the genealogy in the first seventeen verses of Matthew 1. When I was young, I studied the first seventeen verses of Matthew 1. Based on my study, in 1938 I wrote an article called &ldquo;Gleanings from the Genealogy of Christ.&rdquo; That article shows that I did a thorough study of the Lord&rsquo;s genealogy. You too must put such labor into studying the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Exercising to Grow in Life</h2>
<p>We must also grow in life. We should not be loose or indulge ourselves. Neither should we try to improve or reform ourselves. Self-improvement is of no use. We should always remember that we are not living for Jesus; we are living Christ. We must practice &ldquo;not I, but Christ.&rdquo; When something happens to us, we do not need to learn to be patient; instead, we should practice living in a way that &ldquo;it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). We must exercise being rooted in Christ in all things (Eph. 3:17; Col. 2:7). This is to exercise in life. This is like playing the piano; if we skip one day of practice, our playing will not improve. We must exercise to live Christ. We should exercise to say, &ldquo;I am a person in Christ; I must live in Christ, and I must be rooted in Christ.&rdquo; It does not matter what kind of attitude others have toward us or in what way they speak to us, we should always be rooted in Christ. Such an exercise to be in Christ is to be &ldquo;no longer I...but...Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; We must exercise in this way every day so that we grow in life. Then after we lead people to salvation, we will spontaneously help them to live Christ.</p>
<p>For the building up of the church, we must not merely be zealous to preach the gospel; we must also have the truth, life, and the church as our foundation. We should study the truth diligently, just like a student studies algebra and geometry. Then our foundation will enable us to teach our children. Simply encouraging the saints is not enough to build up the church. All the brothers and sisters must be rooted in the truth and in life. We must hold fast to these three things: the truth, life, and the church; we cannot let them go. Even though we encourage the saints to be crazy and thick-skinned when they preach the gospel, their being so must be in the truth and in life; otherwise, there will be problems. We must watch to see that the saints are clear concerning the truth, that they are strong in life, and that they have a normal church life. We must care for these matters, pursue them, and exercise to be in them. This is the only way for the service in the church to be long-lasting and for the church to spread.</p><h2 class="head2">Having a Normal Church Life</h2>
<p>We must also have a practical living in the church life. Even though the brothers are busy with their occupations and the sisters are busy with their households, we still must quietly consider how to properly apportion our time. Everyone should have a schedule in which we clearly list what we will do for the week. We are all busy, and we have many things that we must do; however, in order to learn to do things according to their importance and urgency, we should make a schedule. For example, when we receive a letter, we do not need to read it immediately if it is not urgent. Telegrams, however, are usually short and important and should be read immediately. Since we have so many things to take care of and not enough time for all of them, we must learn to take care of things in the order of their importance and urgency. Hence, we must make a schedule. Then we will know how much time we can spend daily laboring in the Lord&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<p>For the church life, it is good for the saints to attend four meetings a week. In almost every place in the world, no one works on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Therefore, we should go to the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting and to the bread-breaking meeting in the evening. In addition, it should not be too difficult to have two evening meetings during the remaining six days in the week. It is necessary to have four meetings in the church life. We have considered combining the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting with the table meeting, but it is not so easy to combine them. If we are hasty, both meetings will suffer loss. To combine them in a good way, we must have the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting like some localities in America&mdash;they meet from the morning until about one or two in the afternoon. Then they stay and eat lunch together. In this way there is enough time for a message and to remember the Lord. They do this because it is not easy for the brothers and sisters who live far apart in large cities to make two trips to the meeting hall in one day. If the city is not large, and if the brothers and sisters do not live far apart from each other, it is better for them to meet in the morning and in the evening. In addition to the two Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings, during the week there is the need for a prayer meeting and for a meeting to study the Bible. These four meetings are necessary.</p>
<p>No matter how busy they are, the saints must budget their time and endeavor to attend these four meetings. If we practice this, the ones under our care will gradually begin to do the same. We should not consider these four meetings to be insignificant; they have much influence on our living. Attending these four meetings can be compared to eating regular meals instead of starving oneself and then eating a huge meal. The church life is a healthy life; if we are so busy with other matters that we frequently miss the meetings and can attend the meetings only occasionally, it is like missing many meals and then eating a big meal sporadically. After a long period of time of eating in this way, we will not be very healthy.</p>
<p>In order to be clear about the truth, we must study the Bible every day. We should not read it in a general way; instead, we should study it. Merely reading the Bible every day is not enough. We should also use the best reference books so that our knowledge of the truth will constantly increase. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I have not left His Word for the past sixty years. For this reason, the light within me is constantly increasing. The Lord&rsquo;s Word has a free way to flow within me, and when it flows, the light comes from every side. This shows that we must know the truth.</p>
<p>In the future the full-time co-workers will encourage preaching the gospel on the campuses, in the homes, to the children, and in the community. Full-timers are needed for the gospel on the campuses and in the schools; otherwise, it will be difficult to maintain the gospel work. With regard to the children&rsquo;s work, even though the junior high and high school students can teach in the children&rsquo;s meetings, the children&rsquo;s work will be carried forward by the full-timers, because they will prepare teaching materials and make a schedule. The number of children in the church in Taipei has dropped to five hundred because there is a lack of co-workers to carry the work forward. If the children&rsquo;s work is to spread, we must preach the gospel. We should not limit our work to the children of the saints who are in our meetings; we also need to invite the children of our neighbors and friends. Furthermore, we hope that every home will be open for the gospel. This requires that the co-workers visit the saints in order to encourage them to open their homes and that the co-workers help the saints who are willing to open their homes to speak. Initially, the co-workers will have to take the lead in the homes, but after a few gospel times, the saints will be able to take care of the meeting. We need to be flexible in our practice. On the one hand, the co-workers need to go out and encourage the saints, and on the other hand, the saints should not depend on the elders and co-workers; they must learn to do things themselves.</p>
<p>If all the saints know the truth, have some growth in life, and live the normal church life, they will not be sidetracked or get into trouble regardless of how crazy they are when they preach the gospel or how thick their skin is. They will have the ground with people, and they will have the inward reality. When we learn the truth, have some growth in life, and participate in the proper church life, we spontaneously become stable and dependable people. We will regularly lead others to salvation, and they will do what we do. In this way, the church will be built up, and the Lord will have a testimony on the earth that will cause the bride to be prepared.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD TAKING THE WAY OF RECOVERY<br />
FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<p>You should never think that we are one of the many groups in Christianity. The leading that the Lord has given us is different from what is in Christianity; we are His recovery. Christianity lost this way more than one thousand years ago. The Lord wants us to take the way of recovery in order to fulfill the words He has spoken in the Scriptures. In the books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Romans, the Lord spoke many deep things, but we do not see much of the reality of these things. We should not think that it is impossible for these words to be fulfilled. We believe that the words in the Bible, regardless of how deep, high, or mysterious they are, will be fulfilled. If we are not willing to cooperate with the Lord to allow His words to be accomplished in us in this age, He will delay His return. To the Lord one thousand years are as a day; if He delays his coming for one thousand years, He will come one day later. The Lord has great patience, and He has endurance. The day will come when He will fulfill His word. May we be those who have received the grace and the blessing to allow the Lord to pass through us in this age so that His word can be accomplished and fulfilled.</p>
<p>God desires to gain a group of people who are clear concerning the truth and who have growth in life. He also desires to obtain the church life as the expression of the golden lampstand. We are preaching the gospel, speaking the truth, and leading people to salvation so that they may receive grace and enlightenment to be a part of the golden lampstand for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. We believe that this is what the Lord wants us to do, and we also believe that if we are faithful, the Lord&rsquo;s grace will take us on in this way.</p>
<p>We truly are blessed people because the recovery is not what it was in the time of Martin Luther or what it was three hundred years ago or even what it was one hundred years ago. Every generation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery surpasses the generation preceding it. We hope that the younger generation will surpass us and will constantly follow the Lord and advance. Their ability to surpass us depends on the truth, life, the church life, and the gospel. Truth, life, and the church are the foundation, and the gospel is for spreading. It is only by having truth, life, and the church that we will be able to spread.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR EMPHASES IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>There are a few more points for us to fellowship about. First, our feeling toward the church is very important. When we go out to preach the gospel, we should not think that we are great gospel preachers who can bring one hundred people to salvation. A believer with this attitude is finished; in other words, he has killed himself. We should not think that we are tremendous. It is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace if He uses us in any way. We must be humble and understand that everything we have is in the church and that the result of all our labor must be turned over to the church. Only the church can preserve us and balance us. As soon as we do not have the church life, we are on our own, and we are in danger. Moreover, if we do anything special on our own, we will wither, because it will result in division. There is only one Body of Christ, and there is only one way. Hence, we must lay a firm foundation in truth, life, and the church. The firmer the foundation is, the better. Then we will not suffer, nor will we be in any danger when we go out to preach the gospel, even if we lead tens of thousands of people to salvation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must always remember that there must not be parties in the church. Do not say that Apollos is higher than Paul or that Paul is deeper than Peter or even that Peter is older and more experienced. We must not make such distinctions. We must see that Paul is for us, Peter is for us, and Apollos is also for us. Paul said that all are ours (1 Cor. 3:22). We thank the Lord that He gave us Peter and Apollos and Paul; they are for us. If we say that we are following the way of Paul or that we belong to Peter or to Apollos, we have brought division into the church. This has been church history. We cannot afford to take that way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING HUMBLE IN LEARNING FROM OTHERS,<br />
IN NOT CRITICIZING OTHERS,<br />
IN BEING HARMONIOUS IN ALL THINGS,<br />
AND IN NOT CAUSING PROBLEMS</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we must be humble in order to learn from others, to not criticize others, to be harmonious in all things, and to not cause problems. We must love all the churches and all the saints. We must continually maintain such an attitude. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we are one, and everyone has his function. The elderly saints have their function, and the young saints have their function. We must thank the Lord that He gave us &ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; &ldquo;Apollos,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Peter&rdquo;; we must receive the supply from them. We absolutely cannot say, &ldquo;I am for Paul,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am for Peter.&rdquo; We must not allow other saints to take sides with us. We must condemn any situation that results in the saints in a locality beginning to follow us.</p>
<p>We do not want people to follow us, nor do we want to follow men. Rather, we are for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and we love the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, all the churches, and all the brothers and sisters. We receive whoever can give us help, and we help whomever we are able to help. Wherever we go, we do not criticize, nor do we say, &ldquo;This church is not as good as another local church.&rdquo; We must not have such a thought. Some churches have more growth and others have less, but we should not discuss this. Our attitude must be that we are here to supply others with the Lord&rsquo;s grace. We must also be humble, and we must receive the supply from others.</p>
<p>We must always be willing to learn no matter where we are. If there is something that can help us, we should learn from it. In the same manner, wherever we go, we must supply others and receive the supply from others. This is the way for everyone&rsquo;s spirit to be in harmony. We cannot expect that every local church will have the same growth in life. This is impossible. We should not even have such an expectation. We must be one to harmoniously supply the saints wherever we are.</p>
<p>Moreover, we should not focus only on our own work. The Lord has given us a portion, which we must take care of, but we must not push others aside or trample on their portion. We must remember that the Lord has richly given every member to the church and that every member has the Lord&rsquo;s riches. For example, even the little finger has its use. All the members have the riches of the Body. Hence, we must treasure all the brothers and sisters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE SMALL GROUPS TO GAIN PEOPLE<br />
AND ALL THE MEMBERS BEARING THE BURDEN<br />
OF SHEPHERDING AND TEACHING</h2>
<p>If we want the church to continue to spread, every saint must pick up the responsibility to shepherd and teach. We will form small groups in every district, and every group will have twelve people, just as the Lord Jesus had twelve disciples. On the one hand, we will preach the gospel, and on the other hand, we will lead and perfect a few saints. When the number of saints in a group becomes too many, the group will split. This means that when those whom we have perfected learn how to lead others, they will go out to do the same things that we do. In this matter, we do not need to wait for the church to make arrangements. Instead, we should begin to take care of a few saints and gradually increase the number of those under our care. On the one hand, we will preach the gospel, and on the other hand, we will take care of the saints by feeding them as our spiritual children. The saints who have been under our care for one year will have some spontaneous growth.</p>
<p>The goal of leading people to salvation is to bring them into the church so that they will be established in the church. Hence, we need to support those whom we lead to salvation. If we do not support them, we will lead people to salvation with one hand and allow them to slip away through our other hand. We must avoid this. We should not bear children and then neglect to care for them. After we beget, we must feed our children and bring them into the church. Newly saved ones need to be led for some time before they will be stable in the church life. This is our goal.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY FOR THE CHURCHES<br />
IN TAIWAN TO GO ON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hab. 3:2; Ezek. 1:4</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A TRUE REVIVAL</h2>
<p>Hymn #212 in the Chinese hymnal was written after we had a thorough study of Ezekiel 1 more than twenty-three years ago. The messages given during those meetings were published in Chinese.</p>
<p>Ezekiel 1 speaks of a vision seen by Ezekiel in which a storm wind, coming from the north, brings a great cloud in which there is fire flashing. From the midst of the fire there is something like electrum in brightness (v. 4). This shows that in Ezekiel 1 there are four main items: the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum. John Nelson Darby says that the electrum is &ldquo;an unknown substance&rdquo; that &ldquo;some think a mixture of gold and silver.&rdquo; According to the divine revelation, gold represents the manifestation of God&rsquo;s divine nature. The storm wind comes from God, the cloud that comes with the wind contains a flashing sanctifying fire, and from the midst of the fire there is something like the glowing electrum, composed of the elements of gold and silver. This picture, which is full of spiritual significance, implies that every one of us must become a man of wind and cloud, filled inwardly with the divine fire, and full of the shining forth of the divine essence.</p>
<p>Five hundred years of Christian history have passed since Luther began the Reformation. The item most emphasized in Christianity during these years has been revival. According to church history, for the past five hundred years the Protestant churches have been maintained mainly by revival meetings. We cannot say that this is against the Bible; however, even with revival meetings the condition of Christian meetings has progressively declined, and the result is a loss of spiritual weight. When the gospel was preached in China, the Christians changed the word <em>revival</em> into <em>excitement.</em> This means that the meetings merely excited people. After a short time believers grew cold again, and they continued to live as they had in the past. For this reason, after the Lord raised up His recovery among us, we did not pay much attention to revival meetings; neither were we willing to use the term <em>excitement meeting.</em> There have been very few revival meetings among us.</p>
<p>I have been speaking God&rsquo;s Word for many years, and I rarely quote the Minor Prophets in the Old Testament. However, for this meeting, there is one sentence that we can use: &ldquo;O Jehovah, revive Your work / In the midst of the years&rdquo; (Hab. 3:2). <em>Hymns,</em> #797 is also very appropriate, because the beginning of every stanza and the beginning of the chorus say, &ldquo;Revive Thy work, O Lord!&rdquo; However, in considering this matter, we will use hymn #212 in the Chinese hymnal.</p>
<p>If we read this hymn thoughtfully, we can see that the revival we are speaking of is not the shallow revival of which most of today&rsquo;s Christianity speaks, much less is it a revival of excitement referred to by the Christians in China. The second half of the third stanza of hymn #212 says, &ldquo;Burn out filthiness, / Burn up common things, / Making man correspond to God, / Holy without blemish.&rdquo; The revival we are speaking of causes man to correspond to God by making man holy and without blemish. The second half of the fourth stanza says, &ldquo;Divinity mingled with humanity, / Man&rsquo;s spirit joined with God&rsquo;s Spirit, / Causing God&rsquo;s life / To be manifested in man.&rdquo; This is the revival that we are referring to, and I believe this is also the revival that God desires. It is not an outward, so-called revival work, much less a revival of excitement; rather, it is &ldquo;divinity mingled with humanity, / Man&rsquo;s spirit joined with God&rsquo;s Spirit, / Causing God&rsquo;s life / To be manifested in man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1961 I conducted a Life-study of the book of Ezekiel, and I wrote this hymn. This proves that the revival that God showed us over two decades ago was a revival of &ldquo;divinity mingled with humanity, man&rsquo;s spirit joined with God&rsquo;s Spirit, causing God&rsquo;s life to be manifested in man.&rdquo; This is also the revival that causes man to correspond to God. We need to sing these words until they enter into us and come out from us as a cry unto God: &ldquo;Lord, bring in such a revival among us that makes man correspond to You so that Your life can be manifested in us.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MODEL FOR THE ADMINISTRATION, MOVE,<br />
AND BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the past few conference meetings more than six hundred saints have consecrated all their time for the Lord&rsquo;s work and service, and another group of more than six hundred saints have consecrated themselves to be part-time for the Lord&rsquo;s work and service. This will greatly expand and strengthen our service. We must, therefore, make new arrangements for the Lord&rsquo;s work in Taiwan and for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>We will thoroughly fellowship with all the saints concerning the leading we have received from the Lord, the vision we have seen, and the way we must take in order to go on. We want every church and every saint in Taiwan to know how the work of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony should go forward. We also want the churches to know how to build up the priesthood through service. We will fellowship as a family concerning the way we should move forward to promote the Lord&rsquo;s testimony.</p><h2 class="head1">A REVIEW OF THE MOVE OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>According to church history, the first meeting of the church was in Jerusalem. The church there was raised up and established by the apostles. From the beginning there was a large number of saved ones in that church. According to the record in Acts, one hundred twenty disciples prayed in one accord in the upper room for ten days. Then on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit was poured out, and three thousand people heard the gospel and were saved (1:13-14; 2:1-4, 41). When the first church was raised up, three thousand people were added to it on the first day. Not long after Pentecost, another five thousand men believed in the Lord on another day (4:4).</p>
<p>However, Acts does not say much about how the service in the early church in Jerusalem was carried out. The saints did not have their own meeting hall; they met in the temple and from house to house (2:46; 5:42). Verse 46 of chapter 2 says that all those who believed met from house to house. These words in Greek are specific. In the very beginning the church in Jerusalem had their meetings in the homes of the eight thousand saved ones; the saints met from house to house. This is what the book of Acts reveals.</p>
<p>The record in Acts does not show another church that had as many believers as the church in Jerusalem. In other words, it is difficult to find a pattern of a large church in the New Testament; the New Testament does not record another church that had more than a thousand believers or that had more than ten thousand believers. Hence, it is difficult to know how to build up a local church that has a large number of saints and how to spread in such a local church.</p>
<p>Even though there were numerous revivals in church history, it is difficult to find a record that indicates that a church had several thousand or tens of thousands of believers meeting together. It is difficult for us to find a pattern for the administration of a large church from church history.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Recovery in China</h2>
<p>The first church was raised up in Foochow in 1920. In the beginning there were only three saints, and they met in a home. However, even though they were only three, they quickly increased to ten and then to more than twenty believers. After they increased to about one hundred, they did not have further increase. The number of saints in the church remained at around one hundred for several years. In 1927 we spread from Foochow to Shanghai. After five years in Shanghai, in 1932 we spread up to the north and began meeting in Chefoo. The meetings in Chefoo began in the living room of my home. There were eleven of us at our first bread-breaking meeting, and we sat around an old-fashioned Chinese square table. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, our numbers increased to one hundred in 1933.</p>
<p>The strange thing is that when we reached about one hundred, it was difficult for us to increase further. For eleven years, from 1922 to 1933, the number of saints in every church from Foochow in the south to Shanghai and on up to Chefoo in the north was about one hundred. One hundred is not a large number, but when our numbers first reached one hundred, we wanted to celebrate, because we thought that it was a large number. It is easier to administrate, to lead, and to shepherd a church with this many saints. For this reason the churches stopped increasing when they reached one hundred saints.</p>
<p>The number of new believers we would baptize never exceeded forty at one time; at the most there were thirty-seven or thirty-eight. It was in 1940, in Chefoo, that we received light to promote the whole church preaching the gospel. The term <em>the church preaching the gospel</em> was first used in 1940 in northern China. As soon as we began to practice the whole church preaching the gospel, the number of saved ones increased greatly. During the second year of the whole church preaching the gospel, we received a great blessing&mdash;many were baptized. The first time we baptized more than one hundred twenty people. Then we had baptisms every month for at least four consecutive months. We baptized one hundred people, then around ninety, and then around eighty. As a result of the four times that we had baptisms, several hundred new ones were brought in. From that time onward, the number of saints in the church increased greatly.</p>
<p>Chefoo is my hometown. The church raised up by the Lord in that locality began meeting in my home. After the church in Chefoo was raised up in 1932, our numbers increased to over a hundred saints in the second year. Therefore, I felt that I needed to leave my job to serve full time in the church. In August 1933 I left my job. In October I made a special trip to Shanghai to visit the church there. When I first arrived in Shanghai, there were no more than one hundred fifty saints in the church. The city of Shanghai is huge, and the meeting hall was located in the west on Hardoon Road. Since some of the brothers and sisters lived in the northwest district of the city, there was the need to meet in two places. Later, they had another meeting hall in the northwest district, besides the meeting hall on Hardoon Road. The total number of saints in both places was not more than one hundred fifty. It was not until after 1940 that there was a church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the church in Chefoo, where the number of saints increased from a little over one hundred to several hundred.</p>
<p>Soon afterward the War in the Pacific broke out, and there was a great change in the domestic situation, and many brothers and sisters moved inland. As a result, churches were raised up in the inland areas around Szechuan. There were very few saints in these localities. The church in Shanghai had to temporarily close its doors and stop meeting because Shanghai was occupied by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>After the Chinese victory over the Japanese, the church in Shanghai resumed its meetings in 1946. Initially, there were less than a hundred saints in the bread-breaking meeting. In the summer of that year, I was invited back to Shanghai. When I arrived, there were less than ninety saints in the bread-breaking meeting. Later, the brothers suggested that I move my family from northern China to Shanghai. So at the end of 1946, I moved my family to Shanghai, and I also began traveling between Shanghai and Nanking to work in both places.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1947 I began to lead the saints in Shanghai into the practice of the church preaching the gospel. This practice was successful. The church preached the gospel during the Chinese New Year holiday, and more than one hundred people were baptized. For the next two or three months, many people were baptized every month. This is the way we had a great increase in the number of saints in the church.</p>
<p>The church in Shanghai had a slightly longer history than the other churches. It also had a considerable number of brothers and sisters. However, due to the political situation, from 1942 to 1946 the doors to the meeting hall were closed, and the saints were unable to meet. As a result, the saints were scattered. Nevertheless, the meetings were resumed in 1946, and in the beginning of 1947 a revival occurred. By the summer of that year, several hundred new ones had been added and most of the original saints, who had been dormant, came back to the meetings. In 1947 there were more than one thousand saints meeting in the church in Shanghai. Since the saints were spread out all over Shanghai, we felt that we should begin district meetings. So in the summer of that year we separated into sixteen different districts for the bread-breaking meeting. After more than one year of meeting in districts, our numbers increased even more.</p>
<p>In 1949, due to another change in the political situation, the Lord led me to leave Shanghai and come to Taiwan. During the time that I was in mainland China, there was only one locality that had over one thousand saints, and that was the church in Shanghai. All the matters related to service were divided among the sixteen district meetings. Every district meeting had from a few dozen to one hundred saints. This was the largest number of saints that we had in one locality in the work in mainland China.</p><h2 class="head2">Raising Up the Work<br />
in Taiwan and Southeast Asia</h2>
<p>Beginning in 1946, a small number of saints began migrating to Taiwan. More saints migrated in 1947 and even more in 1948. By the end of 1948 there were thirty to fifty saints meeting in the church in Taipei. When I came to Taiwan in the spring of 1949, there were less than one hundred saints in the church in Taipei. In August we built a small meeting hall where hall one is now located, and we officially began the work. Our numbers increased very quickly, and by the end of 1949, the number of saints meeting in the church in Taipei had increased to around nine hundred.</p>
<p>In November of 1950 the Lord led me to go to Manila in Southeast Asia. From then on, I spent approximately four months of every year in the Philippines. Most of the remaining time I spent giving trainings in Taipei. Prior to 1952, a sister and I were the only full-time serving ones. In 1952 we increased to approximately one hundred full-time serving ones. As a result, the work on the island of Taiwan increased and spread, and churches were established in almost all the major cities of Taiwan from Keelung in the north to Kaohsiung in the south and even in Hualien and Taitung on the east. The full-time serving ones spread to these localities to care for the churches for the furtherance of the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, during 1954 and 1955 the number of saints in Taiwan increased to almost fifty thousand. Two years later, from 1956 to 1957, our numbers reached fifty thousand. In other words, we began with a small number of less than five hundred saints, and in six to seven years we experienced a one hundredfold increase&mdash;we had fifty thousand saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Problems of Being Distracted<br />
and of Losing the Leading at the Basic Level</h2>
<p>At the time of our increase in numbers we wanted to receive help in order to pursue spiritual growth, so we invited Brother T. Austin-Sparks to come to minister to us. He came the first time in 1955 and again in 1957. His coming, however, caused problems among us and brought in a storm. As a result of the influence from Brother Sparks, several young brothers had a change of heart and began to dissent. That was a great distraction to the work. It has been approximately twenty-seven years since that storm, but our numbers have not increased; they have remained stagnant.</p>
<p>During the first few years of the work in Taiwan, our numbers increased quickly. In Taipei we increased from one meeting hall to several meeting halls, every meeting hall was divided into several district meetings, and every district meeting was divided into several small groups. Looking back, we must confess that our practice of every meeting hall being divided into several districts and every district being further divided into many small groups was appropriate and effective. The advantage of this practice was that newly saved ones were taken care of by the small groups. However, we became distracted by Brother Sparks&rsquo;s visit and no longer paid attention to the service in the districts and in the small groups. Later, the small groups gradually disappeared, and the districts were rearranged.</p>
<p>According to our rearrangement, the church in Taipei had more than twenty districts, but there were no more small groups. Thus, the basic level of service disappeared. As a result, our care for the brothers and sisters, especially our cherishing of the new ones, was not as effective. Many brothers and sisters were not cared for, and the newly saved ones were not appropriately supported. Subsequently, the number of people in the church gradually decreased, even though the brothers and sisters faithfully maintained the Lord&rsquo;s testimony and preached the gospel to gain new ones. Despite these efforts, our numbers fell far below the fifty thousand we had gained more than twenty years ago.</p>
<p>For the past three or four years, I have been observing our situation. Even though I have not been in Taiwan, I have had a burden for Taiwan. I have been observing the situation in Taiwan from afar. I have also had thorough fellowship with the responsible brothers and the elders. We have constantly been seeking how a church as large as the church in Taipei should go on.</p>
<p>Even though we were distracted and had problems in 1957, the situation remained with us until September 1965 when I came back from America to deal with it. As a result of the problems, the church was like a person who, having suffered a long-term illness, had been cured by an operation and needed a long period to recover his strength. The operation was in September 1965, and we needed one to two years to recover our strength. I visited Taiwan in 1966, 1967, and 1968.</p>
<p>During those three years, I asked the brothers in Taipei to find the address records of all the brothers and sisters in the church in Taipei. According to the reports they gave me, we had names and addresses for about twenty-three thousand saints in the church in Taipei. Over the intervening years, the population and territory of Taipei changed considerably, and many streets and addresses changed. Now we have the names and addresses for only eleven thousand saints. This is significantly less than the twenty-three thousand saints we had from 1966 to 1968. The main reasons for this decrease in number are that the saints moved, emigrated, or passed away. However, according to my observation, the main reason for the decrease in number is that we lost our leading at the basic level.</p><h2 class="head1">THE KEY FOR THE GOING ON OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Strengthening the Leading at the Basic Level</h2>
<p>Why do we pay so much attention to the situation in Taipei? First, it is rare for a church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to have more than ten thousand saints. Second, even though the church in Taipei has not increased in numbers for more than twenty years, the church has been growing in life. Third, the level of education in the city is relatively high; hence, most of the saints have a higher education and are quite capable. Fourth, Taipei is a large city with a population of approximately two million. It is the most densely populated city in all Taiwan, and it has convenient transportation. These are all the prerequisites that make it beneficial for us to spread the gospel. We cannot ignore these resources. We have spent more than twenty years guarding our accomplishments without spreading. This has been a huge loss. Based on this loss we have analyzed our situation, and we hope that the church in Taipei can move forward.</p>
<p>Before I returned to Taiwan this time, I had a blueprint within me. The blueprint is the light I have received from the Lord, and even though I am not absolutely clear, I know the general pattern. My burden was not to hold conferences or put out a call for full-time serving ones. However, through these few meetings, more than one thousand two hundred saints have consecrated themselves to serve full time or part time for the Lord&rsquo;s work. Thus, the light within me has become even brighter, and I feel that the work in Taiwan should have a completely new beginning. Because my time is limited, I can hold only two meetings to present the light I have received from the Lord to the saints. This is the way we will take. I hope that the brothers and sisters will be happy, and I believe that the Lord will also be pleased.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Need for More Full-time Serving Ones</h2>
<p>We need more full-time serving ones. The church in Taipei has more than eleven thousand saints, but only four to five thousand attend the meetings regularly. These four to five thousand saints are a basic number; they will be successful at whatever they do. There are not many full-time serving ones among these five thousand brothers and sisters who meet regularly. Most of these saints are busy with their jobs and their families. They are only able to come to meetings and serve the Lord during their free time. We cannot accomplish many things if we use only our free time. We must have many full-time serving ones to push the Lord&rsquo;s work forward.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei as well as all the other churches in Taiwan have this need. The church in Taipei has five thousand saints who meet regularly and over eleven thousand saints on its name list. Motivating the five thousand saints to exercise their function and labor for the Lord is a great matter. We would need more than thirty or even fifty brothers to do this. Even one or two hundred full-time serving ones would not be enough to advance this work. We must ask the Lord to give us enough full-timers. When we brought up the matter of serving full time, we hoped that five hundred saints would rise up. According to our consideration, two hundred full-timers plus three hundred part-timers would be equivalent to five hundred serving ones. The church in Taipei does not yet have five hundred serving ones. We do not even have two hundred saints who are willing to serve full time, but the number who are willing to serve part time has exceeded our expectation. The work will not be effective if we can use only part-timers as compared to full-timers. Hence, there is still a lack in the number of full-timers. We hope that more saints will consecrate themselves to meet this need.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Establishing and Promoting the Small Groups</h2>
<p>Some saints may ask whether we will be able to make arrangements for so many full-timers. There are Christian groups that have been successful at this. There are several large Christian groups in America that are successful. We have found that forming small groups is an important principle. Imagine the scene when the Lord Jesus fed five thousand people. There were five thousand men, not including women and children, so there must have been more than ten thousand people. The people had not eaten for almost the entire day, and no one had anything to eat. When evening fell, the Lord Jesus took five loaves and two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed the food and distributed it to more than five thousand hungry people. If there had not been some arrangement, everything would have been in chaos. The people were on a mountain out in the wilderness, and there was a possibility that many would have been trampled in a rush for the food. Before distributing the food, the Lord Jesus in His wisdom told the disciples to have everyone sit down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. The Lord told the people to sit down. If they had been standing, it would have been easy for them to move around, but since they were sitting, they remained in one place. After everyone was sitting in their place, the Lord Jesus gave them bread. It did not matter if they were impatient, because all they could do was sit and wait. Thus, the bread was distributed for everyone to eat in an orderly manner (Matt. 14:14-21; Mark 6:34-44; John 6:1-13).</p>
<p>In addition to groups, there are also houses. This is based on the record in Acts: the believers met and broke bread from house to house. Groups and houses are basic units. For example, according to China&rsquo;s present military arrangement, there are battalions, companies, and squads. The most basic of these is the squad. When the army goes to war, the squads must be strong. In order for the entire army to be strong, all the squads must be strong. In the same way, the church should have small group after small group as the basic unit. As long as the small groups are strong, the church will also be strong.</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago, we practiced the small groups. In the beginning we had only ten to twenty saints in a group. Later, as the number of saints increased, our groups became larger. One group even had more than one hundred saints, but the members did not want to split to form another group. According to the Bible, it is appropriate for the small groups to have about twelve members. The first small group was established by the Lord Jesus Himself. That group had twelve members&mdash;the twelve apostles. Therefore, we are going to practice the small groups according to the Bible, and we will have twelve or less saints in every group. The number in the groups can be less than twelve, but it should not be more than twelve. As soon as the number in a group reaches fourteen or fifteen, the group should split into two. If the number in a group remains less than twelve, the group will have to &ldquo;recruit soldiers.&rdquo; The group can either preach the gospel to gain new ones, or it can recover some dormant saints. In any event the saints must fill up the number in their group. This is the way to practice the increase through the small groups.</p>
<p>The four to five thousand saints meeting regularly in the church in Taipei have been divided into more than four hundred small groups. The groups were formed according to geography, not according to the spiritual level of the saints. For example, suppose there are three people in your household who are able to meet, and there is a household down the street with three saints who can meet, and there are saints across the street from you and on the street behind you who also can meet. When these saints come together, they have the number of saints needed for a small group. These few households are a small group. It may be that not far from them there is another group of households that can form another small group. In this way the church in Taipei has been grouped into more than four hundred small groups.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these small groups do not have a group leader or a responsible person or even a coordinator. In another sense, someone is taking the lead because everyone is a coordinator, everyone is a responsible one, and everyone is a group leader. Every one of the twelve saints in a small group is a group leader, and everyone can take the lead. This means that you lead me and I lead you; from your perspective, I am the leader, and from my perspective, you are the leader. Since we are all leaders, we must seek out each other if one is lost. If I fall into a pit, you must rescue me, and if you stumble, I must uphold you.</p>
<p>From our experience, we discovered that appointing group leaders has drawbacks; therefore, the groups will not have leaders. In the past, those who were appointed as leaders or as responsible ones felt as though they were a government official. Even though we did not speak of position or rank, they still manifested such a flavor. As a result, the other saints in the group felt that they did not need to bear any responsibility. They felt that it was the responsibility of the group leader to care for the ones who stumbled.</p>
<p>After thorough fellowship and consideration, we feel that we do not need group coordinators. As soon as responsibility is given to two coordinators, the other ten saints will not take care of anything. Hence, we decided not to have any responsible ones or leaders in the groups. Everyone is a group coordinator and everyone is a group leader; no one can escape responsibility, and no one can condemn anyone else. If someone stumbles, everyone must bear the responsibility to support that saint; no one should push aside the responsibility. We believe that everyone will approve of such a practice. Regardless of whether you are a small brother or a small sister, you are a group coordinator, and this is good. However, we must not forget that as coordinators, we must bear responsibility. When we see someone fall, we must lift him up. Everyone must take care of each other.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the small group meetings will not be held in a set location. The twelve members of the small group can decide where to hold the next meeting. For example, if the meeting is in a brother&rsquo;s home, everyone can fellowship concerning the location of the next meeting. The meetings can be held in any of the homes of the saints in the small group. If you do not have enough chairs in your home, you should not be troubled; it is all right for the saints to sit on the floor. The homes in Taiwan are all very elegant, even the floors are very clean, so it is not bad for saints to sit on the floor. The important thing is that there can be a place to meet. If every home takes turns to have the meeting, everyone will bear responsibility, and the small groups will be a success.</p><h2 class="head2">Leading and Managing the Small Groups</h2>
<p>The church in Taipei of approximately six hundred saints has been formed into districts by joining fifty or so small groups together. If we want the condition of every small group to be the same, every saint to be equal, and every household to be alike, the co-workers need to advance this practice among the saints. The full-time co-workers are not here to lead the groups. They should exercise to advance the practice of the groups in every district. Every district probably needs four to six co-workers.</p>
<p>Before the full-time co-workers encourage the saints to be in the group meetings, there is a need for training. We now have saints who have consecrated themselves to serve full time. They can be compared to newly recruited soldiers who need training. We cannot arm newly recruited soldiers with rifles and send them off to war without training them. If they do not know how to hold their weapons properly, they will lose whatever battles they fight. Hence, we need to plan a training program so that we can train the saints, just as soldiers are trained. We need to train the saints in such things as how to use the Bible, how to speak the word, and how to care for people. All these matters require training. The church in Taipei has already been divided into more than four hundred small groups. These groups can be formed into eight districts of approximately fifty groups each. If every district should have four co-workers, we need at least thirty-two co-workers. These co-workers must serve full time; otherwise, they will not have the time to encourage the saints to practice the group meetings.</p>
<p>The full-time co-workers should bring &ldquo;business&rdquo; to the fifty small groups in a district. A co-worker can be compared to a manager who is over several stores. If the stores do not make a profit, it would be better for them to shut their doors. The full-time co-workers must bring &ldquo;business&rdquo; to the small groups.</p>
<p>Even though every group meeting is coordinated by the saints, if they do not know what to do when they come together, they will sit and look at one another. Someone may eventually suggest that they sing a hymn, but the saints do not know which hymn to sing. After two or three of such meetings, I am afraid that the coordinators will be absent from the meetings; the saints will not come, because they will feel that such meetings are a waste of time. For this reason, the co-workers need to give the saints &ldquo;business&rdquo; and help them run their meetings.</p>
<p>The co-workers can gather the six hundred saints and tell them what to do in a group meeting. We must encourage the saints not to worry but to invite people to the group meetings. We should tell them that we guarantee that everyone will be fed. Of course, we cannot merely say these things without keeping our promise. Every co-worker must prepare material to help the saints do business. For this reason, it is a great responsibility to form the small groups. The co-workers should train the full-time serving ones by having them serve with them. The co-workers can be compared to leaders in an army, who lead the soldiers in their squads. The squad leaders must take the lead to do things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Encouraging the Service of the Small Groups</h2>
<p>The co-workers who help the small groups in the districts should encourage all the saints until every household is preaching the gospel and every saint is serving and functioning. This type of encouraging requires some ability. If after one year of serving a co-worker is unable to help the saints in this way, we should consider whether or not he should continue to serve full time.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s society, people who work for corporations must be competitive and do their best to improve; otherwise, they will not have a future. Even preachers hired in denominations are under a contract system. Those who are employed by contract must produce results; otherwise, when their contract expires, their employer will not hire them again. The full-timers among us should not think that they have a secure job or that they do not need to improve. This is not appropriate.</p>
<p>Doctors in America must take an exam at least once every two years. Even if they have their own clinics, they still have to take an exam. If they do not pass, they lose their license. Even if they have been practicing medicine for more than twenty-five years, they must still take an exam. This is because medicine in America is improving daily. One&rsquo;s experience is not the sole basis of his qualification. Even a doctor who graduates from a famous medical school must keep up with the advances in medicine. Furthermore, numerous government agencies in America hold examinations for their employees every few years. If an employee cannot pass the examination, he will not get a promotion, and he might even lose his job. Therefore, the ones preparing to serve full time must be trained, and after they have served for some time, they should be tested. They will be tested on their performance in the training and on the effectiveness and result of their service.</p>
<p>Some saints might ask whether it is scriptural to do such things and whether Paul ever gave Timothy a test. Several verses indicate that Paul expected those who served with him to be effective (1 Tim. 3:15; 4:15; 6:14, 20; 2 Tim. 2:2-7; 3:10, 14). On one hand, we need to be trained, and on the other hand, we need some testing. People should not need to feel a whip before they make progress. There are many things for the full-timers to do. Two to three hundred full-timers might not be enough to encourage the saints who meet regularly in the church in Taipei to function.</p><h2 class="head2">Recovering the Dormant Ones</h2>
<p>The condition of the church in Taipei shows that the greatest need in the work in encouraging the small groups is to recover the dormant saints. The business office has gone through the name lists and made a list of the dormant brothers and sisters. We will give this list to the small groups according to their addresses. For example, there are some dormant saints who live close to group #2. They are neighbors, so the members of group #2 should go to visit them. Other dormant brothers and sisters live near group #9, so the brothers and sisters of that group should take care of them. The first responsibility of every group is to recover the dormant brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>We cannot rely merely on the brothers and sisters in the groups to take care of this; we must also depend on the full-time co-workers. As the co-workers are encouraging the small groups, they should give the brothers and sisters in the groups a list of the dormant saints who are in their neighborhood. The co-workers should encourage the brothers and sisters to find the time and the way to recover the dormant saints. The full-timers should help the groups and encourage them to contact the dormant saints. The saints can call the dormant ones and invite them to a meal for fellowship. We should not speak to the dormant saints about the meetings; we should first think of ways to warm them up.</p>
<p>Recovering the dormant brothers and sisters is a tremendous matter. We have a list with eleven thousand names but only five thousand saints meet regularly. There are six thousand saints who stay at home. If we can work on recovering the ones at home, we will be able to recover at least three thousand saints by next summer. This means that the number of saints in our meetings will increase from five thousand to eight thousand. We might not be able to recover one hundred percent of the dormant ones, but we should be able to recover two-thirds of them. If we can recover four thousand out of the six thousand dormant saints, our work will have been effective.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Encouraging the Preaching of the Gospel<br />
in All the Households</h2>
<p>We must also encourage all the households to preach the gospel. We must especially encourage gospel meetings in the homes of dormant saints. Some may think that this is hard to accomplish. How can we preach the gospel in the homes of dormant saints? The full-time co-workers should help the saints to encourage the dormant ones to open their homes for the gospel. According to my experience and observation, the best way to recover a dormant saint is to preach the gospel in his home.</p>
<p>For a dormant saint to be recovered into the church life, we should not only hold a gospel meeting in his home; rather, we should ask him to preach the gospel message. He might say that he has no way to give a message, because he has not been in the meetings for five years. Even though he has not been in the meetings for five years, he has been saved for more than five years, he has some experiences of salvation, and he loves the Lord. He can give a gospel testimony and tell others about his experience of salvation.</p>
<p>He might insist that he does not have anything to say, but we should encourage him to speak concerning how he was saved and about his present love for the Lord. Once he starts to speak, he might become more fervent, and he may even shed tears as he speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s grace to him. After he speaks such a word, he will not be able to sleep at night, and the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum will come to him. When the wind and the cloud come, he will become a &ldquo;man of wind and cloud,&rdquo; and his home will become a &ldquo;home of wind and cloud.&rdquo; As a result, he and his family will be recovered. If we will be earnest in having the dormant saints preach the gospel, at least seventy percent of them will be recovered. This is the best and quickest method.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when we go to recover the dormant households, we should not speak to the brothers, because they have their dignity. They may be embarrassed because they have not been in the meetings for many years. We should, therefore, begin with the sisters. This means that first the sisters should visit the households, not the brothers. The co-workers must encourage the sisters to visit the households. It is easier for a sister to soften the hearts of the sisters. Once we gain the sisters, it will not be difficult to gain their husbands. Almost every husband follows his wife. Hence, we should not be afraid; as long as we have faith and boldly go through the door of the sisters, we will be able to gain the dormant household.</p>
<p>The co-workers must exercise wisdom. Sometimes a sister is hard, and it is not easy to contact her. In such a situation, we can go through their children and lay a foundation with the children. Then the children become a net to catch their parents. In most families, the husbands follow the wives, and the parents follow the children. The parents will not follow the children to do evil things, but when the children do something positive, the parents will follow them. If the children are recovered, the father will consider the effect that his not being in the meetings has had on his children. He will be encouraged to meet with the saints since his children have been blessed and God has shown mercy on his household. In such circumstances, it will be almost impossible for the father not to be recovered.</p><h2 class="head2">Encouraging Everyone to Function</h2>
<p>Our goal is not merely to draw people to the meetings. That is not the purpose of our work. The full-time co-workers must be trained, and they must pray much when they go to help the saints enter into their function. The co-workers must pray for more than half an hour every day; it is best if they can pray for an hour or more every day. We need to pray desperately for every family that we are responsible for, and we must pray for every saint by name. Then according to the burden that we receive from the Lord, we should go to care for and encourage the saints one by one until they begin to function in their service. Then every saint will be an apostle, and they will be a prophet and a teacher.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:28 says that God has given the church first apostles, second prophets, and third teachers. I would ask: Are you an apostle, a prophet, or a teacher? You might think that you are not qualified and that you are neither an apostle nor a prophet nor a teacher. We need a change in concept. If you preach the gospel to your unsaved parents, you are an apostle. An apostle is a sent one. When the Lord sends you to preach the gospel to your unsaved parents, you are an apostle. After your parents believe, and you go to them with words of building up, encouragement, and comfort, you are a prophet. When you are sent to preach the gospel, you are an apostle; when you prophesy for the Lord to encourage others, you are a prophet. Later, when you teach them something further, you are a teacher. You should not despise yourself; in the church you can be an apostle, a prophet, and a teacher. It would be wonderful for all five thousand brothers and sisters who meet regularly in the church in Taipei to be first apostles, then prophets, and then teachers. The church in Taipei would have five thousand saints who are apostles, prophets, and teachers. Then there would be hope for the spread and increase of the church.</p>
<p>This is the teaching in the Bible. But since Christians have completely lost this matter, they think that they are not apostles or prophets or teachers. Consequently, they hire pastors and preachers to be their apostles, prophets, and teachers. This is an error. We must encourage everyone to function. The thought in Christianity is that every responsibility must be given to an expert in that profession. For example, one can be a medical doctor only if he has studied medicine, and only those who study other professions can practice those professions. Christianity thinks that preaching the word is a profession, so if a person has never studied in a seminary and has not been educated in the knowledge of the Bible, he cannot be a preacher. When this is the case, the function of the saints is annulled.</p>
<p>A Christian who graduates from seminary and who is hired by a congregation to be their pastor and preacher does everything. Only he acts as an apostle, prophet, and teacher. This results in all the saints in that congregation being unemployed, and it annuls their organic function. This kills the function of the members of the Body of Christ, and it is most offensive to the Lord. This is not the practice in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, because we want to perfect the saints who are not apostles to be apostles and to perfect the saints who are not prophets to be prophets and to perfect the saints who are not teachers to be teachers. This is what the co-workers must do. They must go out to create apostles, produce prophets, and perfect the saints to be teachers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Encouraging Everyone to Study the Truth</h2>
<p>In order to be apostles, prophets, and teachers, we need to study the truth. If we say that we are apostles, prophets, and teachers but cannot speak the truth, we are just pretending. There are many experienced saints among us, but they cannot accurately explain the names <em>Jesus</em> and <em>Christ.</em> We must study the truth if we are to go out as apostles, prophets, and teachers.</p>
<p>Even though the churches abroad speak highly of the church in Taipei, the church in Taipei is not yet up to the standard. There are many young people among us who cannot clearly speak the truth. In order to be apostles, prophets, and teachers, we must understand the truth. This is the main responsibility of the full-time co-workers. We need many full-time serving ones, because the earth is covered in darkness. People everywhere are blind and groping in the darkness. However, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we are full of light and the truth. There is a need for many to go out to different places and preach the truth. The full-time serving ones do not need to go out to preach; instead, they should encourage and perfect every brother and sister to go out to speak. If the co-workers can do this, there will be a rich result.</p><h2 class="head2">Seizing the Opportunity<br />
to Encourage the Spread of the Lord&rsquo;s Work</h2>
<p>Taipei has a population of almost two million. It has a convenient transportation system, a highly educated populace, sufficient economic strength, and good public security. In addition to these things, the church here has several thousand saints who meet regularly. We cannot afford to lose this tremendous opportunity to spread. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and we should seize this opportunity to do business for the Lord&rsquo;s interests. The way to do business is to begin with the small groups as the basic level. We should use the small groups to encourage every household to function, to recover the dormant saints, and to open their homes to preach the gospel. Everyone has extended family, neighbors, classmates, colleagues, and friends who are not saved. Two million fish are swimming around us every day. So why do we not go out to catch these fish? We are five thousand fishermen. Why do we not catch fish? We need to wake up and go out to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>We must remember that one day we will all stand before the Lord. How will we give an account of ourselves, if our hands are empty? <em>Hymns,</em> #930 says, &ldquo;&lsquo;Must I go and empty-handed,&rsquo; / Thus my dear Redeemer meet? / Not one day of service give Him, / Lay no trophy at His feet?&rdquo; This hymn gives a vivid description of how pricked our hearts should feel. We should not wait for others to ask whether our friends and relatives are saved. I am afraid that when God asks us, even the angels will condemn us. This understanding will change our living. In the past we had our friends and relatives over for dinner and politely laughed and conversed with them, but we never preached the gospel to them. How can we repay our debt of the gospel to them?</p>
<p>Paul said that he was a debtor both to Gentiles and to barbarians (Rom. 1:14). How can we justify working with our colleagues at the office for five days a week, fifty-two weeks a year, and yet not preach the gospel to them? If we have this view, we would all repent and confess to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me; I am a debtor to too many people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great American evangelist, Mr. Moody, determined that he would preach the gospel to at least one person every day. One day as he was getting ready for bed, he suddenly remembered that he had not preached the gospel to anyone that day. So he got dressed and went outside. It was the middle of the night, and he could not find anyone except for a policeman standing at the street corner. Mr. Moody went to the policeman and said, &ldquo;Mr. Policeman, you must believe in Jesus.&rdquo; The policeman was both amused and angry because he felt that anyone who would go out in the middle of the night to persuade people to believe in Jesus had to be crazy. He said, &ldquo;Go back home quickly. How is it your business whether or not I believe in Jesus?&rdquo; Later, after the policeman went home, the Holy Spirit worked in him, and he had no peace. The next day he went around asking about a man who preached the gospel. He finally found Mr. Moody. The two of them had a conversation, and the policeman got saved.</p>
<p>If we would preach the gospel in this way, it would be equivalent to having five thousand Mr. Moody&rsquo;s. Who knows how many people we would bring to salvation? This depends on the leading at the basic level, that is, the leading in the small groups, where the co-workers encourage and perfect the saints. May all the saints make this their goal, by praying and following in one accord. Then the church in Taipei will increase, spread, and have a glorious future.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY FOR THE CHURCHES<br />
IN TAIWAN TO GO ON</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You, and we humble our hearts before You. We look to You. We bow before You and confess that we are small and incapable. Lord, the entire church is seeking You, waiting on You, and expecting You to appear to us. Speak to every one of us in our hearts. We do not want to be in outward activities without touching You. Lord, we give ourselves to You. We thank You that You are all our offerings. We are joined to You, and we lay our hands on You as our burnt offering.</p>
<p>Lord, we ask You to spread within us, to gain more room within us, and be glorified in us. We seek You for the churches in Taiwan and for Your glorious recovery. Remember, Lord, that this is Your move and Your testimony. Have mercy on us that we would be able to keep up with You.</p>
<p>Lord, take us forward to pray for Your churches and for all the saints so that none of us would miss Your grace or lose Your presence. Cause us to live in Your presence every minute and even every second. Cause us to be in the reality of daily living one spirit with You. The greatest fact in the universe is that we are one spirit with You. May even the youngest among us experience this fact. We testify to the universe that we are one spirit with the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and reigning Christ. We have received grace to say that for us, to live is Christ.</p>
<p>Lord, supply us with grace every minute and every second so that we can live You every day to be Your testimony on this island. Make us Your witnesses. We praise You as the essential Spirit who transforms us inwardly and as the economical Spirit who anoints us without. Grant us to be filled with You inwardly and outwardly so that You would be our reality in everything. Open the heavens to us and make our sky bright and transparent. May we see the throne. We want to touch Your throne and be connected to Your throne. We want all of our activities to be under the throne and under its direction. Lord, You charged us to go to disciple all the nations because all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to You.</p>
<p>Lord, we worship You. You are our Head, and You are also the Head of all things to the church. As the Head, You are for us and with us. We testify to the heavens and to the earth that we are for You and unto You. We honor You as the supreme Being and exalt You as Lord. Bless Your church. Bless this country for the sake of Your gospel and Your truth. Be glorified so that all men will know that Jesus is Lord. May every knee bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord. We give all the glory in heaven and on earth to You. We announce to the universe that You are our Lord, our Savior, and our Head. We worship You, we serve You, we love You, we exalt You, and we live You every day. You are our all in all. May all love and praise be to Your honorable name. Amen.</p>
<p>In the preceding message we spoke about every home being open for the gospel. From now on our focus will be to open not only the homes of the strong saints but also the homes of the weaker saints and of the dormant saints. We look to the Lord&rsquo;s grace to lead us in life and to cause us to rise up corporately so that every household would be for the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CAMPUS WORK</h2>
<p>This is an age of education. In Taipei alone there are at least four to five thousand students in junior high school, high school, technical college, university, and graduate school. These campuses are fishing ponds for the gospel. There are also many brothers and sisters who are on these campuses either as students or as teachers and professors. This environment has been arranged by the Lord, and it gives us the best opportunity to gain the young students. We need to cooperate with the Lord&rsquo;s work and preach His gospel to students before they enter society, that is, while they are still being educated in school.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that man has three parts: spirit, soul, and body. However, today&rsquo;s society cares only for the body and the soul. The Olympic games are good, but they are good only for the physical body. The educational system cares only for the soul within man, paying particular attention to the mind within the soul. However, no one pays attention to the spirit of man, his innermost part. Therefore, when the church preaches the gospel, it focuses on the spirit of man. We thank the Lord for giving us the opportunity to edify the young ones and to enable them to be complete. They need not only a strong body and a healthy soul but also a proper spirit.</p>
<p>The young people need God. If they never receive the Lord&rsquo;s gospel or hear the Lord&rsquo;s truth, the center of their human existence will not be strong. It is our responsibility that they hear the truth. We must pick up this responsibility and go to every junior high school, high school, technical college, university, and graduate school to ensure that the young people have the opportunity to know the Lord&rsquo;s truth and receive His gospel while they are receiving their education. We must consecrate the entire church to the Lord for the campus work.</p>
<p>We would welcome any young saint, especially between the ages of twenty and thirty-five, who can join the campus work. We hope that all the young brothers and sisters will consecrate themselves to the Lord and to the church after they graduate from college and give a minimum of two years in full-time service for the Lord&rsquo;s work. During these two years they would be trained in reading the Bible, and they would also go out to the campuses to contact students and lead them to salvation. They would also serve the Lord in the church. After the two years of training, they will be able to see how the Lord is leading them.</p>
<p>If the Lord will give us such grace, after the university and college students among us fulfill their military service requirements, they can give two years to God as a kind of firstfruit for the Lord&rsquo;s church. On the one hand, they will equip themselves in the truth by spending four hours every morning to get into the Word and receive help from the Life-study messages. On the other hand, they will spend time in the afternoons to pray and to contact people for the gospel, especially on the campuses. We believe that through these young brothers and sisters, the Lord will bless the students on the campuses. In order to advance the campus work, we will also need some experienced co-workers to take the lead in the campus work. They should be led by the Lord and do business for Him through the furtherance of the gospel at the universities, technical colleges, high schools, and junior high schools.</p>
<p>We worship the Lord that the environment and situation on the island of Taiwan are favorable to the campus gospel work. The people enjoy freedom, transportation and communication are convenient, the level of education is high, the economy is good, society is peaceful, and people&rsquo;s hearts here are wide open. This provides us with an excellent opportunity. If you are not able to give your entire life to be full time for the Lord, you can give at least the first two years after you graduate from college. You can offer them as your firstfruit to God. During those two years, God will perfect you and will manifest something in you. In this way, you will know what to do with your future.</p>
<p>There are nearly six hundred brothers and sisters all over Taiwan who have decided to serve the Lord full time. Most of them are young people, and a few of them still need to complete their education. This is the Lord&rsquo;s grace. However, this number is not enough to be able to send saints to all the campuses in Taiwan. Hence, we must receive a burden and pray. We must receive the Lord&rsquo;s leading to participate in this matter.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>Among the saints in Taipei there are at least several thousand household units, and all of these households have children. When we say children, we are referring to young people between the ages of six and twelve, that is, elementary school students from first through sixth grade. We believe that there are more than two thousand children of this age group among us. There are also many children in the households of our neighbors, friends, relatives, colleagues, and classmates. We should not do a work merely among the children in the church. Our work must include the children outside the church. This is the children&rsquo;s gospel work. The inhabitants of this island would be happy for their children to know the Lord&rsquo;s truth and gain genuine benefits. This is a great matter, and we must do our best to promote it. By next summer, or at the latest by the end of next year, the church in Taipei can have at least five thousand children who are under the teaching of the brothers and sisters and who are listening to the truth every week.</p>
<p>We might have only one thousand children, but we hope that after one year or less we can have five thousand children. The children who are presently six years old will graduate from college in sixteen years, and the children who are twelve years old will graduate from college in ten years. If we continue the children&rsquo;s work, we will be unable to estimate the long-term results. After the children are saved and graduate from elementary school, they will be gospel seeds in junior high school; after they graduate from junior high school, they will be gospel seeds in high school; and after they graduate from high school, they will be gospel seeds in college. If we labor on the children, our numbers will continually grow. We believe that if we start with five thousand children and continue this work for fifteen or sixteen years, more than ten or twenty thousand young people will be brought in as a result of the children&rsquo;s work. That is a significant number.</p>
<p>The ones who are saved through our young people will be both stable and remaining, because they will have heard the gospel in their youth and would continue to hear the truth until they graduate from college. Upon their graduation from college, they will be a group of young Christians who are cultivated in and equipped with the truth. Therefore, this is a great and important work. May many brothers and sisters, including the students and especially those in college, give themselves to the Lord, and may they have a desire to bear the responsibility to serve in the children&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>It is not enough to have children&rsquo;s meetings merely in the meeting halls. We need more brothers and sisters who are willing to open their homes. There should not be too many children in one meeting. At the most, there should be twenty to twenty-five children meeting in a saint&rsquo;s home. Furthermore, the children&rsquo;s meetings do not have to be only on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. If we have them on Saturday or any other day of the week, every district will have many homes for the children&rsquo;s meetings every week. If our goal is to gain five thousand children, we need two hundred fifty children&rsquo;s meetings. If every meeting has twenty children, there will be five thousand children in two hundred and fifty meetings. It would be wonderful if these meetings were in the homes of the saints and in the meeting halls.</p>
<p>We also need a group of brothers and sisters to teach the children. Every meeting would need three brothers and sisters as teachers. If there are two hundred fifty meetings, we immediately need seven hundred fifty college-age brothers and sisters to bear this responsibility. The saints need to be encouraged so that the teaching is done in a manner that is rich, living, and high. We will certainly be able to bring in excellent material through the gospel in the children&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE COMMUNITY GOSPEL WORK</h2>
<p>Our brothers and sisters are at all levels of society. They work in every profession, in companies, in hospitals, and in government offices. These saints should endeavor to bear the work of the gospel. The community gospel is another great work that requires the help of the full-time co-workers to promote it and to be involved in it.</p>
<p>I hope that all the churches in Taiwan, regardless of their size, will divide into small groups. Through the small groups we will recover the dormant saints and preach the gospel in the community from house to house. We will also begin the campus work and the children&rsquo;s work. If we are faithful and work together to carry out these matters and accomplish them, I believe that within half a year twenty thousand brothers and sisters on the island of Taiwan will be going on positively in a church life that involves recovering the dormant saints and gaining new ones.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING EQUIPPED WITH THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>We must equip ourselves with the truth. This will cause us to gradually be cultivated in the truth. In the past we went to meetings and listened to messages, and we also read spiritual books. But we were not cultivated in the truth. The full-timers and all the saints in all the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery need to give themselves to be equipped with the truth.</p>
<p>The Recovery Version of the New Testament in Chinese with footnotes and cross references will soon be ready for publication. The Life-study of all twenty-seven books of the New Testament will also be ready for publication. We want the Recovery Version of the New Testament to be printed in different sizes so that the Bible and the Life-studies can be in every corner of the saints homes: on their coffee tables, in their kitchens, and even in the bathrooms. We must use the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the Life-studies to equip ourselves with the truth so that we are in spirit with a sober mind. We should have a Life-study and the Recovery Version of the New Testament in our hands at all times and in all places. We must encourage the saints in this practice.</p>
<p>We have spent eleven years speaking on all twenty-seven books of the New Testament in the summer and winter trainings. After these trainings we spoke on the conclusion to the New Testament. Our Life-study messages now have at least twelve hundred messages. On the average, every message is approximately ten pages long. This means there are a total of at least twelve thousand pages.</p>
<p>If we could spend four hours every day to study the Recovery Version of the New Testament with the footnotes and the cross references and also study the Life-studies, we would complete the New Testament in two years. If we can spend only two hours a day to study, it will take us four years to complete the New Testament. If we can spend one hour a day, it will take us eight years. If we can spend only half an hour a day, it will take us sixteen years. Regardless of our situation, we can all spend at least half an hour every day to study the New Testament. In the two years that the college graduates give to the Lord, they will spend four hours every morning to read the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the Life-studies. If they can complete this study in two years, it will be a tremendous gain. The rest of us must do our best to spend two hours a day and complete the New Testament in four years. If we cannot find two hours during the day, then we should spend one hour a day and complete the New Testament in eight years. May we all be diligent to equip ourselves with the truth. This is a great matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Truth Being the Gospel,<br />
and the Gospel Being the Truth</h2>
<p>Some people think that the truth is separate from the gospel, but this is not the case. The Bible says that the truth is the gospel and that the gospel is the truth. In Ephesians 1:13 Paul says, &ldquo;In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation.&rdquo; This verse shows that the word of the truth is the gospel.</p>
<p>There are a total of sixteen chapters in Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the Romans. In the first verse of chapter 1 Paul says that he was separated unto the gospel of God. Then in verses 14 and 15 he says that he owed the gospel as a debt to all people and was endeavoring to announce the gospel to those who were in Rome. The gospel in these verses refers to the book of Romans. The entire book of Romans, from chapter 1 to chapter 16, consists only of the gospel. At the end of this book, in chapter 16, the main subject is the local churches. If we carefully read the book of Romans, we will see that Romans 1 speaks of sinners, who are wicked, dark, defiled, and vicious. However, by Romans 16 these people have become believers in the local churches.</p>
<p>The subject of Romans 16 is the church. But this does not refer to the universal church. It refers to the local churches. In this book of the gospel, Paul speaks of the church in Cenchrea and highly recommends a sister named Phoebe, who was a deaconess there. Then he recommends Prisca and Aquila, a couple. When they were in Rome, the church that was there met in their home, and when they were in Ephesus, the church that was there met in their home. Paul says that this couple risked their necks for his life, and that he and all the churches of the Gentiles give thanks to them. Paul also greets the church in their home (vv. 3-5). Then he speaks of all the churches of Christ (v. 16). Thus, in Romans 16 we see the local churches.</p>
<p>In Romans 4 we see justification, and in Romans 8 we see sanctification and the deeper, mysterious truth of the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man. This is the central point of chapter 8, and it is also the center of the gospel. The gospel we preach must attain to this height. Even though the entire book of Romans is the gospel, it does not speak of going to hell or of going to heaven. When we compare the book of Romans to the gospel preached by most believers in Christianity, we see that there is a great contrast. The gospel preached by Christians today is either concerning escaping hell and going to heaven or concerning material blessings. It is difficult to gain people who have been taught such a gospel.</p>
<p>An educated person has his own way of thinking and his own philosophy, which are usually based on his inward condition, that is, the condition of his human life. Most young people graduate from junior high school by the time they are fifteen years old, and they then begin to consider the meaning of human life. What is human life? What is the purpose of human life? Where will they go in the future? What is the goal of their human life? These questions indicate the beginning of their personal philosophy. The thirst to find out the depths of human existence cannot be satisfied with the gospel of escaping hell to go to heaven or the gospel of material prosperity. Such gospels are looked upon as superstition.</p>
<p>If we speak the truths of Bible to the young people, just as Paul spoke the truth, and tell them that the Triune God desires to dispense Himself into the tripartite man, I believe that their eyes will be opened. If we can speak logically and clearly, we will bring the heavens to the earth and the earth into the heavens, and they will be moved. For example, when we go to contact the students on the campuses, we should preach the truths in Romans 8 to them. Whether or not they understand these truths depends entirely on our speaking. When people do not understand our preaching, the problem is that we did not speak logically. It is not that they are unable to understand but that we are unable to explain.</p>
<p>In every nationality children learn to speak by listening to what they do not understand. After hearing the same words many times, they begin to understand them. This is the way elementary students are educated in America, where elementary school students are taught to use computers. Children who are eight and nine years old understand the language of computers. They play games on the computer so frequently that they can often figure things out without a teacher. This proves that we must change our concept. When we preached the gospel in the past, we told people that if they believed in Jesus, they would go to heaven. It was very good for them to believe in Jesus. When they were sick, we told them to pray to the Lord and He would heal them. When a person&rsquo;s business was not going well, we would tell his entire family to believe in Jesus so that his business would do better. We would also tell a family that if they believed in Jesus and prayed to Him daily, their children would get into the best university. What kind of gospel was this? It was a gospel of superstition.</p>
<p>The divine truths in the Bible are higher than any philosophy. However, most Christians have not equipped themselves with this book of truths. Even saints among us, including some who have been co-workers for many years, have never studied the Bible or the New Testament, much less the fourteen Epistles of Paul. Some of the co-workers have been serving full-time for more than thirty years, preaching the gospel and teaching the truth, but they are inadequately equipped with the truth, because they have never adequately gotten into the fourteen Epistles of Paul.</p>
<p>Such a situation of not being equipped with the truth is a shame to the Lord. The Lord left us with His Word, and printing has made the Bible available and widespread. Moreover, the Bible has been translated into every language. But we still have not spent much time to get into the Bible. This is a shame to us. When believers in Christianity preach the gospel, they frequently use John 3:16: &ldquo;God so loved the world.&rdquo; They say that all persons in the world have committed sin and are going to hell, but because God loves us, He sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to save us. This, to some believers, is the gospel according to John 3:16.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John, however, begins by introducing the Word, saying, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word&rdquo; (1:1). Suppose I hold a large gospel meeting to which everyone has invited their friends and relatives. Then I say, &ldquo;Friends, in the beginning was the Word.&rdquo; I believe that everyone would shake their heads in disapproval because that would be teaching people to research the Bible. How could their friends and relatives understand <em>in the beginning</em>? Eighty or ninety percent of the saints would not agree with my preaching the gospel in this way. But if I say, &ldquo;Dear friends, I want to tell you that God so loved the world, and we are all sinners...,&rdquo; everyone would nod their heads in approval and compliment me for being a good gospel preacher. The disapproval and approval are our natural concepts. John did not preach like this. John began by saying, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...In Him was life, and the life was the light of men...And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality...For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace...No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&rdquo; (1:1, 4, 14, 16, 18). This gospel is the high gospel.</p>
<p>Who among Christians today speaks such a high gospel? The gospel of God&rsquo;s economy is very high, but when we preach, we make the gospel something low because we ourselves do not understand what <em>in the beginning</em> means. How can we complain that others do not understand if we do not understand? People do not receive what we speak, because we, the speakers, have a problem. God created man with a mind that is able to understand and with a spirit that is able to apprehend. If we speak clearly to people and speak to their spirit, they will be able to understand.</p><h2 class="head2">Equipping Ourselves with the Truth</h2>
<p>We must equip ourselves with the truth. Then the saints in the churches will be like the children of an educated family. When they open their mouths, the truth will flow out, and when they go out to preach the gospel, they will speak the truth. If the young people among us speak the truth of Romans 8:1-13 to their parents, telling them that the Triune God is dispensing Himself into the tripartite man, I believe that their parents will be moved. We should not be afraid that they will not understand us. If we understand the truth, others will understand what we speak to them.</p>
<p>When we understand the truth, we should discuss the truth with other saints instead of talking about the weather and politics. We should be steeped in the truth and equipped with the truth to the extent that we breathe the truth, eat the truth, and live the truth. Our entire being should be full of the truth, and our conversation with other saints should be nothing other than the truth. Our friends and relatives should hear only the truth out of our mouths. Then after a period of time, they will understand what they could not receive at first, and the truth will enter into them. America has many immigrant Chinese families with elderly men and women who did not understand English when they immigrated. However, since their grandchildren speak English, the grandparents gradually learn to speak English, because they hear it every day.</p>
<p>For the sake of the gospel in our homes, on the campuses, to the children, and in the communities, we must cultivate the habit of speaking the truth. Our gospel is to speak the truth. If we speak the truth in our homes, our friends and relatives will hear the truth when they are in our homes. If this is our situation, how can the gospel fail to spread? We should not be afraid of having nothing to say; there are too many things to speak about. The Life-study of the New Testament contains more than twelve hundred messages and over twelve thousand pages. We also have the Recovery Version of the New Testament with its footnotes. Many treasures are buried in these pages, and the truth they contain is rich.</p>
<p>Every family and every saint must get into the Recovery Version of the New Testament to equip themselves with the truth. This will enable the truth to saturate us, and it will cause us to be filled with the truth. When we are soaked with the truth, we will be able to preach the gospel in our homes, on the campuses, to the children, and in the communities, and the Lord will have a way among us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FEW PRACTICAL POINTS</h2>
<p>We would now like to fellowship concerning a few practical points. First, we hope the brothers and sisters understand that the way that the Lord has given us requires every saint to be practically involved in serving Him. Every one of us is a part of the church, even if we are the weakest or the smallest member. Furthermore, we should be willing to receive help in order to serve the Lord. We all must serve.</p>
<p>Second, we do not need everyone to be full time, but we must all learn to redeem the time (Eph. 5:16). We must also present our bodies (Rom. 12:1). We must all redeem the time and present our bodies. The Lord has given every one of us a different situation. Some of us must work in a profession, as nurses, doctors, teachers, professors, or clerks, to earn a living and support our families. This is proper. Some of us run our own businesses in order to support our families. This is also proper. No matter what our situation is, we must arrange our time so that every day and every week and every month we have the time to present our bodies to the Lord for His use. We might spend one hour every week visiting people, or we can invite our friends and relatives to our home one evening every week and lead our family to preach the gospel to them. This is what it means to redeem the time and to present our bodies. This is very practical, and I hope that we will all enter into it.</p>
<p>The third point concerns finances and material offerings. We do not want to set up an organization to support the needs of the full-time serving ones. Those who serve full time in the local churches serve and work for the Lord. The locality where they live should support them. For example, the church in Kaohsiung should support the full-time serving ones in the area around Kaohsiung; the church in Taichung should support those who serve in the area around Taichung; the church in Keelung should support those who serve in the area around Keelung; the church in Taipei should support those who serve in the area around Taipei; and the church in Hualien should support those who serve in the area around Hualien. Then we will not need a special group of saints to look after this matter. It will also be more convenient for the brothers and sisters to give material offerings. The brothers and sisters who have a heart for the full-time serving ones can give their offerings to the church in their locality. They can indicate on the envelope that the offering is for the brothers and sisters who serve full time. Even if it is not indicated on an envelope, the church can use the offering to take care of the full-time serving ones.</p>
<p>We need to realize that once the full-time brothers and sisters begin to serve, there will be a greater need for material offerings in order to support them. There will also be more saints encouraging the various activities of the church, and their work will produce results. This means our numbers will increase, and when our numbers increase, there will be the need for more meeting halls. Taipei has twenty-one meeting halls. Even if every meeting hall is packed, we would be able to seat only a little more than eight thousand saints. At present, there are only five thousand saints meeting in the church in Taipei, but we hope that by next year we will have recovered more than three thousand of the dormant saints. We will also gain new ones. Therefore, our numbers will reach almost eight thousand. The twenty-one meeting halls will not be able to hold everyone. Some saints have suggested that we divide every meeting hall into two groups, and we would have one group meet in the morning and the other group in the afternoon. However, this is not good for the long-term. If our numbers continue to increase, dividing into two groups will not be adequate. There will be a need for us to increase the number of meeting halls.</p>
<p>In any industrialized country with a growing economy, land and buildings are expensive. This is the case in Taiwan. We must therefore make plans. We will need a large amount of offerings. We must all coordinate together concerning the offerings and concerning the arrangements. The elders and the serving ones must have a long-term view. They must also observe how society is developing and note the locations that will be suitable for meeting halls. This will require many saints, a large amount of material offerings, and much preparation. The brothers and sisters need a heart that is willing to offer up everything to the Lord. Then our way will be prosperous in the Lord.</p>
<p>If a locality has more offerings than it can use, the saints can give the extra funds to make up the lack in other localities so that the local churches care for one another in the matter of finances. In this way there will be no &ldquo;dead&rdquo; money among us. In other words, our money should be living and flowing. Our finances should flow from the brothers and sisters to their churches; it must also flow to other localities and to the churches all over the earth. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery today has spread to all five continents of the world. Numerous countries in Africa, Germany in Europe, and many other areas need help financially.</p>
<p>We are on the earth today for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in this age. The earth has become like a small village in which every country and major region are closely related. We thank the Lord that by His blessing and mercy, Taiwan is economically developed. Because we are under this blessing and we love the Lord, we should give more material offerings. We must give our offerings to the local church in the locality where we reside. If we live in a city, we give our offerings to the church in that city, and the church will distribute the offerings. Most of the offerings will be used to support the full-timers, to spread the gospel, and to build meeting halls. If a locality cannot use all the offerings it receives, it can care for other localities. If the churches in a country cannot use all the offerings they receive, they can care for the churches in other countries. All our circumstances are under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing; we should seize the opportunity to labor under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing and arrange for the spread of His testimony on the earth.</p>
<p>May we all pray and fellowship with the Lord so that we can act according to the Lord&rsquo;s operation. If we rise up, then after five to ten years we will be able to praise the Lord, and the condition of the churches will be clearly manifested. I hope that the brothers and sisters will receive this fellowship and burden and go before the Lord concerning this move. We must pray much before Him for the sake of His testimony.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING CONCERNING<br />
THE FULL-TIME SERVING ONES</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we are still natural and in the old creation; we are even in the self and in the flesh. We need Your cleansing. We take You as our sin offering and as our trespass offering. We thank You for Your redeeming blood, which cleanses us and keeps us in constant fellowship with You. We have received Your mercy and Your grace not for our own work nor for our own future nor for our own living. Your mercy and Your grace are for You, for Your interest on the earth, and for Your move on the earth.</p>
<p>Lord, we worship You from the depths of our being for choosing us before the foundation of the world and for setting us apart. You called us in time, and You gathered us together. We look to You and beseech You to save us from our natural man, from our natural zeal, from our concepts, from our religious thoughts, and even from our natural, pious ideas. Lord, save us from our hidden self and from our self in disguise.</p>
<p>We are not here learning ways and methods. We are here because we want to know You and Your ways. Lord, open the heavens to us and bring us into Your heart&rsquo;s desire so that our feelings come from You. Lord, have mercy on us and deliver us from our natural concepts. We need Your Spirit in us to daily give us the light from heaven, the light in the Holy Place, and even the revelation in the Holy of Holies. Bring us into Your light so that we would know ourselves and understand our history. We need to know our past and to understand our failures. Even more, we need to confess our mistakes.</p>
<p>Lord, we beseech You, be with us in every meeting, and cause our speaking to touch Your heart&rsquo;s desire. Give us a clear sense. Anoint our spirit with Your feeling, with Your thoughts, and with Your words, and grant us Your utterance. We need Your anointing and Your transfusing. We need to practically be one spirit with You. You have become one spirit with us, and we have become one spirit with You. We know that this is an accomplished fact, but we still want to experience the reality of being one spirit with You and of having You speak in our speaking. You are mingled with us; divinity is mingled with humanity, and the human spirit is joined to the divine Spirit. Lord, care for us, care for Your recovery, and care for Your move on the earth.</p>
<p>Grant us a model in Taiwan. Cause us to be faithful to You. We bend our knees to You and ask You to strengthen our entire being into the inner man so that we would give You the ground and the opportunity to make Your home in our deepest parts. Lord, gain our inward parts, and also gain our deepest parts. Speak to us. We are waiting on You and expecting You to cover us and to resist the enemy on our behalf. We proclaim again Your victory by Your prevailing blood. This blood does not merely speak better things for us before God. Your blood also speaks before the enemy. Your precious blood resists the enemy and covers us. We ask You to draw the line so that the enemy has no opportunity or ground to do anything here.</p>
<p>Lord, do not allow the enemy to have any ground in our environment or in our hearts. Bind him. We bind Your enemy in Your victorious name. By faith we trample beneath our feet the evil one&mdash;Your enemy, the devil&mdash;who accuses us. We proclaim Your victory and the victory of Your recovery and of Your move. Subdue the devil and bring the world under Your headship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT REMAINING IN OLDNESS<br />
BEING A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has more than sixty years of history among us. Through many experiences and failures during this time, we have learned that a characteristic of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not remaining in oldness but constantly being renewed.</p>
<p>Those who serve the Lord must learn the lesson of not remaining in oldness. Oldness includes many items. In fact, whatever is not of the Lord is old. Not remaining in oldness means that we do not remain in anything apart from the Lord, regardless of whether it is good or bad. We want nothing apart from the Lord. As long as we hold on to something other than the Lord, we are in oldness. We should not consider this to be an insignificant matter. In our natural man there are many hidden elements of oldness. We all remain in oldness. The elderly saints are not the only ones who can be in oldness; even two-year-old children can be in oldness. Everything apart from the Lord is old. Everything apart from the Lord is rubbish and must be thrown away. Even our former understanding of the Bible is old. If we insist on keeping our former understanding of the Bible, we will remain in oldness, and God&rsquo;s light cannot enter into our being.</p>
<p>Many of us have received mercy to serve the Lord full time. Some of us do not have the circumstances that allow us to serve full time and can serve only part time. But we are all for the Lord. When we are not for the Lord, we are not aware of the old things in our being. However, as soon as we are for the Lord, we must be careful, because our entire being is full of oldness. Fifty years ago I was like many of the young people. As soon as I began to love the Lord, I became zealous. However, even though the Lord has been doing a cleansing work for the past fifty years, I have to confess that there are still many old things within me.</p>
<p>We should never think that only the elderly saints have old and stale things within them; even the younger saints have old things. The younger saints have many ideas, opinions, views, and methods, just as the older saints do. It is difficult to find two sisters among us who are truly in one accord. Even though the sisters may be one in their spirit when they pray, they do not have the same heart. They have the same spirit but not the same heart. There are many sisters in every locality, but who can say with confidence that she is in one accord with another sister? This is our condition: we are one in spirit but not one in our heart. A saint who does not serve the Lord full time has fewer opportunities to be exposed for being in disaccord, but as soon as he begins to serve full time, his discord is easily exposed. If there are six hundred full-time serving ones, there will be six hundred different hearts.</p>
<p>Some saints have served the Lord full time for many years, but it is still difficult for them to be in one accord. This matter is grievous, and it is not easily resolved, because the factor behind our lack of one accord is our oldness. Our views, feelings, knowledge, and even the lessons we have learned can become old. Since the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have been tearing down the old things. We must put aside all the old things. We need to empty ourselves before the Lord and allow Him to speak to us and reveal our oldness so that nothing would hinder us from receiving His leading. Oldness can be compared to layer after layer of heavy veils that cover us. We must remove them.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE NEEDED</h2>
<p>I hope that those who serve the Lord full time will thoroughly study 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus with the outlines, footnotes, cross references, and Life-study messages. In these thirteen chapters of the Bible, we must find and study the crucial points concerning those who serve the Lord. These three books speak about the different conditions of the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones and give us the pattern of a serving one. Hence, we must not read them in a shallow way, nor should we simply pick up the points that appeal to us. Rather, we must study these books thoroughly, as if we had never read them before.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPROVING THE FULL-TIME SERVING ONES</h2>
<p>All the full-time serving ones must be approved by the responsible brothers in their respective localities (1 Cor. 16:3; 2 Tim. 2:15). For example, the full-time serving ones from Taipei must be approved by the church in Taipei, and the ones from Kaohsiung by the church in Kaohsiung.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Older Saints</h2>
<p> The full-time serving ones must be qualified in age. Many older brothers and sisters have been serving full time for many years, because after they retired, they consecrated their remaining days to the Lord&rsquo;s use. This is a good thing. There are also older sisters whose children are grown and married. These sisters can consecrate themselves and serve full time with the approval of the church. The only consideration for approving such saints is their age.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Young Saints</h2>
<p>We must also carefully consider the age of the younger brothers and sisters. We do not want any brothers and sisters who have not reached the age of twenty-one to serve full time. Human history proves that the years before the age of twenty are for receiving an education. In other words, we do not want the young full-time brothers and sisters to lack education. At a minimum, they need to graduate from a university or a college, and they must be over the age of twenty. We must consider the age and level of education of the young saints before we approve them.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we are running a worldly business, in which we must check the educational level of the saints. This is the age of education. Many people have at least graduated from junior college. How can we who serve the Lord have an education that is less than junior college? If our level of human knowledge is low, it will be difficult for us to contact people. It will also be difficult for us to expound the truth or preach the gospel. Therefore, a basic requirement for the full-time serving ones should be that they at least have a college education and that they are over the age of twenty.</p>
<p>When a local church considers the consecration slip of a young brother or sister who does not meet this standard, the church should encourage the brother or sister to get a minimum of a junior college education. If at all possible, they should obtain a degree from a four-year university. Furthermore, even if their age and level of education qualify them, there may be other factors. It may be that they have not fulfilled their military service, or they have to complete a teaching contract, or they have a contract with their employer. We must consider these matters. We should never give people the impression that we are dishonorable or that we do not keep our word or that we do not regard contracts. We should be positive, but we should not rush into the matter of serving full time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning the Working Saints</h2>
<p>With the working brothers and sisters, we must consider their careers. Suppose a brother is thirty-five years old and has only a high school education, but he is an electrician, and his business is very successful. It would not be appropriate for us to insist that he give up his job and serve full time. We should exhort such a brother to continue his business and to use his time after work to serve the Lord. This is good both for the brother and for the church. If he were to give up his profession, he would eventually become a burden to the church related to his support. This is not appropriate. It would be more profitable for this brother to remain in his profession and use his job as an opportunity to preach the gospel to people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Self-employed Saints</h2>
<p>A saint who is considering giving up his business to be completely for the Lord must understand that he is giving up an opportunity to use his business to preach the gospel. Many people have the opportunity to hear the gospel through the businesses of the saints. The saints should also consider their usefulness and function before the Lord. It may be that they do not need to spend that much time in their work. It would be better to advise the saints to remain in their businesses but not be usurped by them. We must encourage them to use their businesses as an opportunity to contact people, to preach the gospel, and to lead people to salvation. In this way they will not only be able to care for the needs of their own households, but they will also be able to make monetary contributions for the Lord&rsquo;s use. The churches must consider all these situations when approving saints to serve full time.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning Sisters Who Need<br />
to Care for Their Families</h2>
<p>Another situation involves sisters who are zealous for the Lord but do not care for family matters. They do not adequately care for their husbands or for their children. A sister in Peiping, whose husband was a university professor, went everywhere serving the Lord zealously. Every day she went to visit the saints early in the morning, neglecting her housework and her children. She did not return home until evening. As a result, her husband came to the meeting hall and complained about her, saying, &ldquo;What are you doing in this church? I do not have a wife anymore.&rdquo; This sister felt that her husband and children could take care of their needs without her. How could such a sister be approved to serve the Lord full time? Instead of approving her, we recommended that she return home to be a full-time wife. When she could be a proper wife at home, she could serve the Lord.</p>
<p>In 1938 there was a sister in Chefoo who was so zealous in serving full time that she did not even stop to eat. She said that when she ate, she wasted the time she could spend praying. She wanted to pray all the time, even at the expense of eating and sleeping. She justified herself by saying that the Bible tells us to pray unceasingly. She would not listen to any exhortations, and this hindered her service. This type of abnormal service is at best short-lived. The churches must consider such situations when they approve the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Good Reputation before Others</h2>
<p>Paul says, &ldquo;We exercise foresight for what is honorable not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men&rdquo; (2 Cor. 8:21). When a person wants to serve full time, we must pay attention to his reputation in the church and before men. If a brother who serves the Lord does not have a good reputation outside the church, we must exhort him to correct the matter that caused him to have a poor reputation. He must learn how to be a proper person before he can serve the Lord full time.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters are not improper in their behavior, but they love to talk. When such a person arrives at a meeting, he does not stop talking. He speaks in every meeting, and every time he speaks, he speaks for a long time. Even if the elders ask him to stop speaking, he does not stop. Such saints might turn in consecration slips and desire to serve full time. If we want to approve them, we must find an opportunity to fellowship with them. The localities must consider these situations when approving the saints.</p>
<p>We hope that the saints who give their time to serve, both those who will serve full time and those who will serve part time, will be useful and not be a burden. For this reason, the churches must approve them according to these principles. By so doing, we will be able to confirm whether a saint should serve full time or part time in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT MAKING THE FULL-TIME SERVING ONES<br />
A SPECIAL CLASS</h2>
<p>We must not consider the full-time or part-time serving ones to be a special class. If we do, we will fall into a religious organization. After 1952 we had more than one hundred full-time serving ones in Taiwan. In mainland China we did not use the expression <em>full-time serving one</em> very often. We used the term <em>co-worker.</em> In Taiwan the term <em>full-time serving one</em> became so prevalent that the full-time serving ones were considered a special class of saints. Strictly speaking, we are all full-time serving ones because we are for the Lord whether we die or we live.</p>
<p>Brother Nee once said that serving the Lord is our primary profession and that our job is our secondary profession. Every one of us is a full-time serving one. It does not matter whether we are students, teachers, doctors, nurses, or even housewives who take care of their children; we are all for the Lord. Our goal is to serve the Lord. From this viewpoint, we are all full-time serving ones.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ASSIGNING WORK TO THE FULL-TIME SERVING ONES</h2>
<p>Assigning work to the full-time serving ones will depend on the practical situation in a locality. Whether the full-time serving ones preach the gospel on the campuses, in the homes, or in the community, or whether they coordinate with the children&rsquo;s work, it will depend on the situation in a local church.</p>
<p>Christianity is an organized religion, and the assignments in Christianity are often made by a centralized committee. We cannot take that way. Concerning the support to the full-time serving ones, we do not want to set up a centralized financial unit in the work that would collect offerings and distribute them to the serving ones. The local churches must take care of the matter of supplying the needs of their full-time serving ones. Neither do we want to touch the matter of assigning duties to the full-time serving ones in a centralized way. Rather, we should let every local church make its own assignments.</p>
<p>The leading that we see in the Bible does not come from a centralized authority but from the Body. We must avoid division in the move of the Body. For example, if an arm becomes separated from the body, it is a division. Such division is a damage to the body and makes the arm completely useless. This applies to us.</p>
<p>In order to avoid centralization and division, we must have much fellowship. Suppose there are many full-time serving ones in the church in Taichung. After they are approved and assigned to the work, the leading brothers might discover that they do not need so many serving ones. Then the leading brothers should fellowship with the other churches. If, for example, there are not enough full-time serving ones in the church in Taipei, the church in Taichung and the church in Taipei can balance the needs through fellowship.</p>
<p>We should not forget that in our natural man, we are all like politicians who set their heart to grasp power and rule over others. If twenty sisters come to clean the meeting hall, there will be problems. First, everyone wants to take the lead. Second, whoever is the leader expects the other nineteen sisters to submit to her. If the elders say that four sisters should take the lead in cleaning four areas of the meeting hall, each of the four sisters will want the rest of the sisters to serve in her group. This is an example of politics. We should not think that only people in government play politics. There can be politics even in the matters of sweeping the floor and washing the windows in the meeting hall.</p>
<p>After the elders assign some young full-time serving ones to the children&rsquo;s work, some to work with the junior high school students, and some to work on the universities, these serving ones may recruit others to serve with them. Such recruiting will result in disputes. This kind of political disposition is in every one of us, and we must do our best to avoid it. We should not think that the full-time serving ones produced by a church should necessarily stay in that church. Neither should we think that a church that produces only a few full-time serving ones is deserving of its lack. Someone who cannot cook should not be forced to go hungry if others have food. However, it is easy to want extra glory for our locality, even if other localities are suffering. This kind of attitude is wrong. All those who love the Lord and His recovery must learn this lesson. We must see that God does not want politics. We must eliminate politics. The churches must get rid of politics, and every one of us must get rid of politics.</p>
<p>When a young brother begins to serve full time, he consecrates himself to the Lord and to His Body. The locality that nurtured him should not hold on to him. His placement in the work should be decided in the fellowship of the Body and according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading within him. There is no organization among us, nor is there a pope among us to give commands as to who must go to a certain place or who must stay in a certain place. Such a practice is the way of Catholicism.</p>
<p>The local churches must not have disputes concerning full-time serving ones. Whether there is an excess or a lack is in the Lord&rsquo;s hands. We have been serving for many years and have seen many situations. We can testify that those who tried to keep some extra glory in their locality found that it did not last long. The serving ones whom they vie for are like the night-blooming cereus flowers that bloom only at midnight and wilt before dawn. We should not fight to have any flowers for ourselves. Even if we have many flowers, they are like the night-blooming cereus flowers that fade and wilt in a very short time.</p>
<p>There may be a certain local church that does not seem to be doing well. However, even though this locality may struggle for eight or ten years, heavenly grace will eventually fall upon it, and it will rise up to become a very living local church. We must believe that our future is bright and that all the local churches are promising and living.</p>
<p>All the serving ones must have a broad view to see that we are serving the Head of the Body, the church. The church refers to the universal church. We should not care only for the church in our locality. We serve the Lord. It is good if the effect of our service helps our locality. It is also good if our service helps another locality. Everything is for the Lord and in the Body. Taiwan is a small island. We must not get stuck in our small well. The localities should fellowship with one another and the full-time serving ones and the part-time serving ones should fellowship with one another. Everyone should seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading. With such a practice it will be easy to assign work to the full-time serving ones.</p><h2 class="head1">FORMING GROUPS</h2>
<p>The groups are crucial, and we must take care of them. All the local churches should go over their name lists to see how many saints in their localities meet regularly and how many are no longer meeting. Then the saints who meet regularly should be formed into groups. Every group should have only twelve saints at the most. Thus, when the groups are formed, they should have less than twelve saints so that they can bring in new ones. There should be no group leaders or coordinators, because all the saints are coordinators. After the groups are formed, the full-time and part-time serving ones should be assigned to care for the groups. It is critical for the serving ones not to replace the saints.</p>
<p>For the care of the groups, we should do our best to form them according to the districts. For example, the church in Taipei will have more than four hundred small groups, which are formed by the ten districts. If each district has forty groups, there will be about four hundred saints in the groups. Every group needs full-time or part-time serving ones to help them. The groups should be formed according to where the saints live, and there should not be group leaders or coordinators. The saints in a group should live near one another, and one full-time or part-time serving one should be responsible for helping them. For example, the full-time and part-time serving ones can give the small groups material for their weekly meetings. They should teach the saints how to meet. These are some of the responsibilities of the full-time and part-time serving ones in the local churches. The saints in every local church can be formed into groups. The elders should take care of the administration of the entire church, and a few co-workers should take the lead in the districts. These are the principles for making arrangements in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OTHER IMPORTANT POINTS<br />
IN THE FULL-TIMERS&rsquo; WORK</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Campus Work</h2>
<p>Concerning the campus work, we must consider how many campuses in a locality are ready for the serving ones and how many campuses are not. We also must know how many full-timers and other saints can serve. Then we can make appropriate arrangements.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Children&rsquo;s Work</h2>
<p>We must realize that the children&rsquo;s work is a crucial burden. Every locality must be aggressive in the children&rsquo;s work, because there is a greater future in the children&rsquo;s work than in the campus work. Generally speaking, it is easier to bring in children, and once they come in, they usually remain. Our history confirms this fact. The church in Manila is an example. Most of the saints in the church in Manila were gained by the children&rsquo;s work. Ninety percent of the churches in the Philippines are maintained by saints in their thirties, and most of these saints grew up in the church and attended the children&rsquo;s meeting.</p>
<p>When we preach the gospel, we frequently have to go out to gain people; we even go to the campuses to gain people. These people are along the roads and hedges (Luke 14:23). There is only one group of people who are not along the roads: the children in our own homes. Why do we not work on our own children? The people along the roads might come today or tomorrow, but the people in our own homes will always be there. Furthermore, our children can bring other children. Therefore, they should be a crucial focus of our work. This work is long-lasting and remaining. A child who is six years old today will be thirteen in seven years. That is a good age to enter the church life. When they enter the church life, they are our young brothers and sisters. When they enter junior high school, they will be gospel seeds. Through them, it will be easier for us to work in the junior high schools.</p>
<p>If this is our vision, we will be aggressive in the children&rsquo;s work. The more children we have, the better it will be. If by the end of 1985 or the beginning of 1986 the church in Taipei has twenty thousand children, the church in Taipei will have a tremendous future. We must expand our view. This is something worth doing. Another benefit of the children&rsquo;s work is that we can bring the high school and college students into the coordination, and it will be easy for them to advance the work. Every local church must do its best to form small groups, begin the campus work, and develop the children&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Gospel in the Homes</h2>
<p>The gospel in the homes cannot be separated from the small groups. It has to be carried out by brothers and sisters who are capable and who have much time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Community Gospel</h2>
<p>The full-time serving ones also need to advance the community gospel. This is the most difficult item to carry out, and it requires everyone, including the elderly, the middle-aged, and the young saints. As many saints as are available should be used. The community gospel work is limitless. The local churches must make good arrangements concerning this aspect of the work by assigning full-time and part-time serving ones according to the need and by utilizing every saint, especially those with a profession. For example, if a certain brother teaches junior high school, he can help with the gospel work on that campus. If a saint is the owner of a factory, an engineer at a factory, or even a worker in a factory, he can contact people in the factory and preach the gospel. Some saints work in government offices and others in hospitals. They can spread the gospel where they work. The churches must assign full-time and part-time serving ones to coordinate with the saints.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Concerning full-time service, there is a brother who is about thirty-five years old. He is very energetic, and his spiritual condition is good, but he does not have sufficient education. What should we do in this situation?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Education is related to function. If this brother&rsquo;s spiritual function clearly manifests that he should serve the Lord full time, then he should become a full-time serving one. This is an important point when we are approving the saints to serve full time. We must look at their function to see whether it is necessary for them to serve full time.</p>
<p>We encourage the young people who have completed a technical college education to continue their studies. Some university graduates also need to continue their studies for their service to the Lord. The young people must learn to speak and write in both Chinese and English, because English is an international language. If we do not know English, our function will be reduced. Hence, the young people surely must study these two languages. The young people should also study Greek. This does not mean that they should obtain a degree in it, but they should study enough Greek to be able to understand the basics of the New Testament. Then they will be able to use reference books and the Bible in Greek. This is related to our ability to understand the truth.</p>
<p><em>Question: In the localities where there are many full-time brothers and sisters, should the full-timers have corporate times to study, pray, fellowship, and discuss matters related to their service? There are many saints who are not full-time but who bear an important burden in the service. In what way should they coordinate with the full-timers?</em></p>
<p>Answer: These matters require us to go before the Lord and then make decisions according to the situation in our locality. I can give you only general principles. For example, I can tell you to eat three meals a day, but you have to determine the time of your meals and whether you should eat with a fork and knife, chopsticks, or your fingers.</p>
<p><em>Question: What does it mean to be a part-time serving one?</em></p>
<p>Answer: To be a part-time serving one means that a person is unable to give all his time, but he is able to give more time than a saint with normal working hours. In other words, some saints give all their time to serve the Lord, and other saints cannot give all their time, but they are able to give some of the time that they would normally use at a job. Instead of serving in their spare time, these saints are part time.</p>
<p><em>Question: What should we do about a saint who is individualistic and has a peculiar disposition, yet he wants to serve the Lord full time?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Today&rsquo;s education emphasizes four aspects: moral education, intellectual education, physical education, and education in social interaction. Concerning social interaction, a person who serves the Lord must be able to get along with others. If he is unable to get along with others, he cannot be useful no matter how capable he is. Christians should be like honeybees, not butterflies. When honeybees come together, it is difficult to tell which one is the first and which is the last. When we lose our peculiar characteristics, we are like honeybees. If we keep our peculiar characteristics, we are like butterflies. Saints who are like butterflies are not good for church service. In other words, such saints should not serve full time. Full-time serving ones must be like honeybees. They must be able to get along with others, that is, to work as a team.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate. When a brother goes to Los Angeles, he should be a brother in Los Angeles. He should not be perceived as a brother from Taiwan; otherwise, he will be like a butterfly instead of a honeybee. A brother from Taipei who goes to Kaohsiung should immediately become a brother from Kaohsiung. He should not give others the sense that he is a &ldquo;butterfly&rdquo; from Taipei. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, especially in our training, we are all honeybees, despite the fact that we are of different nationalities. Our training is like a beehive in which all the honeybees live. The entrance to a beehive is too small to allow a butterfly to enter. For this reason, the responsible brothers in every locality must spend time and effort to labor on brothers who are individualistic. We must let them know that their past actions in the meetings and in the church life were individualistic. Even though they love the Lord and want to serve Him full time, they must first learn some lessons. Therefore, they should wait and not serve full time yet.</p>
<p><em>Question: I have two children, and I want to serve full time. My family approves. What should I do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We should not have the concept that full-time serving ones should never get married. All the full-time sisters should get married. Serving full time should not interrupt a marriage, nor should it affect a sister&rsquo;s place as a wife and a mother. In other words, it is possible to have a husband and children and serve full time.</p>
<p>A sister is blessed when her family, parents, and in-laws approve of her serving full time. With their approval comes their help. This is proper for her to serve full time. It is not a matter of whether she should serve full time but of how she should use her time. She must first make some arrangements. She should ask her mother to do the things that her mother can do, and she should ask her mother-in-law to do the things that her mother-in-law can do. If her mother and mother-in-law cannot help her children with their homework, then this sister must help her children. She must not say that she has to help her children with their homework and therefore has no time to pursue the Lord. She still must pursue the Lord, but she must do it according to her measure.</p>
<p>No saint is truly full time. We all have personal matters that require our time. If serving full time was according to our concept, we would not have time to breathe. Serving full time is a matter of our condition before the Lord. We must care for our husbands, wives, and children. When I get up in the morning, I spend the time to comb my hair and wash up. It is wrong to be so zealous that we care for nothing else. For the sake of coordinating with the brothers and sisters, we should take care of their feelings and do things properly. No matter how much we love the Lord or how spiritual we are, we are still people in the flesh, and our living is in the physical realm. Since we must live in our physical bodies, we must be normal humans so that we can coordinate with others. On the one hand, we need to do our best to give our strength, time, and everything for the service; on the other hand, we still must have a normal living. This is what it means to serve full time.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">SPIRITUAL PRINCIPLES IN CHURCH SERVICE</h1>
<p>In this message we will fellowship concerning some of the spiritual principles in the church service. In the preceding messages we fellowshipped concerning the arrangements for the work and the way the full-time serving ones should lead the small groups and how they should advance the gospel in the homes, on the campus, and with the children. The full-time serving ones must also advance the gospel in the community through the brothers and sisters at all levels of society.</p>
<p>We do not have time to fellowship concerning the details of these points. These will be left for every locality to decide as they begin working in these areas. We must pray much, have thorough fellowship with one another, and observe the situation. Then we can study the practical steps that should be taken. The steps that we fellowship in this meeting are only general principles. For example, a person who wants to be healthy must eat at least three meals per day. However, he still should study and decide whether he should eat Chinese or American food, whether to eat steamed buns or rice, and whether to use a fork and knife or chopsticks. He does not need special guidance with respect to these details.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE NEEDING TO BE ORGANIC<br />
NOT ORGANIZATIONAL</h2>
<p>We are burdened concerning the purpose of our gatherings. We must realize that we are in the Lord and that we are brothers and sisters. Such relationships are not simple. The saved ones in Christian groups are also in the Lord and are brothers and sisters, but we are not meeting with them. We have received the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to be gathered together so that we may maintain a corporate testimony. We do not agree with the Catholic Church, because the testimony of Catholicism is an error. We also do not agree with the groups in Christianity, because they do not have the proper testimony.</p>
<p>Still, we need to ask concerning the testimony we should maintain. According to the ways of human society, organization is necessary in order to accomplish anything. However, we cannot rely on organization. But if we reject organization, how should we proceed in the work? Some saints may respond that we should rely on the elders, the deacons, and the co-workers. While it is scriptural for elders to administrate the church, we cannot do this in a way of organization.</p>
<p>The general concept in human society is that a church is managed by a pastor. For example, when a reporter wants to interview someone from a church, he ask`s to see the pastor. Not many Christians know about the administration of the church by the eldership, or presbytery. Presbyterians know the term <em>presbytery,</em> but often they do not understand what it means.</p>
<p>When I was young, I studied in an English junior college that was run by the American Presbyterian Church. I was a student there, but I did not know who the elders were. I only knew the names of a few pastors. One of the pastors was the uncle of one of the brothers among us. He was famous in the Presbyterian Church, and he was an eloquent and skillful preacher. I am saying this to show that we did not know what an elder was, but we knew what a pastor was.</p>
<p>When the Lord raised up His recovery in China, the first thing we emphasized was the recovery of the practices in the Scriptures. One day we saw that in the Bible the administration and leading of the church are carried out by the elders. So we appointed elders. As the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in His recovery in China became stronger, the practice of having elders administrate the church was received by other Christian groups. The term <em>elder</em> was commonly used among us, and we became famous for using this term. Today this term has traveled to America. Even Chinese newspapers in America speak of interviewing elders rather than pastors.</p>
<p>Regrettably, we have observed that even among us, most brothers and sisters rely on the elders as if they were pastors. Therefore, when we ask how to advance the work, everyone thinks that we must rely on the elders. We have given ourselves to serve full time, but who directs us in our service to the Lord? To say that the Lord directs us is certainly correct and spiritual, but we must ask what this means. You may say that it means to follow the sense of life, to follow the anointing. We cannot dispute with such an answer, because it is definitely a teaching according to the Bible.</p>
<p>Suppose a sister follows her so-called sense of life, or the anointing of the Spirit, and goes to serve in Kaohsiung. Although the church in Kaohsiung may acknowledge her burden and allow her to serve on the campus, they may feel that there was no fellowship. They may feel that she is able to carry out a spiritual function, but that she is unable to carry out any practical service. This shows that when we serve, we cannot be alone. It does not matter how much of a burden a person has, he cannot accomplish anything alone or independently. On the one hand, we have the sense of life, the anointing, and the operating of the Spirit. On the other hand, we are extremely limited in what we can do in the service and must rely on and enjoy the service of other saints. We cannot be individualistic. We cannot exist without the Body life. In other words, if we want to serve the Lord, we must have the Body life.</p>
<p>Organization is in human society as well as in Catholicism and Christianity. But the church revealed in the Bible is not an organization but an organism. Hence, we must ask ourselves whether the testimony of our service is that of an organization or of an organism. If the testimony of our service is an organism, it is the Body. A group is an organization, but a body is an organism. We are not an organization; we are the Body. All the members of the human body are organic parts. Many people wear false teeth, which are not organic members of their body. False teeth are an organization. The difference is that false teeth do not have the life of the body. Only the members with the life of the body can be part of the body. Things without the life of the body are an organization, even if they are within the body.</p>
<p>The elders should ask themselves whether they are a part of an organism or an organization inside the organism. In the example of the sister in Kaohsiung, she must ask herself whether her service is an organic function or an organization within an organism. We must all ask ourselves this question, and we must answer it with much consideration. Then we will realize that whether we are an elder, a co-worker, or a full-time serving one, our motives and element are mainly organizational, not organic. This is the focus of this message.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLES FOR<br />
THE ELDERS&rsquo; ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We might think that in the church we should obey the elders. However, there is not a verse in the Bible says only that the church belongs to the elders. The Bible says only that the church is the church, or the churches, of God (1 Cor. 1:2; 11:16); the church of Christ, or the churches, of Christ (Rom. 16:16); and the church of the saints (1 Thes. 1:1). The Bible never says that the church is the church of the elders, nor does it say that the church is the church of the apostles. In other words, the owners of the church are God, the Lord, and the saints. First, we all should listen to the Lord. Second, since the affairs of the church are also practical and require human service, in matters related to service the owner of the church is not the elders but the saints.</p>
<p>This is the reason Paul tells Timothy in 1 Timothy 5 that the saints should not make an accusation against the elders, except on the word of two or three witnesses (v. 19). The Bible does not speak of people making an accusation against their parents, but it does mention saints making an accusation against the elders. We think that we should obey the elders because the church is under the elders&rsquo; control, administration, and management, but Paul still speaks of the saints being able to bring an accusation against the elders. The important point here is that the New Testament does not have the thought that the elders are lords over the church. Speaking to the disciples, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You are all brothers&rdquo; (Matt. 23:8). He also told them that whoever desired to be the greatest should be a servant and a slave (20:26-27).</p>
<p>During the training on the Life-study of Matthew, we emphasized this matter in relation to the sisters who are the wives of elders, saying, &ldquo;You are all the wives of elders, and it seems that because your husbands are elders, you have become &lsquo;first ladies.&rsquo; This is absolutely wrong. You must know that the elders among us are slaves. If your husbands were not elders, you would not be slave-ladies, but once your husbands became elders, you became slave-ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bible speaks quite strongly concerning this matter, and I believe that Peter received this word. When he wrote his first Epistle, he said, &ldquo;The elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow elder...Shepherd the flock of God among you...nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock&rdquo; (5:1-3). <em>Lording it over</em> means to exercise lordship over the ruled. <em>Becoming patterns of the flock</em> implies that the elders are also sheep. They are in the flock as the head sheep. They should take the lead by walking in the front, not by running or jumping wildly or leaving the flock. When it is time to graze, they must take the lead to graze. When it is time to drink, they must take the lead to drink. They must also obey the Shepherd. In this way, the flock will be willing to follow them. This is what it means to become &ldquo;patterns of the flock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must always remember that an elder is not the owner of a church or a superior official; he is just one sheep among the flock. An elder is an elder because he obeys the Lord; he grazes when he should graze and drinks when he should drink. He grazes when it is time to graze, he drinks when it is time to drink, and he is more obedient than the other sheep. He is a pattern in every way, so he becomes an elder. This is the same as becoming the head sheep. The other sheep simply follow his lead. This is what it means to be an elder. Being an elder is not to lord it over others but to become a pattern of the flock.</p>
<p>The Bible is complete. Peter knew that after hearing this word, the young saints could become puffed up in themselves and not follow the leading of the elders, so he continued, &ldquo;Younger men, be subject to elders&rdquo; (v. 5). The Greek word for <em>elders</em> in this verse is the same word used in verse 1. Peter seemed to be saying, &ldquo;It is true that the elders should not lord it over you, but they are patterns of the flock. Therefore, do not think that since they are also sheep, you do not have to obey them. On the contrary, you younger men still have to be subject to the elderly ones. You have to be subject to the elders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter had much experience, and he was afraid that when the elders heard his word, they would say, &ldquo;Peter clearly told you to subject yourselves to the elders, so that means you must subject yourselves to us.&rdquo; Hence, Peter continued by saying, &ldquo;All of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another&rdquo; (v. 5). In other words, the younger sheep must obey the older sheep, and the older sheep must listen to the younger sheep. We must all be subject one to another. Only then have we girded ourselves with humility.</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s word here is balanced. He made sure that the saints were not an unturned cake (Hosea 7:8). We should receive this reminder. If we always rely on the elders, we will be an unturned cake, a cake that is cooked on only one side. We must turn the cake. The younger ones must submit to the elders, and the elders and the younger ones must submit to one another. In this way the practical affairs of the church will be carried out smoothly. This is the teaching in the Bible.</p>
<p>In the world people must submit to kings. However, no one in the world says that kings and their subjects must submit to one another. If this were the case, kings would lose their status and position; they would be on the same level as everyone else. We are all before the Lord, but we may harbor a deep-rooted natural concept. Some churches are in this situation. When a local church is raised up, the responsibility for leading the church is given to the elders. However, the elders may think that they are bosses and lords, so only what they say matters. We must not have such a concept. Even though the responsibility for leading the church has been given to the elders, the elders are not the owners of the church, and they should not lord it over anyone. The church belongs to the Lord. The church should be ruled by the Lord. He is the only One with absolute authority. The elders are merely patterns of the flock.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ORDER OF THE CHURCH SERVICE</h2>
<p>The New Testament speaks of the elders&rsquo; administrating of the church, but it does not stress this point. First Corinthians 12:28 says, &ldquo;God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.&rdquo; <em>Helps</em> refers to deacons and deaconesses, who deal with practical matters. <em>Administrations</em> refers to the elders. Bible readers encounter a difficulty with this verse, because they do not understand why Paul placed the deacons before the elders. This verse says, &ldquo;first,&rdquo; &ldquo;second,&rdquo; &ldquo;third,&rdquo; and &ldquo;then,&rdquo; showing that there is an order in these services.</p>
<p>In our view, elders are somewhat higher than the deacons, and they should be mentioned before the deacons. But it seems that Paul considers the service of the deacons to be higher than that of the elders, so he placed the elders after the deacons. The last item mentioned is the least desirable&mdash;speaking in tongues. Paul placed the elders next to speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 12:28, the first three gifts established by God are apostles, prophets, and teachers. These are higher gifts. Then there are works of power and gifts of healing. Today&rsquo;s Pentecostal movement promotes the gift of healing, but it disregards prophesying and teaching the Bible. Prophesying and teaching the Bible are our specialties. The gifts we have in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are the highest gifts. I encourage you to function in this way. Even if you are a small sister, you can lead your family members to be saved. When you do so, you are an apostle. When you speak the Lord&rsquo;s word to your family members, you are prophesying. If you can help them understand the Word, you are functioning as a teacher.</p>
<p>We do not, however, encourage you to do works of power, because it is easy to become abnormal or even deluded. You may even think that you can heal all illnesses through prayer. Many Christians want to pursue such gifts, but in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the Lord does not give us such gifts, and neither do we pay attention to them. We emphasize being apostles, prophets, and shepherds and teachers.</p>
<p>Paul lists helps, administrations, and tongue-speaking as the last items. Paul put the eldership last to prevent the elders from elevating themselves. The Bible does not give ground for the saints to elevate themselves. The Lord Jesus told the apostles that none of them should be the master; rather, they were all brothers. Whoever wanted to be the greatest among them had to become a slave. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery follows this pattern and emphasizes it. Even though the fellowship of the elders should be considered by those who want to serve full time, we should never think that the approval of the elders is a condition for full-time service. When someone submits a consecration slip, the elders must be careful, because a saint&rsquo;s future in the Lord&rsquo;s service can be ruined if the fellowship of the elders is received as if it is a formal approval.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING IN SPIRIT WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING</h2>
<p>If the formal approval of the elders is not a condition for full-time service, some elders might ask why their consideration is needed. Such a question shows an organizational mind that is focused on the matter of authority. This is not a question of authority. As soon as authority is brought into a matter, it becomes organizational. If the elders have a proper understanding, they will follow their inward sense and the anointing of the Spirit. Then their consideration of the saints will not be organizational.</p>
<p>However, some elders in the churches cannot distinguish between the organic function of the Body and an organization. The elders are not part of an organization but rather functioning members of an organism. If they stand on the ground of organization and serve as elders with an organizational view, they are part of an organization. They will have no organic function, and they will not have the life of the Body. Forgive me for speaking such a strong word, but this is the same as false teeth and prosthetic legs. They do not have an organic function, because they do not have the life of the Body.</p>
<p>The elders in every locality, both in Taiwan and abroad, have made this mistake to one degree or another. They serve as elders in an organizational way, not according to an organic function. An elder who functions in an organic way will be in fear and trembling as he considers whether a saint should serve full time.</p>
<p>Paul says, &ldquo;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure&rdquo; (Phil. 2:12-13). This means that we have a life in us with an organic function, and this life is operating in us. We must obey the operating of this life with fear and trembling. We need to be in fear and trembling; otherwise, we will not pay attention to the Spirit&rsquo;s operating, and we will make our own decisions. The elders may regard their character, feelings, opinions, thoughts, preferences, and choices too highly, and they may even regard these traits as the reason they were chosen to be elders. If they are not watchful, it will be easy to ignore the inward operating of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The sense of life and the anointing of the Spirit are things that we understand doctrinally. We must ask ourselves how many times during the day do we obey the sense of life and the anointing of the Spirit. Making a small joke can be in disobedience to the operating of the Spirit. Whenever we speak loosely with others, we lose the anointing. Murmuring and grumbling to others are expressions of ignoring the inward sense of life. We must confess that this is our condition, especially with our spouse and other family members. For this reason in verse 14 Paul says, &ldquo;Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.&rdquo; Murmurings are related to our emotions and come mainly from the sisters. Reasonings are related to our mind and come mainly from the brothers. Whenever the sisters stop murmuring to their husbands and the brothers cease reasoning with the ones they coordinate with, they are obeying God&rsquo;s inward operating.</p>
<p>According to my observation, no wife lacks love toward her husband. The Bible does not command the wives to love their husbands, because God knows that the wives love their husbands. The Bible does say that the husbands must love their wives. The main problem with husbands is that most of them do not love their wives. Therefore, the Bible commands the husbands to love their wives. Even though the wives love their husbands, the main problem with wives is that they do not submit to their husbands. Rather, it is the husbands who submit to their wives. The Bible does not charge the husbands to submit to their wives, because all husbands submit to their wives. Wives love their husbands, and husbands submit to their wives. These are almost iron-clad principles. Hence, the Bible provides correction and tells husbands to love and wives to submit.</p>
<p>Wives murmur because they love their husbands. If they did not love their husbands, they would not murmur. The more a wife loves her husband, the more she murmurs. The same thing happens in the church. There are not many sisters who do not complain about the elders. The most difficult thing for the elders is the endless complaining and murmuring of the sisters. Although the sisters often lift the elders up very high, they also murmur and complain about the elders. This is a problem.</p>
<p>We need to take care of the sense of life and the anointing. However, in our experience we ignore the operation of the Spirit most of the time. If we obey the anointing only occasionally, we think that we are spiritual Christians.</p>
<p>The greatest danger in the elders&rsquo; administration of the church is not administrating according to the operating of the Spirit. Of course, the elders do not administrate the church out of evil or bad motives. However, they can administrate out of themselves, rather than by the Spirit. Some elders have a very good character. They are thoughtful and capable, even full of insight. However, it may be that only a few of their decisions related to the administration of the church are according to the operation of the Spirit. The elders who administrate the churches do not fear the Lord to the extent that they say, &ldquo;I fear the Lord, so I am afraid of my views, ideas, and opinions. I am afraid that I will take charge of the church&rsquo;s administration.&rdquo; Instead, nearly every elder feels that he understands the truth and has clear insight; therefore, he is strict to carry things out. It is possible to carry out the truth and not follow the operation of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The elders may ask whether this means that they should not carry things out according to the truth. We should be clear that if we do not carry things out according to the truth, we are not obeying the operation of the Spirit. In many situations it is better to make a decision to not make a decision. When we do not make a decision, it means that we still have some inward consideration. This gives the Spirit an opportunity to operate within us. Our concern is that many brothers shut the door to the Spirit&rsquo;s operation as soon as they become elders.</p>
<p>Those who give themselves to be full-timers should never have the thought that there is a group of co-workers who approve and decide whether one is qualified. That would be centralized authority, and such a practice is unscriptural. Those who desire to serve full time should have the approval of the elders in their locality. This is proper.</p>
<p>We need to turn the cake. We are concerned that in considering the saints who have a heart to serve full time, some elders will function in a habitual way of doing things, not according to their spirit. They might not be in fear and trembling. The consideration of the saints in such a way is organizational, not organic. In other words, we are concerned that the elders will not follow the Spirit but will merely consider outward qualifications.</p>
<p>For the past two thousand years this problem has caused the church to not grow much and to not be useful to the Lord. This problem has also forced the church to rely on organization. It seems that if the church does not rely on organization, it cannot move. The genuine church, however, cannot be in organization. We need to be organic, but we do not have enough growth in life or the habit of being organic. Therefore, what we do still lacks an organic element. This is our greatest problem.</p>
<p>My burden is that every saint would have a heart to fear the Lord. The elders must learn to fear the Lord in every matter. They should fear the Lord not merely concerning playing mah-jongg but also in following the Spirit. The elders in the churches fear the Lord in many aspects of their living; however, in following the operation of the Spirit to obey the anointing and the sense of life, they do not fear Him enough. Most of their decisions are based on what is right or wrong and good or bad. Our consideration of those who wish to serve full time must not be based on what is good or bad or on who is qualified or not qualified. We must be fearful before the Lord and learn to follow the Spirit by obeying the anointing and the sense of life. What the elders do according to the Spirit will not have the flavor of exercising authority or controlling others, because the Spirit is living and not dead.</p>
<p>When we asked the elders in every locality to consider those who desire to serve full time, we did not use the word <em>examine.</em> This means that we asked the elders to consider the situation of every applicant. This does not mean that they have the authority to accept or reject anyone. If we were an organization, it would be easy to carry things out according to rules. However, we are a living organism.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ORGANIC LESSONS IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>There is a Chinese proverb that says, &ldquo;A long illness makes the patient a good doctor.&rdquo; I have suffered tuberculosis and stomach ulcers, and during my convalescence, I learned many things. I discovered that doctors are limited in what they know. It does not matter whether a doctor has studied diligently for ten or even twenty years, what he knows is only a superficial amount concerning the human body. This is because the body is a mysterious organism that is difficult to comprehend. It is easy to understand the way a desk is made; we can even take it apart with a hammer. However, we cannot use the same method to study human beings, because life is complicated and difficult.</p>
<p>It is the same with the Bible. On the surface, the Bible seems easy to read. Such passages as, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God&rdquo; (John 1:1); &ldquo;I am the light&rdquo; (8:12, 9:5); &ldquo;I am the bread&rdquo; (6:35, 48); &ldquo;the water that I will give&rdquo; (4:14); &ldquo;I am the door&rdquo; (10:7) are clear and easy to read. However, it is not easy to understand what these passages mean. The more times you read the Bible, the more you feel that the Bible is a difficult book to understand. This is because the Bible covers the matter of life. This is the same type of difficulty we experience in leading the church.</p>
<p>More than fifty years ago the Lord raised me up to lead the church and to speak for Him. At the time I could answer any question clearly and logically. For example, I could clearly tell a brother the type of sister he should or should not marry. I knew who would be a good spouse, a perfect match for him. I could also tell a sister who would be a perfect match for her. Initially, I was very bold to speak these things, and I spoke clearly and reasonably. But the more I spoke, the more I felt that there was something wrong, because the Lord did not fulfill the things that I had spoken. Therefore, for at least ten years, I have not dared to speak concerning these things. If a saint asks me how to choose the best spouse, I can only say that I do not know. Even though this has disappointed many brothers and sisters, they are not harmed. In America marriage is one of the most popular topics, but the more it is discussed, the more people get divorced.</p>
<p>I have been leading the local churches and speaking for the Lord for many years. I can testify that the more I lead, the less I understand. For example, some saints might consider a young brother to be so good that he can become an apostle in the future. But in five years he turns completely to the world. We might consider that some saints are not very good material, but in five years they might be the ones who love the Lord the most and are the most consecrated. Everything depends on God, not on man. This is what makes it difficult to lead the church.</p>
<p>When a local church is raised up, it must have elders, or there will be no way to administrate the church. There might be disputes concerning who should decide matters, when to visit the saints and when the meetings should be held. For example, some saints might be in favor of having meetings in the middle of the night, because that is the only time they are free. Such situations show the need for elders to make arrangements and to carry out the church&rsquo;s administration. However, it is difficult to appoint elders. How should the elders be appointed? Who should be appointed? Even though we appoint elders in fear and trembling, we may still appoint someone who is not appropriate, and once the elders have been appointed, we cannot casually announce that we are changing them.</p>
<p>It is difficult to be an elder, and it is even more difficult to appoint elders. We must learn not to depend on ourselves but to remain in the Lord with fear and trembling. The elders must remember that it is not a light thing to decide on any matter. Considerations related to full-time service are a great responsibility and can be compared to the Chinese proverb: &ldquo;A timely warning may avert a national crisis; a single wrong statement can bring disaster to the nation.&rdquo; The consideration of those who desire to serve full time is a big responsibility, because a mistake can ruin a young person&rsquo;s future in relation to serving the Lord for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>This is not a word of warning. This word is for us all to learn. The testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not one of organization but one of a functioning, living organism. We do not want an organization. What the elders do in the localities, especially when they consider the saints who desire to serve full time, must come out of an organic function. We must pray before we consider the saints, and we must pray as we are considering the saints. If there is something that we do not understand, we should stop and pray and then consider further. If there is a sense to tell a saint that he is not ready to serve full time, it must be done with prayer. We must not convey the erroneous impression that he can never serve full time for the rest of his life. We must help him to understand that it is not appropriate for him to serve now, because he does not have sufficient growth in life or because the Lord has not given him a suitable arrangement. Instead of refusing him, we should lead him in life. This is entirely apart from organization; it is organic. Organizations approve and reject people without giving any leading in life. We should do things according to a person&rsquo;s situation and lead him in life.</p>
<p>We want the elders to consider the saints so that full-timers are raised up in the local churches and so that the elders are clear concerning the situation of the saints. According to principle, this matter should be carried out by the elders in a local church. The elders must be in fear and trembling before the Lord and follow the leading of the Spirit to help the young people in life. If the elders feel that it is not appropriate for a saint to serve full time, that saint must not be given the impression that he has been rejected. Instead, he must be led to understand that the time is not right, and he must be encouraged to mature in life. There is a need for such leading.</p>
<p>Let me repeat, the elders must follow the Spirit in every matter. If they prohibit a saint from attending the table meeting or quarantine him from the fellowship of the church, they must be in fear and trembling. They cannot make arbitrary decisions based on the letter of the Bible. If a saint commits a sin for which he should be quarantined, but he repents, he should be forgiven. A saint should be quarantined only if he remains unrepentant. We cannot be a court of law; otherwise, we are an organization. We must remember that even if a saint has sinned, he is still a member of the Body of Christ. We must take care of the problem according to our organic function. We must fear God in all things. This is an organic lesson that the elders must learn in their administration of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ORGANIC LESSONS IN THE BODY</h2>
<p>The full-timers, on the one hand, should learn to follow the sense of the Holy Spirit and the anointing. On the other hand, they should learn the Body life. No one can be independent in the Body. Suppose a brother who loves the Lord serves in Kaohsiung, and he has a desire to learn to follow the sense of the Holy Spirit and the anointing. He must be in fear and trembling, because the sense within him might be his preference and not of the Spirit. It might be his excitement and not the anointing, or it might be his impulse and not the operation of the Spirit. Since we can experience counterfeits, we must learn to rely on the Body and not trust ourselves.</p>
<p>We learn the Body life by placing ourselves in the fellowship of the Body. For example, a brother who has a burden to serve on the campuses in a locality must first fellowship with the elders in that locality. This does not mean that he is asking the elders for a decision or a confirmation. Rather, he fellowships because the elders have more experience, and his sense may not be accurate. We must fellowship with the elders.</p>
<p>When there is fellowship, the elders should not act as if they are sitting on thrones to issue edicts and quick decisions.</p>
<p>When some people hear me say this, they may fully support me because they have such thoughts about the elders. If this is the case, such a person is equally wrong. If a saint is not in spirit, and the elders act like government officials, then fellowship with the elders will be without effect.</p>
<p>The lesson in the Body is of two aspects. The full-timers must learn the sense of life and obey the anointing, and they must learn to fellowship with the elders. The elders must also learn these same lessons, because we are all in the Body and are members one of another. We should never consider that being an elder means that the saints need our approval to determine whether or not they can serve. Some elders are proud; they think that no one can serve without their approval and that not listening to them is to not listen to the church. Such an elder warns the saints that they should be careful to &ldquo;hear the church,&rdquo; as in Matthew 18:17, so that they will not be regarded as a Gentile and a tax collector.</p>
<p>Although a young saint loves the Lord with a pure heart and wants to serve Him full time, his present sense may not be entirely accurate. Nevertheless, his heart is an indication of his willingness to learn the lessons. When he goes to fellowship with the elders, the elders must be in spirit when dealing with him. If the elders are not in spirit, they can damage the brother. When the elders are in spirit, even a brief contact with him will help them determine whether this desire comes more out of excitement than conviction. If this is the case, they can direct him to pray more about the matter in a calm way. If he receives this word, it is good. However, he may react inwardly and decide that the elders are lukewarm because they told him to be calm in prayer. If he disobeys the elders and insists on going to the campus to serve, the organic nature of the Body will be damaged.</p>
<p>The greatest need in the Lord&rsquo;s testimony today is for all the saints to be in fear and trembling and to allow the Body to function organically. We do not have organization, but we move as one Body. We do not have the regulations of an organization, but we have the movement of the Body. This is the only way to bring in the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>We believe that the Lord is blessing us. We might be able to accomplish things by taking the way of organization, but we will lose the testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We can only take the way of the Body, which is the organic way. This requires all the members to live in life, to be under the anointing of the Spirit, and to obey the operation of the Spirit. This is not one-sided; it has many aspects and includes all the believers. As long as we are members of the Body, we must learn to take this organic way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO BE<br />
IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>Suppose, for example, every saint in the church in Kaohsiung is exercising to live in the spirit, and the church in Taipei lacks serving ones. When the elders in Taipei fellowship their need with the church in Kaohsiung, the elders in Kaohsiung should go to the saints who have a burden to serve in the campus work and ask whether they have a burden to serve in Taipei. If they say that they do not have a burden, the elders can ask them to pray. However, the serving ones may insist that they do not need to pray because they are clear concerning the sense of the Spirit; this interrupts the organic function of the Body. Ephesians 4:4 says, &ldquo;One Body and one Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s Spirit is the Spirit of the Body, and the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit is in the Body. When we kill the organic function of the Body, the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit cannot get through in His operation.</p>
<p>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is mainly for moving, not for working. When His operation is hindered, the function of the Body is damaged. This can be compared to the circulation of blood in our body. When this circulation is blocked, the organic functions of our body are damaged. Therefore, we must always be in fear and trembling to live in our spirit. We should never think that recognizing the sense of life once means that we are always right. If in any matter or at any time we do not live in our spirit, we damage the function of life.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the Body. He operates not only within the church in Kaohsiung but also in the church in Taipei. Not only so, He operates in the entire Body. Due to His operation in Taipei, the elders may have a sense to fellowship with the church in Kaohsiung and ask the church to send them some serving ones. When the elders in Kaohsiung fellowship with the saints, the saints must seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading. Even if we had the leading of the Spirit in the past, we dare not assume that the Spirit is still operating in the same way. It is possible that the Holy Spirit wants to move some saints to the campuses in Taipei. Hence, we should open to the fellowship of the elders. We should not refuse their fellowship or insist on following our feelings.</p>
<p>We have no organization among us. Everything is in the fellowship of the Body. However, this does not mean that when the church in Taipei has a need, they should always go to the church in Kaohsiung. Neither does it mean that the elders in Kaohsiung should insist that unless they have more than twenty full-time serving ones, they cannot send three or four to Taipei, because they will suffer a lack. Such methods are organizational. In the past we have fallen into such situations when serving ones were transferred by arrangements. It seemed as though everyone was very obedient, but there was not much organic function. This matter concerns us.</p>
<p>From now on we must be careful when using such words as <em>transfer</em> in relation to serving ones. All our activities must be the spontaneous result of the operation of the Spirit of life who is in the Body. It may be that He operates in Kaohsiung and gives the elders in Kaohsiung a sense to fellowship with Taipei. They may say, &ldquo;We have a few extra full-time serving ones. Does Taipei have a need for some?&rdquo; This is sweet fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TWO ASPECTS OF COORDINATION</h2>
<p>There are two considerations related to the full-time serving ones that should be avoided. The first is related to a locality having more serving ones than is needed. This is often the case when the elders in a church want to improve so that their church is the best. Since all elders want their local church to improve, there is a tendency to want to keep full-timers in a locality to function and serve as needs arise.</p>
<p>Second, we are all human, including the elders, and we have our preferences. The elders who are gentle and do things in a refined manner are troubled by saints who are impatient and quick. The elders might pray, &ldquo;Lord, please do not touch these quick-tempered saints. Do not move them to consecrate themselves to serve full time, because I do not approve of them.&rdquo; Such elders prefer gentle and slow saints to serve full time. However, the elders must put all their preferences aside so that their administrating of the church is by the organic function of the Body, not according to their personality. This matter is a lesson in the Body.</p>
<p>Suppose there are five full-time serving ones in a local church. It may be that the elders do not like two of the serving ones and try at every opportunity to send these two serving ones to a different locality. However, if the co-workers feel that they should remain, the elders must keep them. If the elders do not receive this leading, they will continue to look for an opportunity to send them away. Such a situation will kill the organic function of the Body. Such cases do exist. The elders, the full-timers, and all the other saints must learn the lessons of the Body.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the full-timers must always open to the Lord and seek the leading of the Spirit. The church in Taipei might not ask for additional serving ones, and the elders in Kaohsiung might not feel to send anyone to Taipei. However, as you open to the Lord, He may operate within you to give you the sense to go to Taipei. You must fellowship this sense with the elders. If the elders do not consider this matter before the Lord, they may quickly respond that you are doing very well in the campus work and want to keep you in their locality. This can damage the organic function of the Body.</p>
<p>Even if your elders are willing to send you to Taipei, the saints serving on the campus there might not want full-timers from other localities. Such situations have existed. It is not easy for a full-time serving one from another locality to join an established group. Such a group might accept only those who were raised up locally, because they have their local way of doing things. The local saints should be careful not to refuse anyone who comes to serve, because we are all in one Body bearing the same testimony. An attitude that does not accept others who have come to serve also damages the organic function of the Body.</p>
<p>Just as our physical body can become infected with many illnesses, so the Body of Christ can also have different kinds of sicknesses. If we want to stay healthy, we need to learn many lessons. We must pay our full attention to this. It is especially helpful if we can have open fellowship before the Lord when we come together. Such fellowship is like the circulation of blood, which brings in great healing. It maintains the health of the Body and preserves the Lord&rsquo;s testimony.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ORGANIC FUNCTION<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we prostrate ourselves before You once again and look to You from the depths of our being. We were born natural and have been under all kinds of veils. We ask You once again to open the veils that we may see You, see Your intention, and know Your ways. Lord, we confess that we are still not clear. Visit us and bring us into Your presence. Guide us and grant us instant utterance so that every word we speak is Your expression. Cleanse us with Your precious blood, and keep us always in fellowship with You. Cause us to be poor in spirit and to have a pure heart. We confess that we know nothing and are nothing; You are all we desire. We are all willing to place all that we have on Your altar. We do not want to miss Your presence.</p>
<p>Lead us and speak a clear word to us. Guide us, open us, empty us, and fill us with Your heart&rsquo;s desire so that we would be rid of the old things and become new, so that we would put off the old man and put on the new man. Lord, grant us Your visitation. Cover us and withstand the evil one for us. Withstand his accusations and attacks. Cover us from the disturbing thoughts of Your enemy, and grant us a sober mind. Have mercy on us, and give us clear utterance so that Your way would become brighter to us as we speak. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT ORGANIZATIONAL BUT ORGANIC</h2>
<p>The burden of this message is to have special fellowship concerning the organic function of the Body of Christ. This is a great matter, and it is also a great need. The Body of Christ is an organism, and in this organism there is an organic function. After the early apostles, the organic function of the church as the Body of Christ gradually weakened. People began to consider the church as an organization, that is, a group of people who gather together to take certain actions. They also began to think of Peter as the head of this religion, this organization. Peter is now regarded by some people as the church&rsquo;s first spokesman.</p>
<p>According to this human view, the church is an organization. However, from God&rsquo;s view the church is not an organization; it is the Body of Christ. The Head of this Body is Christ, not Peter. At the most, Peter is only a member of this Body. Some members of the Body may be fingers; these are small members. Other members may be arms; these are larger members. However, whether a believer is a finger or an arm, he is merely one of the members of the Body; he is not the head.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church acknowledges Christ as the Head of His Body. The Catholic Church, however, believes that since Christ has ascended to heaven, He must have a representative on earth, and that the first representative was Peter. The Catholic Church has highly elevated such representatives to be not only representatives of Christ but also to be fathers to the church. Hence, the title <em>pope</em> means &ldquo;father.&rdquo; The Roman Catholic Church says that Peter was the first representative and that after Peter there have been popes throughout the centuries. The Catholic Church teaches that Christ&rsquo;s representative on the earth is a father to the church. This is a great heresy.</p>
<p>We study the Catholic Church so that we can be warned and learn from its mistakes. In principle, we can imperceptibly fall into the same errors. Originally, the Protestant Reformation wanted to overthrow only the heretical teachings in the Catholic Church. Martin Luther did not have an intention to overthrow the papal system. When Luther saw that salvation was by faith and not by works, his burden was to repudiate the heresy of the Catholic Church concerning salvation by works. However, his repudiation of this heresy eventually resulted in a rejection of the papal system.</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries, the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones have confronted the question of whether the church is an organization or a Body. They have considered whether the church is an organized group or an organic body. It is correct to say that the church is not an organized group but the organic Body of Christ. However, we may be clear concerning this only in doctrine, not in practice.</p>
<p>Doctrinally speaking, we are clear that the Body of Christ is organic, but we are not so clear in the application of this truth to the practical service and move of the church. It is crucial for our actions in the Body to be organic, not organizational. As full-time serving ones, we need to be clear that any service that is organizational involves degradation. In order for our service to be organic, we must keep the ground, the position, of the Body.</p>
<p>Many full-timers are not clear concerning whom they should listen to in their service. A professor knows that he should listen to the dean, but many saints who are serving full time do not know to whom they should submit. It is correct to say that our &ldquo;Dean&rdquo; is the Lord, but for two thousand years believers have had little understanding of what it means to listen to the Lord. According to the teaching of the Catholic Church, listening to the pope is equal to listening to the Lord, and according to the Presbyterian Church, listening to the presbytery is equal to listening to the Lord. Throughout the centuries the question of what it means to listen to the Lord has not been resolved.</p><h2 class="head1">SOME ILLUSTRATIONS</h2>
<p>If this question concerning being organic and being organizational is not resolved, we will have no way to go on and no way to make decisions. Therefore, we need to spend some time to first fellowship concerning this matter. We should not be anxious if we are unable to resolve this matter immediately, because God is very patient. His patience is much greater than ours. To Him a thousand years are as one day. He can wait for a thousand years as if they were one day.</p>
<p>We all have many theories concerning being organic and being organizational, but we are not clear in our practice. We learn theories when we go to school, but when we go to work, we must put theories into practice. The people who do not put the theories that they learned into practice are not very successful in society. Some say that to be organizational is to put on airs and issue orders. This definition is close but crude. Some say that to be organic is not to put on airs but to be flexible, pliable, and humble. Can we say that a table is organic because it cannot put on airs? Rubber bands are very flexible, but does this mean they are organic? The shoes we wear are always pressed under our feet, so they are very humble, but are they organic? Some sisters say that anything that is automatic and spontaneous is organic. However, many unbelievers do things automatically and spontaneously.</p>
<p>In theory we know that to serve full time is to live before the Lord and to let the Lord&rsquo;s life live out of us. We also know that the Body of Christ is living, that all the members must function, and that every part must be living. However, we do not necessarily put this into practice. Here are some examples.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Elders</h2>
<p>When a brother has a desire to serve full time, he should have the approval of the elders in his locality. This kind of approval cannot come from a centralized group; instead, it should be a matter of local fellowship. However, if the elders simply stand in their position as elders to decide whether or not a brother should serve full time, their decision will be organizational. To be organic, the elders should not have the sense that they are elders, nor should they stand on their position as elders to make decisions. They have received a commission from the Lord concerning the church, and they should therefore act according to their fellowship with the Lord and according to the sense of life, the anointing, and the inward moving of the Spirit. They should not have the slightest thought that their decisions are supported merely by the fact that they are elders.</p>
<p>Once we act, speak, and handle matters according to the position, name, and status of being elders, we fall into organization. We cannot serve the church based merely on the position and status of being elders; rather, we must serve by being in spirit and obeying the inner sense.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Young Sisters</h2>
<p>A young sister who desires to serve the Lord full time might think that she should submit to elderly saints because she is a young sister. If her decision to submit is based on her youth and her gender, her submission is organizational. This sister should say, &ldquo;Even though I am a sister, I am living in fellowship with the Lord. In this fellowship the Lord leads me step by step, and I am touching the anointing and acting according to the moving of the Spirit.&rdquo; In this fellowship, there will be an organic submission that is not based on her age and gender but on the sense of life and the operation of the Spirit. This kind of obedience is not organizational; it is living and organic.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Cultivating Chinese Morality</h2>
<p>Women in Chinese families were taught in former times to obey their fathers before marriage, to obey their husbands during marriage, and to obey their sons as widows. They were also taught the virtues of fidelity, charm, propriety in speech, and efficiency in needlework. These teachings relate to the organization of a family. These matters are good, and those who do not have the Lord Jesus are helped by them. We all need to maintain order in the country, to behave ourselves properly in society, and to be a decent and upright member in our family; however, these things are organizational. Therefore, in the church we do not talk about cultivating the self, putting the family in order, ruling the country, or living peacefully in the world. Instead, our focus is on exercising our spirit to walk according to the Spirit. Instead of being organizational, we should be organic. Those who are unsaved do not have the Lord, the Triune God, the divine dispensing, or the inward moving and anointing of the Spirit. Those who are saved have these items. We are different from the unbelievers in that we have the Triune God, who is the dispensing God, the anointing God, the operating God, and the sealing God. We have such a mysterious God in us.</p>
<p>The church is not an organization but a Body, an organism. Having the Triune God as our life is what makes this organism distinct. This is true in the church meetings, in our daily life, and in our family situations. When we love our wives, submit to our husbands, or take care of our children, it seems as if we are only cultivating ourselves and putting our family in order, but in fact, having received mercy from the Lord, we are following the inward operation of the Triune God. When a husband speaks to his wife, he should not have the thought, &ldquo;Since I am the head, you must listen to me.&rdquo; Such a thought is organizational. A husband should only have the feeling that the Triune God is in him and that he has to speak according to the operation of the Triune God. This is organic.</p>
<p>When we speak, every part of our body is active. This is organic. If we are organizational, our activities will be organized, and we will be an organization, an organized entity. We must learn to be organic in our service.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING ORGANIC, NOT ORGANIZATIONAL, IN SERVICE</h2>
<p>Before a brother is appointed as an elder, he may have had no sense of being anything but a saint who simply served the church. After being asked to coordinate in the eldership, he may regard himself as an elder, and from that day forward, all his service may be based on an organizational understanding.</p>
<p>We need to ask ourselves whether our service comes out of an organizational or organic understanding. If a sister serves only because she has been given an &ldquo;assignment&rdquo; by the elders, her service is organizational. We have fellowshipped that it is difficult to appoint elders. Prior to being appointed to the eldership, a brother may be good, always exercising to be in spirit and organic. However, the moment he is asked to join the eldership, he becomes organizational. An organic brother can easily become an organizational elder. This principle is true not only in the church but even in the world. As soon as someone is assigned to be in charge or to take the lead, he undergoes a change in disposition and behavior. Prior to the assignment he had one disposition, but after the assignment he behaves organizationally based on his position. This is difficult to avoid.</p>
<p>We should not have group leaders and deputy group leaders, or responsible ones and coordinators, because as soon as there is such an arrangement, everything becomes organizational. In 1976 we built a huge meeting hall in Anaheim, California, that could seat four thousand people, but we did not have much arrangement for service related to the building. Taking advantage of this situation, a brother began to arrange service groups. Eventually, he built up a pyramidal organization. Initially, the brothers were organic, but soon everyone became organizational. One day I told the brothers in the elders&rsquo; meeting to abolish and tear down all the service groups. The elders asked, &ldquo;How will the saints serve?&rdquo; And I responded, &ldquo;Whoever has the heart will come to serve; whoever does not have the heart will not serve.&rdquo; After that, our service became living, and the number of serving ones was not reduced.</p>
<p>Fallen people are organizational by birth, and they form groups or communities, which are also organizations. However, the Bible shows that God does not want an organization; God wants an organism. Revelation speaks of the messengers of the churches. Anyone who is organic, in the spirit, and in life is a messenger of the church. We need to be clear that we should not serve organizationally; instead, we should serve organically. Our service is not organizational; it is organic. When this basic issue is resolved, it is easy to deal with other matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING ORGANIC,<br />
NOT ORGANIZATIONAL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Relationship between Apostles and Elders</h2>
<p>Influenced by the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, Christianity has begun to notice 1 Corinthians 12:28, which says, &ldquo;God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.&rdquo; I was born in Christianity. Since my youth I listened to preaching every Lord&rsquo;s Day, but I had never heard a pastor speak of apostles, prophets, and teachers. It was not until the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was raised up in China that Brother Nee took the lead to speak about these things and opened the door for us. Today in Christianity, especially in the East, people speak of apostles, prophets, and teachers, but they are not clear concerning what apostles, prophets, and teachers are. Even the saints among us are not clear, and some of our co-workers are not clear. What are apostles, prophets, and teachers? What are elders and full-time co-workers? What is the relationship between apostles and elders and between full-time co-workers and elders? The co-workers and elders need to be clear concerning these relationships.</p>
<p>The church in Jerusalem was the first church established on the earth. On the one hand, it was established by the Lord, and on the other hand, it was established by the first group of apostles through their preaching of the gospel. In Acts 2 Peter, standing with the eleven apostles, preached the gospel to the multitude, and about three thousand were saved. These three thousand new believers, in addition to the one hundred twenty disciples, became the church in Jerusalem (vv. 14-41; 1:15). Therefore, the first church was established by the twelve apostles. Although the Bible does not speak of the appointment of elders in Jerusalem, surely there were elders. Although it is not easy to see, the apostles who established the church in Jerusalem were the elders there, because it was through them that the three thousand were saved.</p>
<p>A large family may consist of multiple generations, including a grandfather, twelve sons, and the children of the twelve sons. When the grandfather dies, the twelve sons, that is, the second generation, become the elders. There is no need for them to be appointed, because it is clear to everyone in the family. Likewise, when the church was established at Pentecost, three thousand souls were saved, and afterward another five thousand were saved. There was no need to appoint elders, because it was obvious to all the believers that Peter and the other eleven apostles were the elders. In every family the children know who the father is.</p>
<p>Concerning the appointment of elders, the Bible does not say that elders were appointed in the church in Jerusalem. The elders were produced spontaneously, and they were the twelve apostles. Like the father in a family, they did not need to be appointed. The Bible first speaks of the appointment of elders in Acts 14:21-23, where Paul and Barnabas appointed elders in the churches in Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch. When Paul and Barnabas first passed through these places, they preached the gospel and raised up churches. After less than a year, they returned to appoint elders in every church.</p>
<p>Elders were appointed in every place where there was a group of believers meeting together as the church. Even though the believers were young, they were the church. Paul and his co-workers could not remain in these places to care for the churches; they had to leave. Consequently, there was a need for some to take care of the local affairs, so it was necessary to appoint elders in the churches that had been established for less than one year. Hence, the elders appointed could not have been very mature. They must have been considered as elders because they were a little more mature than the other believers in their locality. In order to avoid confusion, the apostles appointed elders in the churches, even elders who were not very mature or experienced. They were appointed elders because they were more mature compared to the other saints.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning Young Full-timers</h2>
<p>In his second ministry journey, Paul went to Lystra, and the church recommended a young man named Timothy (16:1-2). Timothy can be considered the first young full-timer among Paul&rsquo;s co-workers. He was not brought up by Paul; instead, he was brought up and recommended to Paul by a local church. In 1 Timothy Paul said to him, &ldquo;Do not neglect the gift which is in you, which was given to you by means of prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery&rdquo; (4:14). The presbytery in this verse refers to the elders in Lystra who were only relatively mature. Paul did not lay hands on Timothy by himself; he did this together with the local elders in Lystra. Based on their laying on of hands, Timothy was under the elders. Notwithstanding this, Paul later charged Timothy to appoint elders. Initially, Timothy, a full-timer, was like an apprentice under the elders. After a period of time, he became an apostle and was qualified to appoint elders. When he began to serve full time, his service was based on the laying on of the hands of the elders. But at a certain time he had the maturity to appoint elders and could lay hands on the elders (5:22). Even an accusation from two or three witnesses against an elder could be presented to Timothy (v. 19). This means that a charge against an elder was brought to Timothy. Paul also told Timothy that when an elder sinned, he should reprove the elder before all, not privately (v. 20). Paul did not play politics. If a rebuke was needed, Paul indicated that it should be done publicly. This is different from our present practice. Paul&rsquo;s practice was to publicly rebuke any elder who sinned so that other elders might hear and be warned. Regrettably, such practices have been replaced by a willingness to be political. We play politics, but Paul did not.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Raising Up Prophets and Teachers</h2>
<p>In the local church in Antioch there were prophets and teachers who were raised up by the Holy Spirit (Acts 13:1-2). Barnabas was a Levite (4:36). He belonged to the priestly tribe, and he was raised up by the Holy Spirit after his salvation. Acts 13 says that Barnabas was one of the prophets and teachers in Antioch. It is difficult for us to determine whether he was a prophet or a teacher. However, whether he was a prophet or a teacher, he was not appointed by men; he was raised up by the Holy Spirit. Saul of Tarsus, who once opposed the churches, was among these prophets and teachers. After he was gained by the Lord, his whole being was revolutionized, and he began to preach the Lord Jesus. Even though the disciples were fearful of Paul, Barnabas contacted him, served with him in the work, and ministered together with him. Thus, Paul became one of the prophets and teachers in Antioch. Both Barnabas and Paul were not appointed by men. This is strong proof that prophets and teachers are not appointed by men. They are not like today&rsquo;s pastors who need to be ordained by human hands.</p>
<p>The prophets and teachers in Acts 13 were appointed by the Holy Spirit. We do not know when they were appointed by the Holy Spirit. The Bible says only that there were prophets and teachers in the church life in Antioch. As they were ministering to the Lord, the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them&rdquo; (v. 2). The moment they set out for the ministry, they became apostles. Even as apostles, they were not sent out by men but were appointed by the Holy Spirit to preach the gospel. The result of their gospel preaching was the raising up of local churches. Afterward, they appointed elders in the churches.</p>
<p>After churches came into existence and elders were appointed, young people who loved the Lord and desired to serve Him full time were raised up in these localities. Timothy is an example. After the church in Lystra was raised up, the local elders laid hands on a young full-timer named Timothy. After he participated in the work and gained experience, he was charged to appoint elders by the laying on of his hands. If an elder in a locality sinned, the witnesses could go to Timothy to present their accusation against the sinning elder.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY SPIRIT&rsquo;S ORGANIC ACTIONS</h2>
<p>The record in the Bible does not reveal the development of an organization. Acts 13 clearly says, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me...They then, having been sent out by the Holy Spirit...&rdquo; (vv. 2, 4). This shows that the setting apart and the sending out of the apostles was organic. Furthermore, Paul appointed elders in every city. This seems to be organizational, but in 20:28 Paul said, &ldquo;Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers.&rdquo; This shows that the appointment of the elders was by the Holy Spirit. It was the Holy Spirit who appointed the elders to be overseers of the flock to shepherd the church of God. In chapter 14 Paul appointed elders in every church (v. 23), but in chapter 20 he said that the Holy Spirit appointed the elders. This proves that when Paul appointed the elders, he was in spirit. Therefore, he was able to say that his action was the action of the Holy Spirit. Paul did not say that he had the position to appoint elders as an apostle sent by the Lord. If this was the case, the elders he appointed would not have been the elders the Holy Spirit appointed.</p>
<p>Concerning the appointment of elders, we should be able to say with confidence that the elders we appoint are elders appointed by the Holy Spirit. In 2 Timothy 1:6 Paul referred to his laying on of hands, saying, &ldquo;Fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.&rdquo; Timothy needed to fan into flame the gift he received through the laying on of Paul&rsquo;s hands. When the elders and Paul laid hands on Timothy, a gift was bestowed on him. This indicates that the laying on of hands was the operation of the Holy Spirit. In other words, the laying on of hands by the presbytery and Paul was organic, not organizational. It was an organic action of the Body of Christ. Therefore, a spiritual gift was transmitted from the Body of Christ into Timothy. This proves that this action was not organizational; it was absolutely organic.</p>
<p>Timothy was a young person, yet Paul charged him, saying, &ldquo;Let no one despise your youth&rdquo; (1 Tim. 4:12). Timothy was a young apostle, but he could appoint elders, reprove elders, and even remove someone from the eldership. Paul encouraged Timothy not to be timid, because God had not given Timothy a spirit of cowardice but of power, love, and sobermindedness (2 Tim. 1:7). Paul also charged him to fan that gift into flame (v. 6). All the charges in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles to Timothy were based upon this gift. The gift in Timothy&rsquo;s spirit was not a gift of cowardice, but it needed to be fanned into flame. Therefore, Timothy did not carry out the charges in these Epistles by his own effort but by the gift that was fanned into flame, that is, by his burning spirit. His actions were not organizational; they were organic.</p>
<p>Paul also said that Timothy should know how to conduct himself in the house of God based on the Epistles Paul had written (1 Tim. 3:15). Just as Timothy received this word from Paul, the elders need to receive this word so that we may know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God, which is the church of the living God. In the house of God, the church of the living God, we cannot be organizational. We can only be organic. The house of God is the church of the living God; it is the pillar and base of the truth. The house of God is also the great mystery of godliness&mdash;God manifested in the flesh (vv. 15-16). This house is God manifested in the flesh. Our activities in the house of God must not be according to organization. Instead, everything we do in the house of God must be organic; it must be according to the mysterious manifestation of God in the flesh. This is not organizational; it is organic.</p>
<p>We truly hope that while leading the churches, the elders in all the localities would not forget that we are in the house of the living God. We are not in an organization, not in the denominations, much less in a social organization. We are in the house of the living God, which is the manifestation of God in the flesh. Hence, when we serve as elders, all our actions and decisions must be the manifestation of the living God&mdash;they must be organic. We all should have this basic knowledge. According to history, the apostle joined the presbytery to lay hands on a young full-timer. Later, this young full-timer could appoint elders, reprove elders, and remove someone from the eldership. All these matters were not done organizationally. They were organic.</p><h2 class="head1">OVERTHROWING THE CONCEPT OF ORGANIZATION</h2>
<p>Now we will consider the practical application of our fellowship. Who should the young full-time serving ones listen to in their service? Suppose that in a local church there are some co-workers and many young full-time serving ones. Who should the young ones listen to? This question is difficult to answer, because often both the elders and the co-workers have laid hands on them. This is also difficult because even though the full-timers were under the elders who laid hands on them, they may later be charged to appoint elders. God has no thought of organization. The elders laid hands on Timothy, but even when Timothy was young, Paul exhorted him to not let anyone despise his youth, and Paul also charged him to lay hands on the elders. Shortly after the elders laid hands on him, Timothy was qualified to lay hands on the elders. With just this one example, God completely demolished the concept of organization.</p>
<p>The elders laid hands on Timothy, but soon after that Timothy was charged to lay hands on the elders. This is anti-organization. Timothy was probably saved through the elders&rsquo; preaching of the gospel, and he was probably baptized by the elders. It was also the elders who commended Timothy to Paul and laid hands on him together with Paul. Thus, if the church and the work were based on the concept of organization, the elders would be his seniors, and he would be their junior. But the Lord has overthrown organization. The elders who laid hands on Timothy were not qualified to appoint elders; instead, Timothy, who received the elders&rsquo; laying on of hands, was qualified to appoint elders. When an elder sinned, Timothy even had the position and qualification to receive an accusation against the elder from two or three witnesses (5:19). Suppose the sinning elder was the one who preached the gospel to Timothy, led him to be saved, baptized him, commended him to Paul, and laid hands on him. The elder could say that he was above Timothy and that Timothy was beneath him. This is an organizational concept. It is organizational to consider oneself the patron of a serving one. God&rsquo;s ways are particular. He terminates all organizational concepts and practices.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is not organizational; it is organic. Timothy was not raised up by Paul. Rather, he was raised up by the church in Lystra and then recommended to Paul. This was an organic procedure. Paul did not receive Timothy according to organization. Paul, together with the elders, laid hands on Timothy. The laying on of hands was not organizational; it was organic. When Paul laid hands on others, it was according to the operation of the Holy Spirit. When he and the elders laid hands on others, it was an action of the Body. Therefore, there was a flow in the Body that flowed into this full-timer and became a gift within him. These matters were organic, not organizational. Many ordinations are organizational. People are given a position and a name without the organic operation of the Spirit, but the laying on of hands in the Body of Christ is an organic operation.</p>
<p>The laying on of hands by Paul and the elders was an action of the Body. In the Body the Holy Spirit operates in newly consecrated full-timers to constitute them as gifts. When this gift was manifested in Timothy, he appointed elders and laid hands on them according to his organic function. It was not because of his position that two or three witnesses could bring an accusation against an elder to Timothy; it was because of his organic function. Timothy received the laying on of hands from the elders according to the organic function of the Body; likewise, he appointed elders and laid hands on them according to the same organic function. It was in this same organic function in the Body that he could rebuke a sinning elder. All these matters are organic; they are not organizational.</p>
<p>This should be our practice today. The young full-timers that are raised up in the church in Taichung do not need to be approved by the brothers in Taipei. Rather, the brothers in Taichung, as members of the Body of Christ, can consider, through the operation of the Spirit, whether the saints are suitable to serve full time. This is an organic matter; it is not organizational. Whether or not this matter is organic depends on the way the elders handle it. If they stand merely in the position as elders, their action will be organizational. If they live and act as organic members of the Body by exercising their spirit to contact the saints and minister life to them, their action will be organic. Having been raised up in a church and also considered and confirmed by the elders in that church, the full-timers should be willing to submit themselves to the elders. However, when making arrangements concerning the full-timers, the elders should not stand merely in a position as elders and make arrangements; rather, they should exercise their organic function in the Body. Furthermore, the serving ones should listen to the elders but not merely because they are young. Otherwise, their submission will be organizational. Both the serving ones and the elders need to serve together in the church in life and under the anointing.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY TAKING THE WAY<br />
OF THE ORGANIC BODY</h2>
<p>Christianity today is deformed and organizational. It forms committees to prepare budgets and raise funds to hire workers. If they cannot hire people who are trained, they send young people to seminaries for training and then assign work to them. We cannot take this way. We are the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover the Body of Christ; it is to recover an organism, not an organization. We have many co-workers and churches, and young people are being raised up to serve the Lord full time. We have the resources, but we should not take the way of organization, that is, the way of a corporation. We should take the organic way, the way of the Body. If we take the way of a corporation, we will become a denomination. This crucial matter must be clearly presented to the brothers and sisters. We must not go backward; we have only one way&mdash;the way of the organic Body. We must advance boldly.</p>
<p>Being organic depends mainly on the elders. The elders must forget that they are elders in their actions, intentions, and concepts. The elders are not bureaucrats holding official posts. The elders exist because there is the need for arrangement in the church services to avoid confusion. The elders should not replace the prophets or the teachers. The eldership does not involve rank; it involves only responsibility. Therefore, we should not turn the function of an elder into a mere title. An elder is a steward who takes care of the affairs of the church. For example, the elders make arrangements for different kinds of meetings, including schedules and how to lead the saints in the meetings. The Bible clearly says that the elders should not lord it over others but should be patterns of the flock (1 Pet. 5:3). The elders should forget position and status. They should not call themselves elders. They should only be patterns of the flock. In this way we will not repeat the mistakes of Christianity, nor will we take the way of organization. Rather, we will let the Holy Spirit have the ground in us to raise up our organic function.</p>
<p>In addition, the young full-timers should learn the proper way to coordinate in the church. Their submission should involve an organic operation that is much more than their human submission to parents or teachers. This is possible because the Triune God is in us. He is our life and our Lord. He is living. He can be our moment-by-moment, inward leading. We should exercise to live in the Lord. Then instead of being in a religious organization, we will be living members of the living Body of Christ. In this way our actions will be organic functions. Otherwise, we will be merely organizational. We should all be living members of an organism. All our walk and actions should issue from organic functions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD<br />
AND CARRYING OUT<br />
THE ORGANIC FUNCTION OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 7:12 Paul said, &ldquo;To the rest I say, I, not the Lord.&rdquo; Paul boldly declared that his words in verse 12 were not the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. Is his declaration organic or organizational? According to organizational thinking, the Corinthian believers could have told Paul not to speak until Christ, the Head, spoke. Since our knowledge concerning service may not be thorough, we may have concepts that we think are spiritual but are actually organizational. For example, we may say that it is organizational to do something that the Lord has not told us to do. We often say that we should not take any action until we have prayed and fellowshipped thoroughly. However, it seems that in 1 Corinthians 7 Paul had not prayed thoroughly, because it was he, not the Lord, who was speaking. Here, we have to change our concept. Paul was not as spiritual as we are, nor did he pretend to be spiritual. He clearly indicated that it was he, not the Lord, who was speaking. Then in verse 25, concerning virgins, he said, &ldquo;I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who has been shown mercy by the Lord to be faithful.&rdquo; Our opinions are destructive, yet Paul gave his opinion without the Lord&rsquo;s commandment. If I said, &ldquo;Brothers, I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion,&rdquo; I am afraid that everyone would disagree with me.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 7:40 Paul said, &ldquo;According to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&rdquo; This is marvelous. It does not seem logical that Paul could have the Spirit of God without the Lord speaking. However, the significance of Paul&rsquo;s word is that we should not be organizational, nor should we say, &ldquo;I am doing this because the Lord said so.&rdquo; Paul spoke, but not the Lord. Paul did not have the Lord&rsquo;s commandment, but he gave his opinion. Paul could do this because he had the Spirit of God. As a person who was one spirit with the Lord, his walk was in spirit. Since he walked in spirit, he disregarded organizational position and religious concepts. He was joined to the Lord as one, and his speaking and acting were organic functions of the Body. Paul did not have any position, nor did he act according to religious teachings. Rather, he was joined to the Lord as one spirit and therefore had an organic function in the Body.</p>
<p>We need to have a deeper knowledge concerning spiritual matters. Christianity teaches people merely to keep a position and obey orders; hence, it is organizational. When I speak, my whole body moves. No member of my body has the concept or thought of keeping a position or obeying commands. The move of my body is organic. After this fellowship, we should be clear that our service is not a matter of keeping a position or obeying commands. Our service is a matter of having the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Lord; this is to be like Paul, who said, &ldquo;I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&rdquo; If we are one spirit with the Lord, instead of keeping a position or merely obeying commands, we will exercise our organic function. If we are clear concerning this, we will be greatly blessed and not have any problems. At the same time, we will know our position in the Body. We will know to whom we should listen; that is, we will listen to the organic function of the Body, and our living will be in the Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ORGANIC FUNCTION<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORGANIC FUNCTION OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>All activities in human society are organized. For example, among human beings, the cultivation of young people requires organization. In the church, however, how should we produce workers to meet the need of spreading? Paul and Timothy are good examples. We will not use Peter as an example, because he was appointed by the Lord Jesus while the Lord was in the flesh. Since we do not have the Lord&rsquo;s physical presence with us today, we cannot take Peter&rsquo;s experience as an example. The Bible shows that after the Lord Jesus appointed the twelve apostles while He was in the flesh, He appointed Barnabas and Paul according to His invisible presence and in His status as the ascended Head. Barnabas and Paul were appointed as apostles without any element of human work or organization. They were appointed by the organic operation of the Lord as the Spirit.</p>
<p>Paul was called when he met the Lord on the way to Damascus (Acts 9:1-6; 26:12-18). After his conversion he served the Lord fervently, and his function was manifested. The Lord told Paul only that he would be sent to the Gentiles. Besides this, the Lord did not tell him what to do. The Bible does not reveal how the Lord appointed Paul. The New Testament discloses very little about how the Lord&rsquo;s workers were appointed or how they worked, because such a record would be used for organizational purposes.</p>
<p>After Paul met the Lord, he spontaneously and organically followed the Lord according to the divine life he had received from the Lord. When Ananias sought out Paul, he also was carrying out his organic function as a member of the Body of Christ and not because he was sent by men. He laid hands on Paul and told Paul what the Lord wanted him to do (9:10-19). When Paul went to Jerusalem, the disciples in Jerusalem were afraid to contact him because he had persecuted the church. Eventually, Barnabas contacted him. This contact came out of Barnabas&rsquo;s exercise of his organic function in the Body, not from Peter&rsquo;s instruction (vv. 20-28).</p>
<p>In Acts 9 Paul left Jerusalem and returned to Tarsus. In chapter 11 some of the disciples from Jerusalem, who were scattered abroad, went forth proclaiming the gospel, reaching as far as Antioch. Believers were raised up in places even among the Gentiles. Barnabas, according to his organic function in the Body, was sent from Jerusalem to visit the believers as far as Antioch. After visiting the believers, Barnabas went forth to Tarsus, found Paul, and brought him to Antioch, where he and Paul remained. In chapter 13 Paul was one of the prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch. Paul may have been perfected through Barnabas, since it was Barnabas who brought Paul into the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Acts 13 shows that in the church in Antioch there were five prophets and teachers, the first being Barnabas and the last Paul. There is no mention of elders and deacons. As the prophets and teachers were ministering to the Lord, the Holy Spirit said that Barnabas and Paul should be set apart and sent out to do the Lord&rsquo;s work (v. 2). This was the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s operation. The Bible refers to Barnabas and Paul as apostles when they were sent out (14:4, 14). Their first journey ended in chapter 14 when they returned to Antioch (v. 26). In his second journey Paul went to Lystra, and there he met Timothy (16:1).</p>
<p>The church in Lystra was established by Paul in his first journey, and elders were appointed there within a short time (14:6-7, 21-23). Not long afterward Paul passed through again, and the brothers commended Timothy to him. According to the Epistles to Timothy, Paul and the elders in Lystra laid hands on Timothy (1 Tim. 4:14; 2 Tim. 1:6). Timothy was a young full-timer who had a desire to serve God. He was raised up by a local church, and he was recommended to the apostle by the elders. Their laying on of hands was not an ordination; to be ordained is organizational. The laying on of hands indicates identification and fellowship, in which the Spirit of life is imparted for the purpose of bestowing a spiritual gift.</p>
<p>Timothy&rsquo;s spiritual gift was not manifest at the beginning of his service. In Acts 17 Timothy&rsquo;s function was manifested while they were in Greece. Paul mentioned Silvanus, Silas, and Timothy as his co-workers when he wrote his first Epistle to the Thessalonians (1:1; Acts 18:1, 5; 2 Cor. 1:19). In 1 Thessalonians Paul says that they were apostles (2:6). In Acts 16 Timothy was still young, but in chapter 18 he was considered to be an apostle. In 1 Timothy 5:19 Paul indicates that an accusation against an elder could be submitted to Timothy, which means that he was able to properly respond to accusations against elders. Surely this shows that the young Timothy had been perfected to be an apostle.</p><h2 class="head1">PERFECTING THE YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
TO TAKE THE BODY AS THEIR PROTECTION</h2>
<p>We have many young people who have a desire to serve full time. The way for us to perfect them is to hand them over to the Body, just as Timothy was handed over to the Body. Then the church in Lystra recommended Timothy and handed him over to the apostle. The way to perfect is clearly presented: the apostle with the elders and the elders in coordination with the apostle were responsible for his perfection. Perfection is by the Body. The Body perfects the young people, and the Body becomes their protection.</p>
<p>The church in Lystra commended Timothy to Paul. Then the elders and Paul laid hands on Timothy, thereby placing him under the care of the church, under the elders. Without the function of the elders, Timothy would not have been fully attached to the Body. Even if Paul had been able to provide him with some perfection by himself, Timothy could have had an improper attitude toward the church and the elders. This shows God&rsquo;s wisdom and the work of the Holy Spirit. Paul did not lay hands on Timothy by himself. If he had done this, his actions would not have been according to the principle of the Body. Rather, he laid hands on Timothy together with the elders of the church. This shows that Timothy was perfected by the apostle with the church and by the church in coordination with the apostle. After Timothy was perfected, he was able to lay hands on others and even to respond properly to accusations against elders. However, he was not proud toward the elders and the church, because the elders had laid hands on him. Such a relationship is crucial.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING FROM OUR HISTORY</h2>
<p>I went to Shanghai in 1946. At the end of the year I moved there and began coordinating with the brothers in the work and in leading the church. At the time there was a group of students who were being perfected under my ministry. In 1949 I moved to Taiwan, and according to the arrangement in the work, this group of young people also came to Taiwan. I now regret that my perfecting work was not as complete as Paul&rsquo;s perfecting work on Timothy. The young people were short of certain elements. The work committed them into my hands for their perfecting, so they came to Taiwan. I assigned three of them to be under the leading of the brothers in Kaohsiung. However, in less than a year the responsible brothers told me that they had no way to lead the young brothers, because they falsely claimed that they had been perfected by Brother Nee. This was not accurate. Brother Nee did not minister for six years, from 1942 to 1948, and the church in Shanghai was restored only after the surrender of Japan in 1946. At that time, we began with about a hundred saints. A year later we began the practice of the whole church preaching the gospel, and hundreds of people were baptized. By the summer of 1947 the church in Shanghai held the bread-breaking meeting in seventeen districts. Therefore, these young people were actually under my perfection.</p>
<p>The church in Shanghai experienced a revival in the spring of 1948. Responsible brothers from the north, the northeast, the interior provinces as far as Hankow, and from the south as far as Kwangchow (Canton) wanted to come to Shanghai to see the revival. However, Brother Nee had not yet resumed his ministry; he was still in Foochow. Therefore, I went to Foochow to help with the resumption of his ministry, and I also accompanied him to Shanghai. In the resumption meetings we enjoyed the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Therefore, Brother Nee decided that those who were present in the meetings should go to Kuling to be in his training, and that I should remain in Shanghai to lead the church. The next year, 1949, the civil war within China became critical, and government agencies were moved from Shanghai to Taiwan. I also came to Taiwan.</p>
<p>This history shows that the young brothers were not led by Brother Nee. Since they were not able to be perfected in the locality where they were, I brought them to Taipei and continued to lead and perfect them. However, I did not follow Paul&rsquo;s example to coordinate with the elders in perfecting them, and they became detached from the church. Eventually, they left even though they were responsible for many service-related functions in the churches. As a result of their pride, they criticized the other co-workers, and we were unable to rescue them.</p>
<p>In 1954 and 1955 some brothers proposed that we invite Brother T. Austin-Sparks to come to Taiwan. He came in 1955 and again in 1957. After his second visit we had problems. As I look back, I see that the source of the problems was a lack in perfecting. This gave ground for pride to take root in those young brothers. Because they were not like Timothy, problems occurred. After Brother Sparks&rsquo;s visit, they began to say that they had seen a glorious vision of the full Christ. This situation caused the greatest wounds in our history in Taiwan. To this day we can still see the tragic result of these divisions in the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>We must seriously consider the way to perfect the young people. If there are loopholes in our perfecting, problems will arise. This is similar to cultivating fruit trees in an orchard. If we do not properly cultivate the trees, there will be problems: bugs will eat the leaves and branches, and birds will eat the fruit. Therefore, we need to pay much attention to the perfecting of the young people. The young brothers and sisters have a great future, but if their perfecting is flawed, they will not be safeguarded and protected. If there are loopholes, disasters will be unavoidable. This will damage the future of their whole life.</p>
<p>Problems arose, and I warned the brothers that if they left, they would continually divide among themselves. More than twenty years have passed, and my word has proved true. Among those few brothers, no two are coordinating together; they are all separated from one another. They damaged the Body of Christ and created division. As a result, they are divided, and they are ruined. It is not that they did not have light or that they did not see the church. Their speaking concerning the ground of the church was clear. They know that there is only one Body and that there is only one church in the universe. They know that the expression of the church is in the principle of one church in one city. Today they are in America, but it has been difficult for them to preach the truth there. They may lead some students to salvation, but they cannot speak the truth concerning the church, because they do not have the proper standing.</p>
<p>This can be compared to the difficulty of divorced persons being reconciled with their former spouses. When these brothers were with us, they were &ldquo;married&rdquo; to the church, but now they are &ldquo;divorced&rdquo; from the church. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, some are still willing to read our books; thus, they still have a way to receive some supply. In the early days they declared that they were helped by Brother Sparks to see and know the vision of the full Christ, but now they have nothing. It is a great mistake to be critical of others and to look down on others.</p><h2 class="head1">THE YOUNG SERVING ONES NEEDING<br />
TO BE FEARFUL OF BEING PROUD</h2>
<p>The future of the young serving ones is limitless. The Lord will give a considerable number of them important services in the carrying out of His commission. However, when they are given some responsibility, their pride will become a source of temptation. Thus, they should be fearful of their pride.</p>
<p>In 1950 Brother Nee went to Hong Kong and brought a revival to the church. He sent me a telegram asking me to come to Hong Kong and help lead the service of the church, including that of the elders, co-workers, and deacons. I was absent from one of the revival meetings, but during this meeting Brother Nee said, &ldquo;Although Brother Lee has been used by the Lord, he is not proud.&rdquo; Please forgive me for speaking about myself. Brother Nee spoke this word as a warning so that those who had handed themselves over to the Lord would have no expectation of a future for themselves. The Lord will have mercy on those who truly give themselves to Him, and He will perfect them to be useful. However, once a person becomes useful, it is easy for him to become proud. Pride is a worm that destroys us by devouring us from within.</p>
<p>The brothers who became a problem were not fearful of the element of their pride. When they were with us, they listened to me but despised the other co-workers. This is pride. In the future you may be supplied with a great measure of grace by the Lord, and He may perfect you in order to use you to a great extent. After accomplishing such a work, you should still go before the Lord and say, &ldquo;I am an unprofitable slave; I have done what I ought to have done&rdquo; (cf. Luke 17:10). Even if you have seen the vision of Christ, you should not think that others have not seen it. It is wrong to say that others have no vision. If you have seen a vision and know the Lord&rsquo;s way, you will not intimidate others or promote yourself. Instead, you should walk quietly according to the Spirit and minister Christ in the meetings of the church in your locality.</p>
<p>If a brother is raised up in a local church, other churches will learn about him, even if he has a quiet manner. The churches will surely hear about him and welcome him. In this way he will be blessed, and the churches will also be blessed, supplied, and established through him. However, he should be fearful of becoming proud or of seeking a way to advance. The doors that the Lord wants to open will be automatically opened. May the Lord cover me with His precious blood. I have the position to speak such a word, because I am leading the churches, and I have never sought to advance myself. It was not my intention to work in the United States. In 1938 I received two checks: one check was for my traveling expenses to America, and the other was to cover one year&rsquo;s expenses for my family. At that time I did not have the Lord&rsquo;s leading to go to America. But twenty years later, in 1958, by the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement I was invited to London and Denmark, and I passed through America.</p>
<p>If you have Christ and can minister Christ, you do not need to look for openings; doors will open for you. Joseph had an abundance of grain, so all the earth came to him to buy grain. All five continents are open to the testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. My only concern is that we are not perfected. When we are perfected, we can be sent out. There are too many places in need of ones who can be sent. It would not be too much to send three or four hundred to South America. Many places in Europe are also waiting. We must always be afraid of arrogance and pride, especially if we have some spiritual constitution and gift. We must always remain in humility.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT FORMING PARTIES<br />
WITHIN THE UNIQUE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>I have often considered the incident with the brothers who stirred up the trouble in Taiwan, because it left a great wound. Not only did the brothers make the mistake of being proud, they also formed themselves into a party. They had no secrets among themselves, but they were tightlipped with the other co-workers. In the Body of Christ the members should not form parties. There cannot be a &ldquo;small Body&rdquo; within the Body. If there is a &ldquo;small Body&rdquo; within the Body, it will become a cancer. Eventually, the situation among those brothers became cancerous, and it devastated the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Whether we are in Taichung, London, or Hong Kong, we should not try to gain some who would follow us. This is to form a small circle within the Body, and it is extremely dangerous. This is like two sisters who are willing to tell each other their secrets but who are unwilling to speak to their mother. Relationships like this need to be terminated. We are in one universal Body, and there should be no small circles within the one large circle of the Body. In the Body there is no such thing as one member being dearer or nearer to another member.</p>
<p>I began serving the Lord in Chefoo more than fifty years ago, but I do not have any co-workers with whom I have an intimate, personal relationship. Brother Chang has served with me for over fifty years, and Brother Liu has coordinated with me in the ministry of the word. Many saints probably think that these brothers are very dear to me. If you were to ask them, they would say that I have given them &ldquo;hot and sour soup,&rdquo; not &ldquo;sweet soymilk.&rdquo; It is the same in the United States; I do not have any co-workers with whom I am intimate on a personal level.</p>
<p>There are several co-workers who have left us. Some of them accused me of being wrong, while saying that they were right. It is strange that those who say that they are right often have the most difficulty working with others. But even though I am wrong, I have many co-workers. Nevertheless, I am not intimate with any of them. I do not give them &ldquo;sweet soymilk&rdquo; to drink; rather, I give everyone &ldquo;hot and sour soup.&rdquo; Those who are new full-timers should realize that I do not serve &ldquo;sweet soymilk.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">ONE BODY, ONE WORK, AND ONE WAY OF RECOVERY</h2>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ, and the Body is uniquely one. The Lord desires to recover this one Body. You should not think that I control people or try to wield power over the whole earth. When we were in Shanghai and Brother Nee was leading the church, some gifted ones came into our midst. They could preach the gospel and work, and they knew that the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was right. However, in their view, this &ldquo;territory&rdquo; was &ldquo;occupied&rdquo; by Brother Nee, and so by remaining in the recovery, they would have no way to gain their own territory. Eventually, they left the recovery, and some of them became famous preachers. Many of the Chinese evangelists who are now famous were among us at one time. Some formed their own groups, others established their own work, and still others gained honorary doctorate degrees. They knew that this was the Lord&rsquo;s unique way, but they wanted their own work.</p>
<p>There is only one way, one Body, and one recovery of the Lord. When Brother Nee was raised up, he pioneered the way, and it was difficult. We are his successors. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace I can say that when Brother Nee was taking the lead, I was submissive and did not dissent. Although he and I were only two years apart, I never had an opinion about him. I never dissented in the co-workers&rsquo; meetings. In the work of the ministry, I did whatever I was asked to do; I had no opinion. I have often said that I can submit to any person because I can submit to one person. Brother Nee showed me the way of the recovery, and for this reason I submitted to him.</p>
<p>In 1934 Brother Nee was going to be married in Hangchow, and he asked me to be his best man. The marriage stirred up a great turmoil for him. When he came to Shanghai, we met, and I tried to comfort him, saying, &ldquo;Brother Nee, there is no natural friendship between us. I am taking this way because you have led me to see that this is the Lord&rsquo;s way. Please be at peace, even if you give up this way, I will still take this way. I am taking this way not because there is a relationship between us, but because I have seen that this is the Lord&rsquo;s way. Even if you give it up, I will still take it.&rdquo; I hope the young brothers and sisters would see this way and would be able to say to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you have led us to take this way, but we want to tell you that even if you give it up, we will still take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our God is uniquely one, and all the things in the universe created by Him are one in substance. Likewise, everything related to the church is intrinsically one. Ephesians 4:4-6 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father of all. Christianity is in a situation of apostasy because its numerous divisions deny this oneness. However, the Lord&rsquo;s church is essentially one. We are here to bear the testimony of oneness. We need to see that the Lord&rsquo;s church is one, the Lord&rsquo;s Body is one, and the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is one. If I gave you &ldquo;sweet soymilk&rdquo; to drink every day, it would be easy to say that this is the church, but since I give you &ldquo;hot and sour soup,&rdquo; it is not as easy to say that this is the church. When things are palatable for some saints, they speak loudly and highly of the church, but when they taste things that are &ldquo;hot and spicy,&rdquo; they often leave and begin to speak differently. If we are thoughtful and our eyes are opened, we will not be easily deceived. We need to know why we are here; otherwise, we will leave this way and come to a dead end.</p>
<p>Those who were with us and then left tried to do another work. Eventually, the work they accomplished became dissipated; it was, at most, a transient success. However, we can testify that Brother Nee was imprisoned for twenty years, and until the time of his departure to be with the Lord, his work was not transient. Even though he is dead, he still speaks, and his words have reached the uttermost parts of the earth. Fifty years ago Brother Nee led me to take this way. I followed him because this way is the Lord&rsquo;s way. Today, fifty years later, I am happy to say that I am still taking this way. Under the covering of the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood, I would say that no Christian work can compare with the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This work is being spread on all five continents.</p>
<p>It is by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace that I can say that no other Chinese preacher has had as much influence in preaching the truth and building up the churches among English speakers. I am not even a Galilean fisherman; I am a &ldquo;fisherman&rdquo; from Chefoo, which is smaller than Galilee. Peter did not have a theological degree and neither do I, but the Lord&rsquo;s work among us has truly been blessed.</p>
<p>You are not blind followers, and many of you have received a higher education. If you compare the Life-studies and the other messages put out by this ministry with the books published in Christianity, you will see the preciousness of our publications. When people taste what we are offering, they truly appreciate our &ldquo;food.&rdquo; Regrettably, some believers who use our messages are not willing to acknowledge their source.</p><h2 class="head1">THERE BEING ONLY ONE WAY<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S SPREADING TO THE WHOLE EARTH</h2>
<p>The Lord is responsible for the spread of His work; it is not us. We are nothing. Even if we earned ten academic degrees, we would not be able to spread the recovery to all five continents. However, we receive letters from all over the world that were written by people inviting us to visit them. Recently, the brothers in South Korea have reminded us to not forget them. If I worked in Europe, I would preach the word every week of the year. Furthermore, Australia and New Zealand are also open to us.</p>
<p>We should not be governed by our feelings, being happy only when we are given &ldquo;sweet soymilk&rdquo; and being sad when we are given &ldquo;hot and sour soup.&rdquo; Moreover, we should not expect that our service to the Lord will ensure that we have no problems or have a successful career. I have been in the Lord&rsquo;s work for many years, and I have encountered many problems. I have taken this way whether people commended me or criticized me. The church is the church. We cannot say that the church is no longer the church when a cold wind blows, or that the church is the church when a warm wind blows. In fact, when a cold wind blows, the truth of the church is demonstrated even more. This work has been blessed by the Lord because it has never changed its course based on the direction of the wind.</p>
<p>I have been in the United States for over twenty years, but I have never changed my course. I am not afraid of opposition. I have been speaking for fifty-two years in many places on the earth, but I have not changed my way. We invited Brother T. Austin-Sparks to come to us. He was nearly twenty years my senior, and I greatly respected him. However, when I found out that he was incorrect in his stance toward the Lord&rsquo;s way, I told him that I could not take his way. Today, twenty years later, everything of his has been relegated to history. Not only is his ministry finished, but his way is no longer practiced. The Lord&rsquo;s way is the unique way. I am burdened that we all see this matter. I do not want to see the young people coming in today and leaving five years later, neither do I want you to be happy today and disappointed three years later. We must see this way.</p>
<p>Let us use marriage as an illustration. If you are getting married, you must first have a clear knowledge of the one whom you intend to marry. You must not get married foolishly only to divorce later. There is only one Lord, one church, one Body, one Spirit, and one life. Moreover, there is only one way and one fellowship. This is the unique testimony on the island of Taiwan as well as on the whole earth. The Lord has confirmed this. Wherever we go, whether to Africa, South America, or Australia, the testimony among the churches is that we are all in the same move. We have the same life, and we walk on the same way. If we fall into trouble on this way, we should humble ourselves and immediately make a turn, be adjusted, and stop struggling. If we continue our struggling and try to open another way, we will fail.</p>
<p>There is an example in the New Testament. Barnabas led Paul to the apostles in Jerusalem (Acts 9:27), but later, due to his sympathy for his cousin Mark, he separated from Paul (15:37-39). This was related to human affection. From then on, Barnabas is not mentioned in Acts. This is a solemn matter. He did not merely separate from Paul; he diverged from the Lord&rsquo;s way. If a person has a thought to leave, he must understand that he is not separating from us but from the Lord&rsquo;s way. Although he is still saved and a child of God, he will come to a dead end regarding his service to the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s way is only with His recovery. There is only one way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYTHING BEING FOR THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In taking this way, we must learn not to be proud and not to have personal relationships with others. All the brothers and sisters are precious to us. We are members of the Body, and we should treat everyone equally without discrimination. I frequently contact brothers because of the literature work and because of the responsibility we share in the Lord&rsquo;s work. But my contact with them is not related to friendship. I do not have any personal bonds of friendship with anyone. Rather, my love is in the Body. Due to the limitation of time, I cannot contact you more often and have a more practical relationship with you. Some of you have written me letters, but I have no time to reply. If you want to receive a reply from me, it is best to write me a note as short as a telegram. It is not that I do not want to read your letters; rather, it is that I do not have the time. Moreover, due to my poor eyesight, I must wait for helpers to read to me.</p>
<p>I love all of you, but I do not have special affection for any of you. I hope that everyone would be like this. Even if you come from the same locality and stay in the same sisters&rsquo; house or brothers&rsquo; house, you should not consider yourselves as a special group or be distinct from other brothers and sisters. Neither should you have a special feeling toward your locality. Although we cannot be completely void of a special feeling, we should always remember that our work is not for a specific locality. Our work is for the Body of Christ. The fruit of our work is not merely for one local church. The fruit of our work is for the churches throughout the earth.</p>
<p>When you go abroad, you will see that the result of the Lord&rsquo;s work in Taiwan, whether in Taipei, Taoyuan, or Taichung, affects the United States. Therefore, you should thank and praise the Lord if you are in Taoyuan today, and you should thank and praise the Lord if you are in Taichung tomorrow. Everything is for the Lord&rsquo;s church, for the family of God. Therefore, whether you are in Taoyuan or Taichung, it is the same; there is no difference. This is a crucial point. Sometimes when we discuss the needs in one locality, the brothers and sisters from that locality speak for their locality. When we discuss the needs in another locality, the brothers and sisters from that locality speak for their locality. It would be beautiful if the brothers and sisters from Hualien spoke for Taichung, not for Hualien, and those from Taichung spoke for Taipei, those from Taipei spoke for Anaheim, those from Anaheim spoke for South Africa, and those from South Africa spoke for Kaohsiung.</p>
<p>We are not here for our own work nor for the church in our own locality. We are here for the Body of Christ. May we be willing to learn this and always remember it. Then we will be preserved to walk this way for our whole life, and we will not have any problems.</p>
<p>In the church we should never be puffed up on behalf of one or be against another. This is like considering Apollos to be higher than Paul or considering Paul to be higher than Cephas. We are all the same. The least among the saints can supply us, and the greatest among the saints can also supply us. Everything is the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement. We should thank the Lord when He gives us a saint who functions like a big arm. We should thank Him when He gives us a saint who is like a small finger. We should treat everyone alike, without distinction, whether they are weighty, light, high, or low. If your gift is great, you are our brother. If your gift is small, you are still our brother. If you are seemingly not gifted, you are all the more our brother. In this way we will be preserved from many problems. Furthermore, we should never say that we can work with certain ones but not with others. We should be able to work with anyone without expressing our choice. There are always problems when we express our choice.</p><h2 class="head1">PRACTICING DIVIDING INTO GROUPS</h2>
<p>In relation to our practice, we will fellowship concerning dividing into groups. In the past we formed groups, but we gradually stopped practicing the groups. After observing our situation and studying the practice of other Christian groups, we are clear that a local church must stress meeting in groups. The group is a basic unit.</p>
<p> A church must have groups as its foundation so that the church can take root downward. Likewise, whether or not a church stands firm also depends on the groups. Above the ground we need to raise our standard high, and we need to be rooted with a firm foundation. This foundation is the groups.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei has a total of eleven thousand saints, but only five thousand meet regularly. We need to divide these saints into four hundred groups according to where they reside. Eight or ten saints in a neighborhood should gather as a group. The groups should not be formed according to the spiritual level of the saints nor according to their age. The groups are formed solely according to the geographical location of the saints. Furthermore, once a few saints form a group, there should be no group leader or assistant group leader, nor is there a need for a responsible one or a coordinator. Everyone is equal. This practice is based on our experience. In the past when we assigned group leaders, responsible ones, and coordinators, those who were not assigned felt that they did not have any responsibility. As a result, there were distinctions when the saints functioned in the group. We have to get rid of such concepts. We need to give the saints the impression that, in the Lord&rsquo;s eyes, everyone in the group is the same. Everyone is precious and useful, and everyone should serve.</p>
<p>In order to advance the groups, we must use the serving ones in the homes, including the full-time and part-time serving ones. We need to have the manpower to advance four hundred groups. In the initial stage we do not have to spend much effort on the gospel in the community. We can wait until we have laid a good and strong foundation in the groups. Then we can preach the gospel in the communities through the groups. The manpower for the community gospel work must first be used to advance the groups.</p>
<p>According to geography, the four hundred groups can be divided into eight districts. Therefore, every district would have fifty groups, with a total of nearly six hundred saints. In the beginning we need to spend more time and invest more manpower into the groups. Our situation can be compared to an old car that has not been in operation for a long time. We are all in the car, but we have to get out and push it. This principle should be adopted in the localities, but we should not be strict in the way that we push.</p>
<p>At present fifty full-timers are assigned to five categories of the work: advancing the group meetings, preaching the gospel in the homes, preaching the gospel in the community, the campus work, and the children&rsquo;s work. If we are strict and assign ten full-timers to each category of the work, not many will be assigned to advance the groups. Therefore, we need less serving ones in the other categories. If there are fifty groups in a district, there will be a total of five to six hundred saints. We need at least fifty serving ones to advance the groups. In other words, one serving one will work with one group. Every serving one has to be in a group. Before joining the groups, the serving ones must have thorough fellowship and study how to advance the groups. They should study the situation of the meetings, the living situation of the brothers and sisters, and the spiritual level of the groups. Then they should pray together and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading to know how to enter into the groups and lead them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Condition of the Groups</h2>
<p>We should first know the condition of the groups and then pray to seek a way to lead them. Every group may have a different condition, but in principle it is possible to find the direction to lead the saints. I can give only principles. We should seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading to fan into flame the gift that is in every member of a group. We should not expect a quick work. The first time we meet with a group, we should give the saints the opportunity to speak freely with one another in a relaxed manner. There is not the need for much prayer. If we try to bring our old way of meeting into the group, we will bring in regulations. For example, although soymilk is delicious, the more we drink it the less we enjoy it. Hence, it is better to let the members of a group feel relaxed. Please do not misunderstand me. Sometimes our piousness in the meeting is a pretense, because we are not necessarily like that in our homes. It is better to be spontaneous. In the group meeting we do not have to pretend, but neither should we be wild.</p>
<p>We can even drink tea in the group meeting so that everyone will relax. Without singing or praying, the serving one can say, &ldquo;Brothers and sisters, I thank the Lord that we can sit together. The Lord has given the church a new leading, and we have been formed into a group so that we can know one another better, have more fellowship, and can supply and support one another. When I am sick, you will know that I am sick. When you have a problem, I will know that you have a problem. We will be able to sympathize with one another and help one another.&rdquo; Such a word will help the saints not to pretend. We should keep in mind that having the group meeting is not for us to hold a large worship service in a small meeting. The group meeting is for the saints to enjoy a fresh taste. This taste will help the members of the group to relax. This can be likened to rekindling an old fire with a new flame. In such a meeting it will be easy to fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Focusing on Reality, Working Aggressively,<br />
and Not Being Anxious</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the meeting it is best not to speak too much concerning spiritual matters. We have released many messages. The saints are well fed. They are stout and strong, and there are many things stored within them. Instead of giving them more doctrine or spiritual material, we should give them more reality and an opportunity to speak. We can tell the saints, &ldquo;The arrangement in the group meeting is different from the arrangement in the past. There is no group leader or coordinator. We all share responsibility for the meeting, and the meetings will not always be in the same home.&rdquo; Then the saints will be enlivened, the group meeting will be enjoyable, and they will be willing to come again. They might even bring someone to the next meeting. After the saints feel comfortable with the group meeting, we can begin to restore the dormant saints. In brief, the group meeting is the starting point to form a river out of dew. Eventually, there will be a river flowing among us.</p>
<p>We must pray diligently for this matter. In particular, all those who are prepared to serve full time must assist the elders to promote the small groups. The other areas of our work can temporarily slow down. We must remember not to turn the atmosphere in the group meeting into an atmosphere of a small worship service. That is organization. We must be organic. In our service and our work we should always remember to be aggressive but not anxious. It is good if we can achieve something today, and it is also good if we can achieve it tomorrow. We should not be overly concerned with time. However, we must be aggressive and not be loose. This is a principle for receiving the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO ADVANCE THE SMALL GROUPS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH NEEDING TO ADVANCE THE GROUPS</h2>
<p>In the previous message we fellowshipped concerning dividing into groups. The church in Taipei has already formed over four hundred groups. The primary need now is to advance the groups. The church in Taipei currently has about four hundred serving ones, including elders, co-workers, deacons, those who minister the word, coordinators of various services, young full-timers, and part-timers. Every one of these serving ones, whether experienced or not, must be in a group.</p>
<p>From now on the move of the church will be carried out mainly through the groups. The work of the small groups is mainly to restore the dormant saints and to promote the gospel preaching in the homes. Then the groups can promote the gospel work on the college campuses, among the high school and junior high school students, among the children, and in the community. In other words, the foundation of each area of work is the groups. The group is the basic unit and foundation of the church. In order to have a foundation in our work, we must nurture the groups. Once the groups begin to function, every aspect of the work will be carried out smoothly. When the groups function, we can spontaneously bring in dormant saints, and it will be easy for them to be restored. At the same time, we can spread the gospel in the homes. Then we can be aggressive in the gospel work on the campuses, among the children, and in the community. This will result in the multiplication and increase of the church.</p>
<p>Concerning the practice of the group meetings, we are short of experience and personnel, even though we have four hundred groups. This means that every serving one, including the elders and co-workers, should be assigned to help and advance a group. In other words, the serving ones should all serve to advance the groups. If there are not enough serving ones, we should ask other saints to help. For example, the movement of a large truck is slow. If we want it to move faster, it is best to push it. However, as we push it, we will discover that some parts are out of order and defective. Then we can make the necessary repairs so that the truck can run at an ideal speed.</p>
<p>Every serving brother and sister should help in leading a group, but this does not mean that they should regard themselves as a person who is &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; for the group. Neither should they consider themselves as a &ldquo;group leader&rdquo;; they should take the lead only in regard to fanning the gift within the saints into flame. If the fire in a group has not been kindled, the serving ones should bear responsibility to help kindle the fire. If the fire in a group is dying, the serving ones should fan it into flame. The serving ones should fan the gift in the saints into flame.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIVIDING INTO GROUPS ACCORDING TO GEOGRAPHY</h2>
<p>In forming the groups, there should not be groups for brothers and groups for sisters or groups for elderly saints and groups for younger saints. Neither should there be groups for working saints and groups for students. Rather, the grouping of the saints should be according to geography. If there are eight to ten saints who live close to one another, they should form a group. The members of a group should include brothers, sisters, elderly saints, and younger ones, without any distinction. Even the serving ones should be assigned according to geography. In other words, serving brothers should not be assigned to nurture brothers&rsquo; groups, nor should serving sisters be assigned to nurture sisters&rsquo; groups. Furthermore, there is no need to consider whether serving saints are suitable for a particular group. They should simply go and work with a group according to geography.</p>
<p>In order to advance the small groups, we must first drop our old concepts. The only factor we should consider in forming groups is geography. There should be no other consideration. This will limit the impact of preconceptions that can frustrate this simple principle of arrangement. This way of arrangement can be compared to the old-fashioned marriages in China in which the husband in an arranged marriage often did not even know what his wife looked like until her veil was lifted. Nevertheless, this way often produced very stable marriages.</p>
<p>Please do not analyze or doubt the benefit that will come from forming groups according to geography. It will help every saint to endeavor to strengthen and supply each group. After much consideration before the Lord, we believe that we should take this way. We have eaten much of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and our eyes are opened (Gen. 3:7). When our eyes are so &ldquo;open&rdquo; about certain matters, we often hesitate to act. For example, a person who knows everything about the preparation of food is often reluctant to eat food prepared by others because he is afraid of eating food prepared using unhygienic methods. It is better to be blind.</p>
<p>The eyes of some of the younger elders and co-workers are too open. When I propose something, some of them immediately begin to think of possible complications in how to carry it out. For example, before the meeting I said that we needed four hundred brothers and sisters to help the small groups. Immediately, a brother asked whether sisters should lead only sisters&rsquo; groups and not lead brothers&rsquo; groups. This brother has too many considerations. Having eyes that are so open makes advancement difficult.</p>
<p>The principle for arranging the small groups is by geography. We should not say that it is difficult to lead a group that has more older saints. Neither is it necessary to ask an elderly sister to help with a group of elderly sisters. Such thoughts are wrong. Instead, it is possible for an elderly sister to lead young sisters and for a young sister to lead a group of elderly sisters.</p>
<p>We do not agree with special arrangements. When we make arrangements by anything other than geography, we are no longer according to the principle of an old-fashioned Chinese marriage, that is, &ldquo;a match made in heaven.&rdquo; When heaven acts as the matchmaker to put a couple together, it is the best match. Therefore, the elders should not be involved in grouping the saints and the serving ones together in any way other than geography. The church in Taipei has over twenty meeting halls and around five thousand saints who meet regularly. These saints have been divided into more than four hundred groups. Some halls are larger, and others are smaller. Some halls may have only eight or ten groups. These four hundred groups should be divided into eight districts, and every district should have fifty groups. We must still study how to combine the groups into districts for the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s move.</p>
<p>We have not yet reached the stage of forming districts. We first need to advance the groups. After the groups begin to function, the elders and co-workers should combine the groups to form districts. Every district should have fifty groups. Then ten to twenty elders and co-workers should encourage the districts. This is similar to pushing an old car. Initially, many people are needed to push it, but once the old car starts moving, those who were pushing can take care of other matters. In the same principle, once the groups begin to function, we will not need four hundred serving ones to push them. We will probably need no more than a hundred serving ones to nurture them.</p><h2 class="head1">DEMONSTRATING HOW TO ADVANCE THE SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>We should demonstrate and explain how to advance the group meetings. Suppose a co-worker goes to lead and nurture a small group in which there are many sisters but only a few brothers. This co-worker should not give a long message; rather, he should consider the saints as a family and greet them with an intimate concern. He should also be aware of long pauses or gaps to avoid a dull and heavy atmosphere.</p>
<p>As a result of our meeting habits, many co-workers and elders like to formalize the small group meetings as if they are conducting a worship service. To them, a group meeting is merely a large meeting held with fewer people. If we eat the same food continually, even if it is good food, we will grow to dislike it. We are famous for having numerous church meetings. Our meetings can be compared to eating, and just as we need to eat three meals a day, we need to meet frequently. But if we eat dumplings three times a day for six months, dumplings will no longer be our favorite food. According to my understanding, nine out of ten saints come to the meetings only out of habit. Therefore, we must avoid bringing in the atmosphere of a large meeting into a small group meeting. In particular, we must avoid the habit of giving a message.</p>
<p>The most important part of a small group meeting is its beginning. We should not consider what to say at the beginning of the meeting. An opening word damages the meeting. A group meeting does not need an opening word, and it does not need our conventional way of meeting. Instead, we should chat with the brothers and sisters. The secret is to not consider the meeting as a special kind of meeting. We should simply be as if we are at home and chatting with the members of our family. There is no need to prepare a special topic for conversation. Once we prepare something, we ruin the meeting. We either fall into a worship service or mere formality. We might ask a saint, whom we have not met before, his name. We can also ask the saints about their interests, but we should be careful not to hold general conversations about things like the weather. Neither should the conversation center on one person; rather, everyone should be brought into the conversation. This is not a small matter; our ability to nurture a small group depends on such matters.</p>
<p>Our conversation with the saints should not be aimless. Perhaps after ten minutes of conversing, we will come to a turning point. At this juncture we can achieve our goal in leading the group by stirring up the saints. We should perfect them to serve. We should stir up their burden to restore the dormant saints. We should promote the gospel in the homes. We should also promote the community gospel.</p>
<p>We should not let the conversations continue aimlessly. Our purpose is to know the spiritual condition of the saints and then to fan into flame the gift that is within them. This depends on our skill and our spiritual sense. We need wisdom in the things we do. For example, it would be inappropriate to say, &ldquo;Our desire is not merely to get to know one another. It is more important for us to fan the gift within you into flame so that you are stirred up to serve the Lord.&rdquo; Such a speaking will be counterproductive.</p>
<p>We can compare the group meetings to playing basketball. After we dribble the ball, we must throw it into the basket. In other words, our conversation in the small group can be compared to dribbling a ball. At a certain point we should aim at the basket to make a score. We should not speak doctrine. On the contrary, we should exercise wisdom to lead the saints into the practical burdens for advancing the small group.</p>
<p>This is easy to say but not so easy to carry out. We often have meetings with no result, because we continually dribble the ball, but no one takes a shot at the basket. Those who serve the Lord have heard many messages, and some have given many messages. As a result, when they speak, they have the habit of giving a message. We all need to learn to shoot for the basket shortly after receiving the ball in order to attain our goal.</p>
<p>For example, concerning restoring the dormant saints, we may simply ask whether the saints know of other brothers and sisters in the neighborhood, and how they are doing. This is a simple and direct way to stir up the saints related to this goal. It will lead the saints to fellowship mutually. At an appropriate time, we can ask whether the dormant saints would come to the group meeting. This will also encourage the saints to fellowship. However, we must beware of falling into the trap of holding a drawn out discussion. As soon as every dormant saint in the neighborhood has been accounted for, we should wisely stop the conversation. At another time we should encourage everyone to pick up the burden to visit and restore the dormant saints. This is an easy way to help the group reach this goal. With such a good beginning, the group will be able to achieve many things, and we will not be beating the air. We will hit the mark.</p>
<p>The group meeting also needs a good ending. We should give every member of the group the feeling to pick up the burden. This will fan the gift within them into a flame. We should also help them take action. For example, if there was a conversation concerning a dormant sister who lives nearby, we should grasp the opportunity to ask whether some sisters have a burden to visit her. Surely some will have such a burden, and their response will prove that their spirit has been fanned into flame. Such meetings will enable everyone to be burning.</p>
<p>We do not have to consider this example as the best way. If we have better ways, we should fellowship and study them together. This example has no rituals, no routine worship, no regulations, and no formality. It has none of these things. We should simply let the saints come together in order to arrive at the goal of everyone in the group rising up to serve. We should always restore the dormant saints and then begin the gospel work.</p>
<p>Since the groups are formed according to where the saints live, a young sister might be assigned to a group with four elderly brothers and five elderly sisters. For this reason, the young saints who intend to serve full time must exercise to be bold. Furthermore, they must exercise to be calm but not timid. They should be able to keep their composure regardless of the situation.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, young sisters and even young brothers are afraid to function in front of others. There is a common Chinese saying that one can be a hero at home but a worm when he leaves home. The young ones need to be trained so that they are nothing at home but full of boldness when they meet with the saints. Everyone who serves the Lord must exercise boldness. This does not mean we should be bold to do bad things. Rather than being afraid of meeting people, we must be bold to speak for the Lord. For example, if we meet the president, on the one hand, we should respect him, but on the other hand, we should be bold, not timid, to speak to him. Unless we exercise in this matter, it will be difficult for us to serve the Lord. How can we serve the Lord if we are afraid to meet people or are afraid to speak when we meet people?</p>
<p>Furthermore, we need to exercise to speak, but we should not speak like elementary students. Since we have a desire to serve the Lord, the young serving ones, especially the sisters, must learn to be bold. Being bold does not mean that we do anything we want or do things that we should not. Being bold means that we are not afraid to contact people nor are we afraid of any situation. Even if we are young, we should always be unperturbed. We should also learn not to speak like a child. Rather, we should be elegant, composed, and logical.</p>
<p>Since we desire to serve the Lord, we must contact people and we must speak. We must exercise in these few things. If we can learn them, we will advance.</p><h2 class="head1">CHOOSING THOSE WHO ARE<br />
SUITABLE TO TAKE THE LEAD</h2>
<p>It is good for everyone to introduce themselves the first time that a small group meets together. However, this should be done spontaneously rather than formally. We must abandon all formality and rituals; otherwise, it will be difficult to have a group meeting. It will also be a waste of time and effort.</p>
<p>There are many brothers and sisters in the church who can lead a group. The elders should select suitable ones and commit the groups to their leading. Some of the younger brothers and sisters can learn with them. Those who take the lead should be able to train others. Furthermore, many saints with hidden &ldquo;talents&rdquo; will become manifest when they begin to function in the small groups. They will be like seasoned basketball players. Some are even more skillful than the coach. Such brothers and sisters are qualified to lead the small groups.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO LEAD</h2>
<p>There are several things that we need to do when we lead a group. First, we need to fan into flame the gift within the saints, that is, to stir them up, just as Paul did with Timothy: &ldquo;I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you&rdquo; (2 Tim. 1:6). For this we must know the spiritual condition of the saints. However, instead of asking the saints directly, we must understand their situation by contacting them and speaking with them. Instead of speaking too much, we should let the saints speak more. It is best if everyone can speak.</p>
<p>The way that a person speaks usually reveals his condition. For example, a high school graduate speaks like a high school student, but a college graduate speaks like a person with a college education. Not only so, a person&rsquo;s way of speaking reveals whether he is serious, thoughtful, and intelligent. When we go to a small group, we must learn to listen to the speaking of the saints. We may not be able to know a person&rsquo;s situation as soon as he opens his mouth, but after he has spoken three or five sentences, we will have a general idea of whether he loves the Lord.</p>
<p>Second, the purpose of our leading the groups is to coordinate with the move of the church. Suppose all the small groups have been stirred up. If the church has a burden for every group to learn an important truth, the elders can prepare material and give it to those who are helping to lead the groups. When these ones understand this truth, they can bring it to the groups.</p>
<p>Third, in order to advance the groups, we must enliven the saints. We must lead everyone in the group to speak and even create opportunities for them to speak. Some saints are afraid to speak, and others may not like to speak. Hence, we should create opportunities for the saints to speak. This is the basic secret of how to fan into flame the gift within them. We can use an old-fashioned stove as an illustration. If the stovepipe is blocked and the ash door is shut, air will not flow through the stove. As a result, the fire will not burn. We must clear the pipe and open the ash door to allow the air to flow. Then the fire will burn fiercely. If a saint remains silent, it is almost impossible to fan into flame the gift within him. We must find a way for him to open his mouth. However, asking difficult questions or questions involving his personal life make it difficult for him to speak. A question concerning the dormant saints who live nearby is simple. As the saints begin speaking, we will know their situation and how to lead them.</p>
<p>Fourth, the purpose of leading the groups is to recover the saints who have not met for a long time. It may be that the group will meet two or three times before the saints are able to pick up this burden. Therefore, before we fellowship concerning the dormant saints, we should collect some information from the church business office, which will prepare the information cards of the dormant saints. With this information, we can fellowship with the saints in a thorough way. However, our fellowship should not be solemn. It is not a company business meeting. We should have casual fellowship with our family.</p>
<p>We must practice these matters in the groups. We must know everyone&rsquo;s condition, find out if they are familiar with the dormant saints who live around them, and then help them to pick up a burden for the dormant saints. If we can accomplish these few things, we can properly lead the meeting. Then the meeting will gradually be enlivened. However, we must remember that our function is only to enliven the meeting. Once we have achieved this, we should let go. The group no longer needs us to lead it. We should let the saints in the group continue on their own.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STUDYING HOW TO ADVANCE</h2>
<p><em>Question: Should the saints who lead the groups meet regularly to fellowship and study how to go on?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This suggestion is good, but we already have too many meetings. This suggestion adds another meeting. Hence, this matter needs much consideration. It is definitely necessary for us to come together regularly to fellowship and study how to lead the groups, but it would also be sufficient to occasionally meet for some mutual teaching and exercise. For example, a coach will gather his players together only a few times during a game to give them instructions. It is more important for the players to practice regularly. Therefore, the primary matter is to divide the saints into groups and then assign serving ones to the groups. The serving ones should be quick to enliven the groups. Fellowship and study can be later.</p>
<p><em>Question: Should we keep a record of the small group&rsquo;s meetings? How should we use the time of the group meeting?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is best to keep a record of the small group, but it is not necessary to submit a report. Every group can keep the statistics it feels are necessary. This will help in leading the small groups. According to the practical situation of the saints, you should decide how long the meetings should be. If the saints have more time, the meeting can be longer. If they do not have much time, the meeting should be shorter. There is no need for rules concerning this matter.</p>
<p><em>Question: Should we form the groups according to meeting halls or according to districts? Should the responsible brothers be involved in leading the small groups?</em></p>
<p>Answer: In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we must learn to always begin from a foundation and to reject centralized authority. The groups do not have to report to the meeting halls. To do so is to follow the principle of centralization, which will weaken the function of the groups. Every group is a unit in itself, but those who lead the groups should always have fellowship with one another and keep the oneness in spirit.</p>
<p><em>Question: How should those who are in the brothers&rsquo; houses and the sisters&rsquo; houses be formed into groups? How do we group those who have specific services?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We do not need to fellowship about specific services. As the small groups are formed, situations will arise. We should be prepared to make adjustments whenever necessary. Concerning the saints who live in the brothers&rsquo; or sisters&rsquo; houses, the principle is the same. They should be formed into groups according to where they live. However, small adjustments may be made. Suppose there are eleven saints in a brothers&rsquo; house. They can either form a group, or they can combine with other saints who live around them to form two groups. Then the brothers in that house can take care of two groups.</p>
<p><em>Question: The work on the college campuses, which is a specific service, has taken shape. If we break up into groups, we may suffer a great loss.</em></p>
<p>Answer: As we are leading the small groups, we will face such situations. We need to be flexible to make adjustments according to the situation. Since the college campus work is doing very well, we should not stop it. Rather, it should be kept as part of the specific service on college campuses. We should study the situation and decide accordingly. This does not contradict the principle of forming groups. Everyone has to be assigned to a group, whether according to geography or according to their service.</p>
<p><em>Question: Should the goal of the small groups be to focus on the gospel, not edification?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The function of the small group is comprehensive. As long as you can advance the group by fanning into flame the gift within the saints and stirring them up, the group will spontaneously be able to bear the burden of the specific services. However, we should not expect too much. We should labor diligently, because some groups may advance faster and others slower. We cannot expect every group to be the same.</p>
<p><em>Question: The small groups are held in the saints&rsquo; homes. The saint in whose home it is prepares snacks and sometimes even invites the saints for a meal. What is the principle concerning this matter?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Initially, it is best not to invite the saints for a meal, because it will become burdensome. It is necessary to prepare snacks, but it should not be the responsibility of one home. Several homes should take turns doing it or coordinate together in the preparation.</p>
<p><em>Question: We already have a sisters&rsquo; group. Should this group be stopped to form a new small group?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This depends on the burden of the sisters. If the sisters feel that they have time to come together for prayer apart from their small group, it would be very good. If they feel that they cannot do so much because of the lack of time, then they should stop. The principle is not to insist on uniformity. It is the same with our physical life. Once we are in uniformity, there will be many problems. Some people have tuberculosis and can have only a certain diet. Others have stomach problems and require a different diet. People who are healthy eat in a certain way; those who are weak eat in another way. Therefore, although we encourage everyone to eat, we cannot make them eat the same food. We are now encouraging the small groups, and the saints have the freedom to do what they want to do. It is all right for some saints to have morning revival together and then come together again in the afternoon to pray. We cannot stop everything else just because we are in small groups. These saints should decide whether or not they should stop an existing gathering.</p>
<p><em>Question: Should there be a particular pursuit in the small groups? It seems as if this is necessary to prevent us from empty chatting.</em></p>
<p>Answer: There is no need to have a rule concerning this. It depends on how the leading one guides the group onto the proper path. After we have fanned the gift in the saints, we can lead them toward serving and being perfected. What we are doing can be compared to driving a car in an unfamiliar place. It may not be practical to drive a long distance. We should drive short distances. A coach always teaches the players a technique for their practice until it is perfected. Then he teaches them a new technique. We are in the first stage. It will be a great blessing from the Lord if after three to five weeks we have some perfection.</p>
<p>This is not difficult to achieve. Once a fire is kindled, it will begin to burn. If a fire does not burn, it is because we have not kindled or fanned it into flame. Once the groups are fanned into flame, the fire will burn fiercely. This is similar to rubbing pieces of wood together. Once we kindle a fire, it will spread to the other pieces of wood. Once the fire in a group starts burning, everyone will begin to function and to restore the dormant saints. Therefore, we should take care of the fanning. Then the situation concerning the dormant saints will change spontaneously.</p>
<p>I am pleading with all of us to be faithful, love the Lord, and be patient. We should not seek quick results or covet success. We should simply labor aggressively and not care for the results. This is a basic principle. We have four hundred saints who can rise up to lead four to five thousand saints. Even if the groups meet once a week, after three to five weeks, we will cause four to five thousand saints in the church to be burning. This is how drops of dew become a river. We all need to make an effort. This is a tremendous matter.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord that the brothers and sisters among us have the qualifications. They have been meeting regularly and have listened to many messages, so they have reached a certain level of spirituality. Furthermore, they love the Lord and know how to pray. This is our capital. Now it is easy for a fire to be fanned, because the stove is ready and there is even wood in the stove. All that is needed is to fan the flame. In some cases, the fire is already burning; we only need to continue fanning it.</p>
<p>We must admit that in the past we did not pay enough attention to the small groups. We had an attitude of leaving everything to work itself out. Now the Lord has led us to advance the small groups. Some of the saints in the groups may even be more capable than we are. We need to observe them. Some of the groups are strong, and it seems that they do not need others to lead them, but they may still keep some old practices. So we still need to lead them into the new way. Every group will have better results if they take the new way.</p></body></html>
