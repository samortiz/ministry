Furthermore, neither the outpouring nor the indwelling are as important as the overcoming life. The outpouring of the Spirit is much inferior to the indwelling of the Spirit and the overcoming life. God has been gracious to make me a minister of the overcoming life and not a minister of the outpouring of the Spirit. Of course, I also speak about the outpouring. It is wonderful having the outpouring of the Spirit in addition to the indwelling Spirit. But it is terrible if we have the outpouring of the Spirit, but are lacking in the experience of the indwelling Spirit. The best thing is to have both the outward and inward aspects of the Spirit. If we have the inward aspect, we can pursue the outward work of the Spirit, but if we do not have the inward aspect, it is all right if we temporarily put aside the pursuit of the outward manifestation of the Spirit.</p><p>In the Old Testament, after the priests anointed blood on the right ear, right thumb, and right toe of the one coming for cleansing, they applied ointment to the same places (Lev. 14:14-17). First there is the blood, and then there is the ointment. This means that the cross must first work on our ears, hands, and feet before we can walk and work by the Holy Spirit. The cross removes the self, whereas the Spirit lives on our behalf. The application of the blood on the ears, hands, and feet signifies that the blood has annulled us and removed us. Then the Holy Spirit comes in to replace our ears, hands, and feet. First there is the overcoming life, and then there is the outpouring of the Spirit. Receiving the anointing of the Lord's blood signifies that we have died with the Lord. At the same time, His life brings us the anointing. Today we want to see the ointment upon our heads, but unless the blood has done its work first, the outpouring of the ointment will only make us proud.</p><p>The Corinthian believers had the outward manifestations of the Spirit, but they did not have the filling of the Spirit inwardly. They were fleshly believers. There are many people today who have received the outpouring of the Spirit, yet they are not filled with life within. There is no change in their lives. They live in a foolish way and are no different from men of the world. The outpouring is not related to the inward life. A man may be very gifted yet not have the overcoming life within. If a man is unholy in his life, no outward enduement of the Spirit will make him holy within. But if we have the proper life within and in addition have the outward enduement of the Spirit, we will be useful persons.</p><p>Of all the churches in the New Testament, none was worse than the church in Corinth. Yet Paul did not deny their experience of the outpouring of the Spirit just because they were inwardly and morally corrupt. Paul did not say that it was wrong to have the outpouring in the meetings. He only said that there was the need for order because outward gifts could cause confusion. Although they did not have good order, Paul did not say that they had evil spirits. He merely instructed them on how to set everything in order. We should adopt the same attitude. If any brother or sister acts abnormally, we should set things in order and test them. However, we should not consider it wrong just because it is abnormal. A man may walk into a room and find the furniture and garments in disorder. But he cannot say that the furniture is not furniture or that the garments are no longer garments. He can only say that the furniture and garments are in disorder. When things are in disorder, all that is needed is to make some arrangements. Paul only made some arrangements. He spoke of maintaining order in speaking in tongues, and he said that if there was no interpretation, one should not speak (1 Cor. 14:28). Those who prophesy should do so one by one. If too many prophesy, confusion comes in. Hence, he said that only two or three should prophesy. The same is true with speaking in tongues; only two or three should speak. If the number exceeds two or three, those who want to speak should not speak (v. 29). First Corinthians 14 is on order; it is on the outward arrangements that come after the experience of the outpouring of the Spirit. In the future we have to pay more attention to 1 Corinthians 14. All those who consider themselves to be the church in their locality should pay attention to the experience of the outpouring of the Spirit. We have to learn love on the one hand and pursue spiritual gifts on the other hand. If we do this, we will live a balanced life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> </body></html>
