<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. By Our Receiving of Christ as the Spirit<br>out of the Hearing of Faith</H2><P>Day after day we see more of the Lord Jesus. As God, on His side, is revealing, we, on our side, are receiving. In our receiving, we receive Christ as the Spirit out of the hearing of faith (Gal. 3:2). The Spirit whom we receive is the indwelling, life-giving, compound, sevenfold intensified Spirit. We need to receive Christ as such a Spirit.</P><P>When we were saved, we received the Spirit out of the hearing of faith. Here faith does not refer to the action of believing but to the things we believe in. The word faith denotes first the things we believe in; then, based on what we believe in, we have the action of believing. In Galatians 3:2 the word faith means belief, referring to what we believe in. We have received Christ out of our hearing of the belief. The Christian belief is Christ Himself in His person and His redemptive work. Christ's person and Christ's work together constitute our belief.</P><P>When we preach the gospel, we preach this belief, that is, the person of Christ and the redemptive work of Christ. When the audience hears our preaching, they hear the faith; that is, they hear the belief. They hear about Christ's person, and they hear about Christ's redemptive work. As they are hearing of the person and work of Christ, something rises up within them, that is, a believing. By hearing, we believe.</P><P>Romans 10 says that faith comes out of hearing, and hearing comes out of preaching (vv. 14, 17), and preaching comes out of being sent (v. 15). Recently I received a letter from a dear brother who had just returned from a trip to eastern Europe to visit Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary. The impression I received from this report is that there is the need for the preaching of what we believe. Those countries need our young people to go there to teach the people our belief, our faith. I do believe the Lord will afford us the way to go. We need to send a good number of young people to these countries. But where are the people who will go? The Lord said to Isaiah, "Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?" (Isa. 6:8). Would you answer, "Lord, I am here. I will go"? You do not need to care for your living. Jesus will feed you. Some of you can go to those countries to teach English. As you teach English to the people, you can teach them the truth, the faith, the belief, and the holy word that you have heard. If you would go there and take care of just ten people, I believe that in half a year you would bring all these ten to the Lord and into the truth.</P>
