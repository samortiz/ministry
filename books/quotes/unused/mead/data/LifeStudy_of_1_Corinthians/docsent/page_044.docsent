   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DETERMINING TO KNOW ONLY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 2 Paul continues, For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The crucified Christ was the unique subject, the center, the content, and the substance of the apostle s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this he determined not to know anything but the all-inclusive Christ when he was about to minister the word of the testimony of God to the excellent-speech-exalting and wisdom-worshipping Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What a determination!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It should be a pattern to us all.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The expression this One crucified indicates Christ s humiliation and abasement.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His resurrection in glory Luke 24:26 and ascension in exaltation Acts 2:33, 36 are not referred to here because Paul s purpose is to overturn the pride of the Greeks in their elevated wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to verse 2, Paul determined not to know anything among the Corinthians except Christ and Him crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some may appeal to this verse as a basis for arguing that Paul did not preach about the church, but only testified concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We know from the context of the entire book of 1 Corinthians that, beginning with chapter three, where Paul says that the believers are God s farm and God s building, Paul has much to say about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this Epistle he actually speaks more about the church than about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul s meaning in verse 2 is that he determined not to know philosophy, culture, doctrine, religion, or any kind of practice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He cared only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when Paul spoke of Christ, he included the church, for Christ is the Head of the church, which is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 12:12 Paul even indicates that the church, the Body, is part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, it is not correct to say that Paul excluded the church when he declared that he determined not to know anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 2 Paul seems to be saying, Dear brothers in Corinth, you are still very philosophical, and you live a life according to your wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But when I came to you ministering God s mystery and announcing God s testimony, I did not rely on wisdom or philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I certainly did not emphasize religion or culture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I spoke to you of a living Person, the Son of God, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I determined not to know anything among you except this wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I deliberately stayed away from philosophy, wisdom, and excellence of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul also reminded the Corinthians that the Christ he preached was One who had been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, Paul did not use excellence of speech or wisdom; on the other hand, he proclaimed not an honored, exalted, glorified Christ, but a Christ who had been despised, rejected, defeated, and even crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here Paul seems to be saying, You have believed in Christ and received Him with the initial gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But after receiving Christ, you made the mistake of not living a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the contrary, you have lived a self-glorying and self-exalting life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the One I preached to you and the One received by you was a rejected, despised, and crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No longer should you live in a way to exalt yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, you should live a crucified life, even live the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You should not boast in your knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, you should be willing to give the impression that you do not know anything other than the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All of you are saying that you are of Paul, of Cephas, of Apollos, or of a limited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is according to man s way, not according to the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You should live this One who was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There will always be trouble in a local church when the saints seek to know things other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Knowing too many doctrines often produces debates and even causes divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is always profitable to know nothing but Christ and Christ crucified; this is the only safe way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If all the saints in the local churches determine to know nothing except Christ Jesus, there will be no problems in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The most wonderful local church is a church composed of saints who do not know anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever they are asked a question, they reply that they only know Christ, calling on the name of the Lord, praying, and enjoying the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They are willing to appear foolish by not knowing anything except Christ and this One crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the best local church is a church where the saints do not know anything except Christ, the church with the most problems is one where the saints know too many things other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>More than forty years ago, I spent a long period of time trying to help this kind of church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>My efforts were in vain, because everyone knew too much.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is very important for us to determine not to know things and to learn to say, I don t know.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Learn to determine not to know anything except Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Oh, we all must have such a spirit, attitude, and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we determine not to know anything except Christ, there will not be any problems or divisions among us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sometimes when we visit a church in another locality, the saints there have questions about certain doctrines and practices.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To answer their questions would be a big mistake and would waste much time and energy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, we may waste the opportunity to minister Christ to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should be those who know only Christ and the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then we shall have more opportunity to minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The problem at Corinth was that the believers had too much knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, they treasured knowledge, even to the point of worshipping it and making it an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, it is not surprising that Paul s intention was to belittle their knowledge and point them to the crucified Christ.</S>
