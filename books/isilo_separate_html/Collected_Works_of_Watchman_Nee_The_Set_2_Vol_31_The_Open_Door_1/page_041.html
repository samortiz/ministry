I had never even heard of Yuan-Jiang, much less considered coming here. However, things happened that we did not even dream of. I was originally going to go to Chi-Li, but instead I ended up here. I will explain briefly how it happened to comfort you. We left Hankow on the evening of December 16 and arrived in Cheng-Ling-Ji at noon on the eighteenth. Our cargo had to be inspected by the customs officers, so our boat did not leave Cheng-Ling-Ji until the morning of the twentieth. We went to Lin-Tze-Kou on the twenty-first. The captain said that the boat was not going to Shatow, so he hired another local boat for us. The boat went slowly because the water level was so low. We did not arrive in Yuan-Jiang until the morning of the twenty-third. We originally planned to take the next steamer to Ch'ang-Teh. In the beginning we stayed in a hostel, but later we discussed this with the people from the denominational church. Thank the Lord, we were given hospitality by them so that we could settle here. Pastor Hsu Wei invited us to preach the word three times. The audience said they were very touched. May all the glory be to God. Brother Han was too exhausted by the journey. After coming to Yuan-Jiang he got the flu. (Ninety percent of the people had the flu.) Fortunately, he is better now. Pastor Hsu says that they can give us hospitality until the middle of February because their chapel will be holding their annual Bible study then. Rent is higher than usual because many refugees have come to Yuan-Jiang. I had originally planned to write you a letter telling you everything, but I was not able to because of my health. Please forgive me. Peace in the Lord. Please greet Brother Chou, Brother Chu, and all the brothers and sisters in Hankow for me.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chang Gun-jih<br />January 2, in Yuan-Jiang</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'ang-sha, Hunan Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Lan in the Lord:</p><p>Did you receive my last two airmail letters? I think of you often. The day after Brother Hsi-wen mailed his letter, he bought the tickets to K'un-ming through the Lord's marvelous arrangement.</p><p>Brother Jing-yuan took his sister to Yunnan on the twenty-eighth of last month. Miss Hsu En-shiu's entire family went to Kweilin at the end of last year. Sister Shen Hwei-min went to Hong Kong at the same time. Most of the brothers and sisters passing through along the way have all scattered. I received Brother Hsien-lu's letter yesterday that said Brother Han has arrived in Ch'ang-Teh. Praise the victorious Lord! He really guides in marvelous ways! Brother Feng said that there is a meeting in his home on the Lord's Day. They are now asking the Lord to prepare a proper meeting hall for them. I have been very busy since Gan-mu sent a letter with his date of arrival; I have been preparing his house for him. I really need your help in prayer for the two matters mentioned in the previous two letters! I will tell you the rest in detail later. I hope for your answer. Best blessings!</p><p>Ai-wu<br />January 7<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'ang-Teh, Hunan Province</h2><p>Brother Yu-zhi in the Lord:</p><p>After we said good-by, I think that the Lord must have specially protected, led, and used you to do the work that pleases His heart. I do not know whether you received the card I sent last time. I came to Ch'ang-Teh to escape from the war and met Brother Han Fu-sheng. We are now asking the Lord to give us an open door for the gospel. I married Sister Ma Ru-xun on December 27 of last year, according to the Lord's arrangement. We have now started a small school in Ch'ang-Teh to maintain our livelihood. I am still not clear about the Lord's calling. I feel that someone like me will never be worthy to do God's work. However, I deeply believe that if the Lord wants to use someone, that person will be able to obey the Lord. God is not a respecter of persons. As we were escaping from the war, we saw His glory all along the way. Now the five students are all saved. Praise the Lord! Brother Wang Wen-jiang received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit recently, and it is as if he is a different person. He says that the Lord has already called him. We are now asking the Lord to make arrangements for these five students. Perhaps they can follow the footsteps of Brother Han.</p><p>The result of this war is that many brothers and sisters have become scattered and lost. They really need God's special grace to preserve their spirits, souls, and bodies. Did you go to Kuei-yang? If there are any letters for my wife or myself at your place, please send them in care of Brother Feng Hsien-luh, Tung-Gong Print Shop, Court Main Street, Ch'ang-Teh, Hunan. I will stop right here. Many blessings in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Yung-dien<br />January 12</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
