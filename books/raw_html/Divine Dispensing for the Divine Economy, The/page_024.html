<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FATHER EMBODIED IN THE SON<br>AND THE SON REALIZED AS THE SPIRIT,<br>DISPENSING THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD<br>INTO THE BELIEVERS AS LIFE<br>AND LIFE SUPPLY IN ABUNDANCE</H2><P>The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit. In this way, the processed Triune God is dispensed into the believers as life and the life supply in abundance (John 14:9-11, 16-20). The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son as the Spirit is realized in the believers. God the Father is hidden, God the Son is manifested among men, and God the Spirit enters into man to be his life, his life supply, and his everything. Hence, the Father in the Son and the Son as the Spirit are man's portion that man may enjoy God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ISSUE OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY AS THE DIVINE LIFE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Flowing of Rivers of Living Water<br>as the Bountiful Supply of the Divine Riches</H2><P>John 7:38-39a says, "He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive." The issue of our breathing, drinking, and eating Christ is first the flowing of rivers of living water as the bountiful supply of the divine riches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Fruit-bearing</H2><P>The second issue of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity as the divine life is fruit-bearing (John 15:5, 16a). We are the branches of Christ, who is the vine. As branches we should bear fruit. John 15 does not merely speak of the preaching of the gospel to save sinners, because John is a Gospel of life. In John 15, the preaching of the gospel is the bearing of fruit. Fruit-bearing is the flowing out of the inner life. When the inner life flows out, there is an expression. This expression is fruit-bearing.</P><P>Everyone who goes out to lead sinners to be saved must be one with Jesus. If we do not breathe, drink, and eat Jesus, we will not have the authority when we preach the gospel. Our gospel will not be powerful. We must be the breathers, drinkers, and eaters of Jesus. We must have Jesus within us, not merely as a king, but as our breath, water, and food. Many of the dear saints love the Lord and the Lord's recovery very much and are seeking to practice the new way for the church life. However, they are practicing the new way in an old way. When they knock on people's doors for the gospel, they are fearful. Then when they speak with people, they do not command them but rather converse with them in the old way. Eventually, the people may argue with them, and the time will be wasted. We must not take the old way. To talk to people in this way is not effective.</P><P>In Matthew 28:18-19 the Lord said, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." We must realize that it is Jesus and not we who initiate our going out. Jesus charged us to go with His authority to disciple the nations. When we go to people, we should say, "Hallelujah! Amen, Lord Jesus. I am going and You are going with me." Then we can tell people, "The Lord Jesus sent me to you to tell you that He is your Savior and you must believe in Him." We can command them to pray, and after they pray, we can command them to be baptized into the name of the Triune God. We have mistakenly believed that we must teach people before they can be saved and baptized. Matthew 28:19 first says that we should disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. After this, verse 20 says that we should teach them. A mother cannot teach her child before the child is delivered. After the child is delivered, there will be many years to teach him. Whether or not a new believer understands what has happened, his prayer and baptism are accomplished facts, and what he has done in the name of the Lord Jesus counts in God's view.</P>
