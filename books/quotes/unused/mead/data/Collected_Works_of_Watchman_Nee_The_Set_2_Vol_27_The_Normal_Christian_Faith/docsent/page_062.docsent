   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ALL PROBLEMS ORIGINATE FROM SIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>No doubt we see many problems existing in our society and nation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every one of them is a major issue.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every one demands an immediate solution.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But we have to see that the one factor that originates all these problems is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All these problems arose because man became fallen and alienated from God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The order in which God works out His salvation is first to save us and solve our problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After man is saved, all the problems related to him are consequently solved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>TAKE CARE OF GOD'S CONCERN</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, the redeemed ones must first of all know God's work and concentrate on His concerns.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What concerns God most is the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We also must concern ourselves with the same.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since God cares for personal salvation and sanctification, we have no choice but to pay attention to the same.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The solution to these problems is the work of God today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It ought to be the work of every one who belongs to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today Christ is dispensing God's life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We also have to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is His work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is also our work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because God's ordained work for the Christian today is saving sinners from sins and dispensing God's life, regardless of our rank and file, we have to do the work of saving men from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether we are kings or slaves, our commission is the same: to dispense God's life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>INDIRECT INFLUENCE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may jump at me immediately, saying, "Are we going to ignore society and betray our country?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Are we going to overlook things while races are being oppressed, nations are being harassed, and classes are being exploited?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I can only give a simple answer to this: we can only be concerned for one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible shows us what this one thing is.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The rest is not our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a man is saved, he will naturally be beneficial to society.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He will naturally be an asset to his community and nation, and he will naturally not be injurious to others or animals.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no question about this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have only one direct work, and that is to evangelize.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The result will automatically be carried over to the community and nation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, this result is only indirect fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are primarily concerned with the spiritual outcome; the physical one will definitely be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we take care of individuals, society at large will reap the benefits.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>SAVE OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our job is not to deal directly with the problems of our nation, reorganize our institutions, or revolutionize our political system.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are not here to directly settle the problems among races.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot find these kinds of commandments in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What the Bible shows us is that we should do our best to save others and solve the individual problems of sin and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When sinners are saved, they will automatically affect their community, nation, and human institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But all this help is rendered indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not deal with them directly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>LIGHT AND SALT</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus said, "You are the salt of the earth...You are the light of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some misinterpret these words and stand up to propose that we should make our world a brighter and cleaner place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But we have to realize what light and salt are.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Bible only shows what light is in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Ephesians 5:13 says, "Everything that makes manifest is light."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Light is that which exposes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As a Christian, to be the light of the world means that you expose the people around you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, if everyone around you is an alcoholic and none has ever been uneasy about it before, your presence will convict them of their wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Or perhaps they are all gamblers and insensitive to their sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Your presence will make them feel ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Everyone around you is quarrelsome and provocative.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But you only smile at them without participating in their activities.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Your presence will convict them of their corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is what it means to be a light.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When you expose their wrong in their midst, you are a light to them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are merely lights.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are not here to burn up the casinos, round up the outlaws, and reform society.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To be a light means that formerly others did not know what is evil, but your presence as a Christian convicts them of their vices.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Light is what exposes everything.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>PRESERVATIVE</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What about the salt of the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The function of salt is to preserve dead objects from turning stale and stinky.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If something is dead already and you apply salt, it is preserved from further corruption and decay.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There are many dead objects in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you look around, you will find all kinds of decaying things.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They sit there rotting.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Your presence as a Christian will stop these things from further deterioration.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Our job is not to clean the house, scouring the world of all its filth.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord never commissioned us to reform society or change the institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He only gave us authority to save others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are the salt of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We are merely preventing the dead systems from further decay.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have no responsibility to reform them.</S>
