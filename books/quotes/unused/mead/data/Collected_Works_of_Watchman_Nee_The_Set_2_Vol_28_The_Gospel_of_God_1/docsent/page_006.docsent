   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GREATEST SIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen the matters of sin, sins, and the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By birth, we are sinners, and our walk matches our birth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because we are sinners, our conduct matches our title sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are many "gentlemen" in this world who cover up their sins and will not admit that they are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But this does not mean that they are not sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It only means that they have disguised themselves as ones without sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are sinners by birth, and our profession and walk is to commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let me repeat that it is not because we have sinned that we have become sinners; rather, it is because we are sinners that we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fact that we are sinners causes us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who can sin prove that they are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Tonight we have a few Western friends here with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps they all speak the Shanghai dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Shanghainese can of course speak the Shanghai dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But we cannot say that everyone who can speak the Shanghai dialect is Shanghainese.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many have put a lot of effort into learning the Shanghai dialect, but they are not Shanghainese.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There also may be some Shanghainese who do not speak the Shanghai dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot say that because they do not speak the Shanghai dialect, they are not Shanghainese.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are still Shanghainese, but they are Shanghainese who cannot speak the Shanghai dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, there are very few Shanghainese who do not speak the Shanghai dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Generally speaking, all Shanghainese speak the Shanghai dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a natural thing for them to speak the Shanghai dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the same way, it is all but unavoidable for those with a sinner's life to live a sinner's living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Concerning the sins that sinners commit, I prefer not to list them in detail, as many have done.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I would just like to briefly prove man's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both in the New Testament, as well as in the Old, there are a few sins that are especially prominent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Old Testament, one sin which is particularly striking is the failure to love God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the New Testament, there is also one sin that is particularly striking, the refusal to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Bible says that man is condemned and has become a sinner in the eyes of God, it does not mean that he has committed a multitude of sins that incur God's wrath, such as murder, arson, fornication, pride, debauchery, prostitution, gambling, or other kinds of filthy and secret sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not what the Bible emphasizes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What the Bible considers serious is the problem that has arisen between man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The end of the law is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength Matt 22:36-37; Mark 12:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, at issue is not whether one has stolen from others, or whether one has murdered or plotted arson.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At issue are not personal lusts or thoughts or words.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, at issue is the problem of one's relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Among all the sins, there is one which tops the list.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This one sin brings in all sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By this one sin, all other sins follow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible says that sin entered into the world through one man Rom 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I want to ask you, What sin did that one man commit?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Was it fornication, theft, murder, arson?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There were no such things in Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the evil, filthy, and terrible things that happen in the world today come from one incident involving Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But what did Adam do?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Adam did not murder; he did not commit fornication; he did not commit any of the evil and filthy sins in the world today.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The sin that Adam committed was simple and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Adam thought that God was holding one thing back from him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He thought that if he were to eat of the fruit of that tree, he would be like God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The sin that Adam committed was actually a problem that developed between him and God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God expected Adam to be standing on his proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But Adam did not believe that what God had given him was profitable for him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He began to doubt the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A problem developed concerning the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Adam did not commit that many sins in this incident.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He did not gamble; he did not set his eyes on evil things in the streets; he did not read evil books.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Adam's sin was a problem that arose between him and God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Following that, many sins came.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once Adam sinned in this way, all kinds of sins followed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sins are after their kind, and they all come one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, the first sin was not the sin that we would have thought.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The first sin was the unique sin in the Old Testament, the sin of not loving God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After a problem developed between man and God, problems among men began to develop.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the garden of Eden, a problem developed in man; then, outside the garden of Eden, the older brother murdered the younger, and all kinds of sins followed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hence, we see that sins did not begin in a serious and filthy way, as we might imagine.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Bible shows us that sins began with something very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But actually the first sin was the most serious one a problem between man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we look into the New Testament, we see the Lord Jesus saying many times that he who believes has eternal life John 3:15-16, 36; 5:24; 6:40, 47; 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There are probably fifty or more times that the Lord indicates that he who believes has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Who then are those who will perish?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Is it the murderers who will go to hell?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Is it the fornicators who will perish?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Is it those who have filthy thoughts and improper behavior who will go into perdition?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Not necessarily.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Gospel of John tells us again and again that it is those who do not believe who are condemned John 3:16, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Those who do not believe have the wrath of God upon them always John 3:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord Jesus said that the Holy Spirit came that the world would be convicted concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment John 16:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Why concerning sin?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Is it because you have gone to the movies lately?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Is it because you have gambled lately?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Is it because you have murdered someone or have committed arson?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>No. "Concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me" John 16:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The greatest difficulty we have today is that we consider filthiness sin, but we do not pay much attention to the Lord's word to see what God considers sin.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord said that he who does not believe has been condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The reason man commits all his sins is that he does not have a proper relationship with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In the Old Testament, it was when man lost his proper relationship with God that all kinds of sins were committed.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the New Testament, it is when man loses the proper relationship with the Lord Jesus that all kinds of sins are committed.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Here lie all the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>While you are sitting here tonight, you may think that even though I have proven that you are a sinner, you really have not committed very many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But no one in the whole world can say that he has not committed the sin of not loving God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Neither is there anyone in the whole world who can say that he has not committed the sin of not believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>For this reason, no one can say that he is not a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Do you remember Luke 15?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>There you have a prodigal son and his father.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The prodigal son left his father and squandered his estate.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But when did the prodigal son become prodigal?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Was he a prodigal son when he had a lot of money in his pocket and was living lavishly in a distant country?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Or did he become a prodigal only after he had spent all that he had and was hungry while he fed the hogs?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Actually, he was a prodigal the day he left his father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Before he even spent a dime, he was already a prodigal.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He did not become a prodigal only after he had spent all that he had and was feeding the hogs and eating the carob pods and while his garments were torn and his stomach was empty.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He became a prodigal when he left his father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Let me ask you a question.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Suppose the younger son had not spent any money when he was in the distant country.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Suppose instead that he had earned a lot of money, that he had gone into business, made a fortune, and became even richer than his father.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Would he still have been a prodigal?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Indeed he would have.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In the eyes of his father, he would have still been a prodigal.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Today there is a very wrong concept that must be rooted out of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We think that because a man has failed to do good, he becomes a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>As long as a man has departed from God, he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Even if he is ten times more moral than others, as long as he is away from God, he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>You must remember therefore that as Christians, we may perform all the outward services that there are to perform, and we may fulfill all the outward duties that there are to fulfill; we may pray as we always have, and we may read the Bible and attend church meetings as we always have; we may do everything as we always have, and may even do them more.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Yet if there is a problem between us and God, we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>When the first love is gone, there is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Who is a prodigal?</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>It is not simply one who has squandered his father's estate, but rather one who has just left his father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The moment that a person leaves his father's house he becomes a prodigal.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Even if he makes a fortune while he is away, he is still a prodigal.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Of course, there will never be a prodigal who makes a fortune in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>A prodigal will never prosper.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>A prodigal will always squander away all the money he has.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>God allows the "money" to be squandered, so that man will know that it is not a good thing to depart from God and will realize that he is a sinner after all.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>We now see how we have received the qualification of a sinner and how we have become sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We become sinners by developing a relationship with sin, and we commit sins by developing a relationship with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>There is a difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Since I was born in Adam and am under sin's dominion, sin has become the principle of my life and my living, and I have become a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>In the same way, the many individual sins outside of me have made me one who commits sins.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Committing sins has to do with sins, and being a sinner has to do with sin.</S>
