        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PERSON OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:23; 2:2; 1:24, 18; Luke 1:35; 2:11; Matt. 16:16; Rom. 1:4; Acts 2:36; John 20:31</h1>
<h2 class="head1">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>In the following chapters we will consider Christ and the cross exclusively. Those who know the Bible know that Christ and the cross are the center and the reality of the Bible. If Christ and the cross were removed from the Bible, the Bible would be an empty book. The Bible is precious in its revelation of Christ and the cross. We will appreciate the preciousness of the Bible only when we know Christ and the cross.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:23 Paul speaks of preaching Christ crucified. Paul did not determine to know anything among the Corinthians except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified (2:2). He knew Christ as the totality of the power and wisdom of God (1:24), and he also knew the word of the cross as the power of God to those who are being saved (v. 18). The center of Paul&rsquo;s message and work is Christ and the cross. All the apostles, who were sent by God to preach and work on His behalf, emphasized Christ and the cross. This is the message and work that God entrusted to the apostles.</p>
<p>Although we have been saved by grace, I am concerned that we do not know Christ or His cross adequately. In order for us to grow in life, to see the spiritual things and the spiritual way, and to be proper Christians, we must know Christ and the cross. A person who does not know Christ and the cross cannot do a spiritual work or service that satisfies God&rsquo;s heart. In order to grow spiritually or do a spiritual work, such as preaching the gospel or administrating the church, we must know Christ and the cross.</p>
<p>Believers are poor and weak, and the churches are desolate and chaotic because believers and the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones do not know Christ and the cross. Only by knowing Christ and the cross can believers be edified more in life and the church be established so that the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ will increase in the church (Eph. 4:13). Hence, we will spend considerable time in these chapters to consider the matter of Christ and the cross.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals Christ and the cross in ways that are beyond our thought. Without God&rsquo;s mercy, without the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s presence, and without a proper heart and a clear, strong spirit, we would feel that the Bible&rsquo;s profound, central word on Christ and the cross is vague, mysterious, and unfathomable. Like those in John 6, who heard but could not understand the Lord&rsquo;s words concerning eternal life, we would say, &ldquo;This word is hard; who can hear it?&rdquo; (v. 60). We must look to the Lord for a proper heart and a strong spirit in order to listen with our heart and receive with our spirit and then remember, muse upon, and turn this word into prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PERSON OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In this chapter we come to the person of Christ, and we must ask, &ldquo;Who is Christ?&rdquo; All believers can answer that He is our Savior, and according to our human feeling and with respect to us, He is our Savior. However, according to God&rsquo;s revelation and with respect to God, Christ far exceeds what we can say or know about Him.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God and the Christ of God. In Luke 1:35 the angel Gabriel told Mary that the Holy Spirit would come upon her, and the power of the Most High would overshadow her; therefore, the holy thing which was born would be called the Son of God. In 2:11 an angel of God told the shepherds that a Savior, who is Christ the Lord, had been born to them in David&rsquo;s city. Matthew 16:16 records that when the Lord Jesus came out to minister, the Father revealed to Peter that the Lord Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. Romans 1:4 says that when the Lord Jesus came out of the resurrection of the dead, He was designated the Son of God in power. In Acts 2:36 Peter witnessed, saying, &ldquo;Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified.&rdquo; At the end of his Gospel, John says, &ldquo;These have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, you may have life in His name&rdquo; (20:31). From the time of the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, everyone who wants to be saved must believe that He is the Christ, the Son of God. These verses show that the New Testament emphasizes that the Lord Jesus is both the Son of God and the Christ of God. Although the Bible contains many titles for the Lord Jesus, there is not another title more important and crucial than either <em>the Son of God</em> or <em>the Christ of God.</em></p>
<p>These two titles speak of the two statuses of the Lord Jesus. <em>The Son of God</em> speaks of His person, and <em>the Christ of God</em> speaks of His ministry. With respect to the Lord&rsquo;s person, He is the Son of God. With respect to the Lord&rsquo;s ministry and work, He is the Christ of God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
