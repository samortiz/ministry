in Our Spirit</h2>
<p>The so-called gifts and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit are outward. The believers in Corinth spoke in tongues, interpreted tongues, and did not lack in any gift, but the apostle Paul said that they were infants and fleshly (1 Cor. 3:1-3). They did not know God according to life. They were outward Christians; that is, they were Christians according to gifts, not according to life. An outward Christian does not need the cross, but a Christian who is according to life needs the cross and needs to continually touch the Lord, touching His presence and His feeling. Every experience he has needs the cross, and the cross is in every item. The cross is not a matter of suffering but a matter of termination. The cross terminates us so that we are not the ones who are living. Rather, we live by the Lord; we take Him as life and express Him in our living.</p>
<p>We must learn the matter of life because being a Christian is not something outward, nor is it related to spiritual gifts or religious sentiments. Being a Christian is a matter of turning to our spirit, where we can touch Christ and His feeling so that He has a way to live in us. The cross must terminate our person and our preferences, our spiritual inclinations, and the way we work. Even if we are willing to pay a price and sacrifice ourselves in order to serve others, we still need to be terminated by the cross. We must come out of being good, being zealous, sacrificing for Christ, serving others, preaching the gospel, and working for God, all of which are outward, and we must turn to our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Desiring the Lord, Fellowshipping with Him<br />
with a Pure Heart, and Following Him</h2>
<p>Christians who fall into sin and the world are not proper. However, Christians who pursue being good and zealous and who seek tongue-speaking, power, spiritual gifts, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit are outward. We must turn away from the outward things to our spirit; that is, we need to forget about being good, being zealous, paying a price, and serving others, as well as our suffering, sacrificing, and working for the Lord. The way to follow the Lord does not begin with these things. If we are still dealing with these things, we will not be reliable. The way for us to follow the Lord has only one starting point, which is to turn to our spirit. We must be willing to be stripped of anything that is apart from Him, even if it is our best virtue. We must desire only Him. Here is an example. If the Lord were in me as my life, I would be willing to be stripped, imprisoned, restricted, and ruled by Him. I would not have ambitions, plans, goals, insights, inclinations, choices, preferences, decisions, wishes, or expectations. I would drop everything and be a person who turns to my spirit so that I could touch Him and contact Him. This is the beginning of learning the lessons of life.</p>
<p>When I meet with the Lord, contact Him, and touch His feeling, my inner being is enlivened and enlightened, and I know what He wants me to deal with. I also know His intention and see that my intention and my attitude are apart from Him. I also see that my actions are not in conformity with His intention, nor are they in Him. Then I am willing to be restricted by Him and to live in Him. As a result, He can move within me. Although I have stopped my activities, He is moving in me, urging me to obey Him, to pay the price, and not to care for my future or my position so that I can live in Him. These are the basic lessons that we must learn.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SERVE IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Lessons of Life Being<br />
for the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>Now we will consider the aspect of the church. We must know the purpose of God&rsquo;s being our life. It is not for our individual spirituality but for us to be the church, the Body of His Son (Eph. 1:22-23). The church is produced by the Son of God building Himself into His redeemed people. The church is something unique in the universe, and the expression of the church in every locality is also unique. The things of the world and human opinions do not have any place in the church. We cannot expect every Christian to know what the church is, but we should know what the church is. Everything in the church is corporate; there is no place for individuals. A hand, for example, has its place, but that place is in the body. As believers who know the church, we meet together with the building up of the church as our goal. Our spiritual pursuit and our willingness to learn the lessons of life are not for our personal gain but for the church. We are not for our own spirituality; we are for the building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning to Coordinate in the Church and<br />
Knowing God&rsquo;s Arrangement and Order</h2>
<p>If we desire to have good coordination, we must see that there is only one church, one Body. Then we will be open to coordination, which is the building up of the church. Coordination is not a matter of organization according to human will but a matter of the growth and expression of life. It is a practical matter because when we coordinate, we know the order in the Body, and we know our place. This means that we know God&rsquo;s arrangement; we know the place that God has arranged for us, His order in the Body, and the deputy authority in the church. By knowing the church in this way and by touching the Lord in our spirit, we are saved from the things that do not correspond with the nature and the vision of the church. This experience is not according to an outward law but according to an inward vision.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when we coordinate, we see that we cannot be individualistic, because the life of Christ, which is the life of the church, is a corporate life. The Body is a matter of coordination and building. There is an order in the Body, and there is also authority in the Body. Human opinions and concepts of so-called democracy and equality cause the Body to fall apart; they cut the Body into pieces. Hence, we need a clear understanding of what the church is and how to live in the church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Sufficiency, Pursuit, and Learning of the Lord's Serving Ones &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
