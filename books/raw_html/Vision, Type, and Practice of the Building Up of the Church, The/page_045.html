        <h2 class="head1">HUMAN LOVE BEING LIMITED</h2>
<p>We should not misunderstand the love of God as merely being a matter of loving one another as referred to by Christians. I have been a Christian since my youth and have heard numerous messages concerning loving one another. However, it seems as though the more people talk about loving one another, the less they love one another. This is because we can have genuine love for one another only when we touch the love of God. Ephesians 4 speaks of the church&rsquo;s &ldquo;building up of itself in love&rdquo; (v. 16). This does not mean that we need to love one another. Our love is limited. When we try to love others by our love, we eventually love only those who suit our taste. If a brother suits our taste this year, we will love him, but if he does not suit our taste next year, we will stop loving him. When a new district is formed in the church, the saints love one another very much. However, in less than half a year problems will arise and the love will diminish because the saints try to love one another by their own love without the love of God.</p>
<p>It is not until we touch God, live in Him, allow Christ to make His home in our hearts, daily enjoy Him, and touch the love of God in the feeling of our emotions that our love will reflect God&rsquo;s love, not our human love. Then we will be able to love the brothers and sisters without discrimination. We will love the spiritual saints and the saints who are not spiritual. We will love those who offend us, because we have compassion and sympathy for their weaknesses. Even when we rebuke someone, we will do so because we love him and want to help him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING AND THE LOVE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If we only talk about building and the steps of building, the church will not be built. We must have the love of God before we can be built together. In the tabernacle there were several bars made of wood overlaid with gold that connected and joined the boards together (Exo. 26:26-28). These bars signify the love in the Holy Spirit. It is in this love that we are joined as one and built up together. The building up of the church depends on the saints having this love. The extent to which the church can be built up depends on how much divine love we have. The human love, which is according to the natural taste, is limited. It is narrow, short, low, and shallow instead of being the breadth, length, height, and depth. According to Ephesians 3:18, the love that we need to touch is called the breadth, length, height, and depth. This love is the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe. Such a love is immeasurable. With such a love, we can love every brother and every sister. There is no one whom we would condemn, dislike, or not forgive.</p>
<p>The amount of love that we have depends on how much we have gained God. If we are short of love and unable to love others, it means that we are short of God. When we have fellowship with God, touch the feeling of love, and live in the sweetness of love, we will live in the love of God. As a result, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God. Genuine building up takes place in love. It is useless to merely encourage the saints to love one another. Rather, when we touch the divine love, we enter into God, enjoy Him, live in the feeling of such an enjoyment, and have the sentiment of the divine love. Then we will be filled with the element of God and spontaneously love others. When we are rooted and grounded in love, we will realize that the breadth, length, height and depth of the universe are the love of God. Such an unlimited and immeasurable love is Christ and God.</p>
<p>Genuine building is in Christ and is full of the divine element. Furthermore, Christ is love. The building is Christ, God, and love. In the church as the one new man there is nothing other than Christ (Col. 3:10-11).</p>
<p>It is useless to exhort the saints to love one another. If we would enter into God and touch His love in our emotions, we will not only put on Christ but also put on the inward parts of compassion (v. 12). When we put on love, we are in love (v. 14). Such a love is God enjoyed by us and Christ experienced by us. The divine love is unlimited because it is God, Christ, and the breadth, length, height, and depth. When we touch this love, we cannot help but love the saints. We will love them regardless of whether they suit our taste, whether they stand or fall, and whether they are strong or weak. When we all touch this love, we will be built up in love, and there will be a spiritual building among us. This building is nothing less than God being mingled with man and love filling man. It is also man immersed in God as love. This is the building that God desires.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
