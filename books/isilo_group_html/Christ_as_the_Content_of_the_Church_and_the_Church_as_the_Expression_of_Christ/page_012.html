These are not two kinds of offerings, but one offering with two aspects: the wave aspect and the heave aspect. The word wave implies a back and forth movement, and the word heave means to lift up. The wave offering signifies the resurrected Christ, and the heave offering signifies the ascended Christ. Christ offered Himself in His death, and He became the resurrected and ascended One. Resurrection and ascension are always related to each other. The resurrected Christ is the ascended Christ.<p>Everything which we enjoy of Christ is something of resurrection and ascension. Whenever we have something of Christ to bring to the church meeting to express Christ, this is always something of resurrection and ascension. We may testify that Christ is our comfort or wisdom. He is our comfort and wisdom only by His resurrection and ascension. The resurrected and ascended Christ is our comfort and wisdom.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE REALITY OF THE FIVE BASIC KINDS OF OFFERINGS</h2><h2 class=head2>The Burnt Offering</h2><p>Our experience of Christ can be classified into many items and can be typified by the five basic kinds of offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. When we learn to live by Christ, to take Christ as our life, the indwelling Christ will enable us to live a life absolutely for God and not for ourselves. This is the real experience of Christ as the burnt offering (Lev. 1:1-17; Heb. 10:5-7). The indwelling Christ enables us not to live for ourselves in anything but to live for God in everything. Christ then becomes a living burnt offering within us as we live by Him, taking Him as our life.<p>When we have this experience of Christ, we can offer what we have in the church meeting. We may offer a praise by saying, &#8220;Lord, we praise You that You are the One living within us to enable us to live a consecrated and separated life.&#8221; Such a praise, giving of thanks, testimony, or message is the offering of Christ as the burnt offering. When we offer Him in such a way, He is exhibited, expressed, and exalted.<h2 class=head2>The Meal Offering</h2><p>We can also experience Christ as the meal offering (Lev. 2:1-16). When we take Christ as our life, we will have a refined daily life in our behavior and conduct. We will be fine and pure in our humanity like the fine flour of the meal offering. This offering is composed of fine flour mingled with oil. It signifies how Christ lives in us so that we may have a proper, refined, and balanced human life. This is pleasant and sweet to God and man.<p>When we come to the meetings we can give a testimony, a message, or some praise and thanksgiving which will be an offering of Christ as the meal offering for the enjoyment of God and man. We may say, &#8220;Lord, we were rough people but thank You for becoming our meal offering. We can take You as our refined, even, balanced, and pure life. Thank You that we can be pleasant, not by ourselves but by You as our life.&#8221; We can offer this kind of praise if we have the experience, the surplus. If we live by Christ day by day, He will cause us to have a proper human living, to have the fine, sweet, proper human behavior.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ as the Content of the Church and the Church as the Expression of Christ &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
