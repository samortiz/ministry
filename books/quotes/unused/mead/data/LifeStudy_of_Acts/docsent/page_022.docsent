   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE EIGHT THE PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN JERUSALEM, JUDEA, AND SAMARIA</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PETER S COMPANY 3 Scripture Reading: Acts 2:1-13</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall consider the matter of speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fulfillment of Joel s prophecy on the day of Pentecost implies tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A SYMBOL OF SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 2:3 says, And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, which were divided and sat on each one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here tongues are a symbol of speaking, symbolizing that God s economical Spirit of power is mostly for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 3 says that tongues as of fire sat on each of the one hundred and twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this verse fire symbolizes burning power for purging and motivating in God s economical move.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fact that the verb sat is singular indicates that one tongue sat on each one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>ALL FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Acts 2:4 says, And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in different tongues, even as the Spirit gave them to speak out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here all modifies only filled in the first clause, not began to speak in the second clause.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word all cannot be used as evidence that all the disciples who were filled with the Holy Spirit began to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not All Speaking in Tongues</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to read verse 4 carefully, paying attention to the punctuation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Notice that there is a comma after Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This verse says, And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in different tongues, even as the Spirit gave them to speak out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The comma after Holy Spirit may help us to see that all does not modify both filled and began to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we have two predicates: were filled and began to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to have the discernment to know whether the modifier all modifies both predicates or only the first predicate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If it modifies both predicates, then verse 4 is saying that all spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if it modifies only the first predicate, then this verse is saying that all were filled with the Holy Spirit, but not all spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If Luke s meaning is that all spoke in tongues, he should have used the word all a second time, before the word began.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to grammar, verse 4 is not saying that all were filled with the Holy Spirit and that all began to speak in different tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, suppose we said, All the saints came into the meeting, and they began to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Does this mean that everyone prayed?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No, this is not the meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, verse 4 is not saying that all those who were filled with the Holy Spirit spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who promote today s tongue-speaking may insist that all in 2:4 modifies the second predicate as well as the first.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then they may go on to use this verse as a basis for claiming that on the day of Pentecost each of the one hundred and twenty spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, after spending much time in studying this verse, I have the assurance to say that all does not modify the second predicate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the contrary, this word indicates only that all of the one hundred and twenty were filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, verse 4 does not indicate that they all spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>An Understandable Language</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The tongues spoken in 2:4 were dialects vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>6, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The disciples were Galileans v. 7 , yet they spoke the different foreign dialects of the attendants who came from various parts of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is strong proof that tongue-speaking must be an understandable language, not merely a voice or sound uttered by the tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Greek word rendered speak out in verse 4 is a peculiar word, and purposely chosen to denote the clear, loud utterance Vincent .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have pointed out that the tongues in verse 4 were dialects.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Concerning this, verses 5 through 8 say, Now there were Jews dwelling in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together and were confounded, because each one heard them speaking in his own dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And they were all amazed and marveled, saying, Look, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And how is it that we each hear them in our own dialect in which we were born?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Jews in verse 5 were devout Jews who came from their dispersion to Jerusalem to keep the feast of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 10 speaks of proselytes, Gentiles who were converted to Judaism 6:5; 13:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The word dialect in verses 6 and 8 is synonymous with tongues in verse 4.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to verse 11, the people exclaimed, We hear them speaking in our own tongues the great things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Greek word for tongues here is glossa.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this chapter glossa is used for two things: the speaking organ v. 3 and dialects vv.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>4, 11 , referring to the dialects in verses 6 and 8.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This evidence affords no ground to say that tongue-speaking may be merely a voice or sound uttered by the tongue, the speaking organ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, tongue-speaking must be a dialect, because what the disciples spoke in tongues were all different dialects.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this sense, tongues and dialects are synonyms, interchangeably used in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Those who promote tongue-speaking may insist that it is not necessary for the tongue that is spoken to be an understandable human language.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They may claim that to speak in tongues is simply to utter some kind of sound.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Promoters of tongue-speaking need to say this because much of today s so-called tongues are not dialects but meaningless sounds.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, the tongues spoken on the day of Pentecost were a miracle caused by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, the Galileans who spoke in tongues on the day of Pentecost did not speak with a Galilean accent.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Each one heard them speaking in his own dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although the tongues spoken on the day of Pentecost were dialects, it is not likely that you will hear any dialects spoken by today s tongue-speakers in meetings held for that purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One day, in 1936, I had a talk with a leading Pentecostal missionary concerning these verses in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Holding my Greek-English Interlinear New Testament in my hand, I pointed out to him that here glossa is used in two ways: to denote the tongue, the speaking organ, and to denote a dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He was not able to answer me, but instead patted me on the head and said, Your head is too big.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although I myself had practiced so-called tongue-speaking and had led others to do so, I dropped this practice after speaking with that missionary.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I came to realize that much of what is called tongue-speaking is not the miraculous speaking of a dialect, but something humanly manufactured.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The point we are emphasizing here is that the tongues spoken on the day of Pentecost were genuine dialects and not merely sounds uttered by the tongue.</S>
