   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TWO KINDS OF WALK BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Galatians 5 Paul speaks twice about walking by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. Walking About the First Walk</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word for walk in verse 16, peripateo, means to have our being, to deport ourselves, to order our manner of life, to walk about.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is used with respect to ordinary daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It denotes a common, habitual daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This understanding of walking by the Spirit is confirmed by verses 22 and 23, where Paul speaks of the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The various aspects of the fruit of the Spirit mentioned in these verses are not unusual things; they are aspects of our ordinary daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the walk in verse 16 is our habitual and common daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. Walking in Line the Second Walk</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Greek word for walk in verse 25, stoicheo, has a very different meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is derived from a root which means to arrange in a line.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This may be illustrated by the movement of traffic in designated lanes on a highway.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, the Greek word for walk here means to walk in line.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It also means to march in military rank.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Walking in this way, like soldiers marching in rank, requires that we keep in step.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we compare these two kinds of walk, we see that the second is more regulated than the first.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the second walk we need to walk like an army and keep in step, whereas in the first kind of walk we are free to walk about.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, both kinds of walk, the common, ordinary walk and the walking in line or in rank, are by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our daily living as Christians, we need to have two kinds of walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first is a general walk, whereas the second is the walk according to a certain rule or principle for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the first kind of walk, we need to display the fruit of the Spirit, the virtues listed in 5:22 and 23.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, we are not here simply to exhibit such virtues as love, joy, and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are here for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, we need to walk according to certain rules or principles for the fulfillment of this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For God's purpose, we need to have a walk that is orderly, a walk that is according to certain elementary rules or basic principles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Loving and being joyful are not basic rules or principles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are simply different aspects of our daily life as Christians, not the characteristics of the walk which leads to the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This walk, the second kind of walk by the Spirit, requires that we walk according to basic principles and elementary rules.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may use the daily life of a young sister who is a student to illustrate the two kinds of walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, this sister lives with her family at home.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If she truly lives Christ, she will show forth the virtues of Christ to the members of her family.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the other hand, she needs to be a proper student at school and fulfill all the requirements leading to graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At home she needs to walk as a daughter and sister, but at school she needs to walk as a proper student.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She needs to have both the general walk at home with her family and the more specific walk at school according to basic rules and elementary principles.</S>
