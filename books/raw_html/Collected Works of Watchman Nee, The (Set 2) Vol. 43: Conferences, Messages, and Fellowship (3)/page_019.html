<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">A TALK WITH BROTHER NEE<br />AT HIS FAREWELL DINNER<br />PRIOR TO HIS TRIP OVERSEAS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: June 24, 1937, 9:00 p.m.<br />Place: Shanghai<br />(The dinner was attended by saints at three tables, including the elders and some co-workers. The food was prepared by nine sisters.)</h1><h2 class="head1">THE THREE ASPECTS OF THE WORK</h2><p>During the past month or two, there has been a thought continually within me concerning three aspects of our work: first, the gospel among the poor; second, the need of a large meeting hall for the work; and third, the work in Jen-Ru.</p><h2 class="head2">The Gospel among the Poor</h2><p>Let us first talk about the gospel among the poor. The poor include thieves, rickshaw drivers, pick-pockets, etc. There are many of these kinds of people in Shanghai. The church should consider preaching to the poor as a part of its regular church life. It is a noble matter. These people have never heard the gospel. For them, coming to the gospel meeting would mean losing a few dollars. They already do not have enough for their living. Therefore, we cannot expect them to come to our gospel meeting. Rather, we have to go to where they are. In Shanghai there are eight hundred thousand such people, accounting for a quarter of the total population of Shanghai. This number is higher than the total population of Foochow. It is higher than the combined population of the provinces of Tsinghai and Sinkiang and Mongolia. If one out of ten were saved in a year, we would have eighty thousand who were saved. Even if one out of a thousand were saved, we would still have eight thousand people. If we do this, others will not say that we are stealing sheep, because the sheep we have will have been born and not stolen. Of course, this is not the only reason for our work, but if we do this, we will avoid some criticism.</p><h2 class="head2">A Large Meeting Hall for the Work</h2><p>We hope that in the future the Lord will provide us with a central place, a meeting hall which can accommodate seven to eight thousand people. It will be used for the work, not for the church. The large meeting hall will be used for the annual Overcomer Conferences as well as special conferences for the release of perfecting messages. Perhaps monthly or bimonthly, the whole church can have the Lord's table together there. The rest of the time, the Lord's table would still be held in various homes. If our place is not big enough, we will rent a place. We are not like the church in Corinth where the number was small. We are like the church in Jerusalem where the number was big. In the future we may even have to rent a place to set up our own tents for meeting.</p><h2 class="head2">The Work in Jen-Ru</h2><p>The third aspect is the work in Jen-Ru. I think it is appropriate for me to say something here concerning the nature of the work in Jen-Ru. Jen-Ru is for two groups of people. The first group is the responsible ones in each locality. This place is prepared to render them some spiritual help. During the summer months or the holidays, they can come to study the Bible. This would enable them to better serve in their responsibilities later. The second group is the young co-workers who are clear that they have been called by the Lord to serve Him. They can come here to study the Bible for a while before setting out for their work. Jen-Ru will not take those who still need to be dealt with; it is for those who have been dealt with already and who are ready to serve. It is not for the lazy ones, but for those who want to serve the Lord diligently. I am not afraid of those who have committed sins, but I am afraid of the lazy ones. You have to drag a lazy one along before he will move. If you do not drag him along, he will not move. Or he may move a little if you shout in his ears. But if you do not shout, he will not move. Jen-Ru is also not for the flippant ones to come to receive some dealings. It is for those who have received the basic dealings already and who need to be perfected more deeply. Moreover, Jen-Ru is a personal work under the responsibility of Brother Luan and I. Jen-Ru is not a hostel, a rehabilitation hospital, or a seminary. It is established specifically for the young co-workers and the responsible brothers.</p><p>I dare not say with certainty that these three things are the desire of the Lord, but personally I have this kind of burden within me, which I am presenting before you and asking you to communicate to the saints.</p>
