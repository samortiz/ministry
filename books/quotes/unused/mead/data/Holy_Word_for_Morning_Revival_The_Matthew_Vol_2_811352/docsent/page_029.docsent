   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>24-30 Crucial Points</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The King gave the rejecting generation a sign in Matthew 12:38-42.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sign for the evil and adulterous generation was the sign of Jonah.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord followed this sign with the sign of Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By His word in verses 40 through 42 the Lord prophesied fully concerning His death, burial, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jonah was a type of Christ in His death and burial, and Solomon was a type of Christ in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His death and resurrection were to be the unique sign to this age and to that generation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Matthew 12:43-45 reveals the rejecting generation becoming worse.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here the Lord likened them to the demon possessed man out from whom a demon had gone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That person was like a vacant house which the Lord described with three words: unoccupied, swept, and decorated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the demon realized that the person was unoccupied, it took seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all came to occupy the vacancy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that the Jews will not accept Christ, and their situation will become worse and worse.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Jews' rejection of Christ in this chapter caused Christ to forsake them fully.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, in verses 46 through 50 we see a dispensational turn.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After that, His relationship with people was based upon something spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All those who do the will of the Father are His relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The heavenly King went out of the house and gave the parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom beside the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The house signifies the house of Israel 10:6 , and the sea signifies the Gentile world Dan 7:3, 17; Rev 17:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the parables were mysteries to that stubborn Jewish generation simply because of their pride Matt 13:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the first parable, that of the sower 13:3-8 , Christ establishes the kingdom of the heavens by sowing Himself as the seed of life into believing people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The kingdom is not established by outward working but by inward growing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord's recovery today is the produce of the seed sown by Sister M. E. Barber and Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This parable makes it clear that our heart is the soil v. 19 , the earth, the very place where the seed is sown and where it grows.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first type of soil, the wayside because of much worldly traffic corresponds to those who are not poor in spirit and pure in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The second, the rocky places, corresponds to those who still have their temper, lust, sin, self, and flesh beneath the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead of depth, there are rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The third type of soil, the thorns, is difficult for the seed to grow in because of anxiety and the deceitfulness of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The fourth type of soil, the good heart, is the soil that can grow the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The kingdom of the heavens began with the second parable 13:24-30, 36-43 and began to be established when the church was built 16:18-19 on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From that time, the tares, the false believers, were sown among the true believers, the wheat, forming the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The wheat and the tares are allowed to grow together in the world, not in the church 1 Cor 5:2, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the time of the harvest, the judgment upon the tares will be so serious because they have been confusing, frustrating, and damaging God's economy.</S>
