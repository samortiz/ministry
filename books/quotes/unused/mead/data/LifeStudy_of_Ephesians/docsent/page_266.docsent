   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S INTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s intention is not to gain a people who are merely moral and godly in a religious sense.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His intention is to have a people who have been regenerated, sanctified, purified, transformed, and built up as the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He desires to have the church as the new man with Christ as his person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our concern is to become this new man filled and saturated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s concern is that we be filled with Christ, nourished by Christ, and built up in Christ as a proper church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE LORD S RECOVERY AND</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE LORD S COMING</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everyone in the Lord s recovery needs to be clear about the Lord s move on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not think of the recovery as an ordinary Christian work or movement.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The recovery of the church life is not merely another kind of typical Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No, the recovery is unique and of tremendous significance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord s recovery is related to the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the prophecies in the Bible, two signs of the Lord s coming back are the re-formation of the nation of Israel and the return of Jerusalem to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we all know, these two things have taken place, the re-formation of Israel in 1948 and the return of Jerusalem in 1967.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the Lord s word in Luke 21:24, the return of Jerusalem indicates the fullness of the age of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since these two signs have taken place, we believe that it will not be too long before the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, the world situation is focused on the Middle East, particularly on problems related to oil.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The world situation is coming more and more into line with biblical prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible also tells us that the Bride must be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consider the situation of today s Christianity, and ask yourself where the Bride is being prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is the Bride being prepared in Catholicism? in the denominations? in the charismatic movement? in the independent groups?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I sincerely believe that the Bride is being prepared in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We admit that we are imperfect and rather weak, but it is nevertheless a fact that no other Christians love the Lord Jesus more than those in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Recently we received a report that certain missionaries in Taiwan, although critical of the local churches, admitted that the Christians in the churches were the most mature to be found on that island.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We simply cannot deny the fact that so many of the saints in the Lord s recovery love the Lord Jesus in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>May the Lord impress us that it is not an insignificant matter to be in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The time is short, and the Lord s coming is close.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Surely before He comes back the Bride must be ready for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There may not be time for the Lord to begin another work apart from the recovery as a preparation of the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the Bride is not being prepared in the recovery, please show me where this preparation is taking place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We in the churches must not boast, and we must not be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be either boastful or proud is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, we must admit the fact that no Christians love the Lord more than those in the churches in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We praise the Lord that however weak and imperfect we may be, He is going on among us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We believe that the church life will spread in Europe and eventually reach Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We believe that when the Lord sets His feet on the Mount of Olives at the time of His coming back, there will be a church in Jerusalem to meet Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What a shame it would be to Him if there were no church in Jerusalem at His coming!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Oh, may we all be clear that we are not involved in an ordinary Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are in the Lord s recovery, in His move on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Praise Him, He is marching on!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let us go forth with Him to meet Him in His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>May the Bride be made ready!</S>
