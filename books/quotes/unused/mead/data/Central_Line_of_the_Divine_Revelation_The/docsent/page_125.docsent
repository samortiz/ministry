   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The element in our nature is altogether sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But Christ has come into us to be another element within us, a sinless element.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This other element causes God's redeemed people to live an unleavened life Exo 13:7; 1 Cor 5:7a .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Corinthians 5:7 says, "Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A new lump is a lump without leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that we become a new creation 2 Cor 5:17 without sin.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To Make the Course of Life</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>of God's Redeemed People a Feasting One</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The unleavened bread eaten by God's redeemed makes the course of life of God's redeemed people a feasting one Exo 13:6; 1 Cor 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because we are God's redeemed, our life should always be a happy, feasting life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Throughout the course of our life, we should always be pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should be pleasant all our days, weeks, months, and years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, we often are not like this because we eat leavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Leaven signifies the sinful element.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever we eat leavened bread, we become unhappy people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We become unpleasant whenever sin has come in. When we are unleavened, we are happy and everything is pleasant with us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the function of the unleavened bread within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have one Christ with two aspects, the redeeming aspect and the unleavened aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the redeeming aspect, He becomes our food to satisfy us and to strengthen us to run the course God has set before us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the unleavened aspect, He is the unleavened bread to supply us with the unleavened element so that we can live an unleavened life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this way we can live a life without sin in following the Lord through the entire course of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Living such a life, we become happy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every day, every week, every month, and every year is a feast, and we are feasting all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>B. In the Enjoyment</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>of the Heavenly and Spiritual Supply</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the children of Israel journeyed in the wilderness, they needed more than just the Passover with the lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So God opened the heavens to give them manna.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Hebrew word for manna means, "What is it?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even today no one knows what manna was.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet we do know that manna came from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every day for forty years the children of Israel saw one of the greatest miracles in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Each morning, wherever they journeyed, manna was outside their tents.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet the children of Israel were stubborn and still could not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, we are the same as they.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord still does such a miracle every day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever we wake up, we should say, "O Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To say "O Lord" in the morning and to have morning revival is to gather manna.</S>
