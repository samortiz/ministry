   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:17-18; 11:2; Col 1:12,15,18, 19, 27; 2:2, 3, 9, 10, 16-17; 3:4, 10, 11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I was young, I especially loved the Gospel of John because in that Gospel there are more than ten items used to describe what the Lord Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As I began to study the Epistles of Paul, however, I found many more.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What Paul tells us of Christ, furthermore, is more related to life and more for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suppose in the New Testament the writings of Paul were missing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The divine revelation would not be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is no wonder then, that Paul tells us he has received a commission to complete the word of God Col 1:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What Paul has written is for this completing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mainly he tells us what Christ is, not only who He is but especially what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Altogether there are close to forty items in Paul s writings describing what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In our previous message we found five in Romans and fourteen in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we shall go on to consider those that are mentioned in 2 Corinthians and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>CHRIST IN 2 CORINTHIANS The Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 2 Corinthians we have only two items to cover on what Christ is, but they are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 3:17-18 we find: Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit lit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>. Second Corinthians tells us that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a short term, the significance of which is overlooked by many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They fail to realize that the ultimate expression of the Holy Spirit is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Genesis 1 we have the Spirit of God brooding over the dark waters v. 2 . As the Old Testament progresses, the term Spirit of Jehovah, or Spirit of the Lord, is used.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the beginning of the New Testament we find the term Holy Spirit Matt 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we go on to the Lord s resurrection, we find that in resurrection the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This life-giving Spirit is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , who is the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 and the Spirit that gives life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The title The Spirit is short, but its significance is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Its meaning is conveyed to us in typology in the compound ointment described in Exodus 30:23-33.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The anointing ointment was made of olive oil compounded with four spices.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At first there was only olive oil; but after it was mixed with the spices, it became a compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Olive oil signifies the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The four spices myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia signify the death of Christ, the effectiveness of that death, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The numbers mentioned all have their meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To add four spices to the one hin of olive oil speaks of humanity represented by the number four being added to divinity the number one .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A hand has five fingers: one thumb and four fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The number five signifies the Creator the number one being added to the creature the number four .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This adding of divinity to humanity is The Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Spirit comprises both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Also included in The Spirit are the death of Christ, its effectiveness, His resurrection, and the power of that resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second Corinthians 3:17 tells us that the Lord is now the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ today is the ointment, the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perhaps now you understand why we speak of the all-inclusiveness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our Husband</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ 2 Cor 11:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is strange that this One who in chapter three is presented as The Spirit is here called our Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have a Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brothers, do you realize that we have a Husband?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not think that only the sisters are female; spiritually speaking, we brothers are also female!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the universe there is only one Man and one woman.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ is that Man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In fact, the German translation of this verse has man instead of husband.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Man here actually means husband.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ is the Man, so He is the unique Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Humanity is a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As members of the church, we are all part of the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Practically speaking, how do we know Christ as the Spirit and also as our Husband?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we call on the name of the Lord, we receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Before He touches and captures us, we are the man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is true even of the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some wives play the role of the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For a sister to lord it over her husband indicates that she is void of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If she calls, O Lord Jesus! and keeps calling, the Spirit will come and touch her.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He will subdue her and will Himself become the Husband!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This not only applies to the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What about you brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I have the impression that the German men are as hard as the German bread!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Who can subdue you?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Nonetheless, if you will call, O Lord Jesus! you too will be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The man, then, will be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He will be the Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we are filled with the Spirit, we all become submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Christ as the Spirit is then the Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When Paul wrote, he was not trying to pass on a doctrine to us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For him to say, I have espoused you to one husband, was to say something practical.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He was ministering the Spirit so that we might practically enjoy the Husband.</S>
