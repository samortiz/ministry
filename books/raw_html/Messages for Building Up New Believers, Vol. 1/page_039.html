 <h2 class="head1">IV. HOW TO JOIN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Finally, how do we join the church? The Bible does not say anything about joining the church. This very fact invalidates the expression <em>joining the church.</em> However, we are forced to borrow human expressions. There is no better expression; therefore, we still use the expression <em>joining the church.</em></p>
<h2 class="head2">A. &ldquo;Joining the Church&rdquo; Not Being Necessary,<br />
Not Being Possible</h2>
<p>We must see that the Bible never speaks of joining the church. It is impossible for one to join the church. This is like an ear deciding to join the body to become an ear. Even the best surgeon cannot do such a thing. No one can join the church. If you are in, you are in; if you are not in, you are not in. Being a part of the church does not mean that one passes a test that qualifies him to be a member of a church. If a person wants to &ldquo;join&rdquo; the church, he must first be in the church.</p>
<p>If a person sees something concerning sin and the blood through God&rsquo;s mercy and if he has received salvation, forgiveness, and a new life, having been regenerated through resurrection by God, He has put such a one into the church already. He is already in the church. He is already in and there is no need for him to join. Some people still think that they can join a church. But if there is a church which one can join, such a church must not be a genuine church. One can join such a church because it is a false church. If it were a genuine church, no one could join it even if he tried to. As long as you belong to the Lord and are begotten by Him, you are already in the church; there is no need for you to join.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is neither necessary nor possible for one to join a church. You cannot join a church even if you try. And if you are already in the church, there is no need to join it anyway. Those who are in are in already; there is no need to join. Anyone who wants to join is not in it, and there is no way to join it. This is what the church is all about. The church is a peculiar institution. The issue is whether or not you are born of God. If you are born of God, you are already in. If you are not born of God, you cannot get in even if you try to. You cannot join a church by signing a document, sitting for an examination, writing your resolution, or making up your mind. If you are born of God, you are already in. Thank God that all of us are already in the church; we no longer need to join it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Need to Seek Fellowship in the Church</h2>
<p>If this is the case, why are we telling you to join the church? We are merely borrowing an expression that you can understand. You are a member of the church already. Although it is true that you are saved by God, you are also living among fellow human beings. Some may not know you. The brothers may not recognize you. Faith is something that occurs within you; no one else knows it. This is why you have to seek fellowship. You have to go to the church and tell others, &ldquo;I am a Christian; please receive me as a Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If my father is Chinese, I do not have to join the Chinese race; I am already Chinese. If I am a believer, and the church does not know me, I can go to the church and say, &ldquo;You do not know me, but I am a Christian. Please receive me into your fellowship. Please receive me as one of your own.&rdquo; When the brothers realize that you are indeed one of them, they will have fellowship with you. This is what it means to join the church.</p>
<p>You are already a person in Christ. What you need to do now is to seek fellowship among God&rsquo;s children. You have to seek the fellowship of the members, the fellowship of the Body, and learn to serve God properly in the church. Once your eyes are open to this, thank the Lord, you have taken another step forward.</p>
