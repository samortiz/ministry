It is difficult to speak many things if the outer man is not broken. If a worker never speaks what is within him or cannot impart to others what is within him no matter how hard he tries, this indicates that he is not yet a broken man. If the outward shell of a man is not broken, it is hard for him to approach others. Only a broken man can approach others; he has no outward shell to frustrate him. The hem of the Lord's garment was the most superficial and furthermost thing on the Lord's body. It was not as intimate as the collar or the sleeves. But the Lord's power reached further than the hem of His garment. When the woman with the issue of blood touched this hem, her flow of blood stopped immediately. Even the most outward thing of the Lord was able to heal; His power reached to the furthermost part of His whole body, and this power was diffused out through His outer man. This tells us that He was very approachable to men. There was no distance between Him and other men. Even His garment was able to heal. Of course, some people could not touch the hem of His garment. With us distance is a problem, but with God, this problem does not exist. Everyone who desires blessing can receive blessing today. The Lord does not have any shell surrounding Him. Only we do. This is the reason the outward shell must be broken before we can touch life and minister life to others. If the shell remains intact, life will not flow. If two men are together and the shells of both remain intact, neither will touch life in the other.</p><p>The supply of life can be likened to the process of grafting. In order for two branches to be grafted together, the bark of both branches has to be stripped. If the bark is not stripped and the two branches are merely tied together, the branches will never grow together no matter how long one waits, even if one waits until the time of the great white throne. If our shell is broken, we will touch others as soon as there is a crack in them. Unless there are cracks, putting two parties together will only result in death, even though either party can be living. The same can be said about skin transplants; both the grafted part and the grafting part must be cut. Only life will touch life. If a protective covering remains in either party, nothing will happen. The same law of life applies to plant and animal life, and the same can be said of the spiritual life. It is inexcusable for the shell of a minister to remain whole. Such ones will not be able to supply others with life.</p><p>Brother Chen Hsi-wen: Do we need to seek for more empowering of the spirit before we can minister abundantly to others?</p><p>Watchman Nee: This question can be answered with either a yes or a no. Although Ephesians 3:16 tells us to pray to be strengthened into the inner man, the inner man will not be released, no matter how much it is strengthened, unless the outer man is broken. As soon as the outer man is broken, the inner man will be strengthened and will flow out spontaneously. A man must have the first step, that is, his outer man must be broken, before the strengthening of the inner man will become useful to him. Many servants of the Lord may be weak in their outward body, yet they are strong in their inner man. In many cases the inner man is weak because the outer man is too strong. If the outer man is weakened, crippled, and toppled, the inner man will spontaneously become strong and be released. The more the outer man is broken, the more grace the inner man will deliver. We do not have to ask whether or not the inner man is strengthened. We only need to ask whether the Lord has accomplished any breaking work in us.</p><h2 class="head1">RECOVERING THE GOSPEL OF PENTECOST</h2><p>Question: How can we recover the gospel of power that was at Pentecost?</p><p>Answer: The kind of people we save depends on the kind of gospel we preach. Although I cannot say with absolute certainty, I do believe that the preaching of our gospel must be accompanied by God's mighty power in the future, just as it was with the apostles' preaching at the time of Pentecost. At that time a person sold all that he had as soon as he believed in the Lord. He consecrated himself totally to the Lord and served Him in an absolute way. Today many people preach the gospel by telling a few lighthearted stories, and men are saved in a lighthearted way. We preach the gospel in a halfhearted way, and we bring in halfhearted Christians. If we continue in this way, we probably will have to wait for many years before we dare to speak about consecration. We need absolute gospel preachers before we will have absolute testimonies of salvation. Sooner or later our gospel will have to be the gospel of the kingdom. When the gospel of the kingdom is preached, men will be delivered from all kinds of bondages. They will be delivered from sin, from the world, and from money.</p><p>God will work on us step by step until our whole being is consumed and poured out to be a blessing to the church. We have to be recovered back to Pentecost. We have to preach the gospel like men did then. Those who are saved have to be saved the same way as men were saved then, and they have to consecrate themselves just as men did then. When Zaccheus turned to the Lord, his two hands were stripped of everything. An extortioner by trade, he ended up giving half of what he owned to the poor and returning four times whatever he had taken by false accusation (Luke 19:8). This is the genuine gospel of the kingdom of the heavens. When we say we preach the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens today, we are merely preaching one item of it&mdash;the forgiveness of sin. The rest is not preached. Preaching the gospel of forgiveness is only giving others the bare minimum.</p><p>God is taking the way of recovery today. We should not lightly regard the Lord's recovery. The church is forever advancing. The apostolic age lasted only for a few decades. Today we have two thousand years of history behind us. The truth of the gospel is much clearer today than at the time of the apostles. Although we cannot say that it is clearer than at Paul's time, at least we can say that it is clearer than at Peter's time. Today the church as a whole has more experience than it had at the time of the apostles. At the time of the apostles, the Judaistic shell was not completely shed. This shell remained until after the writing of the book of Hebrews. Clement, one of the church fathers, wrote an epistle to the church in Corinth. However, I cannot say that I appreciate his writings very much, because his gospel could not even match our gospel today. Around 60 A.D. the gospel became obscured. This is the reason John had to stand up to affirm the gospel once more around 90 A.D. In one respect the church has become desolate. In the last century J. N. Darby was the first and only one who spoke about the desolate state of the church. Today the fundamental truth of Christ's salvation has become more clearly and firmly established than ever. However, the church is still missing the power of Pentecost.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
