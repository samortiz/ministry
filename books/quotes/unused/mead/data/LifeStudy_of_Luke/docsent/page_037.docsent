   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MAN-SAVIOR S FOURFOLD COMMISSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have emphasized the fact that the Gospel of Luke presents the Man-Savior in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The cases recorded in Luke show different aspects of the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The narration of the instances in 4:38-41, 5:12-14, and 7:1-10 is according to the order of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this reason the narration is different in Luke from that in Matthew 8:2-16 and Mark 1:29 2:1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The order of Mark s record, showing that Jesus is the Servant of God, is according to history.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The order of Matthew s record, proving that Christ is the King of the kingdom of the heavens, is according to doctrine, with certain instances put together to present a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The order of Luke s record, revealing that Jesus is the proper man to be our Savior, is according to morality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Luke 4:31-44 the Man-Savior carries out His fourfold commission: teaching, casting out demons, healing, and preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 31 says that He came down to Capernaum and was teaching on the Sabbaths.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we have pointed out, His teaching released the word of light to enlighten those in the darkness of death Matt 4:12-16 so that they might receive the light of life John 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Luke 4:32 says that the people were astounded at His teaching, because His word was with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the One authorized by God, the Lord Jesus taught realities whereas the scribes taught vain knowledge without authority or power.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Man-Savior had not only spiritual power to subdue people, but divine authority to subject them to the divine ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Casting Out Demons</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 4:33-36 we have an account of the Lord s casting out of a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 33 we are told that a man in the synagogue had a spirit of an unclean demon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kind of spirit is different from a fallen angel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A demon is one of the spirits of the living creatures who lived in the preadamic age and were judged by God when they joined Satan s rebellion see Life-study of Genesis Message 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The fallen angels work with Satan in the air Eph 2:2; 6:11-12 , and these demons, the unclean spirits, move with him on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both act evilly upon man for the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A demon s possession of a person signifies Satan s usurpation of man, whom God created for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In His ministry the Man-Savior cast out demons from possessed people so that they might be delivered from Satan s bondage Luke 13:16 , out of Satan s authority of darkness Acts 26:18; Col 1:13 , into God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 4:34 the demon said, Ah!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What do we have to do with You, Jesus, Nazarene?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Did You come to destroy us?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I know You, who You are, the Holy One of God!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ah! is an interjection of anger or dismay.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Greek word may be translated, Let us alone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Greek words rendered, What do we have to do with You? literally mean, What to us and to You?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a Hebrew idiom.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 35 says, And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet and come out from him!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And throwing him down in the midst, the demon came out from him without harming him at all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Literally, the Greek word rendered quiet means muzzled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After the Lord cast out the demon, amazement came upon all, and they spoke to one another, saying, What is this word?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out v. 36 . Here we see that the Man-Savior has both authority and power to cast out demons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For His ministry He had divine authority not only to teach people but also to cast out demons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Healing</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 4:38 and 39 we have the record of the Lord s healing of Simon s mother-in-law, who had been seized with a high fever.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This fever may signify a person s unbridled temper, abnormal and intemperate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Luke 4:40 says, And when the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases, brought them to Him; and laying His hands on each one of them, He healed them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sickness is an issue of sin and a sign of man s abnormal condition before God because of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, in His ministry the Man-Savior healed the sick condition of people both physically and spiritually in order to restore them to normal so that they might serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Preaching</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In addition to teaching, casting out demons, and healing the sick, the Lord was also preaching in the synagogues of Judea 4:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Man-Savior s preaching was to announce God s glad tidings to miserable people in bondage v. 43 . His teaching enlightened the ignorant ones in darkness with the divine light of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His preaching implied teaching, and His teaching implied preaching.</S>
