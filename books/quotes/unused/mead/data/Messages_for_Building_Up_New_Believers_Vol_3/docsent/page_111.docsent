   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Learning to Be Humble and Not Proud</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Never boast and say, I have a home already.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do not care whether other brothers are wandering outside.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Something is wrong with our family if we do not feel this loss in our family.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As long as a brother or a sister is still wandering in the denominations, our heart should ache and we should be sad.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should always have two attitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, we have to uphold and maintain our stand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand, we must not be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must stand on the proper ground and persevere in it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But while we maintain that stand, our heart must not become uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must not say, We are the family.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must remember that there are still other members of the family who are wandering outside.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must humble ourselves and learn to petition on their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We pray that they will all come home.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The door is always open to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whether they will come home for good or for a short time, we must always maintain our stand as a family.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must never be so wrong as to think that the church does not exist today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no such thing!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE BASIS OF ONENESS JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Finally, I would like you to remember something.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The oneness of the Body is a oneness not only among Christians, but a oneness with God and with His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. God s Presence Bringing in His Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Old Testament, whenever God s presence was manifested, His judgment was executed as well.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The presence of God means the presence of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is no question of judgment where His presence is not felt.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But as soon as there is His presence, there is judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we want to maintain Christian oneness, we must uphold His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His presence means judgment and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He executes judgment on everything that is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Where His presence is lacking, the requirement is not stringent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But where His presence is manifested, no sin can be tolerated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the church tolerates sin and covers things up, there cannot be the possibility of maintaining any oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>B. Forsaking Sins Being the Basis of Oneness</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I would like to draw your attention to the basis of our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is fundamental.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The basis of our oneness is the forsaking of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please bear in mind that God s children are divided today because of the problem of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The matter of sins is always implicated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because of many sins, there are many divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many of God s children have a basic misunderstanding; they think that patience and forbearance are the basis of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no such thing as this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible never takes patience or forbearance as the basis of our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible always takes the forsaking of sins as the basis of our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If anyone wants to have fellowship with God today, he must walk in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We will have fellowship with one another when we are in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may say that fellowship is the basis of our oneness, but the basis of fellowship is our dealing with sin and our removal of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When all of us are in God s light, we have fellowship one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Other than this, there is no fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Second Corinthians 6 shows us that when we separate ourselves, God becomes our Father and we become His children vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s fellowship with us is based on our separation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not keep men s natural ties at the expense of God s fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is where many people have failed!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Who are the vessels of honor in the eyes of God?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They are those who have cleansed themselves from dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If a man cleanses himself from dishonor, he becomes a vessel unto honor.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Those who call upon the name of the Lord must depart from unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only those who depart from unrighteousness can call upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If a man cleanses himself, he becomes a vessel unto honor.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If a man is a vessel unto honor, he can pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart 2 Tim 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only those who draw their swords and take a stand on God s side to kill their own brothers are qualified to be Levites Exo 32:26-28 .</S>
