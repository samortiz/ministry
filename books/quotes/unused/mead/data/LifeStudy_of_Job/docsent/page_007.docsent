   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SUBJECT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The subject of the book of Job is the purpose of God's dealing with His holy one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Job is a book of the debates of godly men concerning the purpose of the sufferings of the saints, that is, the purpose of God's dealing with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since Job is such an early book, it does not contain a clear revelation of God's purpose in dealing with His people.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Paul's Epistles we see that God's purpose in dealing with us is to strip us of all things so that we may gain God more and more.</S>
