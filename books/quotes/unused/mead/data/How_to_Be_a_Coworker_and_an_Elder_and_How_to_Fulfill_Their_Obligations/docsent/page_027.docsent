   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thinking more highly of yourself than you ought to think is another form of pride Rom 12:3.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ in His humanity humbling Himself to wash His disciples' feet gives us a good model of how to humble ourselves for us to escape from pride John 13:3-5.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Self-boasting, self-exaltation, self-glorification, and lusting after vainglory are all ugly and base expressions of pride Gal 5:26.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Self-justification: Self-justification indicates condemning of others and exalting of yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord came not to condemn men but to save men by forgiving forgetting their sins John 3:17.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church is neither a police station arresting people nor a law court judging people, but a home raising up believers, a hospital healing and recovering believers, and a school teaching and edifying believers.</S>
