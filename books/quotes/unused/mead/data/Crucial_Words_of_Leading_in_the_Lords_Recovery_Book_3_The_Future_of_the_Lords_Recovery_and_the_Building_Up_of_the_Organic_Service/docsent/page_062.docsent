   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FORMING GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The groups are crucial, and we must take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the local churches should go over their name lists to see how many saints in their localities meet regularly and how many are no longer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then the saints who meet regularly should be formed into groups.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every group should have only twelve saints at the most.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, when the groups are formed, they should have less than twelve saints so that they can bring in new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There should be no group leaders or coordinators, because all the saints are coordinators.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After the groups are formed, the full-time and part-time serving ones should be assigned to care for the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is critical for the serving ones not to replace the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For the care of the groups, we should do our best to form them according to the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, the church in Taipei will have more than four hundred small groups, which are formed by the ten districts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If each district has forty groups, there will be about four hundred saints in the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every group needs full-time or part-time serving ones to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The groups should be formed according to where the saints live, and there should not be group leaders or coordinators.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The saints in a group should live near one another, and one full-time or part-time serving one should be responsible for helping them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, the full-time and part-time serving ones can give the small groups material for their weekly meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They should teach the saints how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are some of the responsibilities of the full-time and part-time serving ones in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The saints in every local church can be formed into groups.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The elders should take care of the administration of the entire church, and a few co-workers should take the lead in the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These are the principles for making arrangements in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>OTHER IMPORTANT POINTS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>IN THE FULL-TIMERS WORK The Campus Work</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Concerning the campus work, we must consider how many campuses in a locality are ready for the serving ones and how many campuses are not.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We also must know how many full-timers and other saints can serve.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we can make appropriate arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Children s Work</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must realize that the children s work is a crucial burden.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every locality must be aggressive in the children s work, because there is a greater future in the children s work than in the campus work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Generally speaking, it is easier to bring in children, and once they come in, they usually remain.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our history confirms this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church in Manila is an example.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Most of the saints in the church in Manila were gained by the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ninety percent of the churches in the Philippines are maintained by saints in their thirties, and most of these saints grew up in the church and attended the children s meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we preach the gospel, we frequently have to go out to gain people; we even go to the campuses to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These people are along the roads and hedges Luke 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is only one group of people who are not along the roads: the children in our own homes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why do we not work on our own children?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The people along the roads might come today or tomorrow, but the people in our own homes will always be there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, our children can bring other children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, they should be a crucial focus of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This work is long-lasting and remaining.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A child who is six years old today will be thirteen in seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That is a good age to enter the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When they enter the church life, they are our young brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When they enter junior high school, they will be gospel seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Through them, it will be easier for us to work in the junior high schools.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If this is our vision, we will be aggressive in the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more children we have, the better it will be.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If by the end of 1985 or the beginning of 1986 the church in Taipei has twenty thousand children, the church in Taipei will have a tremendous future.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must expand our view.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is something worth doing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Another benefit of the children s work is that we can bring the high school and college students into the coordination, and it will be easy for them to advance the work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every local church must do its best to form small groups, begin the campus work, and develop the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Gospel in the Homes</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The gospel in the homes cannot be separated from the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It has to be carried out by brothers and sisters who are capable and who have much time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Community Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The full-time serving ones also need to advance the community gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the most difficult item to carry out, and it requires everyone, including the elderly, the middle-aged, and the young saints.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As many saints as are available should be used.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The community gospel work is limitless.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The local churches must make good arrangements concerning this aspect of the work by assigning full-time and part-time serving ones according to the need and by utilizing every saint, especially those with a profession.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For example, if a certain brother teaches junior high school, he can help with the gospel work on that campus.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If a saint is the owner of a factory, an engineer at a factory, or even a worker in a factory, he can contact people in the factory and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some saints work in government offices and others in hospitals.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They can spread the gospel where they work.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The churches must assign full-time and part-time serving ones to coordinate with the saints.</S>
