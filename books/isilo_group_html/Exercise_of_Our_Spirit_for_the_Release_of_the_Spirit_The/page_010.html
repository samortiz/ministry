<p>The way we can express and manifest God is by opening and releasing our spirit. If we release our spirit, the very God who is in our spirit will automatically be released because He has committed Himself to our spirit. To illustrate, suppose I put a key in a brother&rsquo;s hand. If the brother closes his hand and never opens it, the hand becomes a prison to the key, and the key cannot be released. As long as he holds the key fast, no one can see the key, and the key cannot be released. However, once he simply opens his hand, the key is released. There is no need for him to exercise his arms, legs, feet, head, or any other part of his body. All he must do is open his hand, and the key will be released.</p>
<p>In a similar way, God today is in our spirit, but most of the time our spirit remains closed while our mind and mouth are open. When we come together to meet, we may know how to exercise our mouth, but we do not know how to exercise our spirit. Consequently, our mouths are open and active to gossip and talk about other people, but our spirit is closed. Then when someone suggests that we pray, everyone closes his mouth. The reason for this is simply that we do not know how to exercise our spirit. If we were those living in the Lord and walking in His presence, we would shut our mouths if we heard someone gossiping or speaking vain things. Furthermore, if given the opportunity to glorify, exalt, and express the Lord, we would pray, sing a hymn, and release our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT BY SINGING</h2>
<p>My only burden is that the Lord would impress us that as Christians who are seeking the Lord, we must realize the secret and mystery of our relationship with the Lord, which is the matter of the exercise of our spirit. We must open our spirit, exercise it, and use it. The most helpful way to exercise our spirit is to pray, but sometimes it is even better to sing. We may sing something short such as a chorus in a loud way, or we may sing something long such as a psalm in a quiet way. Ephesians 5:19 and Colossians 3:16 both mention psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. In terms of length, psalms are the longest, hymns are shorter, and spiritual songs, which are like the choruses of hymns, are the shortest. Many times in the meetings we should sing a short chorus with our spirit and from our spirit.</p>
<p>We should each have some choruses memorized so that we can sing them all the time in our spirit and with our spirit. When the young people want to exercise, they often play basketball, baseball, or football. That is the best way for them to exercise their body. However, in order to play, they need a ball. Similarly, the best way for us to exercise our spirit is to sing, but we need a &ldquo;ball.&rdquo; We need to have some choruses in us so that we can sing them all the time. Then we must exercise to sing, not merely from our mouth but from our spirit and in our spirit.</p>
<p>Recently we have been working to prepare a hymnal. If the Lord is willing, it would be good if He raised up some saints to compose some songs on the book of Ephesians, perhaps a song for each chapter. Then when the saints come together, they could use these songs to sing the whole book of Ephesians. In addition, it would be wonderful to have songs on Romans 8 and Colossians 1. Many Christians today sing the Old Testament psalms, but that is not up to the standard of the New Testament. Very few people have composed songs on the New Testament revelation.</p>
<p>We must learn to sing because the more we sing, the more we get out of our mind and forget about our circumstances. The more we sing, the more we are in the spirit and the more our spirit is open and released. This is not my thought or opinion; this is the thought of the Holy Spirit and the thought of the apostle Paul. In Ephesians 5:18-19, Paul says that we should be filled in spirit, speaking to one another by singing. If we speak to one another by singing a psalm, hymn, or spiritual song, our spirits will be exercised and the Spirit will come out. We should not try to sing in a musical way but in a spiritual way. We should even forget about the music, the meter, and the rhyme. I am not a musician or an expert singer; I cannot sing that well. However, whether I sing well or not, I must sing. We must learn how to praise the Lord by singing. We need to read, study, and be able to recite some hymns. This way we can sing on the street or in the car. This matter is revealed not only in the New Testament but also in the Old Testament. When the people of Israel came together to worship God in the Old Testament, they sang as they were on their way to Zion (Psa. 133:1-3). If we sing while we are coming to the meeting in the car, the meeting will be in the heavens. We must learn to exercise and open our spirit by singing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FULFILLING THE LORD&rsquo;S WILL<br />
BY EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We must realize that God&rsquo;s intention and purpose for us is not that we would do something for Him but that we would be a vessel to contain and express Him. As long as we contain and express God, we will be in a proper condition. Today many Christians are talking about overcoming and being victorious over sin. However, we will never overcome sin by focusing on victory over sin. If we forget about sin and instead sing and praise all the time, we will be in the heavens, sin will not be able to touch us, and we will have the victory over sin. Many people are seeking to know the Lord&rsquo;s mind and will. However, if we would sing, the Lord&rsquo;s will would be clear to us in our spirit. The right way for a Christian to take is to exercise the spirit, contact God, receive the Lord, and express Him. If we have this, we will have everything, including victory over the world, sin, and the self.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s purpose is that we would express Him. Let us forget everything else and simply learn how to exercise our spirit by praying, praising, and singing. If we do this, the Spirit, who is the Lord Himself, will automatically be released from our spirit. Then we will grow every day and will be transformed by the renewing of our mind (Rom. 12:2). It is not by teaching, doctrine, or knowledge that we grow but by the exercise of the spirit. Thus, we must learn how to exercise our spirit so that we may continually grow and experience, enjoy, and partake of Christ. If we do this, we will be in Him all the time. This is the meaning of abiding in the Lord. This message is not a teaching or a doctrine. Rather, it is like a map to show us the way to drive. If we do not actually drive, the map is of no use, but if we begin to drive, this map will be very useful. We must learn to exercise our spirit by praying, praising, and singing.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of Our Spirit for the Release of the Spirit &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
