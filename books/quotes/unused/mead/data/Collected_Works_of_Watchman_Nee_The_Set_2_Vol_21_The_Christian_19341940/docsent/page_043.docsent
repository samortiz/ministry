   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The word pararrhueo not only means leaking; in the original language it also means drifting past.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Drifting means that there is no need of exerting any strength.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It requires strength to sail a boat.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But if one drifts along with the current, there is no need to exert any strength.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To drift is to go along with the power of the current.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It means to follow the direction of the flow; wherever the water goes, one follows along.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please remember that it is impossible to arrive at one's destiny by drifting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you want to go to Pu-tong, you have to hold firmly to your rudder and steer forcefully.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You cannot drift along.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you drift along, you will never arrive at your destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you want to reach the Kao-chang Temple, you cannot follow the current down to the Wu-soong River mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You cannot drift.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to arrive at a specified destiny, one cannot drift; he has to fight against drifting with singleness of effort.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It takes effort to arrive at a destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But it does not take any effort to drift; all that one has to do is to lie on the water and float along.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Wherever the current takes him, he follows along.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Wherever the water carries him, he goes with it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He goes where the wind carries him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is drifting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Friends, all spiritual things, all spiritual walks, and everything related to Christ require that we firmly grasp the Lord and also require a conscious effort to oppose Satan, the world, and ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Can we rest and be at ease?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is it easy to be a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Can we be careless and drift with the tide?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no such cheap thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please remember that in order to have a single destiny in our heart, we cannot drift.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let me ask what the goal of our Christian life today is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we wanted to go to Pu-tong and our boat was moving west, we would surely become worried.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the boat continued in the westward direction, we would never reach Pu-tong and we would miss our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if we had no intention of going to Pu-tong, and if we had no destiny at all, we would drift along and be satisfied with whatever came along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every Christian should have an ambition to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Needless to say, our ambition is not to please ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot be satisfied with whatever comes along.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to have a goal and we should press toward the mark, forgetting what is behind and pressing forward to what is before.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many people do not have anything behind them, because they do not have a goal ahead of them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If one does not have a goal, he does not have anything behind him or in front of him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To him every place is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In traveling from Nanking to Shanghai, and especially around the Kun-shan district, one sees many buffalo-driven water mills.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The water mills are geared to large treadmills, and the buffalos walk around the treadmills day and night, circling them continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are constantly walking, yet they remain in the same place all the time; everywhere is the starting point and everywhere is the ending point; there is no beginning and no ending.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They do not know which way is east and which way is west, which way is north and which way is south; they do not have a goal, and all they do is walk around the treadmills.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have to realize that many Christians are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They go around in circles every day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no front and no back.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are drifting because they do not have a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is the purpose of becoming a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do you really intend to glorify God as the Scripture says?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you do, you have to show me your faith, and you have to press forward all the way to the end. You have to set your eyes on the goal, and you must resolve to reach your goal.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you see anything contrary to this goal, you have to exert your effort to resist it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you see the race ahead of you, you will surely forget the things that are behind and press forward toward the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Otherwise, you will be drifting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Young men and women, does your Christian life have a goal?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who do not have a goal will surely drift.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Recently I was in Hong Kong, and I visited a co-worker there who is also my friend and whom I have not seen for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He told me about a very rich man in Hong Kong who is a nominal member of the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He told my friend, "Don't visit me anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You are serving God, while I am serving mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You should serve God with all your heart and all your soul, and I must serve mammon with all my heart and all my soul.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You have your way and I have my way."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You can see that although this man took the wrong way, he nevertheless had a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He wanted to serve mammon with all his heart and all his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What I am the most afraid of is drifting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today many Christians are drifting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes they serve God, while at other times they serve mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They do not have a direction, and they are drifting.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If the water carries them to Pu-tong, they go to Pu-tong, and if the water carries them to Pu-si, they go to Pu-si.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do you know what the danger of drifting is?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Drifting is something that goes on unnoticed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If a whirlwind comes and takes you away, you feel it right away, because the change is sudden.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If a large steamer comes and tugs you along, you feel it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Drifting, however, goes on unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But drifting always goes from a higher place to a lower place.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is no question about the direction; it is always from the higher place to the lower place, from the upper ground to the lower ground.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Drifting does not take any effort.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Moreover, it does not take any feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A boat ride from here to Wu-soong takes an hour or more.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But if one drifts along, it may take six or more hours.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Drifting is slow, and there is not much difference between one minute and the next.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is not much difference in three or five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But in six hours, one can find himself in Wu-soong and in a very different place.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Many brothers have not committed any gross sins; they are still quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They still read the Bible, come to meetings, offer money, and seem to be the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But after one day, two days, one month, two months, in three or four years, they are very different.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>One does not backslide suddenly or instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There is no such thing as an instant backsliding.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>No spiritual experience occurs suddenly; everything manifests itself in time.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is a very bad thing to drift along.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In the end everything drifts away.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You may not have committed any gross sins, but you have backslidden imperceptibly.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Perhaps nothing will manifest itself immediately, and perhaps no one sees much of a difference in your Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But you must remember that drifting will never carry you upward; it always carries you downward.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Conditions deteriorate day after day, one day at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You may not feel this deterioration, but others can feel it already.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>All pianists know the truth in the adage: "If a man does not practice his piano for a day, he knows it.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If he does not practice for two days, his wife knows it.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If he does not practice for three days, the whole world knows it."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>A little slippage every day will eventually manifest itself.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In the beginning, there is very little difference, but in the end, the difference will become very great.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>God requires that we live before Him every day.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Every day, we have to exercise our spiritual strength, and like the apostle, we have to exercise all our inner strength and the power of our spirit and our soul to stand fast and not drift.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we do this, we will see some progress in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If Satan gave us the whole world in one instant, we would not take it.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>What he does instead is to cause us to stand still and not advance, to gradually drift along with the tide, until one day we fall.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I am convinced that Satan is not hasty in dragging us into gross sins.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If Satan tried to induce you to kill a man today, you would surely not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>He will not induce you to commit any great sins.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>He always comes slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Today he will put a hatred within you.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Tomorrow he will put a jealousy within you.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Perhaps after twenty years, you will have the thought of killing someone.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Please be reminded that Satan is very patient.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>His patience far exceeds our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>It is not inconceivable for us to do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Every day we need spiritual strength, and we need to maintain the condition that we had at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>God's hand will preserve us.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Do not become careless just because today is more or less the same as yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>A little bit of difference every day will become a big difference in ten or twenty years' time.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>May the Lord be merciful to those Christians who think that everything is more or less the same!</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Drifting is being without a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>It is not feeling anything.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>But the result of drifting is always a downward trend; one always travels from a higher ground to a lower ground.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We must be clear that no one can drift from the Wu-soong River mouth to the Kao-chang Temple.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The current will never carry one upward.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>No one can drift from the mouth of the Yangtze River to Wu-han.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>It is impossible for you to expect growth in your spiritual life if you are drifting.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>I have never seen a person who does not exercise his will experience any progress.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>D.L. Moody said that he never saw a lazy person be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>I can also say that I have never seen a lazy person who grows.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>It may be possible to strike a fortune by being lazy, but being lazy will certainly not work in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>If one does not press forward, he will receive nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If one is not hungry, he will not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>If one does not pray and fast before the Lord, he cannot expect to receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>The word perhaps is not applicable here.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Drifting is always downward; never think that perhaps one can drift upward.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>To hope that things will get better in a few days, that the weather will get better in a few days, and that you will feel better is to drift along.</S>
