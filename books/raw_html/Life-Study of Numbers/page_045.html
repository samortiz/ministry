<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>BEING FORMED INTO AN ARMY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(12)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Num. 8</H1><P>In this message on chapter eight of Numbers, we will briefly consider two matters&#151;lighting the lamps (vv. 2-4) and the presenting of the Levites (the serving ones of the priesthood&#151;vv. 5-26). Instead of covering these matters in detail, we will pay attention only to some of the crucial points.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. LIGHTING THE LAMPS</H2><P>Numbers 7 speaks of the offerings related to transportation, and 8:2-4 speaks of the lighting of the lamps. Only after the offerings were presented did Aaron light the lamps.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. After the Conversation<br>with God through the Offerings</H2><P>Numbers 7 ends with Moses conversing with God through the offerings (v. 89). The lamps were lit after this conversation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Seven Lamps Giving<br>Light in Front of the Lampstand</H2><P>Numbers 8:2 and 3 say, "When you light the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand. And Aaron did so; he lit its lamps in front of the lampstand, as Jehovah commanded Moses." Here we see that the seven lamps, which signify the seven Spirits (Rev. 4:5), gave light in front of the lampstand, shining toward the middle, or the central part, of the tabernacle. Thus, the shining of the lamps was in the right direction for serving and moving.</P><P>Within the tabernacle there was no light from the sun, moon, or stars. Apart from the shining of the lampstand, the entire tabernacle would have been in darkness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Workmanship of the Lampstand</H2><P>"This was the workmanship of the lampstand, hammered work of gold; from its base to its buds, it was hammered work; according to the pattern which Jehovah had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand" (Num. 8:4). The workmanship of the lampstand portrays the constituting of Christ as the light-holder. One piece of gold was hammered into the form of a lampstand according to the pattern that God had shown Moses (Exo. 25:31-40; 37:17-24). Gold signifies Christ's divine nature, and the beating of the gold signifies Christ's sufferings in His humanity, through which He was constituted as the divine light-holder to shine in God's dwelling place so that God's serving ones could serve there. (For further details concerning the lampstand, see Life-study of Exodus, Messages Ninety-two through Ninety-four.)</P><P>At this point the people were ready, the transportation had been offered, and the lamps had been lit. Thus, God's people could begin to render their spiritual service to Him.</P>
