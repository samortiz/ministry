   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE BREAKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF JACOB'S NATURAL LIFE Scripture Reading: Gen 31 35</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are a few meanings of the name Jacob in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One meaning is "to grasp," and another is "to supplant."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have said previously that Jacob was constantly under God's discipline because of his craftiness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God would not allow him to be free.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He made him leave his home.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For twenty years, God allowed him to be cheated by his uncle in Padan-aram; his wages were changed ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was a very difficult period for him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jacob's experience was totally different from that of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Isaac's characteristic was one of receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is quick and easy for us to receive riches from God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It takes only a short time for a Christian to enter into the riches of Christ and to realize that the facts in Christ and the life of Christ are his.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The moment he sees this, he enters into it, and all problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But Jacob's experience was different; his experience lasted a lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The natural life is something that lasts a lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The activity of our flesh lasts for as long as we live on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that we need God's continuous, long-term dealings; He has to deal with us step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We thank the Lord that this work will not be left unfinished; it will not be left undone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God will finish this work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God put His hand on Jacob's natural strength, and he became weak.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us consider the third section of Jacob's history, which covers the way his natural life was broken through God's dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>PROGRESS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God used Jacob's years in the house of Laban to deal with him, to discipline him, and to subdue him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But Jacob was still Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No matter how shrewd Laban was, Jacob still came out on top.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although he was oppressed in many ways, he was still very resourceful; even his flock fell for his schemes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After twenty years, the time had come for God to speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He had already had eleven sons, but this was the first time that God spoke to him since the time He spoke to him in the dream at Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God Releasing Jacob Back to Canaan</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Genesis 31:3 says, "And the Lord said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 13 says, "I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God was calling Jacob to return to his own land.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Subsequently, Jacob prepared to return to his kindred's land.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Laban, however, did not want to let Jacob go.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although Jacob had somewhat taken advantage of Laban, God still blessed Laban for Jacob's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was still better for Jacob to serve him than for him to shepherd the flock himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, Laban would not let Jacob go.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After Jacob told Rachel and Leah of his intention and had their consent, he took his wives, children, and all the cattle and possessions he had acquired in Padan-aram and secretly left without telling Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the third day, Laban learned of this and went after Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The night before he caught up with Jacob, God spoke to Laban in a dream: "Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad" v. 24 . God would not allow Laban to say anything, because He was leading Jacob out of the place of trial and was taking him home.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The time had come, and God wanted to release him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every trial will last for only a limited period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the goal of Jacob's trial was reached, God released him and Laban could do nothing to stop him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Laban heard God's word, and dared not say much when he caught up with Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, they made a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This covenant was very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee; this heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor..." vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>51-53a .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Laban was the grandson of Nahor, who was Abraham's brother.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Consequently, Laban said, "The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor..."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But God would not recognize this, so "Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac" v. 53b . Laban could say politely, "The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor," but Jacob could not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He could only swear by the God of his father Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means that the line of God's promise began from His choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God had chosen Jacob's father Isaac and his grandfather Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God alone had done this, and no one else could interfere.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even Nahor could not interfere.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The incident following this was even more precious.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount" v. 54 . Laban did not offer up any sacrifice; only Jacob offered up sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Jacob heard God's voice and began to draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He had made some progress.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He went to Padan-aram because his mother had persuaded him to go; he did not go because of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When he met God at Bethel, he did not do anything except make a vow to God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For his return God told him to go back, and he obeyed God's word to return.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His relationship with God had improved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This was the first time he obeyed God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This was the first time he submitted to God and the first time he offered sacrifice to God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although the twenty years of discipline did not make Jacob a different man, he now showed some desire for God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There was some progress.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When Jacob took hold of his brother's heel and coveted the birthright and blessing, he was not after God, but after the goodness from God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In other words, he wanted God's gift and not the Giver.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He wanted God's things and not God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But after twenty years of discipline under God, there was some inclination toward God and some turn.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, at the time of their covenanting, only Jacob offered sacrifice to God; Laban did not offer any sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After Jacob offered his sacrifice, he parted with Laban the next day and set out on his journey to Canaan.</S>
