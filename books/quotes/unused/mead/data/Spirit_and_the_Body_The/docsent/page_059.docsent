   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INVITING THE YOUNG PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO OUR HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, the freshmen in college are eager to leave home; on the other hand, as they live in the dormitories at school, they are often lonely and homesick.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This provides an excellent opportunity to invite them into our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The young people in the church can invite others to the homes of the middle-aged ones and of the young couples.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All these homes need to be open and ready to receive the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When they come in, serve them something to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This will touch their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In preaching the gospel we do not need any gimmicks.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should simply pray, preach the word, and open our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is difficult for the young people both to go to the campuses and to prepare their homes to receive others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need the youngest ones to go to the campuses, the oldest ones to pray, and the middle-aged ones to prepare their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Day and night the homes need to be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>September is a golden time to catch the freshmen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every September we should be able to catch a good number.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This does not mean that we do not preach the gospel to others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our daily walk, our meetings, and our communal life are all a type of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Wherever we live, we influence the community.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But we must purposely form teams to go to the campuses to reach the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do this with much prayer, a good number will be brought in. Let September be the time to make contact and October the month to reap.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During these months, concentrate your time and labor on reaping a new crop of freshmen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First you reap them, then you build them up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After that, you may use them to gain their classmates or roommates.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to do the same thing year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I believe that each time we do this, more freshmen will be reaped.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not miss this opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must pray and seize this golden opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we gain the freshmen, then through them we shall gain some of their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It seems that when young people reach the age of nineteen or twenty, they will not listen to their parents, but their parents will listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>DEALING WITH OPPOSERS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From the time the Lord's recovery came to this country, there has been opposition against it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord's recovery, of course, is a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But religion does not feel positively about this testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Satan, the Devil, is behind this opposition, for he knows that the recovery will defeat him and bring the Lord Jesus back.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, through the years, the opposition has followed us wherever we have gone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to the book of Acts, it was the same with the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Wherever the apostles went, the opposition was there.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some of the opposers even followed the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the midst of this opposition, we must not be passive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should be not only active, but even aggressive.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, we do not want to fight with others or be angry with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever you meet an opposer, take that as an opportunity to work on him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If that opposer says something negative, do not argue with him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead, be patient and pleasant, and take down all the negative points he speaks to you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then, ask for his name, address, and telephone number and let him know that you would like to study the points and talk with him again.</S>
