   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>11 This may conflict with your concept of what is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many of God's children whom you judge to be "wrong" in their conduct could never be accepted by you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, we must honor the Holy Spirit in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the Holy Spirit can supply, encourage, or even send them to a work, we too must act accordingly with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the Holy Spirit can overlook a certain matter that is in them, then why not we?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Regardless of what others look like, the fact is that many of God's children follow a different system than you do.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In your sight they are not worthy of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Notwithstanding, they do walk with God and have a very close fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This clearly shows us that fellowship is based on one's spiritual condition and demands that we stop all of our actions in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some may reject this, thinking that such a way will certainly destroy the outward uniformity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We know that our flesh cannot suffer external differences, because the flesh delights to see all outward matters in uniformity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The flesh demands that everyone conform to a set of regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Testament has letters and laws in the same way that the Old Testament has them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only as we live in the reality of the Spirit and apprehend all truth in life, and only as we are not in the mind, are we able to put the emphasis on the reality of the Spirit rather than on the uniformity of externalities.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>12 We can recall how the apostles gave freedom to man regarding food and the keeping of days Rom 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If it were up to us, we would have thought that these external differences were of extreme significance and would not have allowed anyone the freedom of choice regarding them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once we would discover that some in our midst eat herbs and keep the Sabbath, how uneasy and anxious our hearts would be!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the oneness and fellowship among Christians are too deep for us to fathom and beyond the touch of these external things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, there is no record in the Bible that those who preach and teach out of envy and strife should be excommunicated Phil 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If an assembly cannot do its duty to remove the evil one 1 Cor 5:2 , that assembly and that evil person are not formally dealt with!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The apostle only exercised his spiritual authority vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is recorded in the Scriptures that even the antichrists went out from the church according to their own volition 1 John 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, they were not excommunicated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These examples tell us that an outward uniformity during an age of desolation is not in the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Recall the ark in the houses of Abinadab and Obed-edom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There God was only interested in the perfect testimony of Christ i.e., the ark and not the details of worship in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During the revival of Nehemiah and Ezra, quite a few things were different from before; nevertheless, God acknowledged them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During the time of Christ, we see a group of people who had outward correctness, but we also see how Christ intentionally put aside all of these external things in order to pay attention to the weightier matters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We believe that in today's apostasy the Lord will lead His people to see the value of spiritual matters and to be lenient on outward correctness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Pharisees of the past were really good at keeping the law "as to the law, a Pharisee."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now I must inquire about your position concerning the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do our brothers surpass other Christians in spirituality, in zeal for Christ, and in the separation from the world?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Or do they surpass others only in their position regarding the church?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the chief characteristic of our assemblies is not in the spiritual realm, but rather in the correctness of our meeting, then our best is but an equal to the activity of the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How regrettable it is to have so much light but fail to serve the Lord with the singleness of those who do not have as much light!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>13 We are not here to forsake the least of God's commands; neither are we here to strain out the gnat but swallow the camel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We feel regretful about those who always overlook the small matters because of a dull conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The small matters are the same as the large matters when both are the commands of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, we are assured that the more important matters need to be taken care of first.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Have you seen the danger of possibly losing the living water of blessing which you once possessed in the beginning and of being left with a system of meeting, like one of the many movements?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you do not see that the fellowship should be in the Holy Spirit, and if you replace it with outward correctness, have you not then become one of the denominations?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once several brothers came together to talk about "the fellowship of the apostles."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They touched upon the matter of the orthodoxy of fellowship, and a brother said that orthodoxy is simply the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, the orthodox fellowship has nothing to do with who is first and who is last; it is not a question of scriptural methods.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It has to do with the Holy Spirit having the full lordship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you try to have outward uniformity in practice and in Bible interpretation, you will, on the contrary, cause divisions among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even the most spiritual ones will divide themselves into different organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have no intention to ignore the external matters, because these outward matters are the testimony not the forms of the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can only cause others to accept the outward things through teaching and love; we cannot achieve our goal through excommunication.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we do this, we will become a sect and will find death rather than life in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many divisions are the result of this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>14 We must know the "oneness of the Holy Spirit" before we experience the fellowship in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Within each believer, there is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Holy Spirit in one believer, plus the Holy Spirit in another believer, plus the Holy Spirit in all the saints becomes the oneness of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all must do our best to keep this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Notwithstanding, the flesh in us makes us different; it creates "strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, divisions, sects."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we endeavor to keep the oneness of the Spirit, we must know in experience how to apply the cross to our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the Holy Spirit becomes the Lord in us and we follow His leading, then we will have the oneness among us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We cannot keep what we do not have.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If the life of the flesh has not been dealt with, there will never be the unity of the Spirit in our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is of no use to make the keeping of the "oneness of the Spirit" mere talk.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only when we live in the oneness of the Spirit do we fully enjoy the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The deadly root in the saints today is that they do not know the crucifixion of their flesh; consequently, they do not know the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We beseech God to grant this revelation to the saints so that they may lay aside and judge the life of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>May the Lord do a deeper work in us until the flesh is fully exposed and judged.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>15 Dear brothers, the fellowship in the Holy Spirit is too spiritual a matter and is beyond our power to guard.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All we can do is keep our fellowship from evil doers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Holy Spirit alone can keep His own fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Human hands are completely useless in guarding the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the Holy Spirit is not Lord in our lives, we cannot enjoy the glory and the smile of His face, regardless of how careful we are with outward matters.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are convinced that confusion sets in where the Holy Spirit is not the Lord and the human hand is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, we must cause the fellowship in our meetings to become very spiritual so that all who are of the flesh dare not join.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When the Holy Spirit has the authority, the fleshly ones will not dare to partake.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Dear brothers, will you bring this matter which we have presented into much prayer and consideration?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We believe that this is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Would you be willing to lay aside your former prejudice, which you have put in writing, and consider the matter in a fresh way as if you have never known it before?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>At the same time would you ask the Lord to reveal whether or not our word is right and whether it is written according to His will?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is a very serious matter, since the Lord is coming back soon.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Now is the time for us to make matters clear before the Lord, for eternity is nigh.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We want to thank you for what you have done in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>May the Lord bless you for the patience you have had in this matter, for which we thank you.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Again, may we request your forgiveness for making you wait so long due to our delay in answering.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Your brothers in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Tu Chung Ch'en, Lin Kuang Piao, Wu Hsi Ku, Chang Kuang Jung, Witness Lee, and Watchman Nee representing the brothers who meet at N. Sze Chuan Road and Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
