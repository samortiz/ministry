   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Laodicea is one step backward from Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The degraded Philadelphia is Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Philadelphia opens the way for Laodicea to come in. In Thyatira there was naturally the ruling of the Pope.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Sardis there was naturally the ruling of the clergy system.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Philadelphia these things have naturally been overturned.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The nature of Philadelphia is to draw near to Christ, to honor Christ, and to suffer for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord's warning, however, is that every Philadelphian believer has to hold fast to what he has.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not everyone begins as a Philadelphian, and not everyone remains as one forever.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a man loses what he has, he will no longer be a Philadelphian.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It does not mean that those who stay with the Philadelphian believers will forever preserve their Philadelphian nature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the end only the overcomers are the true Philadelphians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All others will be disqualified and will degrade to become the Laodiceans.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who keep the Lord's word, the Lord's name, and the Lord's endurance will always remain Philadelphian believers, but those who drift along with the tide will inevitably become the Laodicean believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a man does not take up the yoke of Christ, his own will becomes more rebellious than before.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Among those in Thyatira, there were many who submitted to Jezebel and there were also many false prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Sardis there was still the submission to the clergymen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But those who have been taught the teaching of Philadelphia will know that neither the Pope nor the clergy can deserve our submission.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What we should submit to are Christ and His word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If such a one becomes fallen, he will not only reject the Lord's word, but will at the same time become disgusted with Jezebel and the clergy system.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The end of such a one is to walk according to his own will and his lust.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When these believers come together, immediately we see a church of the Laodiceans.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, we like to hear words about the equality of the believers, and of course, it is right to reject the special privileges of the clergy system.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But does it mean that no one then will be allowed to do anything that God has not laid down?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The laity can annul the authority of the clergy, but by so doing, the authority has not yet returned to its owner.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only Christ is the Lord, and only He should have the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The authority does not belong to the clergymen nor to the laity or the people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"A minister of the gospel," by definition, should indeed be a servant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, he should not be the servant of man but should be the servant of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Is this not the point that the apostle tried unceasingly to prove?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Who can control another's servant?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who dares to be a servant, yet at the same time controls the other servants of his master?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Unless a person is in the position of a master, he should not dare to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only are the servants Christ's, even the whole church is Christ's. He alone has the right to arrange its internal administration, setup, organization, and order.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All others are only the members.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is it not rebellion if one member, or a few members, even all the members rise up to control the Body and to consider themselves to be without a Head or to have no need of a Head?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yet, this is the picture of Laodicea the servants controlling the servants, and the members controlling the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although the opinion and the right of the people in Laodicea are something that fit in with the current of the age, Christ is shut out of Laodicea in the same way that He was shut out of Thyatira and Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The question is not whether power rests with the minority or with the majority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is useless to transfer power from one group of people to another.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ must have His rightful and proper position.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have left Thyatira or Sardis, yet are not in Philadelphia, we will be in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If Christ has the rightful place, then all servants have to be His servants.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If Christ has the rightful place, then all the people have to be His people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Philadelphia and Laodicea are the same with respect to the opposition against the domination of the clergy system.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The only difference is that Philadelphia was zealous for the Lord, while Laodicea was fighting for its own right.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is only a thin line between Laodicea and Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One submits to the Lord; the other submits to the self.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everything that does not submit fully to Christ is Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Laodicea is a walk that does not submit to the Lord's word but rather subjects itself to self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If man does not have the right to rule over us, does this mean then that we have complete freedom to do whatever we want?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Any insubordination to the will of man, unless for the sake of submitting to Christ, is a form of lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we are not absolute for the Lord, yet we attack human traditions, organizations, and methods, such attacks are surely of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many believers are naturally against oldness; they are inclined toward the extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If such believers rise up to oppose human authority, we have to be careful for fear that the motive and power of their work are more of the flesh than of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It does not mean that everyone who speaks the same language as Philadelphia is Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only those whose hearts have been taught by God, who know the Lord's authority, and who are willing to be obedient can be counted as Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One must not submit only because in that particular instance the matter suits his taste.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not know how much of the flesh is hidden within the matter of submission to God!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is not a question of our outward conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The main thing is whether or not the believers' hearts are taught by God, and whether or not they realize that one should obey the Lord and His word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is no ground left here for the natural affection.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is not a matter of how we feel, but a matter of what the Lord has said.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In everything, the only thing that matters is what the Lord has said.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The warning to Laodicea is not concerning a position but a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although many have absolutely nothing to do with Thyatira and Sardis positionally, although they are like Philadelphia in tone and voice, and although they may even be meeting with Philadelphia, they can still be Laodicean believers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Everything that is done according to man's will, whose spirit is not subject to the authority of the Lord's word, is Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What do we see today all around us?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All we see is but human opinion and human authority.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Those teachings in the Bible which believers consider suitable and compatible with their taste are practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Otherwise, no matter how severe the commandment of the Lord is, they will either explain it away, delay it again and again, or ignore it altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The lack among believers today is not of more biblical knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If they can keep what they already know, that is already excellent enough.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What is needed now is for the heart to be taught of God and to know that one has the responsibility to keep God's commandments, that is, to keep all that is recorded in the Holy Book.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If there is not such a heart, it will be useless even if one were to leave everything behind and walk in and out with the church in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If the believer's heart is right before the Lord, even if he does not know many things, God can teach him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The most heartbreaking thing is that God's children today do not regard God's word as God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As such, they do not keep God's word as it ought to be kept by man.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If believers do not have an honest and respectful heart to obey God's word, what use is it for them to proclaim with their mouth that they are serving God?</S>
