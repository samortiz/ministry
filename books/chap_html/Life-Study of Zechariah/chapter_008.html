To Turn from the Vanity<br>of Their Ritualistic Religion</H2><P>Zechariah 7:3-6 speaks of the vanity of ritualistic religion. In particular, these verses mention weeping and fasting. The people of Israel wept, fasted, and separated themselves in the tenth month to express their grieving for the attacking and besieging of Jerusalem by the Babylonians (Jer. 52:4). The people wept, fasted, and separated themselves in the fourth month to express their grieving for the breaking down of the city of Jerusalem (2 Kings 25:3-4). Israel wept, fasted, and separated themselves in the fifth month to express their grieving for the burning of the temple of God and the city of Jerusalem (Jer. 52:12-13). God's people also wept, fasted, and separated themselves in the seventh month to express their grieving for the murder of Gedaliah (2 Kings 25:22-26).</P>
