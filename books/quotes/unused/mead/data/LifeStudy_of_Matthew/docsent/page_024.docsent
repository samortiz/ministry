   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Name of Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being above Every Name</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The name of Jesus is above every name Phil 2:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No name is as high and as exalted as the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whether you hate Jesus or love Him, whether you are for Him or against Him, you realize that the name of Jesus is a special name.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>History tells us that during the past two thousand years, everyone has recognized that His name is the highest name, that it is an extraordinary name.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>My burden in this message is to point out to you that this exalted name of Jesus is for us to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>a. To Believe In</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Firstly, the name of Jesus is for us to believe in John 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all must believe in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not an insignificant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not only say that we believe in the Lord Jesus, but also declare that we believe in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we preach the gospel, we should help people not only to pray, but also to make a declaration to the whole universe that they believe in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever a sinner comes to believe in the Lord Jesus, he should declare, Today I believe in the name of Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This makes a great difference.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To Be Baptized Into</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The name of Jesus is for us to be baptized into Acts 8:16; 19:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Among some Christians there is a controversy regarding the name in which they baptize people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some argue strongly that we must baptize people only in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Others insist on the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These two groups argue, debate, and fight.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, it is not a matter of in the name, but of into the name.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We baptize people into the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The name needs the person, and the name is the person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without the person, the name means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be baptized into the name of Jesus means to be baptized into His Person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose a certain young man has just believed in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should baptize him into the name of Jesus, that is, put him into Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not a ritual nor a ceremony of accepting a religious member.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is an act of faith in which we take one who believes in the name of Jesus and put him into this name, baptizing him into the Person of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Romans 6:3 says that many of us have been baptized into Christ Jesus, and Galatians 3:27 says, As many as were baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the reality of being baptized into the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To Be Saved</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The name of Jesus is also for us to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Acts 4:12 says, Neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The name of Jesus has been given to us purposely that we may be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The name of Jesus is a saving name.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To Be Healed</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To the lame man whom he met at the gate of the temple Peter said, Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene walk!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Acts 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Immediately the man was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then Peter said to the people, In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene...this man stands before you well Acts 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This testifies that the name of Jesus is also a healing name.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may call on the name of Jesus for healing from any kind of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>e. To Be Washed, Sanctified, and Justified</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The name of Jesus has been given to us so that we may be washed, sanctified, and justified 1 Cor 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As defiled persons, we were washed, sanctified, and justified in the name of Jesus and by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I read 1 Corinthians 6:11 for years without seeing a crucial point: in the name and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The name is closely related to the Person and to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the name of Jesus were an empty name, how could it wash us?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How could it sanctify and justify us?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, this name is linked to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Spirit is the Person of the name and the reality of the name.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore the name can wash us, sanctify us, and justify us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Spirit is one with the name.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Jesus is the name of the Lord, and the Spirit is the Person of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we call on the name of a real person, that person comes.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The name of Jesus is linked with the Person who washes us, sanctifies us, and justifies us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is not merely doctrine or theory it is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we believe in the name of Jesus and are put into the name of Jesus, we are placed into a living Person, that is, in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This Holy Spirit washes us, sanctifies us, and justifies us.</S>
