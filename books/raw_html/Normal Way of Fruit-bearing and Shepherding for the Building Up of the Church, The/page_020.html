 <h2 class="head2">Speaking to the Woman at the Well<br />
about Drinking the Living Water</h2>
<p>Verses 3 and 4 of chapter 4 say, &ldquo;He left Judea and went away again into Galilee. And He had to pass through Samaria.&rdquo; Jesus had to pass this way because of one person who was chosen and predestinated by God. This example and that of Nicodemus show that it is worthwhile to spend time to talk to just one person. It was not convenient for the Lord to pass through that city in Samaria. Nevertheless, Jesus &ldquo;had to pass&rdquo; that way, because the Samaritan woman had been chosen by God the Father in eternity past, and it was time for the Lord Jesus to come to her. This woman believed in Jesus, not by seeing His miracles but according to the proper way of life.</p>
<p>Jesus was able to come to her in a wise way. If we could have been there at that time, we would have observed a thirsty Savior and a thirsty sinner. The sinner was thirsty, and so was the Savior. When the Savior asked the sinner for water, saying, &ldquo;Give Me something to drink,&rdquo; she rebuked Him, saying, &ldquo;How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman?&rdquo; (vv. 7, 9). To say &ldquo;give Me something to drink&rdquo; does not seem like a gospel message, but one sentence later the Lord Jesus was able to turn to the gospel, saying, &ldquo;If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water&rdquo; (v. 10). The Lord Jesus preached the gospel not in the way of traditional Christianity but in a very spontaneous way. Immediately that woman was inspired.</p>
<p>Since the Lord Jesus was wise, He did not preach concerning her sin. Rather, when she asked for the living water, He said to her, &ldquo;Go, call your husband and come here.&rdquo; Because this word concerning her husband touched her conscience, she told the Lord a lie by speaking a partial truth, &ldquo;I do not have a husband&rdquo; (vv. 16-17a). She did not expect that this Jewish man would know all her secrets. The Lord Jesus was kind to her and did not rebuke her, but He said to her, &ldquo;You have well said, I do not have a husband, for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly&rdquo; (vv. 17b-18). This was truly an unveiling to her. She may have thought, &ldquo;Who told this man all my secrets? He even knows how many husbands I have had and that the one I now have is not my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although she was a simple person, she was clever and turned the problem about husbands to the subject of worshipping God. It is as if she said, &ldquo;To speak of husbands is not nice. Let us speak concerning spiritual things such as the right way to worship God.&rdquo; Nevertheless, no matter how wise and skillful we are, when we are caught by the Lord Jesus, we cannot get away. Regardless of how much we do, we are still in His hand. She said, &ldquo;Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship&rdquo; (v. 20). Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You worship that which you do not know; we worship that which we know, for salvation is of the Jews. But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him&rdquo; (vv. 21-23).</p>
<p>This shows that in order to drink the living water we must first make a thorough confession of our sins and then exercise our spirit to worship God. Whenever we come to the Lord, He touches our conscience concerning our past. We can cover the things in the past from the eyes of man, but we can never cover them from God&rsquo;s observation. Therefore, we need to confess, and if we do not confess, the Lord will confess for us. If we do not say, &ldquo;Lord, I have had five husbands, and the one I now have is not my husband,&rdquo; He will be gracious to confess this for us. He may say, &ldquo;If you are not bold and have too much shame to confess, let Me do it for you.&rdquo; By doing this, the Lord helped her to agree with Him, confess her sins, and repent. She may have said, &ldquo;You are right. I have had five husbands, and the one I now have is not mine. This is my history, my life, and my living. What is it that I need?&rdquo; What she needed was to exercise her spirit to contact God the Spirit. If she would do this, she would receive the living water.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING OF THE LORD JESUS<br />
HOW TO CONTACT PEOPLE</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s way of speaking was a marvelous preaching. He performed no miracle, used no eloquence, and exercised no special skill in preaching. Rather, He spoke with her in a simple way. We must all learn to speak in this way. We do not need to attend a seminary to learn doctrinal teachings. We may simply read the Gospels and learn of the Lord Jesus how to contact people. The Lord spoke in a normal way with the abundance of life. While He spoke with that woman, He was shining over her, radiating His element into her. Because of this, she left her waterpot (v. 28). She forgot about drawing the physical water because she had received the real water. She herself became a &ldquo;waterpot&rdquo; to contain the living water. She went away into the city and said to the people, &ldquo;Come, see a man who told me all that I have done&rdquo; (v. 29). She also performed no miracle and had no eloquence but was simply a living testimony, testifying to the people.</p>
<p>While she was gone, Jesus&rsquo; disciples returned and urged Him to eat. The Lord responded, &ldquo;I have food to eat that you do not know about&rdquo; (v. 32). This means that the Savior was the living water to the thirsty sinner, and the sinner satisfied the hungry and thirsty Savior. The Samaritan woman drank of Jesus, and Jesus was fed by her. After speaking with one another, they became a mutual satisfaction to each other.</p>
<p>The proper gospel preaching is not a matter of revival or Pentecostal miracles. Rather, it is something normal. The Lord set up an example in John 3 by speaking at night to one man and in chapter 4 by caring for one immoral woman. This was Jesus&rsquo; proper preaching of the gospel. Many today are more spiritual than the Lord Jesus was. These two chapters of John do not speak about praying, but many today tell us that we must first pray and fast for a revival to suddenly come. The Lord Jesus did not do this. It is true that Acts mentions the prayer of the church, but as we have pointed out, Acts is a book of beginnings, not of completion. John, on the contrary, is the final book among the Gospels. A final word means more than a beginning word, and in the Bible the final word is not in the first books but in the last books, such as John. According to the Gospel of John, the final word is that the Lord has no confidence in miracles. His interest is in life, regeneration, and the living water. In John 3 and 4 there are no miracles, but there are strength, power, and the riches of the inner life. We must all be impressed by the Lord as the example of the proper preaching of the gospel and not of performing miracles. In chapter 2 He performed a miracle, but He would not trust in those who were interested in miracles. After this, He immediately set forth the example of how to minister life to others by opening the door to a high-class man to be regenerated with the divine, eternal life and by helping a low-class woman to drink the living water. These are the Lord&rsquo;s examples for us. Today we should all take care of the gospel in such a way.</p>
