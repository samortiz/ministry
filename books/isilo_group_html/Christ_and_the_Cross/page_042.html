<h1 class="title">CHRIST BRINGING THE CROSS TO US</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 3:10; 2 Cor. 4:10-12; Rom. 8:13</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that the cross brings Christ to us; that is, we receive Christ when we receive the cross. In this chapter we will see that Christ brings the cross to us. This means that when we let Christ live in us, we will experience the cross.</p>
<p>Philippians 3:10 says, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&rdquo; Knowing Christ is connected to being conformed to His death, and being conformed to His death follows knowing Him. Hence, being conformed to His death is the issue of knowing Him. Knowing Christ causes us to be conformed to His death. The meaning of the phrase <em>being conformed to His death</em> in Greek is &ldquo;being made of like form with His death.&rdquo; This does not mean that we should make an effort to imitate His death in order to know Him. Rather, it means that our knowledge of Christ puts us into His death. Christ&rsquo;s death is likened to a mold, and we are put into the mold of His death so that our living and walk would have the same form as His death. This is to be conformed to the death of Christ.</p>
<p>Being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death does not mean that we use our strength to imitate Christ in His enduring of sufferings and in His being put to death. Rather, it means that in our living knowledge of the resurrected Christ, the power of His resurrection life enables us to live in His death and to live out the form of His death.</p>
<p>If we use our own strength to imitate Christ&rsquo;s death, we will produce a type of behavior that is based only on our human effort. However, the power of the resurrection life of Christ puts us in His death and enables us to live out the form of His death. This life is lived out through His resurrection life, and our living matches Christ&rsquo;s living, because it is conformed to His death. Such a living has the form of His death but is full of the elements of His life, because it comes from the power of His resurrection life in us. When we know the resurrected Christ, live by Him, and let Him live in us, His resurrection life brings us into His death so that we may live in His death and live out the form of His death. Therefore, when Christ lives in us, we are brought into the experience of His death. When Christ lives in us, He brings the cross to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE OF CHRIST<br />
HAVING THE ELEMENT OF DEATH</h2>
<p>The life of Christ contains the element of death. This matter is difficult to explain, and it is not easy to comprehend. The life of Christ is a resurrected and indestructible life that contains the element of His death. This intrinsic truth is revealed in the Bible and confirmed by our experience (v. 10; 2 Cor. 4:10-12; Rom. 8:13).</p>
<p>Philippians 3:10 unveils that the resurrected Christ lives in us and brings us into His death so that we may live in His death and be conformed to it. If Christ did not have the element of death, then He could not bring us into His death, and we could not live in His death or live out the form of His death. Just as the life of Christ enables Him to live in us, His life brings us into His death. In other words, through His life Christ lives in us and brings us into His death. Hence, His life contains the element of death.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:10-12 says, &ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So then death operates in us, but life in you.&rdquo; According to these verses, the death of Jesus operates in us. In order for death to operate in us, it must operate through His life in us. The issue of the operation of the Lord&rsquo;s death in us confirms this conclusion. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.&rdquo; This indicates that the result of the operation of the Lord&rsquo;s death in us is that the Lord&rsquo;s life is manifested in us. Since the operation of the Lord&rsquo;s death results in the manifestation of His life, this operation must come out of His life; that is, His life must be the source. Hence, verse 10 reveals that the Lord&rsquo;s life contains the element of death.</p>
<p>Romans 8:13 speaks of putting to death the practices of the body by the Spirit in order to live. The Spirit in verse 13 refers to the Spirit of life in verse 2. The Spirit of life dwells in us so that we would not be fleshly or live according to the flesh but that we would put to death the practices of the body (vv. 9-13). Since the Spirit of life can cause us to put to death the practices of the body, He must give us a putting-to-death power. Such a power can be related only to the power of the Lord&rsquo;s death. This power is given to us by the Spirit of life who dwells in us; hence, this power is given to us by the Spirit through and from the life of Christ. On the one hand, Christ dwells in us as the Spirit of life, and His life saves us from living according to the flesh. On the other hand, His life possesses a putting-to-death power that operates in us to put to death the practices of our body. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s life contains the element of death.</p>
<p>If we consider our experience, we will realize that the Lord&rsquo;s life in us has the element of death. When we live in His life and allow Him to operate and live in us through His life, we often sense the power of His resurrection reviving and strengthening us inwardly and also the power of His death killing and eliminating us. Such experiences prove that the Lord&rsquo;s life contains the element of His resurrection as well as the element of His death.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Cross &nbsp; pg 42</div><br></body></html>
