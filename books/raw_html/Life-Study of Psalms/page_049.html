<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. David's Request of God</H2><P>Psalm 10:12-15 is David's request of God. After he presented the condition of man, he asked God to come to judge the wicked.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. David's Praise to God</H2><P>Psalm 10:14b and 16-18 are David's praise to God. The contents of this praise, however, are altogether negative. He said, "Jehovah is King forever and ever;/The nations have perished from His land" (v. 16). He did not praise God for the nations being saved by God's grace, but for the nations perishing. According to the revelation of the New Testament, God is not like this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. God Being in His Holy Temple,<br>His Throne Being in Heaven,<br>and His Eyes Discerning<br>the Righteous Man and the Wicked Man</H2><P>In Psalm 11 David said that God is in His holy temple, His throne is in heaven, and His eyes discern the righteous man and the wicked man. Verse 6 says that Jehovah "will rain down snares upon the wicked;/Fire and brimstone and a scorching wind will be the portion of their cup." If this were the case, the earth would already have been destroyed. There would be no possibility for billions of human beings to live on this earth. Verse 7 says, "For Jehovah is righteous; He loves righteous deeds./The upright man will behold His face." David said this, but he himself was not righteous. Actually, he was in darkness without any sensation about himself. He was not qualified to say this because he murdered a man and robbed that man of his wife.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. David's Request and Jehovah's Willingness<br>to Deal with the Wicked in Their Tongue and Lips</H2><P>In Psalm 12 we see David's request and Jehovah's willingness to deal with the wicked in their tongue and lips. In verse 2a David said, "Each man speaks falsehood with his neighbor." But David was no different; he also spoke falsehood. As a whole, his concept was altogether based upon and entangled with the law and with good and evil.</P>
