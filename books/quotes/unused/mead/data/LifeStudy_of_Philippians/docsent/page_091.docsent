   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO GRACE, SALVATION, THE SPIRIT, AND CHRIST Scripture Reading: Phil 1:7b, 19-21a</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider four very important terms used by Paul in Philippians: grace, salvation, the Spirit, and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1:7 Paul tells the Philippians, Both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel you are all partakers of my grace lit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>. Notice that here Paul speaks of my grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in verse 19 he goes on to say, For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this verse Paul speaks of salvation and of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then in verses 20 and 21 he says, Even now Christ shall be magnified in my body...For to me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In these verses grace, salvation, the Spirit, and Christ are not defined in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, they are related to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Paul says my grace, he is referring to grace in his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Likewise, when he tells us that for him this will turn out to salvation, he is not speaking of a mere objective salvation, a doctrinal salvation, but of a very experiential salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, when he mentions the Spirit, he is surely speaking of the Spirit in his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Certainly his word about magnifying Christ and living Him is very subjective and experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verses 20 and 21 we do not have an objective Christ, but the subjective Christ in Paul s living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>DIFFERENT KINDS OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Unfortunately, many Christians have the habit of taking things for granted in their reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Familiar with such terms as grace, salvation, the Spirit, and Christ, they may assume that they understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, if they are asked to explain these things, they may have difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, what does Paul mean by my grace ?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, what does Paul mean by my salvation KJV ?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Paul wrote this Epistle, he had been saved for many years and had even become an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why then does he indicate that he still needs salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since we are already saved, why do we still need to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What did Paul mean by saying that all that was happening to him, persecution, imprisonment, and even the dissenting preaching out of rivalry, would turn out for him to salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What kind of salvation is he talking about?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It would not at all be accurate to try to answer this question by asserting that salvation is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, we need to point out that, according to the Bible, there is more than one kind of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s salvation rescues us from His condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As sinners, we were condemned by the righteous God according to His righteous law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, we were in need of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Praise the Lord that we have been saved from God s condemnation by the redemption of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, as sinners, we were under the usurping hand of Satan and under the power of death, destined for hell.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we needed a salvation that could save us from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, in addition to being saved from God s condemnation and from hell, we also need other kinds of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, we need to be saved from our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Young and old alike need to be delivered from a bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, husbands and wives need to experience salvation in their married life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The wives need a certain kind of salvation, and the husbands need another kind of salvation, for both face different situations and problems.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By these examples we can see that there is more than one kind of salvation presented in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Paul wrote to the Philippians, he needed a certain kind of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>TWO ASPECTS OF THE SALVATION NEEDED BY PAUL</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The kind of salvation we need depends on our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are under God s judgment, we need a salvation that rescues us from this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are under Satan s hand, we need a salvation appropriate to that situation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Likewise, if we are troubled by our temper or face difficulties in our married life, we need still further kinds of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because Paul was a prisoner, he needed a salvation that applied to his situation in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul, a Jew, was not a prisoner in an ordinary jail; he was a prisoner of Caesar s royal guard, the praetorium.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul s case was extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He had not committed any crime.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His imprisonment was due to the fact that he preached Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because he preached Christ, Paul was arrested and eventually imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At least part of the time each day, he was chained to a guard.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No doubt, Paul suffered there in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He must have been despised and treated with contempt.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To be sure, he needed a specific kind of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By this I do not mean that what he needed was release from prison.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No, he needed to experience salvation there in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He says in verse 20, According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Here we see that Paul s expectation was that he would not be put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Suppose Paul wept over his situation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Would not that have been a shame?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His weeping would have indicated that he was defeated, that he had lost his faith, confidence, and trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Or suppose that Paul became angry with the jailer and argued with him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This also would have been a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, if Paul could rejoice no matter how he was treated, that would be a glory.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In order to maintain such a victorious standing as an apostle of Christ, Paul needed a particular kind of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In verse 20 we see two aspects of the salvation needed by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The first aspect was that Paul would not be put to shame in anything; the second, that Christ would be magnified in Paul s body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Paul expected that his situation would turn out to his salvation so that in nothing he would be put to shame, but that Christ would be magnified in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Here Paul seems to be saying, I need salvation so that I shall not be put to shame by suffering or persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Instead, Christ my Lord will be magnified in my body.</S>
