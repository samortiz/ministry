Turning to Asia Minor</h2><h2 class=head3>1. Churches Established in the Cities of Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch in the Province of Galatia- the Churches in Galatia</h2><p>Acts 14:21-23 refers to the churches established in the cities of Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch. After Paul and Barnabas brought the good news to the city of Derbe and made a considerable number of disciples (vv. 20-21a), &#8220;they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch&#8221; (v. 21b). This is not the Antioch from which they were sent out on this journey of ministry (13:1); rather, it is the Antioch in Pisidia, the Antioch in Asia Minor.<p>The churches in these cities were &#8220;the churches of Galatia&#8221; (Gal. 1:2), a province of the ancient Roman Empire. Through Paul&#8217;s preaching ministry churches were established in a number of cities in that province. Hence, &#8220;churches,&#8221; not &#8220;church,&#8221; is used when Paul refers to them.<h2 class=head3>2. Elders Appointed in Every One of These Churches</h2><p>Elders were appointed in every one of the churches in Galatia. Acts 14:23 says, &#8220;When they had appointed elders for them in every church, having prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.&#8221; The Greek words rendered &#8220;in every church&#8221; contain the preposition kata with the distributive usage-according to church. The phrase &#8220;in every church&#8221; in 14:23 equals &#8220;in each city&#8221; in Titus 1:5. The comparison of these phrases indicates not only that the jurisdiction of a local church is that of the city in which it is located, but also that in one city there should be only one church. The eldership of a local church should cover the entire city where that church is. Such a unique eldership in a city preserves the unique oneness of the Body of Christ from damage. One city should only have one church with one eldership. This practice is illustrated, beyond any question and doubt, by the clear pattern in the New Testament (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rom. 16:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; Rev. 1:11), and it is an absolute prerequisite for the maintenance of proper order in a local church.<p>All the churches in which the elders were appointed respectively by the apostles in Acts 14:23 were established within less than one year. Hence, the elders appointed in these churches could not have been well matured. They must have been considered elders because they were comparatively the most matured among the believers. They were not voted in by their congregation; they were appointed by the apostles according to their maturity in Christ. They were charged by the apostles to care for the leadership and shepherding in the churches.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 189-204) &nbsp; pg 42</div><br></body></html>
