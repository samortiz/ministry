   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PORTRAIT OF THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we read through these eleven verses, we find that they are a detailed portrait of the new man living in the Mediterranean area.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The existence and living of the new man in a practical way is a matter of tremendous significance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Roman Empire covered a vast area and embraced many different peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the attempt to unify the people culturally, the Roman Empire used the Greek language.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the Roman Empire was not successful in uniting the various peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The differences among the nations, races, and social classes remained.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Jews were still Jews, and the Greeks were still Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The distinction between slaves and masters was by no means eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But in spite of all the differences among nationalities, races, and classes, there was on earth in a practical way the one new man created in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There were not merely local churches in various cities there was one new man in a real and practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is shameful for the church in any locality to isolate itself from other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How wrong it is for us to have the attitude of standing apart from other local churches, fearing that others may interfere with our affairs or otherwise trouble us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is utterly contrary to the consciousness of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Any church which holds such an attitude has a consciousness only of itself, not of the totality of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who insist on this attitude cause the new man to be fragmented, to be broken into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, many churches and many individual believers as well have the attitude that they will leave others alone if others in turn will leave them alone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They do not care about the churches in other places, and they do not want other churches to be involved with them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who have this attitude lack the sense, the consciousness, of the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Praise the Lord for the portrait of the living of the new man in these verses!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By these verses we see the practical expression of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BELONGING TO THE CHURCH EVERYWHERE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many saints secretly think more highly of the church in their locality than of the churches elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They do not have the realization that, although they are located in a specific church, they belong to the church everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I can testify that if you ask me where my church is, I shall reply that my church is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My church is in whatever locality I am at a particular time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Presently I am in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, my church is in Anaheim, but in a few days I may be in another locality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then my church will be the church in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1977 I paid a visit to the church in Tokyo.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the brothers were showing me their new meeting hall, they pointed out that right next door was an available plot of land.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I immediately encouraged them to pray about acquiring that property for use by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although I live in Anaheim and am part of the church in Anaheim, my concern at that time was for the church in Tokyo.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I encouraged them by saying that the Lord would surely provide them the means to construct a larger meeting hall in Tokyo, even though in that city land is extremely expensive.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I became aware of the need in Tokyo, my heart was full of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The reason for this is that my church is the church everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the churches on earth make up the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we read the conclusion of the book of Colossians, we see that what was in Paul s heart was not simply a particular local church or a certain saint, but the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul knew a great many saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in the verses devoted to fellowship, he mentions certain ones as representatives of the various peoples who, with Christ as their constituent, compose the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this way he presents a full picture of the living of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>My burden in this message is that we would be impressed with this crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>NOT SECTARIAN</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are conscious of the one new man, we should no longer think that the churches in our country have nothing to do with the churches in other nations.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead, we shall realize that all the churches are the one new man today.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May we look to the Lord that we may not be sectarian in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We would not be sectarian either individually as believers or corporately as local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the contrary, all of us, all the saints in all the churches, are just one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If at the time of Paul, when travel was not convenient, there could be traffic among the churches, how much more should there be today with all the modern conveniences?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By means of the traffic among the churches, we experience in a practical way the living of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>PAUL S GREETING</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After his fellowship, the Apostle Paul greets the saints by his own hand and asks them to remember his bonds v. 18 . He concludes this Epistle with the words, Grace be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This indicates that the saints need grace in order to realize and participate in the all-inclusiveness of Christ as their portion for the practical life of the new man.</S>
