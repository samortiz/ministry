   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A TRIPARTITE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God certainly aspires to sanctify us wholly.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He wants to preserve us in the three parts of our being to preserve our spirit, our soul, and our body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to 5:23, we are tripartite beings; that is, we have three parts: spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was a young Christian, I learned the truth concerning man's tripartite being, and I contended for this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In theology this is known as trichotomy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is also the school of dichotomy, which teaches that man is of two parts, body and soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Thessalonians 5:23 proves strongly that the school of dichotomy is not correct.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this verse there is a conjunction between the words spirit and soul and also between the words soul and body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that the spirit, the soul, and the body are different and distinct.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, some teachers of the Bible claim that the words spirit and soul are synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This can be compared to saying that the different members of our physical body, for example, the stomach and the liver, are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a very serious misunderstanding to claim that the soul and the spirit are synonymous.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Years ago, a missionary who believed in dichotomy came to Hong Kong to attend a conference I was holding there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After one of the meetings, he asked for a time to have fellowship with me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He told me that the conference was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then he went on to say, "You teach that man is of three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I don't believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man has just two parts the visible part and the invisible part."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I replied, "Brother, to say that man is of three parts is not my teaching; it is the teaching in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What would you say about 1 Thessalonians 5:23?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this verse Paul speaks of the spirit and the soul and the body, three nouns with two conjunctions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How can you say that man is of only two parts?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He answered, "I know this verse, but I don't believe that the spirit and the soul are two different things."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then I said to him, "Brother, this means that you don't believe the Bible."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He then claimed that he believed the Bible to the uttermost and that no matter what I would say, he would continue to believe that the spirit and the soul are synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that point I said, "If you think that the spirit and the soul are synonymous, this is like saying that the nose and the mouth are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you want to believe this, I won't argue with you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But to me, the mouth is the mouth, and the nose is the nose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you say things with your nose, or do you smell things with your mouth?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I relate this incident to point out that there is a big difference between the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The spirit and the soul are not synonymous.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, the spirit is the spirit, and the soul is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as the nose and the mouth are different organs with different functions, so the spirit and the soul are different organs and have different functions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Thessalonians 5:23 speaks of the spirit and the soul and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates clearly that we are of three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is easy to understand what it means for the body to be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In chapter four Paul commands the believers to abstain from fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To abstain from fornication is to preserve our body in sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But what does it mean to preserve our soul and our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to be able to explain in a practical way how to preserve our spirit and our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A SHORTCOMING IN READING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We Christians have a shortcoming in the way we read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This shortcoming is that we take things for granted and assume we understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, in reading 5:23 we may say, "Oh, I know what 1 Thessalonians 5:23 says.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It tells us that our spirit and soul and body should be preserved complete.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From this verse we know that we should not believe in dichotomy, that man is of only two parts, but should believe in trichotomy, that man is of three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I, therefore, believe that man is of three parts."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is good, but it is not adequate, because it does not render much help in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead of taking this verse for granted, we need to seek to understand how to preserve our spirit and our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Can you give me the name of a Christian book that explains how to preserve our spirit and our soul?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do not know of any Christian writing that speaks concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I believe that if there were such a writing, we would have learned of it during the course of the last fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As we have pointed out, some Bible teachers do not believe that our spirit and soul are different parts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How could they tell us how to preserve our spirit and our soul?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, my burden in this message is related to the preserving of the spirit and the soul.</S>
