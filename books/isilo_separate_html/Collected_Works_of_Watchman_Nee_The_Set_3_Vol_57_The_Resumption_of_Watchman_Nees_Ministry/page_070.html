Satan tries to gain all things, but he cannot gain every item of all the things. "All things'' are too much for him to handle. It is too troublesome to gain all things. "All things'' include cows, goats, wood, stone, and so forth. You could not exhaust the list of all things with a thousand lines. God made from one all things. Hence, Satan reduces all things into one thing. This one thing is money. There is nothing in this world that cannot be bought with money. If a person has money, he has all things. This is why "money" in Chinese is tung-hwo, which means the "common good.'' You cannot call a piece of stone plus a piece of wood, two of anything. You cannot call a chair plus a table, two of anything. But through the invention of money, Satan is able to unify all things. He makes all things simple. Originally, the world with all its myriads of items was made from one. Now Satan is unifying these myriads of things into one through money. Everything that we see today can be reckoned in terms of money. Money is the means to unify all things. All things are created by God. Only money is not created by God; it comes from Caesar. When men asked Christ if there was a need to pay tribute money, He asked them to show Him a denarius, and He answered, "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar'' (Matt. 22:21). He did not take any money out from His own pocket. Had He done this, others would have said that He too had Caesar in His pocket.</p><p>Money is created by Satan for the purpose of unifying all things. All things can be reckoned in terms of money. The earth is created by God. Yet today man can reckon the price of land in terms of money. If it is possible, man would even reckon the price of the moon or the hydrogen in the sun with money. Today man can buy everything. He can buy time. He can even buy human souls. One brother worked in the post office for many years. The post office had bought his soul. Jacob's wealth included cattle and sheep and the souls of men as well. Revelation 18 tells us that the human soul is a commodity that can be bought and sold (vv. 12-13). God has made from one all things. But Satan has unified all things into one.</p><h2 class="head2">Satan Withstanding God through Mammon<br />and Usurping Man's Worship through Mammon</h2><p>When we gain God, we have all things. In the same way, when Satan takes hold of money, he has everything. Money is omnipotent; everything can be bought with money. In order to buy wood, stones, or any other things that we like, we need mammon. As a result, mammon becomes the power, the center, of man's worship. Is man going to worship God or mammon? This is the controversy of the universe. The worship of God lies on one side of all things, and the worship of mammon lies on the other side of all things. Mammon is diametrically opposed to God. Mammon can withstand God because it is the only thing that can unify all things. Covetousness is not only a root of all evils (1 Tim. 6:10), it is the same as idolatry. Riches are an idol. The Bible says that covetousness and idolatry are the same kind of sins (Eph. 5:5). If a man has not dealt with his money in a clear way after he is saved, he is not yet fully saved. If a person still keeps wooden or stone idols in his house, will we accept such a one for baptism? Yet many people have never dealt with the matter of money after they are saved. Today we say that India is a nation of idols and that there are more idols than people in that land. Yet there are countless more people who worship mammon than people who worship idols. From the people in Asia to those in Africa, from scientists to the most superstitious people, everyone worships mammon. Mammon is the most common object of worship.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Delivered from Mammon to Serve God</h2><p>God wants to gain us, and mammon also wants to gain us. Unless God's people are delivered from the power of mammon, they will not have a proper testimony and cannot be proper Christians. If a man tries to hold on to both sides, he will not be able to serve the Lord well. Why did the Lord put such a harsh requirement upon the young ruler and ask him to sell all he had? That young man was quite good and had kept all the laws. But the Lord said that he lacked one thing, the most important thing, which had to do with mammon (Luke 18:18-23). The same principle applies when Zaccheus gave half of his possessions to the poor when he repented (19:8). The same principle can also be seen in Acts 4 where the disciples sold their land and possessions, and no one said that any of his possessions was his own (v. 32). By the time we come to the Epistles, we see Paul saying, "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack'' (2 Cor. 8:15).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_069.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_071.html">Next</a> </body></html>
