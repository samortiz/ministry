[1]  According to His good pleasure, God made a purpose, a plan, in eternity and for eternity, and thus it is called the eternal purpose; this eternal plan was made in Christ, with Christ, through Christ, and for Christ according to God s desire and pleasure Eph 1:9-11; 3:11.
[2]  God has saved us and called us according to His own purpose; God s purpose is His plan according to His will to put us into Christ and make us one with Christ to share His life and position so that we may be His testimony 2 Tim 1:9; 1 Cor 1:30; 6:17.
[3]  Christ as the eternal, unlimited power of God operates the entire universe and holds the entire universe together Rom 1:19-20; Col 1:16-17; Heb 1:3; 11:3; Psa 19:1-6.
[4]  With such a solid revelation by the concrete creation of God, there is no excuse for man to say that there is no God or that he cannot apprehend God.
[5]  Message Three The Propitiation Place Scripture Reading: Rom 3:24-25; Heb 2:17; 9:5; 1 John 2:2; 4:10 Through the entire process of crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, God has set forth Christ as the propitiation place Rom 3:24-25; Acts 2:24, 32-36; Heb 9:5: In the Old Testament the propitiation place, the lid of the Ark as a type, was hidden in the Holy of Holies Exo 25:17-22.
[6]  The propitiatory cover, the propitiation place, signifies that Christ is the shining of the divine glory and that God meets with us and speaks with us in this glory Heb 9:5; 1:3; Exo 25:17-22: The cherubim on the propitiatory cover are related to God s glory and signify His glory Heb 9:5: The cherubim indicate that Christ expresses God s glory, that God s glory shines out from Him 1:3; Exo 25:18-20.
[7]  Message Four The Divine Transfer and the Grafted Life Scripture Reading: Rom 5:12, 17, 19; 6:4-5, 14; 11:17, 24 As those who have obeyed the gospel of God concerning His Son and have believed into Him to have the obedience of faith, we have experienced the divine transfer Rom 10:16; 1:5; 5:12, 17, 19: As believers in Christ, we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ 1 Cor 15:22; Rom 5:12, 17, 19: In the sight of God there are only two men in the universe Adam and Christ 1 Cor 15:22; Rom 5:14: In Adam we inherited sin, we were constituted sinners, we were under the reign of death, and we were under God s condemnation vv.
[8]  We were transferred out of Adam into Christ by believing into Christ and by being baptized into Christ John 3:15; Rom 6:4: When we believed in Christ, we actually believed ourselves into Him, and when we were baptized, we were baptized into Him.
[9]  Message Five Being Saved in Life and Reigning in Life for the Body Life Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10, 17, 21 Through God s divine dispensing in us and His divine union with us, we can experience and enjoy the saving in Christ s life in God s full salvation, as conveyed to us in Romans, in the following aspects 5:10: By the abundance of grace God Himself and of the gift of righteousness Christ Himself which we received, we are able to reign in Christ s divine life over sin, death, the old man, the flesh, Satan, the world, and all persons, matters, and things that do not submit to God v. 17.
[10]  the Law of the Spirit of Life for the Body Life Scripture Reading: Rom 7:15 8:2, 4, 6 The key to being an overcomer is the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8, a chapter for desperate seekers 7:24 8:2, 28-29: Romans 7 is the experience of being in the flesh ; Romans 8 is the experience of being in the spirit the divine Spirit dwelling in our human spirit and these two mingled together to be one spirit vv.
[11]  The whole key to our living and service in the Body of Christ is the law of the Spirit of life, which operates within us: The law of the Spirit of life makes us God in life, nature, and expression but not in the Godhead, shaping us into the image of the firstborn Son of God so that we may become His corporate expression Rom 8:2, 29.
[12]  Message Eight The Dispensing of the Triune God as Life
[13]  8:2, 6, 10-11, 18, 21; 9:23; 11:36; 12:1-5; 16:27 God s eternal economy is to dispense Himself as the law of the Spirit of life into man so that His divine attributes of righteousness, holiness, and glory would become man s human virtues for God s corporate expression as the reality of the Body of Christ in the local churches to consummate the New Jerusalem as the city of righteousness, holiness, and glory Gen 2:9; John 10:10b; 14:6a; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:2; 2 Pet 3:13; Rev 21:2, 9-11: God s desire is to work Himself into us to the extent that He becomes us and we become Him, that we and He become completely identical in life, nature, and image; this is the pinnacle of His economy John 1:12-13; 2 Pet 1:4; 2 Cor 3:18.
[14]  Message Nine Children of God, Sons of God, and Heirs of God Scripture Reading: Rom 8:14, 16-17, 21, 23 Being children of God is our initial, or primary, relationship with God; we need to grow to become sons of God, and then we need further growth unto maturity in order to become heirs of God Rom 8:14, 16-17, 23.
[15]  Message Ten The Divine Spirit Mingled with Our Human Spirit
[16]  the Key to the Entire Christian Life Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10, 17; 6:4; 7:6; 8:2, 4, 16 The divine Spirit of life dwelling in our human spirit, with these two mingled together as one spirit, is the secret of God s organic salvation and the key to the entire Christian life for the reality of the Body of Christ in the church life to consummate the New Jerusalem Rom 8:2, 4, 16; 1 Cor 6:17: The divine Spirit of life is the Spirit of God processed and consummated to be the life-giving, compounded, and indwelling Spirit, who indwells the believers as the reality of the pneumatic, pneumatized Christ, as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, and as the reality of the divine resurrection; it is through such a Spirit of life that the eternal, only wise God, according to the revelation of the mystery hidden through the ages, dispenses Himself in His processed and consummated Trinity into the believers to be their dynamic salvation as their life and everything Rom 16:25.
[17]  The Spirit of life is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself, Christ is in us, Christ Himself is life, and our spirit is life 8:9-11; John 14:6; Col 3:4: Christ...in you is the crucial point of the book of Romans 8:10.
[18]  Message Eleven The Flesh and the Spirit Scripture Reading: Rom 1:9; 2:28-29;
[19]  Serving God in the Gospel of His Son Scripture Reading: Rom 1:9; 15:16, 29; 16:25-27 That I might be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, a laboring priest of the gospel of God, in order that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit Rom 15:16: Paul s being a laboring priest of the gospel of God to minister Christ to the Gentiles was a priestly service to God, and the Gentiles whom he gained through his gospel preaching were an offering presented to God 1 Pet 2:5: By this priestly service many Gentiles, who were unclean and defiled, were sanctified in the Holy Spirit and became such an offering, acceptable to God Rom 15:16; 16:4-5.
[20]  Paul is a pattern of the priesthood of the gospel; in the Epistle to the Romans, which concerns the gospel of God, he tells us how sinners can be saved and justified by believing in the Lord, how they advance in Christ by being sanctified and transformed, and how they present themselves to God as living sacrifices so that they may become members of the Body of Christ to live the church life, expressing Christ corporately and awaiting His coming 1 Thes 2:1-12; Acts 20:17-36; Rom 1:16-17; 3:24-26; 12:1, 4-5; 13:11.
