   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Beginning and Condition</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Meeting in Hu Shan</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This meeting was an Independent Church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then some brothers read many of the publications put out by the Gospel Book Room, and they received much light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They also heard many truths in the conferences in all the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the fall of 1931 they invited Brother Wang Yu T'ing to come to their locality for a week of conference.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From that time onward, the brothers had more and more light of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After that meeting, seven brothers rose up to be baptized they had already been sprinkled and at the same time began meeting to break bread as the Bible commands.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At first, they broke bread once a month.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Probably the denominations here in P'ing Yang do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They had not been practicing this for long when a group of brothers and sisters who really love the Lord tasted some of the flavor of the joy from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the members who had not been regenerated or who were nominal Christians felt that this type of meeting was too dry and tasteless, so some gradually left.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The number in the meetings gradually decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, some of the outsiders criticized them, saying, "The church in Hu Shan does not have anyone coming to worship, because they left the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They will close their doors soon."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Praise and thank the Lord; this word will never become reality, because the Lord said, "I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord has gradually added saved ones to them since last year.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every Lord's Day people spontaneously come to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now there are thirty-six brothers and sisters who break bread together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are between fifty and sixty people who come to listen to the Word but do not break bread yet.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every Lord's Day morning they have the table and they also have another meeting for preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the afternoon there is a meeting for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are several people who bear the responsibility for the meetings and its affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are Chou Ta Ch'in, Lin Ch'u Ch'ien, P'an Fu Ch'ing, and some others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Apart from these, there are also a few brothers who stand up in the Lord's Day meetings to testify to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Please pray for those who come to hear the gospel that they will be saved soon.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Beginning and Condition</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>of the Meeting in Feng Ch'uan</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is hard to say definitely when this meeting began.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The work began three years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord's table was established after the fall of last year.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the two or three years preceding the establishment of the table, they received the truths about the spiritual life, but they were afraid of the matter of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They thought that the many things in the denominations which are against the Bible should be improved, but that completely leaving the denominations might also be an error.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So a few brothers rose up to do a repair work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, they eliminated the things that were flagrantly against the Bible, and on the other hand, they paid much attention to salvation every Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the brothers and sisters already understood something about all the matters of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, they knew nothing about the matter of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thank the Lord, those responsible brothers received the light about the church last year.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They know not only that in the denominations there are a few problems that are against the Bible but also that the whole system of the denominations is basically against the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, in November of last year, they established the Lord's table according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They break bread to remember the Lord every Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They have completely broken their relationship with the denomination that they belonged to originally.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Unfortunately, there are a few brothers and sisters who are not completely in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are still a few who do not attend the table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They feel it is too solemn and terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May the brothers and sisters who love the Lord pray much for this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May the Lord enable them all to speak the same thing so that Satan will have no ground.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are more than fifty people who meet to break bread.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are more than one hundred who come to listen to the Word but still do not break bread.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are three brothers, Hsu Jung San, Hsu Chih Yi, and Hsu Wei San, who bear the responsibility for the work of the meeting and its affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Condition of the Meeting in Mo Ch'eng</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This meeting place is on a remote coast.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Its back is to the mountains, and it faces the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The scenery is very peaceful and beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There are many people in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The brothers are farmers, fishermen, or potters.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even most of the sisters work in the pottery factories as painters.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They are very hungry and thirsty for today's truths.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although no one has gone to work among them, many of them go to all the conferences that we have to listen to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although they do not have much worldly knowledge, they obey whatever truths they can understand to the extent that they understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They know a little about the error of denominations and the characteristics which the church of God should have.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, in the spring of last year, they left their former denomination and began to meet completely in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Most of those who were sprinkled have been baptized by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There are more than sixty brothers and sisters who meet to break bread.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There are also about thirty who have been saved and are waiting to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There are also more than one hundred who are not saved but come to hear the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Brothers Chang Ho Ling and Fang Hsing San are responsible for the work and affairs of the meeting.</S>
