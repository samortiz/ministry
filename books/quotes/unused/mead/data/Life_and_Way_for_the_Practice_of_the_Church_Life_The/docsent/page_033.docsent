   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO BE AN INWARD CHRISTIAN,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE TRANSFORMED FROM WITHIN,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brothers and sisters, I look to the Lord that our eyes may be opened to see that with us Christians it is not a matter of changing things outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not that formerly we had hatred but now we try to cultivate love because we are taught that hatred is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not that formerly we had pride but now we pray to the Lord to give us humility, since we are taught that pride hurts, damages, and spoils things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nor is it that formerly we easily lost our temper, but now we have learned to be patient because we found out from Proverbs that patience is desirable and profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may have some changes outwardly, but what about inwardly?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The human way, the religious way, the way of Christianity, is to improve man in his outward conduct and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's salvation, however, is to transform us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He wants to spread out from our very center, saturating and permeating all our inward parts with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way we will be transformed from within.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then there will be no need for us to get rid of the troublesome, outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because of the maturity and the growth of the inner life, all the troublesome, outward things will spontaneously be dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The life for the practice of the church life is a life of transformation by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you are being transformed by this wonderful One, many times you experience the effectiveness of the all-inclusive death of Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Something within kills your desire, your motive, your intention.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes when you are being transformed, you sense the release, the liberty, and the glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Something within makes you want to shout, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And sometimes when you are being transformed, you sense the government, the headship, and the lordship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You sense that the very Christ is on the throne, and He is the real King to you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, you sense that you are reigning with Him, and you are His co-partner in the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, you are ruled and governed by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the other hand, you are ruling with Him and sitting on the throne with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times you have the sense of the Lord's divinity, humanity, and human living within you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You have the deep inner feeling that what the Lord is, what the Lord has, and what the Lord has done are realized in you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church life is Christ Himself as the Spirit permeating, saturating, and transforming us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we are fully transformed and are full of Christ, we will become the living, real, practical members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then it will be easy for us to be joined, knit, and built up together with others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is to be built up not with something natural as wood, grass, and stubble, but with something transformed as gold, silver, and precious stones 1 Cor 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church is not formed by organization and discussion and by electing a chairman, a secretary, and a treasurer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That is a religious organization.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is organic, something growing up in life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to have the church life, we need to go to the cross and take care of Christ, who is the wonderful Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to take care of our inner feeling, inner guidance, inner shining, and inner registration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we would go to the cross and realize Christ within us, we will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All problems are solved by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why in 1 Corinthians 2:2 the apostle Paul told the believers that he did not determine to know anything among them except Jesus Christ and this One crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church life is a transformed life, not a natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is Christ Himself, not as an objective doctrine but as the subjective Spirit living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us learn the lesson of being an inward Christian, not an outward Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not try to change yourself outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That is false.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You have to be transformed from within to become a living member of the Body; then you will realize the genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is what we need today.</S>
