<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>THE REAL MEANING OF THE BOOK OF ACTS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 20:22; Matt. 28:18; Psa. 2; Eph. 2:6; Acts 2:1-4; 1:14; 2:14, 46-47; 8:14-17; Rev. 22:1</h1><p>Many Christians today do not know the real significance of the book of Acts. Although many books have been written about the Acts and many teachings put forth about it, even up to today our understanding of this book may not be very deep. This is because this book records matters that are wonderful and beyond our human concept. We may consider the Acts to be an easy book, relating the story of how the disciples of Christ after His ascension into heaven exercised extraordinary power to do things in a miraculous way, convincing people, bringing people to Christ, and setting up churches. However, if we have only this much understanding of this book, we lack the full revelation and insight.<h2 class=head1>BEING ENLIVENED BY THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</h2><p>We need the real insight concerning the record of this book. As we saw in the previous chapter, two important things transpired after the Lord’s death—resurrection and ascension. Resurrection is the strongest proof that the Son of God is the divine life, a life which nothing can damage, hold, or overcome (Acts 2:24). This life overcomes all things—Satan, death, Hades, and the grave. Nothing and no one can hold Him, damage Him, or overcome Him. This was fully proven and testified by the resurrection of Christ. This is one significance of the resurrection.<p>However, the resurrection of Christ is not only a proof or testimony; it is also an imparting of Himself into His members. In His resurrection, Christ imparted Himself into all those who identify themselves with Him in faith (1 Pet. 1:3). Therefore, objectively speaking, His resurrection is a proof, a testimony, that He is the indestructible life, and subjectively speaking, it is the imparting of Himself into us to make us the members of His Body.<h2 class=head1>BEING POSITIONED IN THE ENTHRONEMENT OF CHRIST</h2><p>In His ascension, Christ was enthroned and made the very Head over all things in the universe (Eph. 1:22). Therefore, He is the Head, the Lord, the King, and the anointed One on the throne. On the one hand, His ascension was His enthronement. On the other hand, because we were identified with Him in His ascension, we also were brought into the heavens with Him (2:6). When He was crucified, we died in Him on the cross; when He was resurrected, we were raised up with Him; and when He ascended, we also ascended to the heavens with Him. Therefore, His enthronement is our position. Because He is on the throne in the heavens, we also are in the heavens and on the throne. Enthronement indicates authorization. This is why the Lord Jesus told His disciples that all authority in heaven and on earth has been committed to Him (Matt. 28:18). Psalm 2, as a prophecy of Christ’s ascension, is the declaration of God to the entire universe that He has enthroned His Son, the anointed One, and made Him the Head over all things.<p>God committed all authority in the universe to His resurrected and ascended Christ, and now we are in Christ. Therefore, the enthronement of Christ is our position. We are in the heavens on the throne with Christ. The Lord told His disciples to go and disciple all the nations because all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him. They were sent not to preach the gospel in a common way but to preach the gospel of the kingdom and make people Christ’s disciples. This was carried out not only with His word and His divine life but also with His authority.<p>By the resurrection of Christ we have been regenerated as His members, and by His ascension we also have been enthroned and brought into the heavens. Resurrection is a matter of life, while ascension is a matter of position. In His resurrection we receive the Triune God within us as our life to be regenerated. In His ascension we have been brought into the heavens to be positioned and enthroned there. These two matters—resurrection and ascension—must be very clear to us. What is the resurrection of Christ? To Christ the resurrection is a proof and testimony that He is the indestructible life, while to us it is the impartation of the Triune God as our life that we might be enlivened and regenerated to become the members of His Body. What is the ascension of Christ? To Christ it is His enthronement, while to us it is our position in the heavenlies on the throne.
