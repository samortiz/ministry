   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RIGHT WITH THE TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For the children of Israel, the temple was the center of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hence, it was extremely serious for any of God's people to be wrong with the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who were right with the temple and who thereby maintained the oneness enjoyed God's presence, the blessing of life, and every other positive thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But those who were wrong with the temple through divisiveness opened the door for all manner of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The same is true among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many talk about holiness, victory, and spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, if we would have these virtues, we need to be in the proper oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Consider again the experience of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Holiness, victory, and spirituality were not the result of their effort.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These virtues were theirs simply because they were right with the temple, with the Holy of Holies, and with the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When they remained in the oneness by being right with the temple, there was no need for them to try to be holy, victorious, or spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Spontaneously, as part of the blessing of being in the oneness, they had these virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The reason many Christians have no victory, holiness, or spirituality is that they are wrong with the church and with the ark, Christ, in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we would be holy, spiritual, and victorious, we must be right with Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, we must remain in the proper oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the oneness that gives us access to all positive virtues and attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I was on the mainland of China, Brother Nee was the target for attack and opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many of those who attacked and opposed him claimed that he, the churches, and the elders were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I first heard of such attack and opposition, I wondered about the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Perhaps Brother Nee, the elders, and the churches were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, however, I learned that every opposer of Brother Nee or the churches or the elders was even more wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I noticed that everyone who attacked the Lord's recovery underwent a spiritual decline.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not know a single case of one who has opposed or attacked the church who has improved spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the contrary, they have damaged themselves, and their condition has gradually worsened.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The only thing that can preserve us spiritually is the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we remain in the oneness, all positive things are ours.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if we take the way of division, we shall be visited by all manner of evil things: hatred, jealousy, despising, and perhaps even such things as idolatry and fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sooner or later, the divisive ones are carried away to "Babylon" as captives.</S>
