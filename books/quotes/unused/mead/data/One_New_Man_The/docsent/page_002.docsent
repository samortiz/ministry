   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE ASSEMBLY, THE HOUSEHOLD, THE BODY, AND THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22-23; 2:19, 14-16; 4:24; Col 3:10-11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the Apostle Paul wrote concerning the new man in the Epistles to the Ephesians 2:15; 4:24 and to the Colossians 3:10 , the recipients may not have had a full understanding or appreciation of such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The known world at that time was not as big as it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When people spoke concerning the world, they referred mainly to the world around the Mediterranean Sea under the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But in God's intention, the world was not that small.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The world includes the entire globe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Two thousand years ago the world was considered to be flat.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time no one realized that the world was a sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, today in a conference we may see saints who come from all the six continents.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To see brothers and sisters who represent so many nations of the world stirs up my burden to minister on the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the right time for us to see the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE ASSEMBLY</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all have to admit that since the time of the apostles until at least the sixteenth century the church was going downward.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By the sixteenth century the church had fallen to the bottom, into the dark ages.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It could not go any lower.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At this time the Lord came in to start His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He started the recovery from the very base of the biblical truth, justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Luther did see something concerning the church as well, but he did not have much time to care for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He saw something of the church, yet he did not see enough.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A little more than two centuries later Count Zinzendorf, with so many other brothers, the so-called Moravian brothers, saw something more concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Bohemia, on the land owned by Zinzendorf, they started to have the practice of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That was the first step of the Lord's recovery of the church practice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By reading church history, you could realize that before Zinzendorf, no one was so clear concerning the church practice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Their practice was good, yet it was not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One century later, in the early 1800s, the Lord went on from Bohemia to England, raising up a group of seekers, including John Nelson Darby and other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They began to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Their practice was a great improvement over that which was practiced under the leadership of Zinzendorf at Bohemia.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These brothers began to see that the church is the assembly of God's called out ones Eph 1:22; 1 Cor 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church is the gathering of all the dear saints who have been called in Christ out of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, they began to drop the English term "church," because they realized that it had been damaged through wrong usage.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time fallen Christianity considered the church to be a physical building, perhaps with a "high tower" and a bell.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even today, many parents say to their children on Sunday morning, "Let us go to church," referring to the wood, the stone, the brick, and the glass.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How pitiful that was, and how pitiful it still is today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Brethren dropped this wrong concept, and they even dropped the term church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They began to use the word "assembly."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After this the Assembly of God followed them to use the word assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I agree with the word assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word assembly is better than the word church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Greek word for church is ekklesia.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The ekklesia is a gathering of the called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The root and basic element of the word ekklesia is the word for calling.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Ek means out, and kaleo means call.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church is the called out ones coming together, being gathered or assembled together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Brethren saw this and they made this very clear in their teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even today you can see this in their books.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How we thank God for this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Brethren did have a good start in dropping the wrong usage and wrong concept of the term church and in using the right word for the church, that is, the assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although the English word assembly does not convey the thought of being called out, in the Greek, as I mentioned already, the basic thought is the gathering of the called out ones.</S>
