   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Please read Romans 6:6 again.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have only explained this verse briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The verse is clear enough.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We know that sin is very evil, and we all hope to remove sin from our body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But we do not realize that the existence of the root of sin, like the existence of the devil himself, has nothing to do with the fruit of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is evil and bad is our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reason we can be tempted to exercise our lust or commit outward sins is that our old man is still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the Lord has crucified our old man with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is the purpose of the old man being crucified?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The purpose is "in order that the body of sin might be annulled."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word "annulled" may be translated as unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that without the old man, the body of sin cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Formerly, the body of sin followed the direction of the old man in our daily living; sinning was its profession.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All it did was sin and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The old man loved sin very much, it craved sin, and it loved to do all the sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why the body followed it to sin, making it the body of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now the old man has been dealt with by the Lord; it has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, the body of sin has become unemployed; it has lost its job.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the old man was alive, the body of sin practiced sin as its profession and job.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although sin still remains and still wants to be the master, we are no longer its slave.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although sin tries again and again to stir up the body to practice sin, the new man, through the reigning of the Holy Spirit, will not permit this to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, sin cannot cause the body to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, the Bible tells us that the result of the crucifixion of the old man and the unemployment of the body of sin is "that we should no longer serve sin as slaves!"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The old man is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why we can overcome sin completely.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord's blood was shed and has delivered us from our sins before God and stopped our conscience from condemning us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By the blood, we know that we will no longer perish, we have peace, we are reconciled to God, and we have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if we only know this aspect of salvation, we are still living a suffering life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may know that sin is forgiven, but we may still practice sin as our profession; we may not have any victory over sin practically and may not be bearing the fruit of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may still be forced to sin every day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will find that we still do not have peace, and our fellowship with God is cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although we know that we are saved and have eternal life, our daily sins have robbed us of the joy of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thank God that the Lord's salvation is not a halfway salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord shed His blood to cleanse us from our sins, and His cross has removed our old man and delivered us from the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Please remember that a believer does not die by killing himself or by committing suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some have preached that Christians ought to put themselves to death so that they will no longer sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We were crucified on the cross when the Lord Jesus was crucified there.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let me ask: have we died?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thank the Lord that the old man, who is so hard to deal with and dies with so much difficulty, has been crucified on the cross by the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thank and praise Him!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do we realize that we are evil beyond measure?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I know that I am most evil and detestable.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many times when I was under the oppression of the power of sin, I wished that I could have died.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But unfortunately, I could not make myself die.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Later, I saw that when the Lord was crucified on the cross, my old man was crucified with Him, so that my sinning body no longer would be a slave to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How happy I was!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because of the Lord's work, sin is now under my feet; it has no more power over me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thank and praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our sin cannot be removed by prayer, Scripture reading, godliness, worship, asceticism, or sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are delivered from sin by the Lord crucifying our old man with Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Remember that the blood deals with the sins before God, while the cross deals with the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What then should be our attitude towards sin?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Read Romans 6:11: "So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some have changed this verse to read, "Consider yourselves to be dead to sin," thinking that by just considering, sin would die.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But there is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some have said that the root of sin can be eradicated.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Others have said that we can consider sin to be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But I must tell you that it is not a matter of considering sin to be dead, but a matter of reckoning ourselves as having been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord has crucified our old man on the cross; the body of sin has been annulled, and we should not be a slave to sin any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But many people do not understand why their experience does not match these facts at all.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They are still sinning and not able to come out of sin's domination.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The body is still busily motivated by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Why is this the case?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The reason is that while the Lord has accomplished a full salvation for us, we have not accepted His work and believed in what He has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have not applied His victory by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He has crucified our old man, but we do not believe that our old man has been crucified in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We still consider our old man to be alive.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the reason that after we are told the fact in Romans 6:6, verse 11 tells us what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Romans 6:6 tells us that our old man has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Verse 11 tells us that since the Lord has crucified the old man, we should reckon it as dead so that it no longer can make us sin.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We can therefore say to sin, "Our old man is dead, and I am no longer your slave."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we want to wait to find out if sin is dead and the lusts are gone, we will never find them dead.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Sin is more alert than we are; it is more alive than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As soon as an opportunity comes, it will seize us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It will not die.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But this is all right because our old man has died.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We cannot overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The way is not to consider sin as being dead, but to believe in the accomplished work of the Lord, which is to reckon our old man dead.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Romans 6:11 says that we should reckon.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>How does one reckon?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Two plus two is four.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Why do you reckon that it is four?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is because two plus two is indeed four.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Therefore, the meaning of reckoning ourselves dead is not that we are not dead but we try temporarily to consider ourselves dead, deem ourselves dead, and think that we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is not to say to ourselves that the old man is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The death of the old man is something that God has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is why we can reckon it as being true.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Reckoning means that God has counted us crucified; the fact is reckoned on God's side, and we reckon ourselves dead as a consequence.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We reckon two plus two to be four because two plus two is four and not three or five.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>God said that we are crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We believe this and acknowledge that we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>To believe is to say that since God has declared our sins forgiven, we also declare our own sins forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God says that we are dead, and we acknowledge ourselves as being dead.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Christians must stand daily on the ground of Romans 6 before we can overcome all sins.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I am not boasting, but I can say that no sin is too hard to overcome because the Lord has crucified our old man on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is why we can overcome all sins.</S>
