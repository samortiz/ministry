<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT<br>AND JUDGMENT UPON DAMASCUS</H2><P>In Jeremiah 49:23-27 we see Jehovah's punishment and judgment upon Damascus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Damascus Typifying the World That Is Close to<br>and Involved with the Kingdom of God</H2><P>Damascus was a part of Syria (2 Sam. 8:5). It was close to Israel and had dealings and wars with Israel (1 Kings 15:18-21; 19:15-16; 2 Kings 16:7-16; 1 Kings 11:23-25; 1 Chron. 18:5-6; 2 Chron. 24:23). Damascus typifies the world that is close to and involved with the kingdom of God. The Bible shows us that sometimes Damascus was one with Israel but at other times made trouble for Israel. Around the church today there is such an aspect of the world. Sometimes it is good to the church and sometimes it bothers the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Her Cities Being Put to Shame</H2><P>Jeremiah 49:23 and 24 say that her cities were put to shame because they had heard an evil report. Panic took hold of her, and pain and anguish seized her, like a woman giving birth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The City of Praise,<br>the Town of Jehovah's Joy, Being Forsaken</H2><P>Verse 25 indicates that the city of praise, the town of Jehovah's joy, would be forsaken.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Her Young Men Falling in Her Open Squares</H2><P>Verse 26 speaks of her young men falling in her open squares, and all her men of war being cut off in that day.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Jehovah Setting Fire to the Wall of Damascus</H2><P>Verse 27 says that Jehovah would set fire to the wall of Damascus, and it would consume the palaces of her king Ben-hadad (cf. Isa. 17:1-3; Amos 1:3-5; Zech. 9:1).</P>
