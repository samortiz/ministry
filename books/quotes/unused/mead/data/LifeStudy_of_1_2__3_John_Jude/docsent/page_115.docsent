   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REGENERATED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OVERCOMING THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to 5:4, everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that everything points to the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, it is the regenerated human spirit that overcomes the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Regarding overcoming the world, we should not trust in our own ability or effort.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From experience I can testify that we need to trust our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our spirit is well able to overcome Satan and the world, the evil system.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in ourselves we cannot overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we exercise our spirit, stay in our spirit, and walk by our spirit, we shall see that our spirit has the life ability to overcome all negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is why we need to exercise our spirit to have fellowship with the Lord and pray concerning the enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also need to exercise our spirit to call on the Lord s name and to pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This exercise stirs up the ability in our spirit to overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is the divine life in our spirit that has the ability to overcome the evil, satanic world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are surrounded by temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What can overcome them?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The divine life in our spirit can overcome temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all need to see that our spirit is mingled with the divine life and is the organ that can overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>OUR FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 5:4b John says, And this is the victory which overcame the world our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the faith that believes that Jesus is the Son of God 5:5 that we may be begotten of God and have His divine life, by which we are enabled to overcome the Satan-organized-and-usurped world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, our trust should not be in our faith itself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The faith by itself does not overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our faith brings us into an organic union, and it is this organic union, not the faith directly, that overcomes the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may use switching on electrical current as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The act of switching on is not the power itself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the means by which appliances are brought into union with electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In a similar way, we may say that faith is the means for us to switch on to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By believing in the Lord Jesus, we are brought into organic union with the Triune God; we switch on to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This union, produced by faith, then overcomes the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>HE WHO BELIEVES</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THAT JESUS IS THE SON OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 5:5 John continues, And who is he who overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such a believer is one who has been begotten of God and has received the divine life John 1:12-13; 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The divine life empowers him to overcome the evil world energized by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such believers are in contrast to the Gnostics and Cerinthians, who were not this kind of believer, but remained the pitiful victims of the evil satanic system.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But our believing that Jesus is the Son of God brings us into an organic union with the Son, who is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is this organic union with the Triune God in the Son that overcomes the world.</S>
