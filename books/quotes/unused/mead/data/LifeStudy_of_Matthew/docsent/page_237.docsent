   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Five Prudent Ones</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Taking Oil in Their Vessels</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 4 says, But the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man is a vessel made for God Rom 9:21, 23-24 , and man s personality is in his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, vessels here signify the soul of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The five prudent virgins not only have oil in their lamps, but also take oil in their vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Having oil in their lamps signifies that they have the Spirit of God dwelling in their spirit Rom 8:9, 16 , and taking oil in their vessels signifies that they have the fullness of the Spirit of God saturating their souls.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to be very clear about the lamps and the vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the Hebrew text, Proverbs 20:27 says that the spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Within the lamp is the oil, the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The New Testament reveals that our spirit is the place the Holy Spirit indwells.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Romans 9, we are vessels made by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our being, our personality, is in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the vessel in this verse signifies our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through regeneration we have the Spirit of God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This causes our lamp to burn.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the question is whether or not we have the extra portion of the Holy Spirit filling our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although we have the oil in our lamp, we need the extra portion of the oil in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This signifies that the Spirit must spread from within our spirit to every part of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then in our soul we shall have an extra amount of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have this extra portion, we are prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do not have it, we are foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, if we are indifferent to the infilling of the Holy Spirit, we are foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are wise, we shall pray, Lord, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I want to have Your Spirit not only in my spirit, but also in my soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord, I need the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I need the extra portion of the Holy Spirit to fill my entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without this extra portion of the Spirit, we cannot be watchful or ready.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to be watchful and ready, we need the infilling of the Holy Spirit, the spreading of the Spirit Himself from our spirit to every part of our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bridegroom Delaying</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 5 says that the Bridegroom delayed His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus truly has delayed His coming again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Revelation He promised to come quickly, but nearly two thousand years have passed, and still He delays his coming.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the Virgins</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Becoming Drowsy and Sleeping</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the Bridegroom delayed His coming, all the virgins became drowsy and slept.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Becoming drowsy signifies becoming sick Acts 9:37; 1 Cor 11:30 , and going to sleep signifies dying 1 Thes 4:13-16; John 11:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While the Lord delays His coming back, the majority of the believers firstly become sick and then die.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A Cry at Midnight</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 6 says, But at midnight there is a cry, Behold, the bridegroom!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Go forth to meet him!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Midnight signifies the darkest time of this dark age night .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That will be the end of this age, the time of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Cry signifies the voice of the archangel 1 Thes 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the Virgins Arising</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 7 says, Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Arose signifies resurrection from the dead 1 Thes 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the resurrection predicted in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and 1 Corinthians 15:52.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Trimming Their Lamps</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After the virgins arose, they trimmed their lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This signifies their dealing with their testimony in life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This indicates that after resurrection our life for the Lord s testimony will still need to be dealt with if it is not perfect before we die.</S>
