   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If you do not have this flowing within, you are a dead person; you are a false Christian, not a genuine one.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you are a genuine Christian, I am sure something within you is flowing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The fellowship of life is the current of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 2 Corinthians 13:14 we have the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fellowship of the Spirit is the current of the Spirit, transmitting all the fullness of God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is just like the current of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While it flows, it transmits all the riches of the generator to the building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Holy Spirit is the fellowship, the transmission, transmitting all the riches of Christ, all the fullness of the Godhead in Christ, into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How do you take Christ as your life?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You have something within flowing in you; just take care of that flowing, follow that flowing, and go along with that flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you follow and go along with the inner flowing, this means that you are on the right track to experience Christ as life day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the inner flowing tells you to go to Los Angeles, do not say, "I don't want to go."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, go along with the inner flowing and do whatever it tells you to do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To take Christ as life is to go along with the inner flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not many people know this secret of taking Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some may know yet they are not faithful to the inner flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many times something in you is flowing, yet you do not go along with the flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You try to be good and do good in order to make yourself Christ-like, but you would not go along with the flowing to take Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you go along with the inner flowing, you will have joy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Joy is very much related to the flowing, the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the flowing tells you to go to Los Angeles and you go along with it, you will be full of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A Christian must be a person who is always joyful, but you cannot be joyful unless you go along with the inner flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The joy is always with the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How do you know that you are taking Christ as your life?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just ask yourself, "Do I have joy?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is something that you cannot pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some brothers came to me pretending to be joyful, but in my spirit I could sense their joy was false.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Joy is something from within your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you have the flow and are in the fellowship, you have joy and are joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you neglect the inner flow, the inner fellowship, you lose your joy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Remember that joy is always related to fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now let us consider the next item the light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The life was the light of men John 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In John 8:12 we have this term the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The light of life is just life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The light within us is life, and the life within us is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Light is something shining, illuminating.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Check your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you have something within you shining all the time?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you do, that means you are in the life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How do you know that you are taking Christ as your life?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By realizing, sensing, that you have something within you not only flowing but also shining.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have no utterance to describe this inner shining, just as I have no way to describe the taste of sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you want to know what sweetness is, just take a piece of candy and taste it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then you will know.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I believe many times you have the experience of the shining within you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That is the light of life, the life functioning as light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We know that electricity is one, but its functions are many.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It gives us light, power, heat, etc. Just as there is one electricity yet many functions, there is one life yet many functions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It gives us the flow, the joy, and the light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Something within us is shining all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you sense darkness within you, you should realize that you are not taking Christ as life; you are out of the experience of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you take Christ as life, you must have the shining within you because the life is the light, and Christ Himself is the light of life.</S>
