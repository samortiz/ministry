<h2 class="head1">II. APPRAISING HIS FORERUNNER</h2><p>The questions John&rsquo;s disciples asked the Lord might have given the Lord&rsquo;s apostles a negative impression of John. Thus, in verses 7 through 15 the Lord publicly appraised His forerunner. Concealed within the Lord&rsquo;s reply to John was an indication of John&rsquo;s weakness. However, His words to the crowds concerning John testified publicly for John. Remember that the first four disciples were brought in through John&rsquo;s ministry of recommendation. John had declared, &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God,&rdquo; and John and Andrew followed the Lord Jesus. Eventually they brought James and Peter to the Lord as well. Thus, the first four disciples were brought to Christ through the ministry of John the Baptist.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Not a Reed in the Wilderness<br />Shaken by the Wind<br />or a Man Dressed in Soft Clothing</h2><p>In His public appraisal of John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus vindicated him. In verse 7 the Lord said, &ldquo;What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?&rdquo; A reed signifies a weak and fragile person (12:20; 1 Kings 14:15). When John the Baptist was testifying for Christ in the wilderness, he was not like a reed, a weak person. However, now in prison he was somewhat like a reed shaken by the wind. The Lord Jesus is wise, kind, and merciful. If we had been the Lord, we would have been offended by John. Because the Lord knew that John was somewhat weakened, He encouraged him. He seemed to be saying, &ldquo;John, be careful. It seems that you are at least somewhat weakened concerning Me.&rdquo; This was the meaning of the Lord&rsquo;s word to John. But when He spoke to the crowds and to the other disciples, He vindicated John, indicating that he was not a weak, timid person, but a strong witness. In verse 8 the Lord asked, &ldquo;But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings.&rdquo; After testifying boldly for Christ in the wilderness, John the Baptist became weak when he had been imprisoned for a time. Some might think that he would desire to wear soft clothing in the houses of kings. But the Lord testified that he was neither a reed shaken by the wind nor a man dressed in soft clothing.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Much More Than a Prophet</h2><p>Verse 9 says, &ldquo;But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.&rdquo; The Lord testified that John was much more than a prophet. He was a great prophet, greater than all the prophets who had gone before him.</p> <h2 class="head2">C. Being a Messenger<br />before the Heavenly King&rsquo;s Face,<br />Preparing the Way for Him</h2><p>John was sent by God as a messenger before Christ to prepare the way for Him (11:10) that the people might be turned to God and receive the heavenly King and the heavenly kingdom. His ministry was to pave the way for the kingdom.</p>
