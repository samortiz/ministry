   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>POOR CHARACTER BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A HINDRANCE TO THE LORD S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The reason the Lord s work in Taiwan has been frustrated and has not been spreading is that for the past twenty years the churches here have been living a life of ease and comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I left Taiwan in 1961, there was a great number of saints meeting in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since then, however, not only has there been a lack of expansion, but there has even been a decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reason lies in the fact that the church in Taipei has many assets and a great number of saints in the meetings, so the co-workers have been able to maintain the situation without having to endeavor and struggle for the spread of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, when I left, I left the church in Taipei with many assets.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This allowed the co-workers to quickly become loose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand, I can testify that the co-workers have faithfully maintained the testimony of the Lord s recovery in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the other hand, during the past twenty or more years, all the shortcomings of the Chinese character were brought into the church because of their carelessness and inattentiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since there are so many valuable assets in the church, they tend not to care when they lose a few of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They may feel that the absence of these saints does not make much of a difference and that there are still thousands of people who attend the conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, as the saying goes, One false step makes a great difference.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During the past twenty-five years, not only has the number of saints in the meetings decreased, but even the spirit for expansion which was among us has been lost.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The work of the Lord s recovery in Taiwan began at the site of Hall 1 of the church in Taipei, which was part of a Japanese residential district during the Japanese occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That area was bombed by the allied forces during the war, and all that was left was an area of cement-covered ground.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the victory, this plot of land was taken over by the Chinese government.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later two Chinese brothers who had been living overseas came to reside in Taiwan and bought half of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, a small meeting hall that could accommodate three to four hundred people was built.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On August 1, 1949, I held our first conference in that little meeting hall to officially start the Lord s work in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the beginning of the work, under the Lord s blessing the number of saved ones steadily increased.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, our meeting place quickly became inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1950 we made use of the adjacent empty lot by fixing it up and putting a bamboo fence around it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, we were able to add many more seats to the hall.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later as the Lord s work spread more, and the number of saints multiplied, I bought another piece of land next to the meeting hall, combining it with the land that we originally owned, and we rebuilt the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1953 I began to conduct a training which many saints attended.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the fenced lot I built a house for the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even though its appearance was simple, the lush plants and flowers provided a sense of serenity and freshness, and its interior was clean and tidy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I left Taiwan in 1961 and did not come back until 1965.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I came back, the workers house was almost unrecognizable.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The plants had dried up, and all the flowers had withered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everything was a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I was exceedingly troubled within.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I thought back to when I had conducted the training twelve years earlier and had spoken on the thirty items of character training.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The messages that I had given at that time had been very strong and serious, yet twelve years later, the co-workers had completely forgotten them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Recently I told the elders that our meeting hall, which is now a building made of reinforced concrete, is no longer the simple building we once had.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, it should not have an old appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regarding the condition of the meeting hall, if the hall were being used by the Japanese saints, it would definitely be tidier and cleaner than it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If it were being used by the American saints, it would be much more spacious and elegant.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, when we use the meeting hall, we make it appear so unbecoming.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, consider the bookshelves which contain the Bibles and hymnals for public use.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All of the Bibles and hymnals are in disarray, and many of them are torn and are even missing pages.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not one of them is in a proper condition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This implies that our work has not been developed and has no vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If people came and saw the disorderly condition of our Bibles and hymnals, how could they respect us?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this world every building, regardless of what kind of business it is used for, needs to have an impressive front.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, the people who work at a bank must clean their surroundings so that everything is neat and tidy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When people see that the bank s environment is respectable, then they are more likely to have confidence in the bank and to be willing to deposit their money there.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Similarly, every week we should organize the books and hymnals on our bookshelves that are for public use.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The torn ones should be repaired, and the ones that are no longer usable should be replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The books should be neatly placed on the shelf so that in the next meeting they can be properly distributed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not look down on these kinds of matters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A little bookshelf could ruin our reputation, resulting in our being unable to bring in anyone of quality, or it could be our silent testimony, attracting people to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, as we are working here, we should have an impressive front, a dignified appearance, so that people would be fully convinced to come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Please forgive me for saying these things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I must say them because I hate how the Chinese character has damaged us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There are many business entrepreneurs in Taiwan who are successful because they have changed their character.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As long as one is willing to change his poor character, he will ultimately succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who do not change their slothful nature will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Those who change the fastest, the earliest, and the most radically will have the greatest chance of success.</S>
