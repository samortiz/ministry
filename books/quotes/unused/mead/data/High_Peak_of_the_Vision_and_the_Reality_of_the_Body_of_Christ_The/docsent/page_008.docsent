   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At the end of 1950 I went to Manila.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I worked there for five and a half months, and just before I left, a brother went to the elders and asked them to make an appointment for him to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This brother was a businessman and was quite wealthy but had donated little prior to that time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He came to see me and said, "Brother Lee, now you are going back to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Please tell me the total amount of the annual expenses of your work in Taiwan, including the building of meeting halls and the support for the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have the burden before the Lord to bear the whole responsibility."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was truly something of the Lord's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then I said, "Brother Wang, you know the practice among us is that we do not tell people of our needs."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He said, "This is not you telling me, but it is I receiving the Lord's commission.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, if you don't tell me, how can I know the amount?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So I told him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, he supplied the work every year for eleven years, from 1950 to 1961; every year there was a sum of money as a supply.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thank the Lord, this was all His doing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I went back from Manila to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At that time I was the only full-time brother in Taiwan, and there was a Sister Hou, who was also serving full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the whole island of Taiwan we were the only two full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even Brothers Chang Wu-chen and Sun Feng-lu were not yet full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everyone knew that unless he went to get a job, there would be no support, so everyone got a job.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After I had this experience in Southeast Asia, I fellowshipped with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then I began to hold trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 1952 over eighty full-time serving ones were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I told the church clearly that it did not mean that the churches had no responsibility or that the brothers and sisters did not need to give in love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But my own experience told me that there was the possibility that the serving ones would have no food on their tables.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From the Bible we see that this was also the experience of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, I said that, because of my experience, the support which I received in the work of my ministry would be used to pay the expenses of providing adequate food for the co-workers and their families.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that even if the brothers and sisters would not give anything, the co-workers still would have food on their tables.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This support continued through 1961.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From 1961 the churches began to share according to their ability in order to reduce the burden on the side of my work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because many churches were set up and the number of saints increased, they reduced the amount of my support of the co-workers to about sixty percent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, gradually, in 1964 I unloaded this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All this was recorded in the accounts of the Gospel Book Room in those years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The number of co-workers with their families reached a peak of 170.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every year the ministry supplied them for their daily needs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was truly the Lord's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1950 I had my last contact with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the time I was not clear, but now when I look back, I see that it was the Lord's doing; that is, the Lord was making preparations to transfer to me the ministry of the word in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I was in mainland China, I did not publish books on my own.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, I helped Brother Nee manage the Gospel Book Room.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I wrote only a few articles, which Brother Nee liked and published as a book, entitled Gleanings from Christ's Genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There were also a few other books concerning the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 1950, when the two of us were in Hong Kong, we spent much time talking together.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because I realized that later it might not be possible for me to contact Brother Nee, I brought up to him the need to publish in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He said, "Brother Witness, you know that among us only I personally own the Gospel Book Room.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It belongs neither to the church nor to the co-workers; it belongs to me personally."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then he made arrangements, saying, "Now the three political regions the mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan all differ from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>So we will have the Gospel Book Room divided into three: one in Shanghai, one in Taiwan, and one in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are not three Book Rooms; rather, they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Due to the political situation, the three places will be on their own financially."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was responsible for the one in Shanghai; he entrusted to me the responsibility for the one in Taiwan; and he asked Brother K. H. Weigh to take charge of the one in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He further charged me, saying, "Brother Weigh also needs your help in bearing the responsibility for the articles."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, in the initial period, the Taiwan Gospel Book Room published books mainly in coordination with the Book Room in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The two published books together, not separately.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The cost of the books published both in Hong Kong and Taiwan were calculated together.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was due to such an arrangement made by Brother Nee that we have today's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thank the Lord, as soon as we began the work in Taipei, an overseas Chinese brother contributed ten thousand U.S. dollars, and that became the beginning of the Gospel Book Room.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Concerning the Book Room, I have explained clearly to the co-workers that this Book Room does not belong to the church nor to the co-workers nor to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Just as it was in the past with Brother Nee, this is my book room to serve the publication of my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, I began to publish books in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I knew that there could no longer be the ministry that was with Brother Nee and we could no longer have it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>So I began to carry out the literature work in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That fellowship in Hong Kong truly was the Lord's sovereign arrangement in that Brother Nee gave me instructions concerning the work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After another two years he was put into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In 1952 in Taiwan over eighty full-time serving ones were added at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I can testify to you that none of these things was of my work, but everything was the Lord's sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>From 1932, when I began to speak for the Lord, to the year 1952 was a total of twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I began to speak ten years later than Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Brother Nee began to speak for the Lord in 1922.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>From that time to the summer of 1952, when he was imprisoned, he spoke for a total of thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>From 1952 on, the Lord transferred the ministry of the word to me.</S>
