   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO NEED TO UPHOLD ONE'S AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Samuel 15 is a record of Absalom's rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This was a double rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, it was the rebellion of a son against his father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the other hand, it was the rebellion of a people against their king.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was the greatest rebellion David experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His son was taking the lead in this rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time, more and more people were following Absalom, and David had to flee from the capital.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was in need of followers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ittai the Gittite wanted to follow him, but David was able to say to Ittai, "Return and abide with the king" v. 19 . David was truly meek.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His spirit was truly keen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not say, "I am the king, and all of you should follow me."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead he told Ittai, "You can take your way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have no intention to drag many people into my woes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even if you choose to go to the new king, that is fine with me."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was in the midst of his tribulation, yet he still would not take people along with him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not easy to know a person when he lives in the palace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when he is in the midst of trials, his true personality is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here David was not rash or careless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was still humble and submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After he crossed the brook Kidron, he was about to turn to the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Zadok the high priest with all the priests and the Levites wanted to come with him, and they took the ark along with them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the ark had left the city, many Israelites would have gone with it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Zadok and the Levites' attitude was right: When rebellion broke out, they had to remove the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But at this juncture David did not say, "This is good.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not leave the ark with the rebellious ones."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>David thought that if the ark left Jerusalem, many of the people of Israel would be in turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was a person who had ascended to a great height.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He would not allow the ark to go with him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was willing to resign himself to God's dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His attitude was the same as that of Moses, who was altogether humbled under the mighty hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both of them ascended to a height that was unmatched by their opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>David said that if he should find favor in the sight of the Lord, He would bring him back again to see the ark and His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If he did not find favor in God's sight, it would have been useless even if the ark followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, he exhorted Zadok the high priest and the Levites who bore the ark to return vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>24-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This was easy to say but difficult to do.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There were not many people who escaped from Jerusalem, and the city was filled with rebellious ones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now he had to send his good friends away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How pure was David's spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was still humbling himself meekly before the Lord, just as Moses did.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In verse 27 David said to Zadok that since he was a priest and a seer, he should take the lead to bring the priests and the ark back.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At that word the group returned.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In reading this passage, we have to touch David's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His spirit was saying, "Why do I have to fight with others?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whether or not I remain a king is God's business.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I do not need many people to follow me, and I do not need the ark to accompany me."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He realized that being an authority is God's business and that no one needs to maintain his own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>David went up to the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went up and with his head covered v. 30 . Here indeed was a meek and pliable man! This was what David did when he was offended.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He did not hold on to his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the proper attitude of a God-appointed authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>AN AUTHORITY SHOULD HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TAKE OFFENSE</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A rebellious spirit is contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Second Samuel 16 tells us that Shimei came forth along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He threw stones at David and cursed him, saying that he had shed the blood of the house of Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even David's followers suffered because of him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nothing could be farther from the truth than Shimei's accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If there was a person who had not shed the blood of Saul's house, that person was David.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Shimei could say that David had reigned in Saul's stead and that David was running for his life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There was nothing wrong in saying that.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But it was a gross lie to say that David had shed the blood of Saul's house.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Yet David did not argue.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He did not vindicate himself or deny anything.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>David still had his mighty men with him, and it would have been easy for him to get rid of this man, but he would not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Shimei cursed as he went.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even David's followers could not stand it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yet David exhorted them not to kill.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He said, "Leave him alone and let him curse, for Jehovah has told him to do so" v. 11 . He was truly a broken and pliable man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He was learning to submit to a higher authority.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>David said that it was God who had told Shimei to curse him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In reading this portion of the Bible, we have to touch David's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He was alone and an outcast.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At least he could have taken out his frustration on Shimei and vindicated himself a little.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, he was an absolutely submissive person.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He submitted absolutely to God and accepted everything that God had done to him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Brothers and sisters, you must realize that God's appointed authority is one who can take offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He is one who can be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If the authority that you have received cannot suffer any offense, you are not qualified to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Do not think that you can act as you please as long as you have been given authority.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Only those who have learned the lesson of obedience are qualified to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Verse 13 says that Shimei continued to curse David, yet David was truly a submissive man.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Only such a person is qualified to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Here was a man who was truly pliable before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>David and his followers rested wearily at a place.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Even while Absalom was rebelling, David still maintained a proper attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He was a man in the Old Testament, yet he was full of the grace of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He was so broken that he was able to have such a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is indeed a person who was qualified to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>LEARNING TO BE HUMBLED UNDER THE MIGHTY HAND OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In 2 Samuel 19, after Absalom was defeated and killed, the Israelites heard that David was sitting in the city gate, and they all had fled to their own house v. 8 . David did not return with fanfare to his palace.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Absalom had been anointed to be a king also.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This was why David had to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The eleven tribes came and asked him to go back, but the tribe of Judah did not come along.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>David sent men to recover the tribe of Judah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>David was of the tribe of Judah, and he was driven away by it.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This was why he had to wait for the people to ask him back.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He was God's appointed authority, but during his trial, he learned to humble himself under the mighty hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He did not try to build up his own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He accepted the arrangements in the environment and was humbled under the mighty hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He was not in any haste.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He was a warrior himself, but he did not fight for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>All the battles were fought for the Lord's people.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In the past God's people had anointed him to be the king.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In order to return to his kingship, he had to wait for God's people to anoint him once again.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>All those whom God uses to be an authority should have the spirit of David.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We should not say anything to defend ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>There is no need for us to say anything for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We should not act on our own.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>There is no need to move even a little finger to prove that we are chosen by God.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We should trust, wait, and humble ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We have to wait for God's timing.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>God will surely accomplish what He has set out to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The more submissive we are, the more we will learn to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The more we prostrate ourselves before the Lord, the more God will vindicate us.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>But if we try to speak for ourselves, fight for ourselves, and complain, we will destroy God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We have to learn to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The more we try to be an authority in ourselves, the more we will walk down the wrong path.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The way is clear before us.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>In the Old Testament the greatest authority was Moses, while among all the kings the greatest authority was David.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Both behaved the same way in their capacity as deputy authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>We have to touch these men's spirits before we can maintain God's authority.</S>
