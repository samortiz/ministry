   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Terrible Suffering Indeed!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Physically, I still need to rest another week, according to Brother Deh-bao's word; it is still too early to move around.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you think I need to go to Yungkang, I believe the Lord will protect and support me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I await your letter with instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I do not know when you think it will be appropriate for me to return to Jinhua.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I feel that my condition before the Lord is terrible both inwardly and outwardly!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I believe that I have been going steadily downward on this trip from Jinhua to Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I feel a great darkness inwardly and outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I cannot touch the Lord when I try to fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes I wonder if my spiritual pathway has reached its end. Do I still have a hope of rising up again? I do not know why I feel as if I have committed some great sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The things which I thought were no longer with me the things of the old creation are still in me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The things which I thought I had in the new creation have completely disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I do not know where they have gone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes I am so discouraged and disappointed that I hate myself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What kind of a person am I?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I do not have any spiritual reality, and I have touched nothing of service.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I can do nothing, but I am full of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When others do something well, I am jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I cannot tolerate a single critical sentence or attitude from others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am weak and pitiful inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is beyond me to describe my present condition!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes I really cannot stand it, and my uneasiness all too clearly shows where I am!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is a terrible suffering indeed!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have no words to pray to the Lord concerning this condition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I want to cry, but have no tears.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, I am really afraid to return to Jinhua.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I used to think that I could handle everything and that I could solve the brothers' and sisters' problems.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now I do not even know how to solve my own problems.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if I do not return to Jinhua, what is the use of my staying in Hangchow?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes I think it is useless for me to be anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am like salt that has lost its flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes I tell myself, "It is futile to serve any longer!"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But I am not willing to quit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this kind of condition, I really cannot receive any leading.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps I do not need to seek any leading by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Wherever you put me is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you think I need to return to Jinhua, I will return to Jinhua.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I feel that I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you want me to go back to Jinhua, please give me a little time to study more about optometry.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What do you think about this?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Beginning Monday, a few brothers began praying together every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I believe Brother Chao has probably written to you about this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first two times were very oppressive; we were not able to release ourselves; nor could we sense what to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We could only confess our sins and pray for our hopeless condition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We did not touch the spirit at all, nor did we rise up inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Each of us was there looking at the pitiful condition of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more we prayed like this, the lower we sank, and the more we were oppressed!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By the third morning, there was almost no prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This continued until Brother Chao prayed a few words about faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He prayed about coming before God by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When he touched this point, everybody opened up inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We turned and began to lift our praises to Christ for all of His accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We stopped looking at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We looked at Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is our everything!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are not accepted before God based on ourselves; nor do we boast about ourselves before the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We do not overcome the flesh in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Here we touched some praise in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is unfortunate that we had turned back to our "self."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord showed us once again that we are fallen, that our heart is wicked, and that we cannot be used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We asked the Lord to give us deeper dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Please remember us in prayer, and protect us with your prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sisters Wu and Kwei went to Changloh; they will return to Hangchow in twenty days.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They have already returned to Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Editor</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
