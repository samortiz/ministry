[1]  Enjoying Christ as the All-Inclusive Spirit for the Practical, Genuine, and Real Church Life CONTENTS
[2]  Leaving the Ordinances of Religion to Live by Christ as Our Person
[3]  CHAPTER ONE BEING SAVED FROM THE PRESENT EVIL AGE BY GOD REVEALING HIS SON IN US Scripture Reading: Gal 1:1-4, 6-7, 10-16, 22-23
[4]  The entire Bible is a revelation from God, breathed out by Him 2 Tim 3:16; 2 Pet 1:20-21 , and the order of the books of the Bible is also sovereignly arranged by God.
[5]  In the New Testament we first have the four Gospels, presenting a full picture of a wonderful person, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[6]  In order to know the subjective, indwelling, and transforming Jesus, we need to see more concerning the veils.
[7]  Paul was an apostle not from men nor through man but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead v. 1 . Paul s source and origin as an apostle was not man but God.
[8]  Religion is something for God and for the benefit of people, yet it is apart from Christ and without the Spirit of Christ.
[9]  As long as Christ is not in something, no matter how good it may be, it is only religion.
[10]  Even if we pray or study the Bible but are not in the spirit and do not have the Spirit of Christ, we are in religion, which does not bring forth the church.
[11]  The Lord s recovery is to bring us back to the proper church life, and Christ as the Spirit is the only element that produces the church.
[12]  As long as we do things in the spirit and with the Spirit of Christ, we have the church life.
[13]  On his way to Damascus, Paul received not mere teaching but a revelation from the heavens so that he could see Christ and God s will to have the church, which comes out of Christ.
[14]  TO LIVE BY CHRIST AS OUR PERSON Scripture Reading: Gal 2:1-5, 11-14, 19-21 GOD S INTENTION CONCERNING
[15]  God s intention is to impart Christ, the wonderful One, into His many believers so that He may have the church as a Body for Christ.
[16]  Galatians 1 tells us that religion with its traditions persecutes the church, ravages it, and tries to uproot it vv.
[17]  CHAPTER THREE CHRIST AS THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT BEING THE BLESSING OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Gal 3:2-3, 5, 14
[18]  On the negative side, Galatians 1 exposes religion with its traditions, and chapter 2 speaks of the law with its ordinances.
[19]  On the positive side, however, chapter 1 shows us Christ revealed in us, and chapter 2 unveils Christ living in us 1:15-16a; 2:20 .
[20]  Moreover, Christ revealed in us and Christ living in us are for the church.
[21]  In chapter 3 the Spirit is mentioned four times: Receive the Spirit...out of the hearing of faith v. 2 ; having begun by the Spirit v. 3 ; bountifully supplies to you the Spirit v. 5 ; and receive the promise of the Spirit through faith v. 14 . God promised the Spirit to us, we have received the ministered Spirit, and we have begun in the Spirit.
[22]  There are always two realms before us the realm of the flesh and the realm of the Spirit which represent two possibilities for us.
[23]  God s economy is to dispense Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit, into us as our life and our person so that we would deny ourselves and follow the Christ who is within us, that is, in our human spirit 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 8:16 .
[24]  The Spirit is ministered to us through the death of Christ on the cross.
[25]  Christ died on the cross in order that we may receive the blessing of Abraham, the bountiful Spirit vv.
[26]  This inclusive Spirit includes the eternal Father, the Creator, the incarnated God, the man Jesus, the Lamb of God, the Redeemer, the resurrected Christ, the Savior, Master, King of kings, and Lord of lords.
[27]  He is recovering our experience of the real, living, indwelling Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit so that we may have a practical daily life in the Spirit and spontaneously become the one Body expressed as the local churches in every locality that we are in. This kind of real, living, and practical church life will push the enemy into the corner.
[28]  TO INHERIT THE PROMISE OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 3:23-29; 4:4-10, 19, 21-31 GOD S PURPOSE BEING
[29]  Now as the ascended One, the One who was raised to the third heaven and seated on the throne of God, He is the Lord and Christ Acts 2:36 , the One appointed and anointed by God to execute all that God planned to do for the accomplishment of His purpose.
[30]  CHRIST BEING THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT
[31]  In the King James Version, Romans 8:16 renders the pronoun for the Spirit as itself, leaving the impression that the translators of that version did not realize that the Holy Spirit is a person, considering Him simply as a kind of power or instrument.
[32]  From the time of the American Standard Version of 1901, people began to see more clearly that the Holy Spirit is a divine person, so that at least since then, translations refer to the Spirit as He or Himself.
[33]  However, some of the Brethren continued to teach that we should not pray to the Holy Spirit but only to the Father and sometimes to the Lord.
[34]  Therefore, we should not remain in it but should return to the pure Word of God to see that our Jesus, whom God is working into us, is all-inclusive.
[35]  This Spirit is Christ, into whom we have been baptized and whom we have put on v. 27 . We can be baptized into Christ because, as the Spirit, He is the living water into whom we are immersed.
[36]  Galatians is a book on Christ versus many negative matters, such as the law with all the ordinances, religion with traditions, and the flesh.
[37]  If we try to keep the law with its ordinances, we are deprived of all profit from Christ 5:2 , and if we still hold on to the traditions of religion, we are brought to nought and separated from Christ v. 4 . Moreover, if we live by the flesh, we are not living by Christ as the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit vv.
[38]  In chapter 2, Christ lives in us v. 20 . In chapter 3, we have been baptized into Christ and have put Him on v. 27 . At this point, Christ is in us, and we are in Christ.
[39]  After Galatians 1 through 4, the emphasis of chapter 5 is no longer on the law, ordinances, religion, and traditions.
[40]  Rather, this chapter speaks of walking by the Spirit, living by the Spirit, and being led by the Spirit vv.
[41]  We all must be unloaded and unburdened of the things of religion to see that the genuine and real church life is simply Christ as the life-giving Spirit living in our spirit, and we must walk by this wonderful Spirit.
[42]  OF THE BOOK OF GALATIANS Scripture Reading: Gal 6:1, 7-8, 12-18; 2 Cor 5:17; Eph 2:15; 4:24; Col 3:10-11 AN OVERVIEW OF THE BOOK OF GALATIANS
[43]  Galatians 1 tells us how religion with its traditions is versus Christ and the church vv.
[44]  3-4, 13-14, 15a, 16a , and chapter 2 tells us that the law with its ordinances is in opposition to Christ as our life vv.
[45]  In order to be sons of God and heirs of God s riches, we need Christ revealed in us, Christ living in us, Christ put upon us, and Christ formed in us v. 19 . Christ, who is the Son of God, is being formed in us to make us sons of God.
[46]  Galatians 1 through 4 tells us that we need Christ revealed in us, Christ living in us, Christ put upon us, and Christ formed in us.
[47]  OF THE BOOK OF GALATIANS The New Creation Having the Divine Life
[48]  In 5:6 Paul says, In Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith avails, operating through love.
[49]  The new creation is the new man in Christ, which corporately is Christ s Body, the church Eph 4:24; 2:15-16; Col 3:10-11 .
