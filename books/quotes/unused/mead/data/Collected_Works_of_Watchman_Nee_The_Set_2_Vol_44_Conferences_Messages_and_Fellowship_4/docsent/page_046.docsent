   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN LOVING NOT OUR OWN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MANY SICKNESSES Date: December 6, 1939</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Rev 12:11; Job 2:3-10; Matt 10:39; Acts 15:26; 20:24; Rom 16:3-4; Eph 6:10; Phil 2:29-30; 1 Pet 4:1-2; 1 John 3:16 NOT LOVING ONESELF</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>BEING THE BASIS FOR VICTORY OVER SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The book of Revelation tells us that the brothers overcome Satan, the accuser, by the blood of Christ, by the word of their testimony, and by not loving their soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not loving our own soul-life is not the condition for overcoming Satan, it is the basis for overcoming him 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not loving our soul-life does not mean that we have to die.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It means that we are willing to give up our own soul-life and that we do not care for our own soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some people are not that attached to their children; they are not concerned whether they lose their children.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But they care very much for their own "face."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is easier for them to lose ten ounces of gold than to give away "ten ounces" of their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These men love themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They cannot overcome Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In fact they are certain losers in the hand of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan is only afraid of one kind of people those who do not love their own soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only these ones are beyond Satan's touch.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The basis for victory over Satan is to not love our own soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE LORD'S PATTERN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Lord was on earth, He did not care for His own soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was why many people considered Him to be a mad man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They thought that He did not know how to control Himself, that He did not know how to eat properly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today we are all familiar with teachings on temperance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, we are practicing worldly temperance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord was able to give up temperance for the sake of others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of course, I must say that being intemperate for no reason at all is a sin, and it is extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not wrong to live an unregulated life, but it is wrong to be intemperate in an irresponsible way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not loving our own soul-life and being intemperate are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord could eat outside normal times; He could touch lepers, get up before the sun rose, or pray all night.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But these were done during times of special need and for the benefit of others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Being able to sleep properly and eat properly are not signs of temperance in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Proper temperance is having the ability to control oneself, eating when one should eat, refraining from eating when one should not eat, sleeping when one should sleep, and rising up when one should rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>EXPRESSIONS OF SELF-LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a believer never prays or fasts, this is an expression of self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If he comes to the meeting late and does not open his mouth, this is also an expression of self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some dare not share the same cup with others at the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although they love the Lord, they cannot remember the Lord, because they are fearful of being infected by germs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is also a form of self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am not saying that we should not take care of hygiene.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am saying that it is not right for us to become paranoid about these things through self-love and self-indulgence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When some go to the hospital to preach the gospel, they cover their nose with their hands when they are preaching to the sick.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It would be better for such ones to go home.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord could touch the lepers with His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is man's soul more precious, or is your life more precious?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There was a sister who was sick, and I prayed for her twice.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I knew that the Lord would heal her, and I asked her if she wanted to be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She answered, "When you are sick, others love you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But after you get well, no one loves you anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I realized that this sister just wanted to be loved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many people are sick because they want to be loved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Their sickness is not an outward affliction; it is self-induced.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They impose sickness upon themselves artificially.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once I was sick in a hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The patient lying in the room next to mine groaned quite often.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, the pattern of his groaning followed the sound of footsteps on the stairs.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When there was a noise on the stairs, he began to groan, but when it became quiet, his groaning stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He groaned to win sympathy from others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Such ones are self-lovers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is a shame for believers to seek for sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They love no one but themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many people love themselves; they love their own voice, their own health, and their own money more than the souls of others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord can never use them in His work.</S>
