OF A NEW CONTINENT AND<br />
THE REFORMATION FREEING MAN&rsquo;S MIND</h2>
<p>According to church history, after the church was produced, it gradually became degraded. Eventually, the church entered into the so-called Dark Ages, which lasted ten centuries. During this period of time the Roman Catholic Church was prevalent, and the Bible was locked up. At the end of the fifteenth century Columbus discovered a new continent. At the beginning of the sixteenth century Martin Luther was raised up by the Lord to recover the truth concerning justification by faith. These two great historical events&mdash;the discovery of a new continent and the Reformation led by Martin Luther&mdash;freed the minds of people who were previously under the bondage of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>From that time, science became a powerhouse, and material culture became prevalent. The steamboat, automobile, and airplane were invented one after another. While science and industry were developing, capitalism and socialism emerged. Eventually, the overproduction of goods gave birth to imperialism. On the surface God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, did many things during this period; however, we must realize that the Lord Jesus is above Satan. Satan is merely a &ldquo;colt&rdquo; used by the Lord Jesus to carry out God&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BRITAIN DEFEATING SPAIN</h2>
<p>After Columbus discovered the new continent, Spain became the leading power in the world, possessing the strongest navy. In order to bring the gospel to all the continents, especially to Africa and Asia, God raised up Britain to defeat Spain in a sea battle in 1588. From that time Britain became the leading power in the world. It was called &ldquo;the empire on which the sun never sets.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s purpose in raising up Britain was to limit the power of the Roman Catholic Church, supported by Spain, and to spread the gospel through Protestant missionaries. In the past two hundred years the missionaries who went to Africa and Asia to preach the gospel were mainly from the Protestant Church. We believe that it was God&rsquo;s doing to raise up Britain to maintain order on the earth for two hundred years and to take the gospel all over the world through many Protestant missionaries.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the gospel preached by most of the Protestant missionaries was merely about forgiveness of sins and going to heaven after death. Some missionaries preached a slightly higher gospel about loving the Lord, fearing God, and pleasing God, and they exhorted people to improve their human conduct. However, this is a very shallow gospel. After Martin Luther and in coordination with the political changes on the earth, God raised up Madame Guyon, Andrew Murray, and other inner-life people. These believers knew Christ as life and also had a deeper pursuit of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RISE OF THE UNITED STATES</h2>
<p>In considering the political and religious situations in the world, we must have a panoramic, broad, and high view in order to see God&rsquo;s wondrous doings. For two hundred years God used Britain to bring the gospel to all the nations in the world. After these two hundred years, however, God&rsquo;s work with Britain came to an end. After World War I God&rsquo;s move turned from Britain to the United States. World War I ended after the United States entered the war. World War II was also brought to an end by the United States. The United States played a critical role in both world wars.</p>
<p>After World War I President Wilson of the United States proposed the establishment of an international organization to oversee the relationships between different countries. Eventually, under the leadership of Britain and France, the League of Nations was established in Geneva, Switzerland, but the United States did not join. The League of Nations failed to fulfill its mission, especially in its inability to keep its promise related to China. On September 18, 1931, Japan invaded China and became the first country to violate the charter of the League of Nations. In 1935 Italy invaded Ethiopia, and in 1939 Germany invaded Poland. These three invasions buried the League of Nations and brought in World War II.</p>
<p>During World War II, God used the United States to bring the war to an end. After the war the United States became the leading country in the world. As a result, the United States formed the United Nations in New York City. After World War I the leading power shifted from Britain to the United States. Nearly every nation, such as China, Japan, France, and Britain, has been founded based on its race. The United States is an exception. It is a united country with different races merged together. The United States may be likened to a big melting pot, where white, black, Asian, and other races are melted together.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Age of the One New Man &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
