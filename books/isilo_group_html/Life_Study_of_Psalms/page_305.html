THE GOD-SEEKERS' ATTITUDE TOWARD GOD'S LAW<br>AS GOD'S TESTIMONY AND GOD'S WORD</H2><P>In Psalm 119 many different verbs are used to express the attitude of the God-seekers toward God's law as God's testimony and God's word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Choosing It</H2><P>Psalm 119:30 says, "I have chosen the way of faithfulness; /Your ordinances I have set before me." Verse 173 says, "Let Your hand be ready to help me,/For I have chosen Your precepts." Like the psalmists, we all should choose God's word, making a strong decision in favor of the word of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Believing It</H2><P>Considering God's law to be His word, the psalmist believed in the word. Verse 66 says, "Teach me proper discernment and knowledge,/For I believe in Your commandments." We all must believe in the genuineness, accuracy, authority, and power of God's word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Lifting Up Their Hand unto It</H2><P>"I will lift up my hand to Your commandments, which I love" (v. 48a). To lift up our hand unto God's word is to welcome it. Therefore, to lift up our hand unto the word of God is to indicate that we receive it warmly and gladly and that we say "amen" to it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Loving It</H2><P>Many times the writer of this psalm declared that he loves God's word (vv. 47, 48, 97, 113, 119, 127, 140, 159, 163, 165, 167). We all should be able to testify that we love the word of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Delighting in It</H2><P>The psalmist also delighted in God's word (vv. 16, 24, 35, 47, 70, 77, 92, 174). He enjoyed the word of God and found it a source of delight. Every day we should have a time to delight ourselves in the Word.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_304.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_306.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 305</div><br></body></html>
