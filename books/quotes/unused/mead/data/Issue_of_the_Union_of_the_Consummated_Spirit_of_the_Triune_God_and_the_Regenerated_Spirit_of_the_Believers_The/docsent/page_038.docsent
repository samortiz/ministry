   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Local Churches Are Scattered</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Different Places by Geography, yet They Are Not Divided by Any Doctrine or Matter</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The local churches in the various localities are scattered in different places by geography, yet they are not divided by any doctrine or matter 1 Cor 1:10-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people suggest that the local churches should be autonomous and that the churches should be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, I must say that to be autonomous is the biggest division.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The United States of America has only one federal government, one national defense, one diplomacy, one postal service, one monetary system, and one highway system that connects the whole country.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If each state issued its own currency, the entire United States would have to issue fifty kinds of notes, and the market would be in turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is the same regarding the highways.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The entire country has only one highway system.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the highways in each state could not be connected, then the transportation in the entire country would be choked.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is because of all these onenesses that the United States of America has become so strong and so great.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, some said that although the Bible speaks of the apostles setting up churches and appointing elders, after a church is established and the elders are appointed, the apostles should take their hands off.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the Bible clearly shows us that after Paul established the church in Ephesus, he continued to visit them and wrote letters to that church to care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One time he even stayed there for three years, admonishing them night and day, both publicly and in the homes Acts 20:20, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the way of Paul's last visit to Jerusalem, he even sent people from Miletus to go tens of miles away to ask the elders of the church in Ephesus to come, and he exhorted them to take heed to all the flock, to shepherd the church of God, which was purchased by God's own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He said this because he knew that after he departed wolves would come into their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, after the apostles established the churches and appointed the elders, they did not leave them and cease caring for them; rather, they continued to care for the churches that they had established.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>D. The Unique Church of God Is Expressed</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>as Many Local Churches throughout the Whole Globe, yet They Are Still the Unique Universal Body of Christ and Should Not Be Divided</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>into Sects or Denominations</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the practice of the church, although the unique church of God is expressed as the many local churches throughout the whole globe, the churches are still the unique universal Body of Christ and should not be divided into sects or denominations 1 Cor 10:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>E. There Should Not Be Any Hierarchy</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Religious Organization or System of Rank</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the practice of the church, although there are the apostles who establish the churches, and within each church there are elders who manage the church and deacons who serve the church, besides the order of these holy services, there should not be any hierarchy religious organization or system of rank 1 Cor 9:1-3; 1 Tim 3:1-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Catholic Church today there is a hierarchy of the pope, the cardinals, the archbishops, the bishops, and the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Protestant churches, there is also the system of rank of the pastors and the common believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All these should not exist, and these practices are not scriptural.</S>
