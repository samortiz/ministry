   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Fulfilling the Righteousness of the Law</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we receive the new life, we should realize that the righteousness of the law can be ours without trying to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 8:4 says, "That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since we have received life in the spirit, we do not need to gain the righteousness of the law through keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Do not covet" this is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But not coveting is a righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Judaizers say, "Do not covet," yet they cannot free themselves from covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They say, "Keep the law," yet they cannot keep it Rom 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They do not have any righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can be free from covetousness through the righteousness that comes from the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can gain the righteousness of the law without keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A Christian does not covet because he is walking according to the Spirit, not because there is the law forbidding covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When he walks according to the Spirit, he fulfills the righteous requirement of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the true gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The law is not an end in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The end of the law is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God brings us to righteousness through another avenue; we do not gain righteousness through keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Keeping the law is useless, both before and after salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we were saved, we were justified, not through the law, but through crucifixion with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were saved by the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Having begun by the Spirit, we should continue with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit accomplishes the righteousness within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Galatians 4:9 says, "But now, having come to know God, or rather having been known by God, how is it that you turn again to the weak and poor elements, to which you desire to be enslaved yet again?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Galatians 5:1 says, "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God wants us no longer to be the slaves of the law; He does not want us to be entangled with its yoke again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans 7:4 says, "So then, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ so that you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everyone who has received life has been joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A Christian has died with Christ through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He has also risen with Christ and is now married to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually not only have we received a life, but we have been joined to Christ's life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A saved person is one who is risen from the dead and who is joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we are joined to Him, we are married to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Galatians wanted to go back to their former husband the law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Anyone who tries to turn us back to the law is trying to make us an adulterer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is to be accursed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Romans 7:4b says, "So that you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not refrain from idols just because the law says that we should refrain from them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We refrain from idols because the Holy Spirit is bearing His fruit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have the righteousness of the law, but this righteousness is not produced through keeping the law; it is a fruit of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After we are saved, we can gain the righteousness of the law without keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are not saying that after a man is saved he does not need to keep the law and that he can sin at will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are saved by grace, and the Lord's life is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Spontaneously we will not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Particular Error of the Judaizers</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>concerning the Keeping of Sabbath</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Ten Commandments which Moses instituted speak of keeping the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even today the Jews are still keeping it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church began keeping the Sabbath from the time of Smyrna.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Lapsed Jews who returned from Rome to Smyrna brought the Old Testament law which they held dearly into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After the Roman Catholic Church gained prominence, Judaism became more mixed up with Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For over a thousand years, the church considered the Lord's Day as the Christian Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the last century, Judaizers have reappeared, supporting the keeping of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They have lifted high the Ten Commandments in their chapels and made Saturday their Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They have changed the Jewish Sabbath day into a Christian Sabbath day, making this Sabbath the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But Christians should not keep the Sabbath; we are not obligated by the fourth commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We cannot even make the seventh day the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is not a matter of which day the Sabbath should fall on.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The basic issue is that Christians should not keep a Sabbath at all because they are not under the law.</S>
