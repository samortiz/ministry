   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. No Longer Tolerating the Intermediary Class</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We can no longer tolerate an intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can no longer accept a hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can no longer allow priests to stand between God and His children; we can no longer accept an intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to see what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is the place where every child of God is a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot have one person or a few persons monopolizing spiritual service.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They cannot be the only ones through whom God speaks or the only ones through whom we approach God to settle spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such an intermediary class cannot exist in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our controversy with denominations is not a matter of outward forms but a matter of inward content.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today there is a hierarchy in the denominations one group of people is serving God, while the rest are merely pew members.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One group of people is serving God as a profession, while the rest of the pew members, though equally born to be God's children, need to approach Him through them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This hierarchical practice is tolerated by many organizations in Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But we cannot accept any intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We cannot set aside the grace given to the church in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot forsake it as the Israelites did.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>C. The Intermediary Class Abolished</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Everyone Serves</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to abolish the intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order for us to abolish this class, we all have to become part of it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When all of us become a part of that class, the hierarchy is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How can we make the three groups two groups?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How can we turn three-way traffic into two-way traffic?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can these three God, the priesthood, and the people become two?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no other way except to kneel down before the Lord and say, "Lord, I am willing to serve You.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am willing to be a priest."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When all of God's children become His priests, the three parties will be reduced to two.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hierarchy comes from the world, the flesh, idol worship, and the love of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If all the brothers deny the world and reject idolatry from the beginning, they will all offer themselves up to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They will say, "From this day forward, I will live on earth for the sole purpose of serving God."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then hierarchy will disappear spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If all the brothers realize that their sole occupation is to serve God and if all of them will serve God in coordination, the intermediary class will disappear!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>D. One Needing to Be a Priest As Long As</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One Is a Christian</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I hope you will not allow any intermediary class to come in. Uphold this from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only among the fallen and backslidden ones and among those who walk according to their own way could there be the resurgence of an intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Among those defeated ones, it is natural for some to serve the Lord and some not to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who do not serve the Lord attend to their own affairs, while those who serve the Lord take care of spiritual affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who do not serve the Lord, at most, offer some money to support those who serve.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They may be businessmen, teachers, or doctors, but they all attend to their own affairs and walk their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They do not seem to have anything to do with God's service.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this kind of setting, what does a person need to do to qualify to be a good Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He only needs to set aside a little time every week to attend a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If he has some money, he only needs to offer a small portion of it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But this clearly makes God's people and His priests two classes of people!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today we should realize that either we are not Christians at all or we have to be those who consecrate everything to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as we are Christians, we have to be priests to God.</S>
