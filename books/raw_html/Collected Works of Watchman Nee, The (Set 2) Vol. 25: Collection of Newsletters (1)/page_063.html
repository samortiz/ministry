<H1 CLASS=TITLE>ISSUE NO. 8</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>July 7, 1934</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONDITION OF THE MEETING IN HANGCHOW, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>The Lord is worthy to be praised. He has gradually begun to call His chosen children into His name in Hangchow where the church is in such desolation. On March 19 of last year, we had three brothers and two sisters. We came together in Ch'ing Chun Road to begin to pray that the Lord would establish His table. Then we met every Lord's Day to pray for this matter. In April two more brothers entered into our prayer. Then Brother Chang Kuang Hsiung came from Shanghai to Hangchow for other reasons. He spoke three messages in the meetings. Sister Peace Wang also moved her household to Hangchow for personal reasons and did some work among the sisters. In this way our numbers gradually increased. Because the light which the brothers had received was not the same, we waited until October 22 to begin breaking the bread and remembering the Lord.</P><P>There is one matter which we especially want to thank the Lord for. When Brother Luan Hung Pin received the Lord's call, he boldly and decisively moved out of the Kwang Ch'i Hospital to bear the responsibility for the work. Hangchow desperately needed that type of worker at this time. The Lord's preparation is truly marvelous.</P><P>On December 3, one brother and two sisters were baptized. They were all newly saved. On April 15 of this year, four brothers and three sisters were baptized. Two of the brothers were board members of the Anglican Church. They love the Lord very much and were baptized to obey Him. The rest are all newly saved. Our meeting already has more than twenty brothers and sisters who break bread together. Although many in the denominations do not understand, there are also others who have come to our meetings to see and have said afterward, "The Lord really is with you." We praise the Lord more because of this.</P><P>At the end of May, our meeting place moved from Tao Mao Lane to 321 Tung Chieh Road (at the end of Hua Ts'ang Temple Lane). This building is very big. It can seat five hundred people. But because we are renting it together with the brothers, the meeting only uses a small portion.</P><P>Now we have a perfecting meeting every Lord's Day at 2:00 p.m. We have the table meeting at 4:00 p.m. On Friday evenings at 7:00, we have the prayer meeting. We soon plan to begin a meeting for brothers' fellowship and a gospel meeting on the Lord's Day morning. There are gospel meetings at 30 Chiu Fan Shu every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings at 7:30. These meetings will all gradually witness the Lord's grace. We believe that the Lord has truly begun the work of revival in Hangchow. Honor and authority be to the Father God. Amen!</P><P>Ch'iu Ch'ung Man<br>June 13, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER EXPLAINING<br>THE REASON FOR LEAVING THE DENOMINATIONS</H2><P>(This letter is Hangchow's Mr. Juan Ch'i Yu's answer to Mr. Ch'ien Yi K'ung.)</P><P>Greetings to Brother Yi K'ung:</P><P>I have received your letter. I am very grateful you remembered me.</P><P>Please pay attention to the fact that I have not left the church; I have only left the sectarian denominations. I have not been exhorted to by man but have been directly led by the Holy Spirit. I did not leave the denomination because of some opinion but because of obedience to God's command.</P><P>My main reason for leaving the denomination is that in the denominations the organization is contrary to the command of the Bible. Man has taken over the Lord Jesus' authority. Man's way has taken over the work of the Holy Spirit, so the Holy Spirit cannot operate freely.</P><P>Now in Hangchow, there are brothers meeting in the Lord's name according to the examples in the Bible and in obedience to God's commandments. They do not have the name of Little Flock. This name was added to us by others. We absolutely do not acknowledge it. We absolutely cannot acknowledge it, because the term little flock refers to all the believers from the past to the present and in the future. In other words, Little Flock refers to the true church which includes all the people in the Lord who are in the whole world both Chinese and foreign, both past and present. Therefore, the meeting in Hangchow can only say that it is the brothers in Hangchow meeting in the Lord's name. It does not have the name of Little Flock.</P><P>Since the little flock is the entire church, then the entire church is the little flock. There is only one church on this entire earth. The present so-called churches can only be called a denomination or a mission. Our building at 321 Tung Chieh Road in Hangchow can only be called the place where the brothers in the Lord in Hangchow meet in the Lord's name. Our meeting is completely according to the Bible and follows the leading of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, we do not have any names among us, nor does anyone dare to replace the Lord's holy name with his own name, because the Lord is our everything.</P><P>Mr. Watchman Nee is one of our brothers and a brother in the meeting in Shanghai and one of the workers. He is not the chairman. To say that Mr. Nee is the chairman of the Little Flock is others' common assumption. Not only do we not acknowledge this, but he also does not acknowledge it. There is no chairman among us to lead us to do something. This is because our chairman is the Lord Jesus Himself.</P><P>The church is not a chapel, nor is it a place, a name, or an organization. It cannot be dictated by tenets of faith. It is all the people in the Lord.</P><P>The churches which most people talk about now have given in to the world, so they can only be called denominations. They are not called the church. We have left the denominations because they are hated by God.</P><P>In conclusion, whatever name and organization are not in the Bible, we should not have either. Whatever the Bible commands, we should obey. We cannot avoid criticism. It comes because others have not seen clearly! I will again clarify the little flock as follows:</P><P>The little flock is not an organization of man, nor is it a special name. It is how the Lord Jesus, when He was on the earth, referred to all those on earth who believe in Him and have life. When you compare the number of those who believe that Jesus is the Christ with the number of all the people in the world, it really is a little flock. There are one billion nine hundred million people on the earth. Of this great number, there are only six million (according to a certain Westerner's statistics) who are truly saved. When you compare six million with one billion nine hundred million, is it not a little flock?</P><P>Furthermore, the two words little flock were not created by us, nor did we choose this name. The Lord Jesus called the ones who believed in Him a little flock. I fully believe that the words spoken by our Lord Jesus cannot be wrong. What do you think?</P><P>According to the Bible, a Christian who has received the Lord Jesus as his Savior and is regenerated by the Holy Spirit, no matter where he is or what he does, is a member of the little flock in God's eyes. In other words, whoever is not in the little flock does not have life, because a saved person can never get out of the flock. Please pay attention to the fact that this is not my word. This is a fact that the Lord Jesus has established.</P><P>With regard to our meeting in Hangchow at the present, the hymnal we use temporarily is called the Little Flock Hymnal. You cannot say that because we use this hymnal, it proves that we are the sect of the Little Flock and you are the sect of the Big Flock. Please pay attention to one matter; there is no church aside from the church. In the church there should be no sects. Whoever is sectarian, whether in organization or in concept, is manifesting division. Paul said that sectarianism is out of the flesh. I dare to testify in the Holy Spirit that this is against the Bible and is hated by God. On this earth, there can be differences of nationality and race, but in the church of God, there should not be sects or divisions. Once there are things of the flesh, such as self-exaltation, undisciplined ideas, special names, special fellowship, special tenets of faith, etc., it divides the Lord's Body. We need to know that the Lord Jesus is the Head of the church (Eph. 1:22). The church includes all those believers from all times and all places. We are all members one of another. All the members are in the church. This church is the mystical Body of Christ. On the earth, this church is what the Lord Jesus calls the little flock. The little flock is not worldly people; it is those people whom the Lord Jesus redeemed with His precious blood. Peter, John, Paul, you and I, and all the saved ones on earth right now and in the future are in it. Although this flock is small, it includes all those with life. In conclusion, any Christian with life is already in the little flock. Therefore, we should obey the Bible and do our best to pursue holiness and peace to maintain the oneness given by the Holy Spirit. The life which we live on the earth should glorify the Father. I will not say anymore. I bless you with this.</P><P>Your brother,<br>J'an Ch'i Yu<br>June 20, 1934</P>
