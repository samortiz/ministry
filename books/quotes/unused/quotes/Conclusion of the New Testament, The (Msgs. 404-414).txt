In the foregoing messages, we have considered the experience and enjoyment of Christ in the twenty-one Epistles of the New Testament
In these messages we have seen one hundred eighteen aspects of the riches of Christ, who we may experience and enjoy for His expression
To enjoy Christ is to enjoy the processed Triune God-the processed Father, the processed Son, and the processed Spirit
The Spirit of God was processed through Christ's death and resurrection to consummate in the life-giving Spirit
As we consider these aspects, we will see that Christ as our eternal enjoyment is the embodiment of the processed Triune God
The book of Revelation, as the conclusion, completion, and consummation of the Bible, is 'the revelation of Jesus Christ'
He is marvelous in that He surprises us to the uttermost; He is also mysterious in that we cannot fully understand or comprehend Him
The third section, Revelation 21 and 22, reveals Christ in eternity as the center, centrality, and universality of all things
Throughout the centuries, however, most Christians have not fully realized the meaning of the term the Triune God
In Revelation, not only is the revelation of Christ ultimate; the revelation of the Triune God also is ultimate
At the opening of the other Epistles, only the Father and the Son are mentioned; from Them grace and peace are given to the receivers
In Revelation we see that the first of the Divine Trinity, the Father, is modified by the phrases who is, who was, and who is coming
According to God's economy the Father is the One who is now, who was in the past, and who will be in the future
Also, in God's existence the Spirit of God is one, but in God's economy the Spirit of God is seven in function
At the end of Matthew we see the Trinity described in a simple way as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
The throne of God is not related to His person but to His administration, which is altogether a matter of God's economy
In Revelation we see the administration, the activity, the motion, the move, the act, and the work of the Trinity
In God's essence the Trinity is simply the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, whereas in God's economy the Trinity is complicated
Although Revelation 1:5-7 does not mention the expression the Son of God, it gives us a description of His person and work
From the time of His resurrection Christ became the Firstborn of the dead to be the Head and the beginning of God's new creation
He accomplished redemption in order to make us a priestly kingdom, a composition of priests to His God and Father
There is a man in this universe, who lived on the earth by the name of Jesus and who was and still is the testimony of God
The book of Revelation presents the testimony of Jesus, which is the church as the corporate expression of Christ
In the book of Revelation Christ is revealed to a great extent, and we must experience and enjoy Him to such an extent
Christ is revealed, we experience and enjoy Him and become His testimony, and our testimony becomes His present revelation
In our experience of Christ as a testimony to Him, He is revealed as the all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous, mysterious, and wonderful One
Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, and in Revelation 1:5 we are told that He is the Firstborn of the dead
In God's first creation there was a beginning, and in God's second creation in resurrection there was another beginning
In this message we will continue to consider our experience and enjoyment of Christ as the last of the Divine Trinity
Having passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, He has been enthroned above all kings
In Revelation 1:5 Jesus Christ is described as 'the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth'
The name Jesus implies the incarnation, and the title Christ indicates that the Lord Jesus is God's anointed One
In His ascension and enthronement He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth, for He is now Lord and Head of all
The title the Ruler of the kings of the earth thus refers to His ascension, to His present situation, and to His coming back
His calendar is the universal calendar; Jesus' birth has become the landmark of the calendar of all the peoples on earth
Christ carries out His mission as the Ruler of the kings of the earth by the seven Spirits of God burning before the throne of God
The flame of the seven burning Spirits before the throne of God has sovereignly controlled the world situation
According to Revelation 1:5, Christ, the Son of God, 'loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood'
He loves us and has accomplished redemption for us by shedding His blood, which washes us and cleanses us from all our sins
The Lord shed His blood to redeem us from our sins, cleansing us and releasing us from them so that we no longer have the problem of sins
All the troubles that come to us from our sins were resolved by the Lord's blood, which has released us from them
John, the writer of Revelation, was in this kingdom , and all redeemed and reborn believers also are a part of this kingdom
In saving us through the blood of Jesus, God desires not only to transfer us into His kingdom but also to make us His kingdom
In other words, in God's eyes, we saved ones are not only saved into His kingdom but also constituted to be His kingdom
On the one hand, He is the Spirit of power; on the other hand, He is the reigning Spirit, bringing God's throne into our spirit
The Holy Spirit is the authority-the seven Spirits of God before the throne-and He desires to establish the throne in us
The seven Spirits of God, the sevenfold intensified Spirit, has entered into us with God's throne and is ruling and reigning within us
On one hand, the kingdom of God today is in the church, but on the other hand, the kingdom of God is coming through the overcoming believers
When there is a group of overcomers in the church, these overcomers will bring the authority of heaven, the kingdom of God, to the earth
Only those who receive the training to be under this heavenly authority today will be able to exercise this heavenly authority in the future
If today we learn to be under God's authority, one day we will be enthroned to rule and reign with His beloved Son
We need to know today not only that we are citizens of God's kingdom but also that we are actually being trained to be kings
It will be practiced intensively in the millennial kingdom and will be ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem
In the New Testament, according to Revelation 1:5b-6 and 1 Peter 2:5 and 9, every believer in Christ is a priest
The Hebrew word translated as breath can also be translated as spirit in Proverbs 2027 which says The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah
The Old Testament also reveals that a priest offers the sacrifices, which typify Christ, to God for God's satisfaction
A New Testament priest should be a person who lives Christ in His death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension
In the Old Testament there were items typifying Christ, but they were not Christ in the actuality of His death, resurrection, and ascension
In the New Testament he taught much concerning our human spirit, and he used his spirit to contact God, to receive God
A minister of Christ Jesus to the nations is a ministering, working, and energizing priest of the gospel of God
Our preaching is our priestly service, and we need to make it our daily life and daily work; we need to make it even a part of our being
In the New Jerusalem in eternity, one of the blessings to be received by the redeemed ones is to be priests serving God
The priests who compose the New Jerusalem will undoubtedly have the four characteristics in God's creation of man
At the close of the great tribulation Christ will come on the cloud with power and great glory to be seen by all the tribes of the land
According to the context of Zechariah 12, the tribes are not all the nations of the earth but the twelve tribes in the Holy Land
Although it was the repentant Jews' forefathers who pierced the Lord Jesus, God counts that as something done by these repentant ones
Repentant Israel will wail over Christ as the only Son of God and will cry bitterly over Him as the firstborn Son of God
In the New Testament Christ is revealed first as the only begotten Son of God and then as the firstborn Son of God
According to the New Testament, Christ's being the only begotten Son is for us to be redeemed and to receive eternal life
In their repentance Israel will recognize Christ both as the only begotten Son of God and as the firstborn Son of God
That the Lord is still the Son of Man after His ascension indicates that He has not put off His human nature after resurrection
We believe, however, that according to the pure Word, today our Christ is both the Son of God with divinity and the Son of Man with humanity
According to verse 13, 'One like the Son of Man' is 'in the midst of the lampstands,' which signify the churches
In Exodus 25 the emphasis is on Christ being the lampstand as the divine light, shining as seven lamps with the Spirit
In Zechariah 4 the emphasis is on the Spirit as seven lamps shining, these seven lamps being the seven eyes of God
They should be the stands, even the lampstands, that bear the lamp with the oil and shine in the darkness individually and collectively
They are individual lampstands locally, yet at the same time they are a group, a collection, of lampstands universally
They not only are shining locally but also are bearing universally the same testimony both to the localities and to the universe
They bear the same lamp for the same purpose and are fully identified with one another, not having any individual distinctiveness
The differences among the seven churches recorded in chapters 2 and 3 are all of a negative nature, not a positive one
The churches with Christ as their one center are the focus in the divine administration for the accomplishing of God's eternal purpose
Revelation 4 and 5 unveil the Christ in heaven whereas the first three chapters of Revelation unveil the Christ in the midst of the churches
That Christ is walking in the midst of the lampstands is a sign, indicating that the place in which Christ can walk is the churches
Many of us can testify that before we came into the churches, we knew of Jesus, but we did not see much of Him
When Christ comes to deal with us in the churches, He does so not only in His divinity but also in His humanity
Today the Lord is both in the heavens and on the earth, walking in His humanity in the midst of the local churches
In Matthew 28 the Lord clearly promised that even though He would ascend to heaven, He would still be with the disciples
The Lord's being with His disciples after His ascension is from the time of His ascension until His second coming
The situation of the church over the past two thousand years testifies that the ascended Lord has never left the church
Revelation 1:13 says that Christ, the Son of Man, is 'clothed with a garment reaching to the feet' as a priest
Although the word priest is not mentioned in Revelation 1:13, we know by His garment that Christ is depicted here as the High Priest
Among the three offices of priest, prophet, and king, the most dear, intimate, precious, and lovely office is that of the priest
In God's administration today, Christ is a Priest in the midst of the churches, taking care of them as lampstands for the shining of God
Christ's long robe signifies His splendor in His virtues, which is expressed mainly in and through His humanity
His long robe signifies that He is short of nothing and that this God-man has human virtues that are sufficient to cover His whole being
He is walking in the midst of the churches as the High Priest in a perfect robe to bring the local churches into the priesthood
To be girded at the loins is to be strengthened for work, whereas to be girded about at the breasts signifies care in love
Christ is now exercising a divine care over the churches, moving among them in His humanity and caring for them with His divine strength
Golden indicates that He is divine, bearing the divine administration, whereas the girdle at the breasts indicates love
These seven eyes of His are the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God
When we are arguing with others, especially with our intimate ones, the shining eyes of Christ are upon us, and we cannot go on speaking
His throne is like the fiery flame and its wheels are burning fire, and a fiery stream issues and comes forth from before Him
When He comes to take possession of the earth by exercising judgment over it, even His feet will be like pillars of fire
When He looks at people, He burns them in order to purge away everything that does not correspond to the nature of God
Anything that does not match the nature of God is purged away by this burning fire and is cast into the lake of fire
After all of the judgments by burning, everything in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem is purified
We need the Spirit as the living water flowing in us, but we also need the Spirit as fire shining, searching, judging, and burning in us
Under this exposure, we will see that all that we are, all that we have, and all that we do cannot stand His test
If our walk has been tested in this way, it will be like shining bronze, enlightening others and becoming a kind of shining to them
Since the leading ones are in His hands, there is no need for them to shrink back, to be weak, or to be mistaken
We should not aspire to be one who is merely in the position of an elder; instead, we should desire to be a shining star
It is significant that every one of the seven epistles to the seven churches was written to the messengers of the churches
When the Lord came to speak, He did not speak directly to the churches; rather, He spoke to the messengers of the churches
In Song of Songs 5:16 'His mouth is sweetness itself,' and in the Gospels 'words of grace' proceeded out of His mouth
The Spirit speaks to the churches, and the speaking Spirit today is this Christ who speaks with a two-edged sword
Before the Lord comes back to enlighten the whole world, He is now walking among the local churches, shining over us
In Revelation 1:18 we see that the Lord is 'the living One,' the One who 'became dead' and who is 'living forever and ever'
His living forever is His testimony, for the testimony of Jesus is always related to the matter of being living
If we do not eat any food, we will not be so living, but if we eat nutritious meals, we will be living and even energetic
It was to the church in Smyrna, the suffering church, that the Lord revealed Himself as the One who became dead and lived again
Severe the persecution may be, the church will still be alive, for the resurrection life of Christ within her can endure death
The extent to which the church experiences and enjoys the resurrection life of Christ can be tested only by tribulation
Due to the fall and sin of man, death came in and is now working on earth to gather up all the sinful people into Hades
Such a Christ is walking in the midst of all the local churches in His recovery, taking care of them as the golden lampstands
Luke 422 says that words of grace proceeded out of His mouth but Revelation tells us that a sharp twoedged sword proceeds out of His mouth
In John 1:29 He is introduced as the Lamb of God, but in Revelation 5:5 He is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah
In this sense, Revelation continues the Gospels and the Epistles, but it does not reveal Christ according to the Gospels and the Epistles
In Revelation He is not a small, gentle, kind, patient, silent, and suffering Christ; He is a bold, fierce, rich, burning, and living Christ
If we experience the Christ unveiled in Revelation, we will be in life, enjoy His victory, praise Him, and shout for joy
If we contact the Christ in Revelation, we will not be cold but burning, and we will not be silent but will shout to praise Him
Every local church is a golden lampstand, and the golden lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God as the testimony of Jesus
The high priest in the Old Testament dressed the lamps of the lampstand every morning so that they would continue to shine brightly
When the wick burned out, it became charred and black; hence, the priest had to come to cut off the black part of the wick
Christ in Revelation 2 and 3 is like the priest in the Old Testament coming to the Holy Place to dress the lamps
The first vision of Christ in Revelation, recorded in chapter 1, is that of the High Priest clothed with a priestly garment
To the church Christ is the High Priest; as the ascended One in the heavens, He is now living, working, and ministering as a Priest
It is by this way that a local church is built up more and more until it becomes a golden lampstand in reality
We may realize that the church in our locality is not yet according to the vision in Revelation 1 of a golden lampstand
Our saying 'not yet' indicates that there is hope that the time will come when all the churches will be golden in reality
In Revelation 2 and 3 the most striking point is the speaking of this all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous, mysterious, and wonderful One
Chapters 2 and 3 cover His priestly service in His dealing with the seven churches; they reveal how He ministers the priestly service to us
As the High Priest, He speaks to God to intercede for us, and He speaks to us to minister the priestly service
As we have seen, the oil is actually the flow of the gold, which is the sevenfold Spirit as the divine element
That the Lord spoke of Judaism in such a way indicates that by the time of the church age, Judaism had become satanic
It was neither Pilate nor Herod who sentenced the Son of God to death; rather, the high priest and the Jews called for His death
Our heavenly High Priest cannot tolerate worldliness, which is seen in the case of the church in Pergamos, the church married to the world
We may be proud of being moderate or mild, thinking that it is good to be neither too zealous nor too apathetic
Their church service is neither too hot nor too cold; it is just right for the indifferent audience who attends the service
The heavenly High Priest has kept us in the church, and day and night He has been taking care of everything that concerns us
Christ's priestly service includes His walking in the midst of the churches, by which He gets to know the condition of each church
Today our High Priest in His heavenly ministry is walking among the churches to look into the condition of each one
For every local church to be an embodiment of the Triune God as the lampstand, Christ's heavenly priesthood is needed
By ministering His priesthood to us, He purifies and transforms us, and we become white stones and are built into the temple as pillars
In the Lord's epistles to the seven churches, to overcome is to overcome the degraded situation of the churches
The tree of life is Christ with all the riches of life; to eat of the tree of life is to take in Christ as our life supply
Even the words of the Scriptures should not be considered merely as doctrines to teach our mind but as food to nourish our spirit
Now in His epistles to the seven churches, the Lord came to recover the proper eating of Himself as our food supply
In Greek the word for tree in Revelation 2:7, as in 1 Peter 2:24, means 'wood'; it is not the word usually used for tree
In the church's degradation, religion crept in with its knowledge to distract the believers in Christ from eating Him as the tree of life
The Lord promised to grant the overcomers to eat of Himself as the tree of life in the Paradise of God, as a reward
Because of the church's degradation, the Lord came to call the overcomers to replace the church in the accomplishing of God's economy
The eating of the tree of life not only was God's original intention concerning man but also will be the eternal issue of God's redemption
Eating the tree of life, that is, enjoying Christ as our life supply, should be the primary matter in the church life
There is a kind of exchange: When we give our first love to the Lord Jesus, He will give us to eat of the tree of life
Today the church life is the precursor of this coming paradise; it is the miniature of the New Jerusalem in the coming kingdom
We are enjoying the crucified and resurrected Christ as the tree of life, the food supply in our spirit, as a foretaste today in the church
If we do not give the preeminence to the Lord or enjoy the Lord as the tree of life, the church life may become an unpleasant place to us
To have a foretaste of the fruit of the tree of life is to have an early enjoyment of the blessing of eternal life
If we miss Him as our special portion today in the church life, we will surely lose the enjoyment of Him as a reward in the coming kingdom
They come into the intimacy of God's presence, and here in this divine intimacy they enjoy the hidden manna in the divine nature
It is so inward that those who eat of the hidden manna are actually in the divine nature enjoying the hidden Christ
The open manna was the people's portion, but this offered, hidden manna in the pot before God's testimony was God's portion
While we are enjoying Christ as our manna, we must take the best portion and offer it to God, offering Christ to God
Aaron ministered in the outer court, offering sacrifices on the altar; Melchizedek ministers on the throne of grace in the heavenlies
We need to press deeper to enter into 'the secret place of the Most High' in order to touch the heavenly Christ Himself
We should get away from all persons and distractions to have a personal time with the Lord, in which we can enjoy Him in a hidden way
We can enjoy Christ in a public way with all the saints, but we still need a time apart from everyone to enjoy Christ as the hidden manna
The golden pot is in the Ark, and the Ark is in the Holy of Holies, and the Holy of Holies is joined to our spirit
In the Holy of Holies we enjoy something of Christ that all those who are far off from His presence cannot taste
The hidden manna is that portion of Christ that we enjoy in the presence of God when there is no distance between us and Him
Those who stand on the Lord's side to maintain His testimony will be able to experience Christ as the hidden manna
They will have Christ as their life supply, but the flavor of that supply will be the hidden manna, which others do not know
If we seek fame or position we will have no share in the enjoyment of the overcomers we will not taste touch or experience the hidden manna
When we are beyond all situations, good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant, we are in our spirit touching the Ark and the golden pot
The more worldly the church becomes, the more we need to enter into the Holy of Holies to eat the hidden manna
We must be in His divine nature where there is nothing worldly or distracting and where there is the intimate fellowship between us and God
When we say this to the Lord, we are in the golden pot, in the intimacy of the divine nature, partaking of the hidden Christ
The manna preserved in the golden pot was the center of the tabernacle, God's dwelling place in the Old Testament
The Christ whom we have eaten, digested, and assimilated is the center of our being as a part of the church, God's dwelling place today
The Christ whom we eat as open manna spontaneously becomes hidden manna by being digested and assimilated into our inner being
The open manna, the manna that lay on the ground every morning, was for the enjoyment of God's people in a public way
The amount of manna kept in a pot before Jehovah was one omer, the same as the amount gathered and eaten by the people
If we are right with the Lord day by day and eat Him consistently, we will have much to say about Him in eternity
If we read Numbers 18:26-30, we will see that the tenth part denotes a special portion that was reserved for the priesthood
Spontaneously the manna we eat causes a transformation that transfers us from the general congregation to the priesthood
The contents of the Ark-the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the tablets of the covenant-are arranged in a particular sequence
According to Exodus 16:34, we read that Aaron placed the pot with an omer of manna 'before the Testimony to be kept'
In the words of Romans 8:4, the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in those who walk according to spirit
Because Christ is hidden, those outside the church do not know where we obtain our energy to attend many church meetings week by week
Gods work of building the church depends on our transformation and our transformation issues from the enjoyment of Christ as our life supply
We cannot be built up together in the church life because of our peculiarities, our particular, peculiar traits
In Revelation 2:17 the Lord also said that 'upon the stone' would be 'a new name written, which no one knows except him who receives it'
As we eat the Lord Jesus as the hidden manna, we will have certain experiences and the Lord will write a new name upon us
The Lord's promise of the hidden manna to the overcomer in the church in Pergamos corresponds to the parables in Matthew 13
The Son is in the Father, that the Father is in the Son, and that the Son as the Spirit is the reality of the Holy of Holies
The New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God, and the center of this tabernacle is Christ as the hidden manna for us to eat
We need to ask whether we are a part of the world or a part of the New Jerusalem as God's tabernacle, the universal incorporation
We should not be joined to the world; we should be incorporated into the New Jerusalem by eating Christ as the hidden manna
The way to be incorporated into this unique incorporation is to enjoy Christ, to eat Him, and to partake of Him
When we eat Him, we live by Him in this incorporation, which today is the corporate Body of Christ and which consummates the New Jerusalem
If we do not reign as kings today in Christ's life, we cannot be kings in the coming age to rule over the nations
Our work, our exercise, and our use of the talent given to us by God determine whether or not we will share in the Lord's kingship
We need to be transformed by the extra portion of oil in our vessel , and we need to exercise our gift to gain some profit for the Lord
If we do not mature and exercise our gifts, we will miss the enjoyment of reigning with Christ in the coming kingdom
In the parable of the talents the Lord said to the servant with the five talents, 'Well done, good and faithful slave
The New Testament reveals that Christ, who is signified by the heavenly luminaries, the lights, is the bright morning star
Concerning the types of Christ, the entire Bible begins with Him as the light and ends with Him as the morning star, a luminary
As the Sun of righteousness after the dawning of the day, He will appear publicly to all the people on the earth
The 'Star out of Jacob' and the star appearing at the Lord's birth consummate in the morning star in Revelation 2:28
At the beginning of the New Testament the star was outside of religion , but at the end of the New Testament the star is within the church
When we are in religion, we have the sense of being in darkness, but when the Lord brings us into the churches, we see the bright star
If we take heed to the word of prophecy, the day will dawn within us, and the morning star will arise in our hearts
The seven Spirits of God enable the church to be intensely living, and the seven stars enable her to be intensely shining
Christ has the seven stars, and He has the seven Spirits as the supply to the stars so that the stars can shine
If we have the living word as the morning star rising within us and if we are one with the seven Spirits eventually we will become the stars
We not only have the star shining within us but also become the stars by looking to Christ as the star and by following in the Spirit
It is by the shining that in today's darkness people receive the guidance and are turned from the wrong way to the right way
In the beginning of the New Testament there was only one star in the heavens that led the magi to the place where Christ was
Immediately after Revelation 2216 which says that the Lord Jesus is the morning star the following verse says The Spirit and the bride say
Since many believers are spiritually dead, they will be unaware of the Lord's coming as a thief in His secret appearing to His seekers
The revelation in the New Testament regarding the Lord's second coming is not according to our natural understanding
His coming back will begin from the throne and will pass through a process until He descends to fight the battle at Armageddon
Only those who are matured in life and transformed in their soul will be precious enough for the Lord to steal
We all must ask ourselves if we are precious and if we are worthy of being stolen by Christ in His secret coming
No one knows the time of the beginning of the process of the Lord's coming back and of the rapture of the early overcomers
In Matthew 2440 and 41 the Lord spoke of His secret coming saying At that time two men will be in the field one is taken and one is left
The Lord Jesus was very wise, using two brothers in the field and two sisters grinding at the mill as illustrations
After giving this illustration, the Lord said, 'Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes
In Revelation 3:5 the Lord said to the church in Sardis that 'he who overcomes' will be clothed 'in white garments'
To overcome here is to overcome the deadness of the Protestant churches, that is, to overcome dead Protestantism
To walk in white garments is to have a living that is unspotted by death and that is justified and approved in life by the Lord
We need the living garment to cover us; this living garment is Christ Himself wrought into us by the living Spirit
In Luke 15, when the prodigal son returned home, the first thing the father did was to have the best robe placed upon him
Besides this garment of justification, we need another garment to make us approved and well pleasing to the Lord
According to typology, the queen in Psalm 45 has two garments: one for salvation and the other for her to be with the king in His reign
Christ as our objective righteousness has been put upon us, whereas Christ as our subjective righteousness comes out of us
Christ is our garment for our justification, for our marriage to Christ, and for our covering to enable us to express Christ, not ourselves
We should overcome the dead situation in religion, conquer all kinds of death, and wear a white garment, with no stain of death
When we enter into the Bible and see all the items of Christ's being, we can see that they are for the divine dispensing
To the church in Philadelphia the Lord is also the One who has the key of David the key of the kingdom with authority to open and to shut
We do not see this power until God's chosen people, the children of Israel, entered into the good land and built the temple
Apparently, the temple was built by Solomon; actually, it was built by David, for he was behind the building of the temple
In Genesis 1:26 God made man in His own image that he might express Him and with His dominion that he might represent Him
The image and dominion revealed in Genesis 1 are, at least to some extent, fulfilled in the temple and the city
The overcomers in Philadelphia will be pillars in the temple of God and the temple of God will ultimately be enlarged into the New Jerusalem
Christ, holding the key of David, opens and shuts, not that we might be holy or spiritual but that we might be built up
The all-inclusive Christ, as typified by Eliakim, is the One upon whose shoulder the key of the house of God is set
Because the Father is in the third heaven , to be exalted to the third heaven is to be exalted to God the Father
The children of God as the offspring and the issue are glory in the house of God, and they are also the vessels
The Speaker to the church in Philadelphia holds the key of David to deal with us so that we might be transformed and built up
Although the opposers are trying their best to imprison us, we are released by the key held in the hand of Christ
After we have been released and have entered into the house of God, He becomes the peg holding us off the ground
Christ's writing the name of the New Jerusalem upon us means that we have been transformed into a part of the New Jerusalem
From the beginning of the recovery of the proper church life, Satan, the enemy of God, tried his best to shut the door
No matter how much opposition there is to His recovery, the doors are increasingly open to the recovery, and the key is in His hand
If we invite others to come to the church meetings, we simply need to let them see the love with oneness and harmony that we have
To have the new name of the Lord Jesus means that they are Jesus, because they have His new name written upon them
The overcomer is the possession of Christ, and he is the expression of Christ, who has transformed him with His elements
That the name of the Lord is written upon the overcomer indicates that the person of the Lord has been wrought into the overcomer
If we choose to take the overcoming way, we will experience Christ in a new way, and Christ will become new to us
If we make the decision to be an overcomer in this age, we will have the sense that Christ is exceedingly fresh and new
If we put a label on a brother with his name on it, everyone will know who he is because he bears a certain name
We have the same Jesus, but the defeated believers' taste of Him may not be as good and sweet as that of the overcoming believers
No one can say what the new name of Christ is because it is simply the designation of our new experience of Christ
When we experience Christ in a certain way, that aspect of Christ will become our designation, the new name written upon us
In Revelation 3:14 Christ is revealed as 'the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God'
Whatever God intended to do-including His intention to establish many local churches and to consummate the New Jerusalem-will be done
It is significant that He declares Himself to be the Amen not in the first epistle to the churches in Asia but in the last epistle
For Christ to be the embodiment of God means that He is the portrait of God, and as such, He is the testimony of what God is
Christ being the beginning of the creation of God means that the entire universe as God's creation began from Him
In order to be the overcomers, daily we need to pay the price to buy the gold , the white garments , and the eyesalve
In the Bible our operating working faith is likened to gold and the divine nature of God which is the divinity of Christ is typified by gold
Although this is difficult to explain doctrinally, we know experientially that when we have living faith, we enjoy the divine nature
The church in Laodicea needs this gold-the divine nature applied, appropriated, by the living faith, which is Christ Himself
When we have living faith and participate in the divine nature, this divine nature will eventually come out of us to be our living
We all have been justified and have been covered by the first garment, the best robe put on the prodigal son in Luke 15
Undoubtedly, as children of God, we have been justified, redeemed, saved, and regenerated, and we are members of Christ
If we pray this way to the Lord, He will become our outward covering, the second garment for us to be approved and chosen by Him
When that day comes, He will surely tell us to come with Him to enjoy our portion and to fight with Him against the army of the Antichrist
The eyesalve needed to anoint their eyes must refer to the anointing Spirit , who is also the Lord Himself as the life-giving Spirit
Because she has been distracted by the dead knowledge of letters the degraded recovered church needs this kind of eyesalve for her blindness
Once our eyes have been anointed by the divine, spiritual eyesalve, we will realize that it is worthwhile for us to pay any price for Christ
If we say this to the Lord, the heavens will be opened, the scales will fall from our eyes, and we will see the heavenly vision
With regard to white garments, the color white denotes purity, the absence of mixture, and garments refer to our walk and conduct
When the eyes have an ailment and are unable to see, there is the need to buy eyesalve to cure the eyes and make them bright again
In normal situations the inner nature of a Christian should be pure, and his outward living should be white and bright
In verse 20 the Lord also said that, after He comes in to him who opens the door, He will dine with him and he with Him
Whenever the Israelites had a feast, they ate with God, offering what they were eating to God and letting God eat with them
If we are an overcomer, we will have the special privilege of eating with the Lord when He comes in the kingdom
Eventually, we will be mingled with Him in our constitution as one entity in order to express Him as the New Jerusalem
The Lord's word in Revelation 3:20, regarding enjoying Him as a feast, was spoken to the church in Laodicea, which had become lukewarm
The enjoyment of Christ as a feast will cause us to gain the faith in Christ, the white garments, and the eyesalve
We need to be those who dine, who feast, with the Lord in this age so that we can sit on the throne with the Lord in the kingdom age
God's throne is absolute, but one of His creatures has rebelled and seeks to exalt his throne to be equal with that of God
In his rebellion against God's throne, Satan intended to exalt his throne to the heavens and thereby to intrude upon God's authority
It is not easy for us to realize that a man who could be crucified and buried could be the Lord of the universe
After He was crucified and buried, God resurrected Him and set Him at His right hand, making Him the Lord of all the universe
When we overcome, we will sit with Christ on His throne and have authority to reign with the Lord and rule over the nations
God's intention is to cast Satan down and to redeem many of those taken captive by Satan and bring them to His throne
He will triumphantly declare that His chosen ones, who had been taken captive by Satan, have been brought to the throne
We have been called to be sons of God, and we are destined to be kings, but we need God to work in us and on us to qualify us for kingship
At the beginning of each of the seven epistles recorded in chapters 2 and 3, it is the Lord who speaks to a certain church
It is significant that the Lord is speaking as the Spirit not only to a certain church but to all the churches
The Spirit, as the eyes of the Lord, looks into the situation of all the churches , and He speaks concerning the whole situation
The Lord speaks in the Spirit, through the Spirit, and with the Spirit, because the Lord is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Lord
If we listen to His speaking, we will immediately be under Christ's transfusing and infusing, and we will be immersed into Christ
When the majority of God's people have failed God and cannot meet His need, God calls a small group of overcomers
Overcomers are produced by having an ear that can hear, and the ear to hear is produced through the Spirit's speaking to the churches
Those who have an ear to hear what the Spirit says to the churches should hear, and those who hear will be overcomers
All the churches should listen to the word that the apostles have received of God, which is the teaching of the New Testament
All that Christ is in chapter 1 has been condensed into the all-inclusive Christ and the speaking Spirit in chapter 2
