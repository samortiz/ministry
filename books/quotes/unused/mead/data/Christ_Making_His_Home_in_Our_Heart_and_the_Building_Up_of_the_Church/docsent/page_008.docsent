   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR WHAT IS REGENERATION THAT WHICH IS BORN OF THE SPIRIT BEING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 3:3-8 is a record concerning regeneration: Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He cannot enter a second time into his mother s womb and be born, can he?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born anew.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must pay special attention to verses 3, 5, and 6.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 3 says, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then verse 5 says, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 5 is an explanation of what was said in verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 3 mentions being born anew, and verse 5 explains what is involved in being born anew.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be born anew, to be regenerated, is to be born of water and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When one is born of water and the Spirit, he is regenerated, born again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second half of verse 3 says, He cannot see the kingdom of God, and verse 5 explains that seeing is entering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To see the kingdom of God is to enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In spiritual matters, seeing is equivalent to entering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As soon as you see a certain spiritual matter, you enter into that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To look at it from another perspective, only those who have entered can see.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, to see the kingdom of God is to enter into the kingdom of God, and to enter into the kingdom of God is to see the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 5 explains what is said in verse 3, and verse 6 is a conclusion and summary: That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These three verses are very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every believer must be able to memorize at least these three verses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Until this day, I can still remember what I memorized before I was twenty-nine years old.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While you are still young, learn to memorize the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The younger you are, the easier it is for you to memorize.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You do not have to memorize the Scriptures chapter by chapter; however, you must memorize the important and precious verses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the verses in these messages are very important.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You should memorize all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are willing to take the time and make the effort to memorize them, they will make an eternal impression within you and will become a fountain in you to gush out a rich, inexhaustible supply for the rest of your life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>REGENERATION BEING TO HAVE GOD S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>IN ADDITION TO MAN S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now we will see what regeneration is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regeneration means to be born again, that is, to obtain the life of God in addition to man s life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even if man did not fall, he would still need God s life in addition to his own life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that a person must have two lives: his own human life and God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One life is a created life, and the other is an uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One life is bound by time, and the other life occupies eternity; it is a life that transcends time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man not only needs to be saved; he also needs a second life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today Christianity presents the gospel at a low level.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christianity gives people the impression that they need salvation because they are sinful and destined to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, we need God s salvation because we need God to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not enough for us to have only our human life; we need God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not enough for us to be born once; we need to be born a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This second birth is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>BEING BORN OF WATER AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the record in John 3, initially Nicodemus thought that to be born again was to enter into his mother s womb and be born a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, he could not understand how he could enter into his mother s womb and be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, the Lord Jesus added an explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He told Nicodemus, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God v. 5 . To be born again does not mean that a person is born from his mother s womb a second time; rather, it means that a person is born of water and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What do water and the Spirit refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When I was young, I read many books concerning this matter, and there are many views.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Most of the books said that water denotes the Word and that to be born of water and the Spirit means to be born of the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Others said that water denotes something else.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to carefully consider what it means to be born of water and the Spirit.</S>
