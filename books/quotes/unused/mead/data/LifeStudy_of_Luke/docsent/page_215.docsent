   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Three-one God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God, the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word triune means three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, God is the three-one God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because He is triune, three-one, we should not think that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit can be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to always remember that the Three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, while They are one, They are three at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Ultimate Consummation of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Christ s resurrection the Spirit came as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Son came in incarnation, He came with the Father and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After coming in incarnation, the Son took a further step to go through death and enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the process which we call the Man-Savior s transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By going through this process of transfiguration, the Son, who came in incarnation with the Father and by the Spirit, became the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not think that when the Spirit came He came alone, leaving the Son and the Father on the throne in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No, when the Spirit came He came as the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that when the Spirit came, the Son and Father came with Him also.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit came together as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Elements Brought into the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>through the Man-Savior s Transfiguration</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, when God came through incarnation, something was added to Him the element of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before the incarnation, the Son of God was merely divine; He did not have the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But when He came through incarnation, humanity was added to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way He became a God-man, a Person both divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This God-man experienced human living on earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then He went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have seen that the Man-Savior died as One with a sevenfold status.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His death was the death of the Lamb of God, a serpent in form, a grain of wheat, the last Adam, the Firstborn of all creation, a man in the likeness of the flesh of sin, and the Peacemaker.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because of the Lord s sevenfold status in His death, it was an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After this God-man passed through His all-inclusive death, He entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His resurrection was His transfiguration the transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit to enter into His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This transfiguration included a number of elements: humanity, human living, and Christ s all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All these elements were brought into the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit who became the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just as the incarnation added humanity to God, so the Man-Savior s resurrection brought all these elements into the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some may argue that nothing can be added to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But I would ask you to look at what is portrayed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When God became a man, was not humanity added to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Incarnation was a process that brought God into humanity and added humanity to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In like manner, resurrection as the Man-Savior s transfiguration was also a process that brought the elements of humanity, human living, and the all-inclusive death of the God-man with His sevenfold status into the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
