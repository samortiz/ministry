   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUALIFIED BY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The One who went to the cross to accomplish redemption for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose was not a great worker.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was not an outstanding work that qualified the Lord Jesus to be the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What qualified Him was the life He lived.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We know from the Gospels that Jesus was not a famous person living in a mansion in a large city.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No, He was a man raised in the home of a carpenter from Nazareth, a despised town from the despised district of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the life He lived qualified Him to be the Redeemer for the accomplishment of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is crucial for us to see that the Lord Jesus was qualified by life, not by work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This matter of the priority of life over work is a very important aspect of the Lord s recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord wants to recover a life; He is not seeking to accomplish a work of revival.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A JESUS OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since the Reformation Christians have often prayed for revival.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some have prayed for a great revival to stir up all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But according to history, there has never been such a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, about eighty years ago, there was a revival in Wales.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some Christian leaders were excited and expected that revival to spread to every continent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But it did not spread worldwide.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In fact, after some years, it eventually died out, even in Wales.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1958 I was invited to a certain place in London.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One day my host drove me through the countryside of England and Scotland.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As he was driving, he pointed out the window and said of the people in the Scottish countryside that many of them had never heard of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He went on to tell me that Scotland was much like a heathen country.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, Scotland is not far from Wales, where a great revival had taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that the way of revival does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only one thing works, and that is life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the reason the Lord Jesus did not come to accomplish a great work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, He came to live a life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now His life has been spread to every corner of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is not a Jesus of work; He is a Jesus of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I need to point out to the saints in the Lord s recovery that even many of us, young and old alike, still care for a work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Subconsciously or unconsciously our interest is related to a work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some, for example, may aspire to be great evangelists.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The thought of carrying out a great work may still be in your heart, in your subconsciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I would encourage you to lay aside this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God does not respect any work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Much of the damage among Christians has been the result of human works.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more we try to work for the Lord, the more trouble we shall create and the more damage we shall cause.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I believe this is the reason that Paul, when presenting the confirmation of his ministry, uses the name Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He does not say, The Lord Jesus Christ, King of kings and Lord of lords.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, he speaks simply of Jesus: the putting to death of Jesus, the life of Jesus, and Jesus sake.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The life that was manifested in Paul s body was not the life of a great man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was the life of Jesus, a little-known man from a despised region.</S>
