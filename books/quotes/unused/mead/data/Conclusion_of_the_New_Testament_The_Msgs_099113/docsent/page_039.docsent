   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Keeping the Earth from Being Fully Corrupted</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For us to be the salt of the earth means that we keep the earth from being fully corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that we exercise our influence over the earth created by God to keep it in its original condition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The earth, which was created by God, has become fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a sense, it has become rotten and corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But salt kills germs, eliminates rottenness, and preserves things in their original condition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By nature salt is an element that kills the germs of corruption and eliminates them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, through its killing and preserving function salt brings the earth back to its original condition or keeps it in its original condition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the function of salt is to preserve what God has created.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The entire earth is becoming more and more rotten.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we must exercise our influence over this corrupted earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To the corrupted earth the people of the kingdom of the heavens are the element that keeps the earth from being fully corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They have the salting function of killing germs, eliminating rottenness, and keeping things in their original condition or bringing them back to their God-created condition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord's intention is to bring this earth back to its original condition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although we cannot see this in the present age, we shall see it in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the millennial kingdom comes, the whole earth will be salted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the germs on earth will be utterly killed, and the whole earth will be not only regained by Christ but also brought back to its God-created condition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This work will be done by the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Wherever the kingdom people are, they should exercise a salting influence over those around them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our neighborhoods we should exercise our function of killing germs.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have the nature of the kingdom people revealed in Matthew 5:3-12, we shall be truly salty.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are poor in spirit, mourning, meek, righteous, merciful, and pure in seeking God, we shall have a salting function.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There will be no need to rebuke others or point out their mistakes and shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They will be salted simply by our presence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is what it means to be the salt that kills the germs of this corrupted earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>E. LIGHT OF THE WORLD 1.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>People of the Kingdom of the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Matthew 5:14a the Lord Jesus says, "You are the light of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This light is also the people of the kingdom of the heavens, the overcoming believers living a kingdom life to shine in the darkness of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In nature the kingdom people are the healing salt, and in behavior they are the shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Shining in the Darkness of the World</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Matthew 5:13 the Lord Jesus speaks of the earth and in verse 14, of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For the earth there is the need of salt, but for the world there is the need of light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The darkness is not upon the earth; rather, it is in the world, which denotes human society, a system of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The world, Satan's system, the dark human society, needs light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The light of the world in verse 14 is the shining of a lamp to enlighten those in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To the darkened world, the people of the kingdom of the heavens are such a light effacing its darkness.</S>
