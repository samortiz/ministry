   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Revelation 13:2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"A leopard."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to understand this portion, one must read Daniel 7:3-8 and 2:31-33: 1 The lion is the golden head in chapter two, which refers to Babylon; 2 the bear indicates Medo-Persia and is the silver breast; 3 the leopard is the bronze belly, which is Greece; and 4 the dreadful and terrible beast is the iron legs, which is the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Babylon's army was very fierce in battle; Medo-Persia's army was more fierce and deliberate; Greece's army was most ferocious; and Rome's army was the most cruel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This beast in 13:2 possesses each of these four evil characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is the totality of the power of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The leopard with its spots indicates sin Jer 13:23 ; the Lord Jesus has no blemish or spot.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Revelation speaks of the Lord as a Lamb twenty-eight times, and it speaks of the beast as a wild beast thirty-six times.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God will use this beast to judge men Jer 5:6; Hosea 13:7; Hab 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Leopard" refers to his sinfulness; the bear bites see 2 Kings 2:24, the tearing up of forty-two children ; and the lion devours.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God sealed the mouths of the lions in Daniel 6:22 and delivered Paul out of the lion's mouth in 2 Timothy 4:17.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"The beast" in Revelation 13:2 indicates a kingdom because it has seven heads and ten horns.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We also know this from 17:9-10 and 12.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition, according to Daniel 7, the lion, the bear, and the leopard, all indicate kingdoms.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the fourth beast must also indicate a kingdom, which is the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the same time, this "beast" also indicates a man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Have fallen in 17:8-11 in the original text means to have died violently.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The one who still existed at John's time was the Roman Caesar, Domitian.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The beast is personified in 19:20 and 20:10; he must be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God cannot cast a kingdom into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Slain to death" in 13:3 must refer to a man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The dragon is a counterfeit of God, the beast is a counterfeit of Christ, and the false prophet is a counterfeit of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The counterfeit father also gives authority to the counterfeit son.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This "power" v. 2 is for performing supernatural and deceiving wonders.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 2 Thessalonians 2:9, the phrase "wonders of a lie" does not mean that the wonders are themselves lies; it means that the purpose of performing these wonders is to deceive people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"His throne."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This must mean that he has a kingdom; without a kingdom, there cannot be a throne.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The dragon revives the Roman Empire and delivers it to the false Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Power" speaks of influence, and "authority" is the legitimate power to execute laws.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>D. Revelation 13:3</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"And one of his heads was as it were slain to death, and his death stroke was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And the whole earth marveled after the beast."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Revelation 13:14 tells us that the wound was caused by a sword.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John wrote this book in A.D. 96.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From 17:7-8 we see that "was" means prior to A.D. 96, "is not" means that this one was not on the earth at the time that John wrote this book, and "about to come up out of the abyss and go into perdition" means that this one is going to appear and will go to the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Revelation 17:10 says, "Five have fallen, one is."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This latter one is John's contemporary emperor, Domitian.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"The other has not yet come," that is, he was not yet on the earth at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But he could now be on the earth, though not yet manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the words of 17:11, there are seven souls and seven bodies but eight lives.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"He himself is also the eighth and is out of the seven," one of the previous seven.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>So we can see that this one must have died and been resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The seventh dies; then this one becomes one of the previous six, resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From this we can see that in the future there will be a very powerful one who will rise up to revive the Roman Empire and become the king of the ten kingdoms.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Someone will kill him and, probably after three days, he will rise again, causing people all over the earth to think that he is God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Actually, he is not resurrected; instead, the spirit of one of the previous emperors will enter into his body to resurrect it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This spirit may be that of Nero.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many people do not believe in the resurrection of Christ, but they will believe in the resurrection of Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>E. Revelation 13:4</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"And they worshipped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And who can make war with him?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Antichrist can be such because the dragon is behind him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>People will worship the beast because they will see 1 no personality greater than the beast and 2 no ability comparable to his ability.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>F. Revelation 13:5</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and authority was given to him to act for forty-two months."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"Speaking great things" is to exalt oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"Speaking...blasphemies" is to profane God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The "authority" in this verse is something allowed by God, and there is a limit to it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"Forty- two" equals six times seven.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Seven is a complete number, and six is a number for Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Here Satan is doing something that is neither six nor seven similar to doing something that is neither black nor white .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Numbers, between the exodus from Egypt and the entry into Canaan, there were forty-two stations.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The bears tore up forty-two children in 2 Kings 2:24.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the holy Scriptures, forty-two is the number of wandering and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Second Thessalonians 2:9 through 11 tells us the reason that God allows Satan to do whatever he wishes for forty-two months.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the original text, the word "lie" in 2 Thessalonians 2:11 has the definite article.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is the lie of Genesis 3:4, which suggested 1 that things shall not surely be as God has said and 2 that man shall be like God in wisdom .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God gives the beast the authority John 19:11 .</S>
