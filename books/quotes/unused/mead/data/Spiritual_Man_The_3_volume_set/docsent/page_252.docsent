   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Man's head does more damage to him than his heart!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If believers could differentiate between the renewing of the heart and the renewing of the head, they would not be misled to trust in man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Believers must know that a man can have the most intimate fellowship with God, and at the same time, the mind can unintentionally receive the suggestions of Satan, bringing his conduct, speech, and judgment into error.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Other than the clear teaching of the Bible, no one person's word is entirely dependable.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not live by the words of any one person just because we are close to him or admire and honor him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must realize that even though a person's words and deeds are very holy, his thoughts are not necessarily entirely spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our attention should not be on his words and deeds, but on his mind, his head.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we believe what a worker says to be God's truth based on the words and conduct of the worker, we are making his words and conduct the standard for the truth, and not the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Throughout history, many propagators of heresies were holy believers!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though their heart life was renewed, their head mind was the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, they behaved in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We admit that life is more important than knowledge many times more important but after we have been edified in life, we should not neglect the pursuit of knowledge, that is, the knowledge that proceeds from the renewed mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Believers must realize that both their heart and mind must be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the mind is not renewed, a believer's life will not be balanced; it will be almost impossible to do any work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Most teachings today emphasize a believer's spiritual life the heart how one should love, be patient, humble, etc. These are surely very important, and nothing can substitute for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, we should not think that these are sufficient to make up all the needs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are important, but they do not include everything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is equally important for a believer's mind to be renewed and enlarged and increase in strength so that it becomes strong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Otherwise, we will have an imbalanced life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many people think that a spiritual believer should be one without any perception.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It seems that the more foolish one is, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Besides being a little better than others in his living, he has no other usefulness, and he cannot be entrusted with anything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, we do not want worldly intelligence and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the goal of God's salvation is not that we would continue to use the same mind that was defiled by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God wants our mind to be renewed in the same way that our spirit is renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God wants our mind to be restored to the perfect condition that existed at the time of His creation so that we will not only glorify God in our living, but also with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Countless numbers of God's children have become narrow, obstinate, hard, and even defiled through the negligence of their minds.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The result is that they have come short of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Believers must know that in order for their lives to be full, their minds must be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's kingdom is lacking in workers because the minds of many believers are incapable of bearing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Believers forget that after they are saved, they should still pursue the full renewing of their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This results in their work being hindered.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why the Bible emphatically tells the believers, "Be transformed by the renewing of the mind" Rom 12:2 .</S>
