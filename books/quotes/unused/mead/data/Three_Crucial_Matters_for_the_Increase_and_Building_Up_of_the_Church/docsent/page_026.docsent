   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO USE LIFE LESSONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we go to the home meetings, we should not merely exchange greetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In every meeting we should use the Life Lessons to inject the new ones with life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever we go to a home meeting, we are doctors making house calls to give injections.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have forty-eight different medications, or nutrients, with which we inject the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the meeting we obtain a diagnosis based on their need, and we give them an injection of the nutrients that they are lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If they are lacking vitamin C, we give them vitamin C. After twenty minutes we may give them an injection of vitamin B. Then our time with them will not be a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In every meeting we should inject the new ones with nutrients when we speak with them, pray with them, and pray-read with them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we lead the new ones to read one lesson a week, we can read through all forty-eight lessons in one year.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, because every lesson has many points, we should not read through the lessons quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should give the new ones an injection point by point.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may even need to read one topic two or three times.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we read the lessons quickly, the new ones will not be able to absorb the points.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we take the way of reading the lessons slowly, we may need a year and a half or even two years to read all the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>TWO BASIC STEPS IN PRACTICING THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we announced the change in system in October 1984, we said that even though the vision concerning changing the system is clear and we know how to take this way, this is still a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, this is our first time to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, we are still researching, even though we are practicing the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We first discovered the way to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we discovered the way to have home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These are the two most basic steps in practicing the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church in Taipei is the largest church in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is also the most stable church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It has a history of more than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, during the past ten to twenty years our condition has gradually declined to the extent that we are maintaining the status quo, but we are not spreading or increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our numbers have remained almost the same for ten to twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1961 the church in Taipei had more than twenty thousand information cards.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was the number of brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Of this number four to five thousand people were regularly in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Twenty-three years later, in 1984, the number of people in the church in Taipei had still not increased.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moreover, all the churches in the Lord s recovery seemed to be in the same condition; they were neither increasing nor spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We lacked the increase in numbers and the spread of the church life to new localities.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the reason that we felt the need to change the system in order to break through our condition of not doing business for the Lord Luke 19:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We thank the Lord that during these twenty-three years no corrupt situation was manifested among us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The co-workers and the elders are holding to truth and pursuing life; hence, there is no corruption in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In spite of this the churches are not able to move forward and improve in order to increase in numbers and spread to new localities.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We began the work in Taiwan in 1949, and in six to seven years the number of people in the meetings increased from four or five hundred people to forty or fifty thousand people, and many local churches were established.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regretfully, the increase stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There has not been any increase since 1961.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the churches fell into the condition of maintaining the status quo.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I returned to Taiwan in 1985, I was saddened by the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, I felt that I had not provided a better way; on the other hand, I felt that the saints who have been here for twenty to thirty years could have found a way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though we faithfully preach the gospel to our friends and neighbors, invite people to love feasts, and even rent cars to take them to the meetings, year after year almost no one is gained for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Perhaps many were baptized, but few remained.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, out of ten people who are baptized, less than one would remain in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the number of those in the churches has not increased.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the one hand, I am sorry that I did not provide a way for better results; on the other hand, I am concerned for our future.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What will we do if we do not have a way to go on?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have been in Taiwan for nearly forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We began the work exactly thirty-eight years ago on August 1, 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even though Taiwan is not a large island, only one out of every forty people is a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This ratio is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This proves that we have not preached the gospel with our whole heart and our whole strength.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are indebted to the Lord and to our fellow citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the reason that we were determined to change the system.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We did not have the confidence to change the system two and a half years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we are now confident concerning two things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are confident concerning the effectiveness of door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the past we were unable to bring one person to the Lord in one year, but now we can baptize two people in one evening.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to the experience of the full-time trainees, who are also door-knocking in coordination with the local saints, in two terms they baptized twenty thousand people in Taipei and its suburbs.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Of these twenty thousand people, more than six thousand are in meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>These figures exceed our original calculations.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Initially we estimated that out of ten thousand people who are baptized, two thousand five hundred would remain in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This would be one-fourth of those who are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This estimation is based on the parable of the sower in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this parable the Lord Jesus spoke of four kinds of soil, three of which are not good.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the first kind of soil, which is by the roadside, the seeds that are sown cannot penetrate the soil; instead, Satan comes and takes the seeds away.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the second kind of soil, which is rocky, the seeds spring up and then wither.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the third kind of soil, which is thorny, the seeds are choked and cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The fourth and last kind of soil is the good earth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, we estimated that one-fourth of the people who are baptized will be like the good earth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We also have confidence in the home meetings that are established with the new ones who are gained through door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We asked the trainees to establish home meetings, and they are now busy visiting people and taking care of more than two thousand home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The trainees made a list of their home meetings, which included the names of the new ones, their address, and their district.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Most new ones have at least one meeting in their home a week.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Some new ones have two or more meetings a week.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There are also new ones who only have one meeting a month.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The home meetings do not have a noticeable result; hence, some elders are saying that they have not seen the newly baptized ones.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Even some of the brothers and sisters are complaining because the newly baptized ones are not in the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The saints do not understand what the trainees are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The trainees will bring the new ones to our next corporate meeting, but I am concerned that there will not be enough seating in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then everyone will see what the trainees are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>For example, there is a hall that has almost one hundred people meeting on Lord s Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The same hall also has more than three hundred and seventy new ones in home meetings every week.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If only half of those in the home meetings were to join the meeting on the Lord s Day, that would be an additional one hundred and eighty people.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is good news that should cause us to rejoice.</S>
