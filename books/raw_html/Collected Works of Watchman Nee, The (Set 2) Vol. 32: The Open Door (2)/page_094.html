<h2 class="head2">A Letter from Lai En-shi, Canada</h2><p>Dear sisters in the Lord:</p><p>This short letter is to tell you of my continual prayer for and remembrance of you. I have always thought of you before the throne of grace. I know of your joy in the Lord and that you consider the Lord your life and your fortress. In the morning I read 1 Chronicles 26:27, which says, "Out of the spoils won in battles...." Ephesians 4:8 says, "He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men." Verse 10 says, "That He might fill all things," which can also be translated, "that He might fill the universe." From David's battle in 1 Chronicles 18, we can see what the spoils were and how they were used for God's house (vv. 8, 10-11). David reigned this way. One who is greater than David is now with you. May you find greater spoils from the battles in your daily life, and may you find more treasures in Christ. The servants in the house cannot satisfy His heart, only the sons and daughters can satisfy Him and inherit the possessions (Rev. 21:7).</p><p>A friend, who is a child of God, would like to offer this little gift through God's love to those among you who are in tribulation and need. Greetings to all the dear ones. May the Lord become your life, and may He overshadow you all day long. Please mention me before the brothers in the Lord, for they are all in my prayers and in my heart. While I am alive, I still open my window to the land I love&mdash;China. But I wait on God to release me back to you. Please pray for me so that I will know His will and not walk ahead of Him nor fall behind His purpose and His will.</p><p>Lai En-shi, Vancouver, Canada, February 4</p><h2 class="head1">MISCELLANEOUS NEWS</h2><p>(1) From Brother Watchman Nee's letter to his family we know that he was still in England before Easter.
