<h2 class="head1">THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LIVING GOD<br />
AND THE GOD OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>There is a distinction between the living God and the God of resurrection. Before passing through death and resurrection, God was merely the living God; the human element was not in Him. At that time, man was on the earth, and God was in the heavens. After God passed through death and resurrected from death, something mysterious happened: God and man were fully mingled as one. Incarnation was a mingling of God and man, but it was God entering into man. Through incarnation there was a man on earth in whom was God. Incarnation brought God into man.</p>
<p>Through His resurrection from death, the Lord brought man into God. Since the time of the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection, there has been a man in heaven, and this man is God. After His resurrection the Lord said to His disciples, &ldquo;A spirit does not have flesh and bones as you behold Me having&rdquo; (Luke 24:39). This proves that He is still a man in resurrection. By ascending to the heavens after His resurrection, the Lord brought man into God.</p>
<p>The living God does not possess human nature, but the God of resurrection possesses human nature. The living God possesses only the divine element, whereas the God of resurrection possesses both the divine element and the human element. God is the God of resurrection not only because He was tested and overcame death but also because the human element has been added to Him; hence, He now possesses both the element of God and the element of man. In the God of resurrection, God and man have been fully mingled. God is in man, and man is in God. The two have been fully mingled as one.</p>
<p>The living God lives in the heavens and in man&rsquo;s environment. The God of resurrection took a further step in order to live in man. In ancient times, God performed various signs and wonders for the Israelites, but they experienced Him only as the living God. Today Christians have the living God within them so that they can experience Him as the God of resurrection. Many Christians are content with God doing things for them in their environment and experiencing Him as the living God. They do not know that in His salvation, God dwells in His people in order for them to experience Him as the God of resurrection. Not only does He do things in our environment in order to solve our problems; He also lives in us so that we may live one life with Him in order to overcome death and its factors.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE GOD OF RESURRECTION<br />
TO BECOME LIVING PERSONS</h2>
<p>God does not want to be the God of resurrection in Himself alone; He wants to live in man as resurrection. He wants to be mingled with man. Every genuine and living Christian must know God not only as the living God in the heavens and in his environment but also as the God of resurrection who lives in him. A Christian who does not know and experience the God of resurrection living in him is a dead Christian. Many people know that God is a living God, but they only know that He lives in the heavens and operates in their environment, not that He is in them as resurrection. A genuine Christian not only needs to know God as the living God but also needs to advance to experience God as resurrection. This is to be a Christian in the New Testament age. People in the Old Testament age merely knew that God lived outside of them in their environment and that He did things for them. In the New Testament age God is resurrection in us.</p>
<p>If God is resurrection in us, we will not fall asleep in the meetings. If God is resurrection in us, we will have the boldness to open our mouths to pray and the power to give testimonies in the meetings. Regrettably, until now many saints know God only as a person who is outside of them. They pray and ask God to keep them, but they do not know that God is resurrection in them. When we let God live in us as resurrection, we will be living within, both in our daily life and service. Our prayers and our testimonies will also be living. Not only so, even those who hear us and contact us will become living.</p>
<p>When the resurrected living God enters into man, He makes man a living person. Concerning God, the Bible says, &ldquo;He is not the God of the dead, but of the living&rdquo; (Mark 12:27; Luke 20:38). God is the God of resurrection. He hates not only unrighteousness and evil but also death. Many believers think that it is sufficient to be well behaved, law-abiding, faultless, and God-fearing. They do not know that it is not enough to be a faultless Christian; they do not know that God wants living Christians who experience Him as the God of resurrection and who live Him out. Although they might not commit any crimes or make mistakes, they are still dead. God hates every form of death; death is abominable to God. The Old Testament indicates that all dead things are unclean (Lev. 11:8, 11, 24, 27, 31-40). This shows how much God hates death and how abominable death is in His eyes.</p>
<p>God wants us not merely to be faultless Christians but to be living Christians. We may not express the flesh, but if we express death, God cannot accept us. Our God condemns not only unrighteousness and unholiness but also death, because He is not only the righteous God and the holy God but also the living God and the God of resurrection. Even though the church in Sardis had done no wrong, the Lord still condemned her. Revelation 3:1 says, &ldquo;These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead.&rdquo; In this verse the Lord seems to be saying, &ldquo;You should know that I am living because I have the seven Spirits; I am the Lord who is full of life.&rdquo; Being a Christian is not a matter of studying what is right or wrong but of being living. As long as we are living, everything is right.</p>
<p>God wants us to be living, which is different from what the world refers to as being lively. To be lively is an outward condition and can be compared to a performance on stage. To be living is to express the divine life by touching and experiencing the God of resurrection. God is not only the living God but also the God of resurrection. When we touch Him, we become living. Even if we are dead, as long as we are willing to touch the God of resurrection, we will immediately become living. The more we touch things that are related only to ourselves, the more death we have, but once we touch the living God, we will be living. If we contact the God of resurrection a few times during our day, we will be living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING TO THE GOD OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>When we pray, we need to first stop ourselves. A brother can come to God in prayer without stopping himself. As a result, he will not touch God; instead, he will stay in himself. The issue of such prayer is deadness. We do not pray in order to ask for things. We pray in order to touch the God of resurrection and in order to let Him touch us. We can pray to the God of resurrection when we stop ourselves in order for us to touch Him and let Him touch us.</p>
<p>The basic principle of prayer is to stop ourselves in order to touch God and to let God touch us. Then He can be resurrection in us, and we can live out His resurrection life. As a result, we will be living.</p>
<p>Being a faultless Christian is not enough. A person must be a living Christian because God is not the God of the dead but of the living. He will judge not only sin, the world, and Satan but also death. We must let the God of resurrection live in us daily so that we may be living because of Him. As Christians, our God is not only a living God but also the God of resurrection, who is in us to enable us to be living Christians.</p>
