2) The law in the economy of God is to be used by God for exposing the sinful nature and evil deeds of the sinners
4) The issue of the experience of grace in the economy of God is the organic Body of Christ, consummating in the New Jerusalem
He likened himself, as one who delighted in the law, to a tree growing beside streams of water and flourishing all the time
The one who enjoyed the law as the streams of water by which he grew became a kind of exile due to the rebellion of his son
Paul pointed out that the law was something added to the central line of the divine revelation to expose mans sinful nature and wicked deeds
We need this view of the law in order to understand the Psalms according to the divine concept in the New Testament
The book of Psalms is composed of the expressions of the sentiments, feelings, impressions, and experiences of godly men
3)The house of God, the temple, and Mount Zion on which the temple was seated, as the center of God's dwelling place on the earth
6Their love toward God their fellowship with God their blessings received of God their sufferings under Gods dealing and their environment
Eventually, the psalmists turned from enjoying the law in which they delighted to enjoying their God whom they loved and sought after
The traditions of their holy race formed their human concept according to which many of the psalms were written
He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity , but He needed to be begotten again in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God
David was saying that the one who delights in the law and meditates in the law will be blessed and will prosper in everything he does
He will prosper because He will gain the whole earth as His possession, and He will gain all the nations as His inheritance
The human concept of the holy writers uplifts the law as their central emphasis to treasure the law and remain in it for their whole life
One tone is uttered according to the human concept, and the other tone is uttered according to the divine concept
No doubt, these holy writers were wrong in their understanding according to their human concept, but they were still godly men
Because they were so intimate, so close, and even so one with God, while they were speaking, God came in to speak in their speaking
The day will come when the entire earth will be excellent because the Lord's name will eventually be excellent in all the earth
According to God's divine concept, the central thought in the five books of the Psalms is Christ and the church
Book 1 indicates that God's intention is to turn the seeking saints from the law to Christ that they may enjoy the house of God the church
In Psalm 1 the psalmist appreciated the law to the uttermost, but in Psalm 27 he no longer appreciated the law
Book 2 indicates that the saints experience God and His house and city through the suffering, exalted, and reigning Christ
After reading these commandments, a number of Christians would say that they cannot make it since they break the commandments all the time
When Moses, the one who wrote the Ten Commandments, became old, he declared, 'O God, You are our dwelling place for eternity
If we do not see this, our understanding will be natural, and the Psalms will be understood by us according to the human concept
In this message we want to see the truth concerning Christ in God's economy versus the law in man's appreciation
We need to see the truth concerning the law in its position, its nature, its content, its function, and its weakness
We need to fight the battle against the wrong teachings concerning the law which are not in the light of God's New Testament economy
In Romans and in Galatians, Paul stressed that no flesh, no fallen human being, can be justified before God by the works of the law
In Romans 7 Paul told us that the law, instead of giving us life, becomes the killing instrument by which sin deceives and kills us
The first thing we need to see concerning the position of the law is that the law entered in alongside the main line of God's economy
The principle we need to see concerning the law is this Paul in Romans 5:20a told us that the law entered in alongside
God created man in His own image and after His own likeness with the intention that man could take in God, live God, and express God
In order to continue His purpose with man after man's fall, God added something to the main line of His economy
Paul indicated that Sarah signifies the new covenant of grace, and he pointed out that Hagar symbolizes the old covenant of the law
The writer of Psalm 1 uplifted the law according to the human concept, which is contradicting to the main line of God's economy
In verses 147-148, the psalmist said that he anticipated the morning dawn that he might meditate in the Lord's word
The fourth commandment requires man to have satisfaction and rest only in God and all that God has accomplished for man
God worked for six days and the seventh day was the day of rest the Sabbath for man to enjoy God and Gods work as his rest and satisfaction
The fifth commandment requires man to honor his parents that man might trace back to man's source God who created man
If we trace our genealogy back to the beginning of creation, we come to the first pair of parents, Adam and Eve
We should have a heart to honor our parents, but quite often, we fallen people do not honor our parents as we should
The sixth through the tenth commandments require man to live out the virtues that express God according to God's attributes
He had the attitude that the foreigners who came to China did many things wrong, but he did not do anything wrong
Even as you are reading this message, perhaps there is something in your heart right now which is violating the law
Paul told us in Galatians that before Christ came, God gave His chosen people the law as a guardian to guard them
By being exposed by the law, subdued by the law, and convinced by the law, God's chosen people would go through the law to Christ
Regardless of how good, how holy, how righteous, and how spiritual the law is, the law cannot impart life to us
Psalm 1, which is concerning the law in man's appreciation, is for the personal benefit of the saints, such as being blessed in prosperity
We need to compare this to Christ's attainments concerning the accomplishment of the economy of God in Psalm 2
Psalm 1 is for the personal benefit of the saints, and Psalm 2 is for the accomplishment of the economy of God
That is poor because Christ is separated from us, and, in a sense, we are competing with Him, since He is a tree and we also are a tree
Eventually, he was instructed, in the sanctuary of God, to take only God Himself as his portion, not anything other than God
Eventually he declared that he had no one in the heavens nor anyone on this earth except God, his eternal portion
If someone who loves the Lord is suffering, his suffering is not basically a matter of his being right or wrong
A brother may wonder why his wife is not as nice as other wives, and a sister may wonder why her husband is so incapable
The Lord's teaching in the New Testament says, 'Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness'
In the previous message, we saw the truth concerning the law in its position, its nature, its content, its function, and its weakness
If we take this position when we read Psalm 1 we will receive the Spirit we will see the secret and we will also see the spirit of the Bible
James told him, 'You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed; and all are zealous for the law'
We may say that our spirit is for Christ, but in practice we live according to the law, according to what is right and wrong, good and evil
If we meditate on Christ for a short time, we think this is wonderful, but David meditated in the law day and night
Mount Sinai was the place where the law was given, and Mount Zion is the place where Christ is today in the heavens in His ascension
Mount Sinai produces children of slavery, but our mother, the Jerusalem above, is in the heavens, at Mount Zion
Revelation 14:1 tells us that there are a hundred and forty-four thousand standing with the Lamb on Mount Zion
God is embodied in Christ, Christ is in His Body, and His Body is God's house and God's city for God's kingdom
The central thought of the book of Psalms is Christ and the church as the house of God and the city of God for His kingdom
We need to see the revelation concerning Christ in God's economy versus the law in man's appreciation in the Psalms
Christ was the only begotten Son of God in His divinity , but when He became incarnated, He put humanity upon Him
By resurrection Christ brought His humanity into the divine sonship and was designated the Son of God with His humanity
We believers in Christ are regenerated sons of God, having God's life and God's nature, but we also have our human nature
In Psalm 2 we can see God's economy with God's kingdom and the resurrection of Christ, in which He was begotten to be God's firstborn Son
When Christ was born as the firstborn Son of God, we were all born with Him to be His many brothers, the many sons of God
Christ's resurrection was a big delivery, a big birth, of Himself as the firstborn Son of God with His many brothers, the many sons of God
According to Psalm 2:8, Christ has been given the nations as His inheritance and the limits of the earth as His possession for His kingdom
When the Lord came back to the disciples in His resurrection, He told them, 'All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth'
We may wonder where Christ's death is spoken of in Psalm 2, but we need to realize that Christ's resurrection implies His death
In Psalm 2 we see His being anointed in His divinity and humanity, His death, His resurrection, and His ascension with His enthronement
The Bible tells us clearly that Christ is waiting for the opportunity to come to execute His judgment in His anger, in His wrath
The police station will transfer them to the law court, where they will be judged and ruled according to the law of man
Joel reveals that after the three and a half years of the great tribulation, the Lord will judge the living Gentiles
In the last chapter of John, chapter twenty-one, the very Christ who is our refuge came back to Peter to restore Peter's love toward Him
Peter failed utterly in denying the Lord three times , so the Lord came back to ask him three times 'Do you love Me'?
Psalm 2 is concerning the accomplishment of the economy of God, whereas Psalm 1 is concerning the personal benefit of the saints
Far, we have covered Psalm 1 concerning the law in man's appreciation and Psalm 2 concerning Christ in God's economy
It is interesting to see that right after Psalms 1 and 2, there are five psalms which show us David's concepts concerning a godly life
David committed intentional murder, using his power and authority as a king to carry out his conspiracy to kill Uriah, one of his fighters
It is difficult to believe that about three years later, he wrote Psalms 3 7, which are full of the human concept
After David committed murder and fornication, God disciplined him by allowing there to be trouble among his children
To be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts
There is no point indicating much fellowship with God, touching God or being touched by God, and being humble and contrite in spirit
David's concepts of such a godly life in Psalms 3 7 are in comparison with His inspired praise of the excellency of Christ in Psalm 8
In his great sin, however, he broke all the last five commandments, which require men to have virtues expressing God's divine attributes
The law is good in its nature but the law cannot give us life it cannot impart the very dynamic power life power organic power into us
David appreciated the law in Psalm 1, but he committed murder, fornication, stealing, lying, and coveting against the law
In these psalms David asked God to deal with his adversaries and be a shield around him, his glory and the One who lifted up his head
When he was fleeing from his son, he still asked God to vindicate him of his righteousness, but where was his righteousness?
In considering Psalm 4, we need to remember that this was a psalm written by David at the time when he was fleeing
We all need God's mercy to see our failures, our sinfulness, and our filthiness, to even roll on the floor in confession of our sins
In Psalm 4 David even admonished others not to sin in anger but to consider in their heart upon their bed and be silent
How could such a sinful person pray this way to God at the time when he was fleeing from a situation of rebellion caused by his sinfulness?
David said that he came into God's house in the abundance of His lovingkindness and worshipped toward God's holy temple in fear of Him
He asked God to lead him in His righteousness and make his ways straight on account of those who lay in wait for him
In God's chastisement, David asked God to be gracious to him, to heal him, return to him, and save him for the sake of His lovingkindness
He said that he was wearied with his groaning, causing his bed to swim all night long, dissolving his couch with his tears
David believed that Jehovah had heard the sound of his weeping and that all his enemies would be ashamed and greatly dismayed
David asked God to establish the righteous man and believed that his shield was with God who as a righteous Judge saves the upright in heart
David gave thanks to Jehovah according to His righteousness and sang praise to the name of Jehovah the Most High
These psalms encourage, strengthen, and confirm the readers in asking God to take care of them and their interest
Psalms 3 7 reveal David's concepts concerning a godly life, whereas Psalm 8 is his inspired praise of the excellency of Christ
If we read Psalms 3 7 with much prayer, we can realize that they all are on the same level and in the same category
In verse 1 David said, 'O Jehovah our Lord,/ How excellent is Your name/In all the earth,/You who have set Your splendor above the heavens'!
We need to realize that this psalm tries the best to link the earth to the heavens and to bring down the heavens to the earth
Adversaries are those who are within, enemies are those who are without, and the avengers are those who run back and forth
In between the heavens and the earth, there are the adversaries within, the enemy without, and the avenger running back and forth
He also said, 'Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens'
If we consider that we are people with a high degree or status that we have a doctors degree that we are seniors we are not in the kingdom
The psalmist means that we, the children of God, all are babes and sucklings, yet God could cause us to praise Him
Some praises may come out of our mouth, but they cannot be considered as perfected praises, because they are not so full of strength
The scholars who translated the Old Testament into Greek for the Septuagint did have some kind of spiritual knowledge
God can work in His redemption to such an extent that the weakest ones and the smallest ones can have the strength to praise Him
In the Lord's quotation in Matthew 21:16, it says that He has 'perfected' praise out of the mouths of the babes and sucklings
Now that we have read through Psalm 8 in an interpretive way, let us consider in more detail the major points in this psalm
Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings the Lord has established strength because of His adversaries, to stop the enemy and the avenger
We may not be old in our physical age, but in our Christian experience we may be like tired and fatigued old folks
When we were in Elden Hall in Los Angeles, a certain brother was shouting praises to the Lord while he was driving to a meeting
The weakest among men being perfected to praise the Lord indicates the highest consummation of the Lord's work in His redemption
The Lord establishes strength, perfects praise, out of our mouths because of His adversaries , for the stopping of the enemy and the avenger
These three portions of the Word show us that man has been in three stages created in Genesis 1 fallen in Psalm 8 and redeemed in Hebrews 2
Man is the central object of God in His creation for the accomplishment of His economy to fulfill His heart's desire
Psalm 8:9 repeats the first part of verse 1 by saying, 'O Jehovah our Lord,/How excellent is Your name/In all the earth'
Now the earth is not a messy earth but an excellent earth because the excellency of the name of Christ fills all the earth
Today with us, the earth is joined to the heavens, the heavens are brought down to the earth, and the two are one
With the unbelieving ones and with the defeated Christians, the heavens are far away and the earth is dark and messy
In Psalms 3 7 David thought the earth was messy and full of problems, but in the Lord's view, His name is excellent on this earth
In addition to the earth, the heavens, man, and the coming kingdom, there are the adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger
Because of the adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger, God makes the babes and sucklings to praise Him in a complete way
The sucklings are even younger than the babes, the infants, because they are still feeding on their mother's milk
We also have to realize that for the Lord to regenerate us, He had to undergo a number of procedures, or processes
God visited man through the long journey of His process to become the life-giving Spirit to reach us and to enter into us
We should go on to praise Him for His human living, for His death, for His resurrection, for His ascension, and for His kingdom
While we are here being stopped from all of our doings to praise the Lord, the adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger are all defeated
The revelation goes up to Psalm 16, where we see Christ as the God-man in His human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
In Psalm 23 the resurrected Christ becomes our Shepherd , and this shepherding One in Psalm 24 becomes our King
We have seen that David exalted the law so highly, but by his failure regarding Uriah, he broke the last five commandments
He murdered, he committed adultery, he stole by robbing another of his wife, he lied to Uriah, and he coveted Uriah's wife
If there were no killing fornication stealing lying or coveting in the human race the kingdom of the heavens would really be on this earth
In addition to the enemies surrounding David, he had the adversaries from within, even from his house, from his family
It is hard to find another portion in the Bible which presents us a complete picture of man's condition as in these psalms
David's concept in these psalms is according to the law given by God alongside the central line of His economy
Davids concept in these psalms is also based upon the principle of good and evil the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
In the New Testament, we are told that Christ is the King, even the Ruler of all the kings , sitting on the throne not to judge but to save
If God remembers the slain, David should not have forgotten Uriah, the one slain by him according to his conspiracy
David advised others to put their trust in God, sing psalms to Him, declare His deeds among the peoples, and exult in God's salvation
David also said that the needy will not always be forgotten by God, nor will the hope of the afflicted perish forever
David asked God to look on his affliction and not let mortal man prevail, but let the nations know that they are mortal
One thousand years later, when Matthew wrote the genealogy of Christ, he said, 'David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah'
David, a man after the heart of God , did right in the eyes of the Lord all the days of his life except for this one evil
In Psalm 11 David said that God is in His holy temple, His throne is in heaven, and His eyes discern the righteous man and the wicked man
Verse 6 says that Jehovah 'will rain down snares upon the wicked;/Fire and brimstone and a scorching wind will be the portion of their cup'
In Psalm 14 we see David's concept concerning God's dealing with the corrupt fool and His salvation to His people
Every day and even every moment, we can come to approach this throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help
We see the human concept of being blessed by the keeping of the law versus the divine concept of being blessed by taking refuge in the Son
No doubt, Psalms 15 and 16 were arranged together to show us a comparison between the keeping of the law and the participating in the Son
He does not slander with his tongue;/He does not do evil to his friend,/Nor does he take up reproach upon his neighbor
When the Lord Jesus was a man on this earth, He always held such an attitude of recognizing God the Father as His Lord
His attitude toward the Father could have been expressed by His saying, 'I do not have anything beyond You which is good
He did not delight in the commandments of the law, but in the members of His Body, the saints in God's kingdom
The inheritance refers to the substance of the lot, and the cup refers to the enjoyment of God as our blessing
In Genesis 2 the earth was a pleasant garden, but after the fall of man, this pleasant garden became a messy earth
All the nations with the earth will be not only pleasant but also beautiful to Christ as the man who inherited God's inheritance
Where good is, evil is there; where good and evil are, knowledge is there; and where knowledge is, death is there
The one end for the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the lake of fire, and the other end for the tree of life is the New Jerusalem
The lake is full of burning fire, but the holy city is full of water, flowing and quenching and watering and saturating
If you are of the source of good and evil and are always going along in the line of good and evil, you will arrive at the lake of fire
Teachers of philosophy and those of many religions would all say that if there is a God only a good man not an evil man could dwell with Him
Thank the Lord in the Bible which is His divine revelation we have a pair of psalms Psalms 15 and 16 to show us what kind of man God wants
In Psalm 15, David's concept was according to the law given by God at Sinai alongside the central line of God's economy
According to Galatians 4, Sinai symbolizes a source that produced slaves, who are rejected by the grace of God
If He had not been incarnated and did not have the human nature with a human body, He could not have lived on earth
When Jesus was born, divinity was brought into humanity, and divinity and humanity were mingled together to produce a God-man
Christ in His human living had nothing to do with other gods and their offerings, nor did He take up their names upon His lips
Christ blessed God who counseled Him and was instructed by His inward parts in the nights through His contact with God
In John 8:29 the Lord said that while He was on this earth, He was never alone, because God the Father was always with Him
In the meetings their spirit is not exercised, their mouth is not exercised, and their tongue is not exercised
In His incarnation Christ brought divinity into humanity; in His resurrection He brought humanity into divinity
In His resurrection He brought His human part into divinity to be begotten of God that He could be the firstborn Son of God
In Christ's resurrection the believers were regenerated to be the many sons of God and the many brothers of Christ
When Christ in His humanity was begotten of God to be God's firstborn Son, all His believers were also begotten of God to be God's many sons
As sons of God, we need to realize that divinity was brought into our humanity and now our humanity is being brought into Christ's divinity
Such a man is not a good man according to the law, but a God-man according to God Himself as the life and life supply
The history begins in Psalm 1 with a man appreciating the law treasuring the keeping of the law and highly appraising the keeper of the law
Even in the genealogy of Christ, Matthew 1:6 says, 'David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah'
There is no hint or indication that he was humbled, that he was full of self-denial, or that he was self-condemned
He was on the test during Absalom's rebellion, and the testing did not bring out anything positive in these psalms
Psalm 15 speaks of David's concept of a perfect man according to the law being able to dwell with God for God's heart's desire
In Psalm 16, there is the divine revelation that the only one who can dwell with God for God's heart's desire is the God-man, Christ
The book of Psalms, composed of one hundred fifty psalms, is the longest book among the sixty-six books of the Bible
A husband and a wife may speak to each other in a way that is full of mistakes, but their talk to each other can still be very sweet
In order to see the two lines of the Bible, we need to go back to the very beginning of the divine revelation at the creation of man
The book of Genesis reveals that God created man in His image so that He could have a vessel to contain Him for His expression
After you have a wife, you will produce children, and you have to listen to Me so that you can pick up the best way to raise them'
After God created man in His own image and after His own likeness, He did not tell man what to do and what not to do
If there is much complaining, arguing, debating, gossiping, and reasoning among us, the church life cannot be carried out
God warned Adam not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, telling Adam that if he ate of it, he would surely die
The line of the tree of life runs through the entire Bible from Genesis to reach the last chapter of the book of Revelation
Along with the main line of the tree of life, there is another line, the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
If there were only one tree, the tree of life, Adam would not have been able to fall even if he had wanted to fall
Without Satan, the excellency, the majesty, the wisdom, and the marvelous, wonderful points of God could never be exhibited
About six thousand years have passed since the time of Adam, and the entire world today is taking the way of the knowledge of good and evil
Families, societies, and nations of the world are formed not by the way of life but by the way of the knowledge of good and evil
Much of the time, however, instead of living by the way of life, we live by the way of the knowledge of good and evil
Even Christianity and many other religions have fallen into the same 'cage' of the way of the knowledge of good and evil
The first one, Cain, chose the way of the knowledge of good and evil, and the second one, Abel, chose the way of life
We need to ask whether David's righteousness as an offering to God is from the crop, as from Cain, or from the flock, as from Abel
David's prayer, thanksgiving, and praise in Psalms 1, 3 7, and 9 15 may be good, but they are of the knowledge of good and evil
It is possible to pray to God, love God, praise God, and work for God according to the line of the knowledge of good and evil
Cain was a God-worshipper who offered something to God, but what he offered according to his way was not acceptable to God
David offered his righteousness to God, but we know that man's righteousness is as a soiled garment in the sight of God
In Psalm 27 David was on the line of life, saying that he desired to dwell in the house of Jehovah to behold the loveliness of Jehovah
In Psalm 36 David said that in God's house, there is the fatness, the river of God's pleasures, the fountain of life, and light
When we endeavor to do things in ourselves, by ourselves, with ourselves, and for ourselves, we are companions of Cain
God had promised Abraham a son, but Abraham and his wife Sarah became very old, and they had lost the human capacity to produce children
The main line is the line of the tree of life with the tabernacle, with the priesthood, and with the offerings
While Moses was on the mountain with God receiving the commandments of the law, they made a golden calf to break the law
Later, however, when he was fleeing from Absalom, David turned back again to the group of Cain, as we saw in Psalms 3 7
Among the Jews in the Old Testament, there was the wonderful way of the tabernacle, the priesthood, and all the offerings
Occasionally and unconsciously they turned to Mount Zion of the main line, as unveiled in Psalms 3:4; 9:11, 14; 14:7; and 15:1b
The psalmist in Psalm 15 was questioning as to who may sojourn in God's tent and who may dwell on God's holy mountain
There are many principles in the Bible and of the Bible which can help us to understand the Bible in a proper way
It is very difficult for many students of the Bible to understand the Bible because they do not know the principles of the Bible
During Martin Luther's time, the Catholic Church taught that to be saved and justified by God, one had to do good works and keep the law
Psalm 1 says that if you keep the law, you will be blessed , but Psalm 2 says that the one who takes refuge in the Son is blessed
To understand the Old Testament, you need to keep one principle; and to understand the New Testament, you need to keep another principle
When you apply anything of the Old Testament, you must find out the principle of applying it in a spiritual way, not in a physical way
Every part, chapter, paragraph, sentence, and clause of the Bible must be interpreted according to the proper principles
According to the principle in the Old Testament, the Old Testament saints had to keep the Sabbath, the seventh day
The principle in the New Testament concerning the Sabbath is to believe in the Lord, to rest in the Lord, and to enjoy the Lord
Christ has the preeminence in the Godhead because in the Godhead, He is the image of God, the embodiment of God, and the expression of God
Since He has the first place in all things, we must give Him the first place in our being and in all that we do
Also the spirit of the Bible does not give any orthodox position to the law given by God alongside His economy
Many teachings in Christianity today are off the mark because they do not take care of the lines the principles and the spirit of the Bible
He speaks the word in the line of the tree of life, in the proper principles, and in the spirit of exalting Christ
If we read the Bible without seeing the lines, the principles, and the spirit of the Bible, we will not know what it is talking about
We may think that all of the psalms are good psalms, since they are psalms of prayer, psalms of thanksgiving, and psalms of praise
Only the things done by Christ as our life and only the things accomplished by God as our enjoyment are in the line of the tree of life
The two lines of the Bible are the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the line of the tree of life
These psalms are extraordinary and great in unveiling the secret concerning the centrality and universality of Christ in God's economy
Psalms 17 21 show us David's concept concerning two things concerning a man before God and concerning David's kingship before God
In the entire thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, we cannot find any word concerning Christ's living in us and our living Christ
David's concept in Psalm 1 was that the one who meditates in the law is blessed, but Paul said, 'For to me, to live is Christ'
When we come to the Psalms, we must see them in the light of the full revelation of God's New Testament economy
David's concept improved from his righteousness to God's wondrous lovingkindness and God's hiding him in the shadow of His wings
David said that his thoughts did not pass through his mouth and that his prayer was not made with 'lips of deceit'
In verses 7-9 David's concept turned from his righteousness to God's wondrous lovingkindness and God's hiding him in the shadow of His wings
His boasting in his righteousness was in the line of the tree of knowledge but Gods eye and Gods wings are in the line of the tree of life
How could David boast of his righteousness when he committed such a sinful act by taking Bathsheba and murdering her husband, Uriah?
Kings 15:5 says that David did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all the days of his life, except in the case of Uriah the Hittite
Psalm 51 shows that God forgave David, but in Matthew 1 God still mentioned Uriah, meaning that God did not forget
In verses 16-28 David turned to his righteousness and cleanness because of which God delivered him from his enemies
After David's praise concerning the speaking of the universe in verses 1-6, he highly appraises the law in verses 7-11
We have to give David the credit in the line of life and the debit in the line of the knowledge of good and evil
Verse 7 says, 'The law of Jehovah is perfect,/Restoring the soul;/The testimony of Jehovah is faithful,/Making the simple wise'
David said in Psalm 1 that the one who delighted in the law would be like a tree planted beside streams of water
In Luke 1369 the Lord told a parable indicating that God came in the Son to seek fruit from the Jewish people who were likened to a fig tree
Israel was like a tree planted by the law as the waters, but God would cut them down if they did not repent and receive Christ
We may not have agreed with what Cain did in Genesis 4, but we surely have agreed with David's prayer at the end of Psalm 19
May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart/Be acceptable before You,/O Jehovah, my rock and my Redeemer'
In Psalm 51, however, David applied Christ to the uttermost because he realized that he had sinned greatly and that he needed Christ
Psalm 20, however, still shows us that David has improved and progressed in his concept beyond the three foregoing psalms
In verses 8-12, David spoke of God's furious dealing with David's enemies by devouring them and destroying their descendants
We have seen that Psalm 1 uplifts the law instead of Christ, but we should not condemn Psalm 1 to the extent that we give it up
The first twenty-one verses of Psalm 22 cover the death of Christ, the crucifixion of Christ, and the last ten verses cover His resurrection
The subject of Psalm 22 is the Christ who has passed through the redeeming death and entered into the church-producing resurrection
God surely hears our prayers, but many times He does not answer our prayers which are not according to His desire, His economy, His plan
The suffering of Christ unto death was through men's reproach, despising, deriding, sneering, head shaking, and mocking
The word reproach is also used in Hebrews 13:13, which says, 'Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach'
When Christ was on the cross the ridiculers also shook or wagged their heads saying He committed himself to Jehovah let Him rescue him
Groups of people reproached Him, despised Him, derided Him, sneered at Him, shook their heads at Him, and mocked Him
He intended definitely to die and expected to be delivered from death, that is, to be resurrected from the dead
They tied two legs of the lamb at the foot of the cross and fastened the other outstretched legs to the crossbar
They slew the lamb so that all its blood was shed, for they needed all of the blood to sprinkle on their doorframes
Hebrews 5:7 says that Christ cried to God for God's deliverance, that is, for God to raise Him up from the dead
The beginning of Psalm 22 speaks of this but in the sequence of events on the cross Christ cried out My God My God why have You forsaken Me
Darkness fell over all the land because our sin and sins and all negative things were being dealt with on the cross
While He was on the earth, God the Father was with Him all the time , but at a certain point in His crucifixion, God left Him
The modernists say that Christ's death was not for redemption but was merely a martyrdom for the good of the people
Christ was the only begotten Son of God but in resurrection He was begotten as the firstborn Son of God with many brothers many sons of God
On the day of His resurrection, He could say that His Father is our Father because He and we were all born of the same Father
After we remember the Lord by taking the bread and the wine, we follow the Lord to praise the Father, to worship the Father
Following Christ's praise to God in the church, David advised God's people to praise Jehovah and all the earth to worship Him
In David's advice at the end of Psalm 22, we see the church as the kingdom and all the people worshipping God and praising the Father
In Psalm 22 we see Christ's death, His resurrection, and His many brothers produced in His resurrection to form His church
We were snakes and scorpions, but we have been redeemed, we have been washed in His blood, and we have been resurrected and regenerated
As those who have been redeemed, washed, resurrected, and regenerated, we are the sheep of God's flock, the church
By Jehovah the Triune God being incarnated crucified and resurrected to become the lifegiving Spirit He is qualified to be our Shepherd
He said that His sheep would hear His voice and follow Him out of the fold to enjoy the green pastures as the flock
In Psalm 23, the Spirit as typified by the waters and the oil signifies the consummated Spirit after Christ's resurrection
After we enjoy Christ, are filled up with Christ, and are nourished by Christ, we walk on the paths of righteousness
In our educational system there are five stages elementary, junior high, high school, college, and graduate school
The resurrected Christ shepherds us first in the initial stage of enjoyment in green pastures and at waters of rest
The little lamb lying down in the pasture and eating the grass does not have to worry about proper table manners
When we go to take care of the new ones, we must not only feed them with Christ but also help them to drink of the Spirit
He restores us revives and transforms us in our soul to make us take His way, to walk on the paths of righteousness
John 7 says that when we drink of the life-giving Spirit as the living water, we will flow out, not just one river but many rivers
Christ as our Shepherd leads us in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake in the person of the resurrected pneumatic Christ
Matthew 28:19 says that we are to baptize people into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit
The third stage is the stage of the experience of the presence of the resurrected pneumatic Christ through the valley of the shadow of death
Even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we do not fear evil, for the pneumatic Christ is with us
His presence is a comfort, a rescue, and a sustaining power to us when we are walking in the valley of the shadow of death
If we have had the proper experience in the valley we can testify that it was a place for us to enjoy the Lords presence in such a close way
In the valley of the shadow of death, the Lord's rod and His staff His protection, His guidance, and His sustenance comfort us
The Lord has the rod to protect us, and He has the staff to train us, to instruct us, to guide us, and to sustain us
In the fourth stage of the deeper and higher enjoyment of the resurrected Christ, the Lord anoints our head with oil ; our cup runs over
In verse five there is the Triune God the Son as the feast, the Spirit as the anointing oil, and the Father as the source of blessing
Psalm 23:6 speaks of the fifth stage of the lifelong enjoyment of the divine goodness and kindness in the house of Jehovah
Goodness refers to the grace of Christ, kindness refers to the love of the Father, and follow refers to the fellowship of the Spirit
God's house is our dwelling place where we enjoy the Triune God the Son's grace, the Father's love, and the Spirit's fellowship
In the church meetings, in God's house, we can enjoy the divine goodness and the divine kindness following us all the days of our life
Verse 7 says, 'Lift up your heads, O gates;/And be lifted up, O long enduring doors;/And the King of glory will come in'
All the nations, in a general way, are expecting Christ to come, but Christ would not come that quickly according to our human concept
Because we must wait for His coming with long endurance, we have a tendency to drop our heads in discouragement
Verse 9 says, 'Lift up your heads, O gates;/And lift up, O long enduring doors;/And the King of glory will come in'
The King of glory is Jehovah of hosts, the consummated Triune God embodied in the victorious and coming Christ
We have seen that Psalm 23 reveals Christ as the Shepherd in His resurrection, and that Psalm 24 reveals Christ as the King in God's kingdom
It shows that Christ lived on this earth as a God-man, died on the cross, resurrected, and then ascended to the right hand of God
In these seventeen psalms, the main point, the major point, the crucial point, is the enjoyment of God in the house of God
The revelation of the Psalms begins with the psalmist stressing the law and with the Spirit turning the psalmist to Christ
In the first psalm, the psalmist seeking after God was driving on the wrong highway, so the Spirit came in to turn him to the right way
Many Christians love Psalm 23, but not many have the realization that in this psalm they need to kiss Christ as the Shepherd
The fifth and final stage is the lifelong enjoyment of the divine goodness and kindness in the house of Jehovah
Psalm 24 goes on to show that the victorious Christ as the King of glory is coming to reign as the King in God's kingdom
The enjoyment of Christ leads the psalmist to another state of enjoyment the enjoyment of God in the house of God
It seems that our God did not feel satisfied with remaining in the heavens, so He came down to His temple on Mount Zion to have a retreat
He desired to leave the millions of angels in the heavens and come down to earth to stay with human beings for awhile
In the Old Testament, both God's residence in the heavens and His retreat place on Mount Zion in Jerusalem were physical
We may come to the church meeting, and in the meeting we receive the light, and everything becomes clear to us
Revelation 21:2 and 3 tell us that in eternity future we, God's redeemed people, will be a tabernacle to God for God to enjoy us
If someone had the privilege of entering into the temple on Mount Zion, he had to be under the abundance of God's lovingkindness
Psalm 11:4 says that God is in His holy temple on His throne in heaven discerning with His eyes and trying the sons of men
When God came and stayed in His retreat place, the temple on Mount Zion, He sent help and strength to those who trusted in Him
The psalmist as the one who enjoyed God in His temple, in His house, made a big mistake in understanding in Psalm 15:1-5 and Psalm 24:3-6
According to his concept, this one was the perfect man according to the law, who had clean hands and a pure heart
We have seen that in Psalm 23 Christ as the Shepherd leads the church as His flock through five stages of enjoyment
Psalm 84 expresses the psalmist's love for the house of God, which is the kind of love we should have for the church today
We have a hymn in our hymnal based on the psalmist's expression in Psalm 84 of his love for God's dwelling place
When evils, calamities, are taking place, we can be concealed in God's shelter, and the evils cannot 'see' us, cannot affect us
Psalm 24:7 says, 'Lift up your heads, O gates;/And be lifted up, O long enduring doors;/And the King of glory will come in'
We taste and see that God is good in His house, that is, in Christ, in the church, and eventually in the New Jerusalem
Psalm 36:8 also says that we can drink of the river of God's pleasures not just one kind of pleasure, but many pleasures
Our God is located in these three persons: in Christ, in the church as a corporate person, and in the New Jerusalem as a corporate person
The general title of Psalms 25 41 is 'The Mixed Expressions of the Psalmist's Sentiment in His Enjoyment of God in God's House'
David also wanted the treacherous ones to be ashamed because of his lifting up his soul to God, his trusting in God, and his waiting on God
His asking God to let the treacherous ones be ashamed also belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Now we need to consider David's lifting up his soul to God, his trusting in God, and his waiting on God according to the context of Psalm 25
We cannot answer this question in a definite way because David sought God according to and in the age of the old covenant under the law
David also asked God, as the God of his salvation, to teach and guide him through His compassions and acts of kindness
The way for us to enter into the New Testament age is by our confession of sins plus God's forgiveness of our sins
Be assured that God, being good and upright, instructs us sinners concerning how to confess and how to receive His forgiveness
The word testimonies in the Psalms refers to the law with the Ten Commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances
The law of the old covenant deals with the act of murder , but the new law of the kingdom deals with anger, the motive of murder
If you are such a person, David says that you will be one whose soul will dwell in prosperity and whose seed will possess the land
Verse 14 says, 'The intimate counsel of Jehovah belongs to those who fear Him,/And His covenant will He make known to them'
David also asked God to deliver him by keeping his soul and not letting him be put to shame, for he took refuge in God
Psalm 26 reveals the mixed expressions of David's sentiment in his asking God to judge him, examine him, try him, and test him
Many readers of the Psalms love David's expressions in asking God to judge him, examine him, try him, and test him
Within us are defects, shortcomings, wrongdoings, offenses, transgressions, trespasses, evils, iniquity, sin, sins, and defilement
As he went around the altar, he made himself heard with the voice of thanksgiving and the telling out of God's wonderful deeds
Regardless of how good a person is, as long as he is not a God-man, he is not up to the standard of God's economy
Paul said that Christ came into the world to save sinners and that he was the foremost sinner among all the sinners
Psalm 27 is the mixed expressions of David's sentiment in his trusting in God for His protection and deliverance from his enemies
He spoke much in this psalm about his enemies, and he believed that he would be delivered because he trusted in God
God said in 1 Kings 15:5 that David did what was right in the eyes of the Lord except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite
At the end of Psalm 27, David advised and encouraged others to wait on God and to be strong and encouraged in their heart
According to Pauls word in Galatians 220 and Philippians 121a every one of Gods elect should confess I have been crucified with Christ
Eating and drinking the Lord to enjoy Him as our spiritual life supply is so crucial, but this is missed in today's Christianity
We can see a picture of this flowing river in Genesis 2 and this river the river of water of life in Revelation 22 will be flowing forever
Food is for eating, the river is for drinking, the fountain is for sharing of, and the light is for us to participate in by seeing
In this message we want to see the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in his enjoyment of God in God's house in Psalms 28 30
The only point that might be worthwhile for us New Testament believers to consider is that David said his heart trusted in God
There are many things in the New Testament that are simple in terminology but deep and mysterious in their significance
He also said that he labored more abundantly than all the apostles, yet it was not he but the grace of God which was with him
While the psalmist was enjoying God in God's house, he expressed his sentiment, and his expressions were a mixture
Psalm 28 shows us the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in calling God to hear the voice of his supplications
Every line and word of the Scripture is inspired by God, but there are many words in the Bible that are not God's words
David exhorted the sons of God, the Mighty One, to ascribe to God glory and strength and worship Him in holy splendor
He said that the voice of Jehovah was over the waters breaking the cedars of Lebanon making them to skip like a calf like a young wild ox
He also said the voice of Jehovah cleaves out flames of fire and shakes the wilderness, even the wilderness of Kadesh
According to David, Jehovah's voice causes the hinds to calve and strips the forests bare, and 'in His temple all say, Glory'!
There is no comparison between David's praise and blessing in this psalm and the utterance in Paul's prayers in Ephesians 1 and 3
At the end of Psalm 29, David blessed the people of God with God's giving strength to them and His blessing them in peace
Psalm 30 shows us the mixed expressions of David's sentiment in his song at the dedication of the house of God
David extolled God for His lifting him up over his enemies, for His healing, and for His deliverance of his soul from Sheol
Although David said this in Psalm 30, he surely was not prospering when he was being chased by his rebellious son, Absalom
The living law, the law of life, being written into the New Testament believers is to have God imparted into them
In the new covenant, we who were once dead have been enlivened, resurrected from the dead, and regenerated to become a new person
There is no comparison between the old covenant of the Old Testament and the new covenant of the New Testament
The Psalms, therefore, are full of expressions that are not uttered in the New Testament, especially in the apostle Paul's Epistles
The real blessing in God's New Testament economy is that Christ has made Himself one with us and has made us one with Him
We have to remember that the Word who was God became flesh and lived in this flesh for thirty-three and a half years
God became a man and by dispensing Himself into us He made us Godmen men who are one with God having God within us as our life and nature
We have Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, and Christ today is realized as the life-giving Spirit, the consummated, compounded Spirit
One Bible teacher has said that the tree of life is over today, but the tree of life in Genesis 2 is a central item
Psalm 31 shows us the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in experiencing and enjoying God's salvation from his distress
In Psalm 31 David does not speak of God's salvation from eternal perdition and from God's judgment but of salvation from his distress
David said that he took refuge in God as a rock of protection and a fortress to save him out of the net secretly laid for him by his enemies
Once we are saved from eternal perdition, God wants to continue to be our salvation so that we can live and magnify Christ
Perhaps the wife wants to be saved from her husband's bad temper, and the husband wants to be saved from his wife's disapproval
God's salvation for the New Testament believers is for them to be sustained and strengthened to live and magnify Christ
David's word concerning others' taking counsel against him and scheming to take his life was actually the experience of the Lord Jesus
He realized that all things worked together for his good that he could be transformed and conformed to the image of Christ
David said that the blessed man is the one to whom Jehovah does not impute iniquity and 'in whose spirit there is no deceit'
Verses 8-10 say, 'I will instruct you and teach you concerning the way you should go;/I will counsel you; My eye is upon you
David said that the wicked have many sorrows, but that the one who trusts in Jehovah is encompassed by lovingkindness
Verse 11 says, 'Rejoice in Jehovah and exult, O righteous ones;/And give a ringing shout, all you who are upright in heart'
We may be impressed with Gods restoring of the heavens and of the earth but the New Testament is concerning the new creation in resurrection
Regardless of how much restoration the heavens and the earth undergo, they are still the old creation, but we are the new creation
There is nothing in the New Testament which asks us to praise God for the restoration of the heavens and the earth
The difference between Christ and the law is the difference between the Old Testament economy and the New Testament economy
Man realized that he was weak and sinful, so he asked for God's mercy, God's lovingkindness, and he put his trust in God
In His incarnation He entered into the womb of a virgin, but through His death and resurrection He entered into thousands of men
Our honesty, faithfulness, patience, endurance, kindness, and everything we are and do involves the Triune God
We need to have the proper discernment to see the difference between the Old Testament economy and the New Testament economy
On the one hand, the psalms are lovely because they are the aspiration of the sentiment of the ones who were seeking after God
In this message we want to continue our fellowship on the mixed expressions of the psalmists sentiment in his enjoyment of God in Gods house
The title of Psalm 34 says that this was a psalm of David when he disguised his sanity before Abimelech who drove him out and he departed
David was not normal; he disguised himself as being insane because he was before a king who had the power to kill him
The basic principle, the main principle, of Christ's birth is that God came to join Himself to man, to be a man, and to be one with man
All of God's chosen people will be consummated to be fully one with God to become the constituents of the holy city, the New Jerusalem
Psalm 34 shows us the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in his enjoyment of God in God's house in blessing and praising God
It is good to bless and praise God, but we should not forget that such a wonderful psalm was written after David put on a 'mask'
Sometimes they might have even done something in a way to cheat people, but God surely did not cheat people for them
When David disguised himself in front of that king, he did not take refuge in Jehovah but in his 'mask,' in his disguising himself
People may quote these verses for their personal benefit but eventually end up lacking the material things they desire
Corinthians tells us that Paul passed through much suffering and deprivation, even to the extent that he was lacking food and clothing
David said that if we love having days in order to see good, we should guard our tongue from evil and our lips from speaking deceit
Draw out also the spear, and close up the way/Against those who pursue me;/Say to my soul,/I am your salvation'
Of asking God for something, David here is teaching God how to deliver him by fighting against his enemies with weapons
Verses 4-8 say, 'Let those who seek my life/Be put to shame and humiliated;/Let those who devise evil for me/Be turned back and confounded
Let destruction come upon them unawares,/And let his net, which he hid, catch him;/Let him fall into it, into destruction'
But I, when they were sick,/Had sackcloth as my clothing;/I afflicted my soul with fasting,/And my prayer returned to my own bosom
In verses 17-28 David urged God to deliver him by instructing God according to his natural knowledge of good and evil
Verses 1-4 are his accusation of the wicked: 'Transgression speaks to the wicked/Within his heart;/There is no dread of God/Before his eyes
Verses 5-10 are his praising of God's lovingkindness, faithfulness, and righteousness mixed with the enjoyment of God in His house
In these verses David entreated God to deal with the wicked not according to God's way but according to his way
In a sense, it seems that they received the help from reading the Psalms, but actually they did not receive the real help
In eternity past God decided to do one thing in His economy to create for Himself an organism, the Body of Christ
Man became fallen, but God promised man that He would come through a woman to be a man, to join Himself with man, and to become one with man
Afterward, He went to the cross and died not only for our sins but also to deal with every problem in the universe
In His incarnation He brought God into man, and in His resurrection He brought man into God so that God and man could be one
Because they know that they are weak and the temptations are strong, they ask God to help them and try to trust in God
Paul solemnly charged Timothy before God and before Christ by His appearing and His kingdom to proclaim the word
Paul was being poured out as a drink offering , so he charged Timothy to be faithful to proclaim the healthy word
According to Paul's word to Timothy, the itching and turned-away ear is the main factor in the worsening decline in the churches
We have to be faithful to speak the healthy words of God's economy, not the words that satisfy people's itching ears
In the Lords ministry we have spoken concerning Gods economy Gods dispensing and the lifegiving Spirit the processed consummated Spirit
We have seen that this Spirit is the compound Spirit, and this compound Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God
One is the Father in the Godhead and the other is the Father in Isaiah 9:6, whom they say is the Father of eternity
One is the Holy Spirit in the Trinity, and the other is the life-giving Spirit mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:45b
From that year the light concerning the all-inclusive Spirit came in and has been shining brighter and brighter
The compound ointment takes olive oil as a base compounded with four kinds of spices myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia
The Bible reveals all of these things to let us know how God can be one with man and how man can be one with God
My burden is to try the best to help the saints in the Lord's recovery come out of the misled concept concerning the Psalms
David also said that you should trust in Jehovah do good feed on His faithfulness delight yourself in Jehovah and commit your way to Jehovah
He will give you the requests of your heart and cause your righteousness to go forth like light and your justness like noonday
Verses 9-40 point out that according to David's concept, the evildoers will be cut off, but those who wait on Jehovah will possess the land
And in a little while longer there will be no wicked man;/Indeed, you will look diligently for his place, and he will not be there'
Again and again throughout Psalm 37, David said that the righteous would inherit the land and the wicked would be cut off
He wants Christ to replace all the offerings, to replace all things, to replace all matters, and to replace all men
David said that in his flesh there was no soundness because of God's indignation, and there was no wholeness in his bones due to his sin
Psalm 38:9-20 shows that David's environment compelled him to groan before God and declare his iniquity and sin
When the apostle Paul asked the Lord to remove the thorn from his flesh, the Lord's response was, 'My grace is sufficient for you'
The more you are under suffering, the more you will declare your iniquity, not your righteousness as you did in Psalm 37'
We may say that the title of Psalm 38 could be 'Sin and Iniquity,' and the title of Psalm 39 could be 'Nothing and Vanity'
God would keep David in his situation for a while so that David would be compelled to realize his real situation and his real condition
In Psalm 38 he realized that his condition was sinful, and in Psalm 39 he realized that his situation was full of vanity
In the New Testament, all the believers should be heavenly strangers and sojourners , sojourning as foreigners on this earth
We need to see the human concept in the Psalms so that we can jump out of this concept into the divine concept in Paul's Epistles
In these psalms we can again see the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in his enjoyment of God in God's house
In the New Testament, however, the Lord Jesus told us that we should love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us
Do you believe God is happy to see His children ask Him to raise them up that they might recompense their enemies?
David indicated that he would know that Jehovah delighted in him if Jehovah raised him up so that he could recompense his enemies
He indicated that all his enemies encompassing him were evils which had become so numerous that they could not be counted
Christ said to God You do not delight in sacrifice and offeringYou have bored My earsYou do not require burnt offering and sin offering
Christ delighted in doing God's will, which was the will of God to replace the Old Testament sacrifices and offerings
However, the doing of God's will in Hebrews 10 refers to Christ coming to replace the Old Testament sacrifices and offerings
He is the reality of the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering
Whenever we sin, we ask God to forgive us, taking Christ, God's Son, as our sin offering and trespass offering
The revelation in Psalm 40:6-8 is one of the greatest revelations concerning Christ in His commission of His incarnation
Verse 6 says, 'You do not delight in sacrifice and offering,' and again, 'You do not require burnt offering and sin offering'
God not delighting in and not requiring the sacrifice and offering means to terminate His economy in the Old Testament
Hebrews 2:14 says that because Christ was going to destroy Satan, He needed to partake of blood and flesh, that is, He needed a body
To bore the ears was for Christ's obedience to die on the cross, and to prepare a body was also for His dying on the cross
When the Lord appeared to His disciples in resurrection, He told them all the things that were written concerning Him in the Scriptures
The Lord's word here unveils that the entire Old Testament is a revelation of Him and that He is its center and content
When the Lord established His table, He indicated that His blood shed through His death was the enacting factor of the new covenant
The prophecy concerning Christ in Psalm 40:6-8 was spoken in the context of the mixed expressions of David's sentiment
Peter frequently said the wrong thing, but one day he told the Lord that He was the Christ, the Son of the living God
The Lord Jesus told Peter that he was blessed because flesh and blood did not reveal this to him, but the Father in the heavens
At one moment Peter was blessed to receive a heavenly revelation of Christ from the Father, but in the next moment he was one with Satan
At one time David is speaking, but suddenly his mouth becomes the mouth which reveals the divine revelation concerning Christ
Matthew 17 says that the Lord Jesus brought Peter, James, and John with Him to the mount of His transfiguration
In Psalm 41:13 David blessed God for eternity 'Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel,/From eternity to eternity!
Psalms 25 41 are a section of psalms showing us the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in his enjoyment of God in God's house
Matthew 26:4 says that the chief priests and the elders took counsel together to seize Jesus by craftiness and kill Him
John 19:36 says, 'For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled: 'No bone of His shall be broken'
In the mixed expressions of the sentiment of Gods lovers and seekers Christ is revealed as the centrality and universality of Gods economy
In the mixed expressions of his sentiment, Christ is revealed as the centrality and universality of God's economy
Psalms 22 24 reveal that Christ died an all-inclusive vicarious death and entered into the church-producing resurrection
In this book we see the psalmists' intensified enjoyment of God in His house and city through the suffering, exalted, and reigning Christ
David is a glorious name among the nation of Israel, but Korah is an infamous name because Korah rebelled against Moses and God
The psalmist said that the one who delighted and meditated in the law would be like a tree transplanted beside streams of water
In Psalm 42, however, the psalmist said that his soul panted for God, just as the hart pants after the streams of water
Do we want to be like a tree transplanted by the streams of water by delighting in the law or like a hart panting after God?
We have to realize that the psalms progressively become higher in their revelation from Book One through Book Five
Book One does not speak of the enjoyment of God in the house of God and the city of God as strongly as Book Two does
Jerusalem was built on a mountain range, that mountain range had a high peak, and on top of that high peak was the temple
God's house is both Christ as God's tabernacle and temple and the church as the enlargement of Christ, the enlarged temple
On the one hand, God in Christ is our home, our dwelling place , and on the other hand, we as the church are His home, His dwelling place
Our enjoyment of God is through a stairway, and this stairway is Christ the suffering One, the exalted One, and the reigning One
In a sense, we are still poor sinners and rebels, yet we poor sinners can be those who are speakers of the holy Word!
The psalmist was panting after God at a time when he and his people had been stripped and defeated by the neighboring nations
At least in his thought, in his consideration, he left the panting after God and went to something else the recounting of his past
Psalm 42:4 is a good verse, but it shows that there is a mixture within the sentiment of the writer of this psalm
Because the psalmist departed from his panting after God, the thoughts constituting his sentiment were expressed
In our time with the Lord, we may be panting after Him, but then we are taken away from God by distracting thoughts
Verse 7 says, 'Deep calls unto deep/At the sound of Your water spouts;/All Your waves and Your billows/Pass over me'
Verse 8 says, 'By day Jehovah commands/His lovingkindness,/And by night His song is with me,/A prayer to the God of my life'
In the day he enjoyed God's lovingkindness; in the night he enjoyed Jehovah's song being with him, a prayer to the God of his life
While the psalmist was enjoying God in His house and His city, a lot of things came into his thoughts to distract him
Psalm 43:1-2 shows us the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in his enjoyment of God in His house and city
When we have light and truth, we have the way, but at that time the people of Israel did not have a way to get out of their captivity
They did not have the way, the leading, to get back to Mount Zion, the holy mountain, so that they could return to God's house
They were panting after God, thirsting for God, and desiring to go back to Jerusalem, to get to Mount Zion to reach the altar
Psalm 44 shows us the mixed expressions of the psalmists' sentiment in their enjoyment of God in His house and city
Verse 1 says, 'O God, we have heard with our ears;/Our fathers have recounted it to us,/The work You did in their days,/In the days of old'
Psalm 44:9 says, 'Nevertheless You have rejected us and humiliated us,/And You have not gone forth with our armies'
The psalmists were saying that even though God was so good and kind to their forefathers, He had rejected them now
Verse 17 says, 'All this has come upon us; but we have not forgotten You,/Nor have we been false to Your covenant'
In the Old Testament, especially in the Prophets, God told His people frequently that they had forsaken Him and had broken His covenant
Verses 1 and 2 speak of panting after God and thirsting for God, and verse 5 speaks of the salvation of God's countenance
In this message we will begin to consider Psalm 45, the highest and the greatest of the one hundred fifty psalms
The word love in the title refers not to a father's love for his son but to the love between a male and a female
In order to understand this psalm, we need to turn to the particular book in the Bible which is concerned with love the Song of Songs
In one of the life-study messages on Hosea 11 14, we pointed out that throughout Hosea Israel is depicted as the wife of Jehovah
When God's everlasting love is touched, Israel is called God's son , indicating that Israel has the Father's life
A husband who loves his wife in affection may spoil her, but a father who loves his son in life never spoils his son
Genuine Christians those who have a heart for the Lord enjoy Christs love but they may enjoy it according to their own concept or feeling
Regarding the kingdom, Hebrews gives us five warnings, and each of these warnings concerns either reward or punishment
The first is the good word of God the word of the beginning of Christ which is the milk the believers taste when they believe in the Lord
These verses are on the praise of Christ as the King from four directions: His fairness, His victory, His kingdom, and His virtues
In the praise of Christ as the King in Psalm 45, there are two balanced pairs: fairness and victory, kingdom and virtues
Now the One who has come to us in His fairness, the One who has caught us and who loves us, wants us to love Him in return
Concerning this, Luke 4:22 tells us that the people marveled at the words of grace proceeding out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus
Verse 4a continues, 'And in Your splendor ride on victoriously/Because of truth and meekness and righteousness'
Christ's crucifixion was a great event that threatened Satan, the demons, and the fallen angels, the powers of darkness in the air
Eventually, as part of His correction of Peter, He said to him, 'Go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up
Psalm 45:7b continues, 'Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You/With the oil of gladness above Your companions'
Christ's authority, throne, scepter, and everything related to the kingdom are under the anointing of the Spirit and therefore are spiritual
Regarding Christs virtues 1 Peter 29 speaks of telling out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light
To preach the gospel is actually to tell forth the many virtues of Christ, including His love, kindness, and forgiveness
In Christ's living there is the virtue of love, and this virtue is the expression of the divine attribute of love
As human beings we are under two kinds of covering our clothing and dwelling place, both of which express what kind of person we are
As we praise the Lord, we need to appreciate what He is in His virtues and what He has done to produce the church to be His expression
The first station is Psalm 2; the second is Psalm 8; the third is Psalm 16; the fourth is Psalms 22 24; and the fifth is Psalm 40
According to the second school, Revelation should be understood symbolically, since some items of its content are revealed by 'signs'
Those who follow this school say that as the golden lampstands are symbols of the churches, so the New Jerusalem is also a symbol, a sign
From Ephesians 5 we know that the relationship between husband and wife portrays the great mystery Christ and the church
If we did not have these two symbols, we would not understand many of the details concerning the church being God's dwelling place
From this we see that the biblical way is to use symbols to portray spiritual things and we need to keep this in mind as we come to Psalm 45
Psalm 45 was written in praise of King Solomon who was a symbol a type of Christ with a wife composed of many daughters of many believers
The Bible clearly reveals that God's intention is that a man have only one wife, yet Solomon had hundreds of wives
Solomon with his wives is a type of Christ with His corporate wife a wife composed of believers from every tribe tongue people and nation
Solomon did not follow God's regulation about having only one wife, and many readers of the Bible would condemn him for this
In verses 2 through 7 this psalm praises the king Solomon in his fairness in his victory in his kingdom and in the sweetness of his virtues
In Psalm 45 the bride of Christ is typified by the queen, and His overcoming guests are typified by the honorable women around the queen
Not only does the king have honor and majesty, but the queen and the women around her also have honor and majesty
Paul's word of exhortation cannot compare with the revelation regarding our status as believers given in the type in Psalm 45
We all, males and females, are daughters of kings because we have been born of the King and thus are of the royal family
We will not sell ourselves cheaply and we will not fight or quarrel with others, but will behave ourselves more honorably
Apart from understanding the type, we have no way to understand this psalm, and the more we read it, the more we will be led into a 'forest'
The queen signifies the church, and her being covered with gold signifies the church's appearing in the divine nature
In 1 Corinthians 1:30 we are told that God has made Christ to be righteousness to us for our justification, for us to be justified by God
Verse 10 goes on to say, 'Hear, O daughter, and see; and incline your ear;/And forget your people and your father's house'
The daughter is the queen, who signifies the church, and her father's house signifies the natural relationships of the church
If we would have these righteousnesses, we must have Christ Himself lived out of us to be our subjective righteousnesses
The second garment, the embroidered clothing, corresponds to Christ as our subjective righteousnesses, which are for our victory
Because Christ is the King and we are the queen, eventually this mutual abode becomes the palace, which signifies the New Jerusalem
In brief, the New Jerusalem is the redeeming God wrought into the believers and mingled with them to be one entity
Both the church and the New Jerusalem are the Triune God Himself wrought into us and mingled with us to be one entity
Far in Psalm 45 we have seen the praising of Christ in Himself and the praising of Christ in the praising of His church, of His redeemed
On the one hand, as believers, we are the members of Christ; on the other hand, we are the sons, the descendants, of Christ
In our study of the Bible, we need to learn to ask questions of the Lord, and we should do this as we come now to Psalms 46 48
We should ask why these three psalms are placed immediately after Psalm 45, a psalm praising king Solomon with his queen
When we study a psalm such as Psalm 45, we should not have any trust in our natural understanding or our natural concept
As we study Psalm 45, for instance, we must find out the spiritual significance of the king, the queen, the daughters, and the sons
If we read Genesis 1 and 2 only according to the letters without caring for the spiritual significance we will not understand these chapters
He has a body, made from the dust of the ground; he has a spirit, the issue of the breath of God; and he has a soul
Through Christ and by Christ we experience the house of God, another matter of spiritual significance in the Psalms
According to Psalm 23, as we experience Christ in His shepherding, we are brought into the house of God to dwell there forever
In Psalm 36:8 the psalmist speaks of the fatness of God's house, where there is the fountain of life and where we see light in God's light
In Psalm 31 we have a word concerning the city, and in Psalm 24, a word concerning the mountain, which implies the city
As the One unveiled as the King in Psalm 45, Christ needs a city in which to rule and reign, and we see this city in Psalm 46
In verse 3 the psalmist says, 'Let the waters of the sea roar and foam; /Let the mountains shake at its swelling'
The streams of this river gladden the city of God, which is the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High
Today the nations are raging, but one day God, who rules and reigns in the city, will command them to be still and know that He is God
Verse 9 goes on to say that those who are noble among the peoples have been gathered with the people of the God of Abraham
Consider carefully her bulwarks;/Pass between her palaces; /That you may recount it to the generation following'
The God whom we enjoy through Christ, in Christ, and with Christ in the church and the local churches is our refuge, retreat, and guide
The Christ we enjoy in Psalm 23 is the Shepherd, the One who is shepherding us into the house of God, the local church
Eventually when we are built up strengthened and enlarged the church becomes the city the kingdom of God where the King rules and reigns
In studying the Psalms, we need to pay attention to the sequence of the psalms and also to how the psalms are arranged in groups
The third category is a single person, King David, repenting, confessing his sins to God, and asking God for His purging
Some people think that money can do anything; they believe that as long as they have money, they do not need anything else
In verse 3 the psalmist says, 'My mouth will speak wisdom,/And the meditation of my heart will be that of understanding'
The psalmist, on the contrary, has the assurance that God will redeem his soul from the power of Sheol, for God will receive him
Those who trust in their wealth are not only foolish and senseless but are also likened to animals, even to beasts
Verse 20, the last verse of the psalm, concludes, 'A man in honor but without understanding/Is like the beasts that perish'
Finally, the ones who trust in their wealth have no share in the enjoyment of God in His house and in His city
Because they are outside of Christ, they are excluded from the enjoyment of God in His house, the church, and in His city, the kingdom
In the Bible, a book of covenant, God has covenanted Himself to us, and now we need to call upon the Lord according to this covenant
In this psalm, those who call upon the Lord according to His covenant are the saints of God who have made a covenant with God by sacrifice
To make a covenant with God by sacrifice is to make a covenant by Christ as our Mediator, as the 'middleman' between us and God
One could offer to God a burnt offering, a meal offering, a sin offering, or a trespass offering without much affection
Whenever a person, being thankful to God, offered a thanksgiving offering to God, that person's heart was touched
The psalmist, speaking for God, indicated that what God wants is not the burnt offering but the thanksgiving offering
God wants you to offer Him your thanksgiving offering, an offering that is touching to both you and God, an offering full of affection'
Those who call upon the Lord according to His covenant are those who have been redeemed by God in Christ, typified by the sacrifices
In Psalm 51 we have the third category a person repenting, confessing his sins to God, and asking God for His purging
The title of Psalm 51 is significant: 'A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba'
David begged God to blot out his transgressions wash him thoroughly from his iniquity cleanse him from his sin and purge his sin with hyssop
Before we come to Psalm 68, we need to pass through sixteen psalms, and we will devote three messages to these psalms
In verses 8 and 9 David continued, 'But I, like a flourishing olive tree/In the house of God,/Trust in God's lovingkindness/Forever and ever
In verse 6 we see that the psalmist wanted to enjoy God in His salvation from His house when God turned the captivity of His people
For strangers have risen up against me,/And those who terrorize seek my soul;/They do not set God before them'
Of asking the Lord to have mercy on them in His faithfulness, the psalmist prays that God will annihilate them
The psalmist says, 'I will offer a freewill offering to You;/I will praise Your name, O Jehovah, for it is good
Verse 22, a 'golden' verse, says, 'Cast your burden upon Jehovah,/And He will support you;/He will never allow the righteous to be moved'
On the one hand, the psalmist trusted in God; on the other hand, while trusting in God, he asked God to cast down his enemies
The psalmist did this even while he was trusting in God and enjoying God in His salvation, lovingkindness, and faithfulness
On the one hand, he trusted in God and enjoyed Him; on the other hand, he was happy to see that his enemies were suffering
My point is that David's prayers in these psalms are altogether different from what is taught in the New Testament
Many of today's Christian readers of the Psalms do not have any realization concerning the learning of lessons
We should not pray that God would put others down; we are the ones who need to be brought down and broken by God
We should not have the shortage, displayed in nearly all the psalms, of being devoid of learning the lessons of God's discipline
Throughout the centuries, many Christian readers of the Old Testament have not had the proper understanding of the Psalms
In Genesis 1518 God had promised to give to Abrahams descendants this land from the river of Egypt unto the great river the river Euphrates
Various judges were raised up to defeat these nations, but the enemies were not utterly defeated until the time of David
Insofar as he had been raised up by God to destroy the enemies of the kingdom of God, he was justified in praying this way
We need to consider David not only in the aspect of his being a type of the fighting Christ but also in the aspect of his spirituality
Some might excuse David by saying that the Old Testament saints were not expected to love their enemies and were justified in hating them
Paul says If your enemy is hungry feed him if he is thirsty give him a drink for in doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head
In his condemnation of the sons of men, David says that in heart they perform injustice and that their hands 'weigh out violence on earth'
He continues by likening the wicked to water that runs off, to a snail that melts and goes away, and to a woman's miscarriage
He declares, 'The righteous man will rejoice when he sees vengeance;/He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked'
David concludes this psalm, saying, 'Men will say, Indeed there is fruit for the righteous man;/Indeed there is a God who judges on earth'
He prays Consume them in wrath consume them so that they are no moreAnd men will know that God rules in JacobUnto the ends of the earth
In verse 5 the psalmist prays, 'That Your beloved ones may be delivered,/Save with Your right hand, and answer us'
Verses 6 through 8 are concerned with God's exultation in His promise to His people for the possession of the land
In His holiness, or holy place, God said that He would exult, divide Shechem, and measure out the Valley of Succoth
The psalmist expresses his expectation that God will subdue the neighboring nations and restore His people to their possession
In verses 1 through 5 we see that the psalmist enjoyed God as his refuge by dwelling in the tent of God under the covering of His wings
The psalmist is asking God not simply to give but to appoint lovingkindness and faithfulness that they may preserve him
The psalmist's word here seems good, but it actually involves a kind of commercial transaction between him and God
The singing of psalms to God's name is the psalmist's 'payment' for the 'purchase' of God's lovingkindness and faithfulness
If we love with the expectation of receiving something in return, that is not genuine love it is trade, business, commerce
In verse 8 he says, 'Trust in Him at all times, O people;/Pour out your heart before Him;/God is a refuge to us'
He gives this advice: 'Do not trust in oppression,/And do not become vain through robbery;/If wealth increases,/Do not set your heart on it'
In Philippians 310 he says To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings being conformed to His death
We should use their pious expressions as a background for us to know the spiritual things in the New Testament
We should not follow the Psalms blindly for they are not the absolute pattern up to the level of the New Testament standard for us to follow
To cut straight the word of the truth means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion
On the one hand, the psalmist treasures the enjoyment of God; on the other hand, he also rejoices in God's punishment of his enemies
The psalmist's use of the words 'perfect man' indicates that he considers himself perfect, one who should not be hated by anyone
The psalmist goes on to speak of his enemies saying They firm up an evil matter They plan to lay snares secretlyThey say Who will see them
In his praise to God, the psalmist says, 'Iniquities prevail against me;/As for our transgressions, You make propitiation for them
David is saying that God should remember the iniquities of David's enemies but should propitiate his transgressions
Some may appreciate the good poetry, but what do you receive from the psalmist's word about grain, ridges, and furrows?
In verses 3 through 5 the psalmist advises the nations to praise God for His equitable judgment and kind guidance
In verse 4 he says Let the nations rejoice and shout for joyFor You will judge the peoples equitablyAnd will guide the nations on the earth
In order to evaluate the Psalms properly we need to consider such books as Genesis Leviticus Matthew John and the fourteen Epistles of Paul
In certain of the psalms we have a wonderful revelation concerning Christ as the centrality and universality of God's economy
In particular, we will become more able to understand the Bible according to its controlling lines and governing principles
God's eternal economy is to impart Himself into man and dispense His riches into man's inner being that He may be man's life and life supply
By His life and the bountiful supply of His life-giving Spirit , man can live Him and magnify Him for His manifestation
In this way, all His chosen people can corporately be His expression as His fullness, His organism, the church
Good things often become the replacement of the best, the opposition against the best, and even the enemy to the best
The standard of the divine revelation in Paul's Epistles is high compared not only to the Psalms but also to the four Gospels and Acts
If we do not believe that Christ is us and is in us, then we have not yet seen the revelation concerning the new man in the New Testament
Though you lie among the sheepfolds,/There are dove wings covered with silver,/And its pinions, with greenish yellow gold'
We also need to inquire concerning the dove wings covered with silver and the pinions covered with greenish yellow gold
In His death, resurrection, and ascension, Christ fought the battle, and the spoil reaped by Him has become our enjoyment
There are little Benjamin, who rules them,/And the princes of Judah in their company, /The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali'
Why are the names of four of the twelve tribes mentioned Benjamin, Judah, Zebulun, and Naphtali but not the names of the other tribes?
What was God's purpose in decreeing the law and in charging Moses to build the ark and the tabernacle with all its furnishings?
When Moses laid before them all the words which God had commanded him the people answered and said All that the Lord hath spoken we will do
John 1:14 tells us that the Word, which is God, became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality
In the Old Testament, God called Abraham, having chosen him and his descendants to be His people, His called race
Whereas the law decreed through Moses was a reality, the tabernacle with all its furnishings and utensils was a type of Christ
Throughout the remainder of the Old Testament, in all the books of history and of the prophets, God continued to expose Israel
God's move on earth for His New Testament economy began with the incarnation, with God's coming as the Son to be incarnated
He moved on the earth for thirty-three and a half years and then, after His death and resurrection, ascended to the heavens
Sinai was the place where the law was decreed, and Zion was the destination of the traveling Triune God and His people
As we consider this, we need to realize that there have been two journeys a journey in type and a journey in reality
God's actual journey on the earth, His real move on the earth, was His move in Christ, the real tabernacle with the real ark
In the Old Testament we have the type, but in the New Testament we have Christ as the reality of the tabernacle of the ark
Psalm 684 says Sing to God sing psalms to His name Triumph in Him who rides through the deserts For Jah is His name and exult before Him
In verse 1 we have the prayer of Moses, the representative of God's elect, for Jehovah to arise and for His enemies to be scattered
Silver signifies Christ in His redemption for our justification, which is indicated by the color white, the color of approval
The greenish yellow, glittering gold with which the pinions are covered signifies God's nature glittering in the divine life and glory
Both Christ and God are brought in by the Spirit's power: Christ by the Spirit's moving power and God by the Spirit's soaring power
Verse 11 indicates that God's elect enjoy all the above items as their portion in Christ and announce them to others as the glad tidings
Before we were saved, we were sinners and enemies of God, and we had been taken captive by Satan and imprisoned
The Amplified New Testament renders 'He led captive those taken captive' as 'He led a train of vanquished foes'
In Christ's ascension there was a procession of these vanquished foes, led as captives from a war, for a celebration of Christ's victory
When Christ ascended to the Father, He presented to the Father all the ones He had captured and brought with Him
Although as gifts we may differ in size and quality, we all are gifts given by the Father to the ascended Christ
The gifts received by Christ have become the gifted believers like the apostles the prophets the evangelists and the shepherds and teachers
As Ephesians 4 reveals, all the gifts do the same work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ as God's dwelling place on earth today
The gifts as the gifted persons, the believers in Christ, are builded together to be the dwelling place for God
We see that God's dwelling place is also the habitation of the believers, the needy, the solitary, and the bound ones
Today we all are the needy ones , the bound ones , and the solitary ones, and the church is our dwelling place
Whenever the saints in a locality are divided and scattered, they are on the earth or, even worse, below the earth
Before we explain what is the center of the first section, let us consider once again the matter of God's move on the earth
The Old Testament time was actually not a time for God to move on the earth but rather a time of preparation for His move
In a similar way, the Old Testament time was a time of God's preparation for opening the 'business' of the divine economy
Such a mingling did not take place in the Old Testament, for the Old Testament time was the time of God's preparation
God took about two thousand years the period of time from Abraham to the coming of Christ to prepare the people of Israel
Without that type, God could not have had, with the children of Israel, a type of His move on the earth in Christ
God had sent Moses to Egypt to bring them out of Egypt to Sinai, and there at Sinai God gave them a training which lasted quite a long time
By the time the tabernacle was set up, the people had been trained and prepared, even as an army, for God's move
Moses the representative of Israel prayed saying Let God arise let His enemies be scatteredAnd let those who hate Him flee before Him
Eventually, the ark ascended Mount Zion and was placed in the temple, which had been built to replace the tabernacle
After being on earth for thirty-three and a half years, Christ was crucified, was resurrected, and ascended to the heavens
At present, the Lord is still moving on in the heavens to make us the new creation in full and to bring us from the earth to the heavens
The center of this section is the dove wings gilded with silver and the dove pinions gilded with greenish yellow gold
The dove wings gilded with silver and the pinions gilded with greenish yellow gold are the spoil mentioned in verse 12
To understand this we need to realize that by spoil we mean something gained, or reaped, as the result of fighting and winning a battle
Christ fought the battle in His death, resurrection, and ascension, and surely He has gained some spoil as a result
We gain God; we gain the Spirit; we gain the divine life; and we gain the all-inclusive Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God
they' refers to the enemies, to the unbelievers; 'goings' refers to God's activities; and the 'sanctuary' signifies the church
At Mount Sinai God decreed the law and charged Moses to build the tabernacle with the ark and all the various furnishings
At the rear there might have been another group composed not of virgins but of males from the tribes of Benjamin Judah Zebulun and Naphtali
There are little Benjamin, who rules them,/And the princes of Judah in their company, /The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali
Whereas Rachel named her son Benoni, Jacob immediately changed the child's name to Benjamin, which means 'son of the right hand'
Judah, as the kingly tribe, was accompanied always by Benjamin, as a warrior tribe , for God's kingdom on the earth
With Benjamin the emphasis is on the accomplishment of redemption; with Judah the emphasis is on the application of redemption
On the day of Pentecost, at least one hundred and twenty gospel 'ships,' all of whom were Galileans, set out to spread the gospel
People of both Zebulun and Naphtali were men of Galilee , from whom the gospel of Christ has been spread, preached, and propagated
God will also deal with the nations, who are likened to herds of the bulls among the calves and who lust for silver and delight in war
They are charged also to ascribe strength to God, whose excellence is over Israel and whose strength is in the skies
Psalm 69 is on the suffering Christ typified by the suffering David, and Psalm 72 is on the reigning Christ typified by the reigning Solomon
While the Lord Jesus was suffering on the cross, He said, 'I thirst,' and mockingly they gave Him vinegar to drink
In verse 6b he says My praise is continually of You and in verse 8 he declares My mouth is full of Your praise With Your glory all day long
The reigning Christ is typified in Psalm 72 by the reigning Solomon, the son of David , in his prosperous and flourishing time
He will have pity on the weak and needy and will save the souls of the needy, redeeming their soul from oppression
He shall live and to Him shall be givenThe gold of Sheba And prayer shall be made continually for HimHe shall be blessed all the day long
Its fruit will wave like the forests of Lebanon,/And those of the city will blossom like the foliage of the earth'
His name will be foreverAs long as the sun endures His name will spreadAnd men will be blessed in HimAll the nations will call Him blessed
It is, of course, not wrong to use Job as a pattern of suffering with endurance; however, this understanding of Job is shallow
Much of this book is the record of a long debate involving several parties: Job, his wife, his three friends, and Elihu
The concept that we need to fear God keep the law of God and be just and righteous is wrong for it is not according to the divine revelation
It is worthwhile for us to study the Psalms to appreciate Christ but not to appreciate other matters such as trusting in God
Since we have been crucified and Christ now lives in us, it is no longer a matter of 'I' fearing God or trusting in Him
To be perfect outside of Christ is wrong, and God condemns this kind of perfection just as He condemns imperfection
The church is helping you to remain in your tomb so that you will no longer be the one living but that Christ will be the One living in you
Whereas many of us are remaining in Job or in the Psalms, we need to be brought by these two books into the New Testament economy
If you make such a comparison, you will realize that Paul's Epistles are vastly superior to Job and the Psalms
These are the virtues of a dead person, and God does not want them, for they are something of Adam and in Adam
God wants only those virtues that are in Christ and of Christ, the virtues that come by living Christ and magnifying Christ
God's economy is to terminate us and to put us into the tomb so that we may receive Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God
It is a great thing to see that we have been crucified and that it is no longer we who live but that it is Christ who lives in us
If we realize this, we will care only for Christ, and we will eagerly receive the revelation in Paul's Epistles concerning Christ
In Genesis 1 we have a history of God's creation, but in that chapter we cannot see much of the divine revelation
Those who hold this concept need to consider the Lords word in John 161215 I have yet many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now
In particular Paul completed the word of God in regard to the mystery of God which is Christ and the mystery of Christ which is the church
Revelation 22:18 and 19 tell us that, since the divine revelation has been completed, no one is allowed to add to it or take away from it
The apostles' teaching began with the teaching of the Lord Jesus and continued with Peter, John, Paul, and the other apostles
Today's Christians commonly say that every word of the Bible from Genesis 1:1 through Revelation 22:21 is the word of God
Surely, the word of the serpent to Eve in Genesis 3 is not a word by God, and it would be a great mistake to say that it is
How much of the divine revelation is unveiled in a particular expression depends on the kind of sentiment conveyed by that expression
Certainly David's expression of his sentiment of hatred for his enemies should not be considered something of the divine revelation
Let us now go on to consider Psalms 73 through 76, which are concerned with the desolation of God's house and Christ as the solution
Their failure to give Christ the preeminence, their failure to honor and exalt Him, was the cause of their becoming sinful and evil
The desolation of the church as the house of God always issues from the negligence of the experience of Christ
The real revival in the church depends upon everyone in the church life giving Christ the first place in everything
If we are clear concerning the problem of desolation and its solution, we may now go on to consider Psalms 73 through 76 one by one
Psalm 1 says that the one who keeps the law will be blessed, but in Psalm 73 we see a law-keeper who was plagued
Having gone into the sanctuary of God, the psalmist could perceive that the wicked were set in slippery places to be cast down into ruins
Psalm 73 ends with these words: 'My flesh and my heart fails,/But God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever'
Whereas Psalm 73 is on the sufferings of the seeking saints, Psalm 74 is on the desolation of the house of God
Verses 1 through 11 are the psalmist's painful presentation of the perpetual ruins and damages in the sanctuary of God
He seemed to be saying, 'O God, You must regard the covenant which You made with our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
The basis for my speaking here is the fact that, according to John 5:22, God has given all judgment to Christ the Son
Verses 1 through 5 are a declaration concerning the victory of God, as the glorious and excellent One, in His tabernacle
Verse 4 speaks of God's excellence and glory: 'More glorious are You,/More excellent than the mountains of prey'
If as we study the Psalms we stand on the shoulders of Paul, we will have a clear view of all one hundred and fifty psalms
In particular, these psalms reveal the way of restoration, showing us that the way to be restored is to exalt Christ
According to the history recorded in these psalms, the ark of God was captured once and was probably lost eventually
One day, when the people of Israel went out to fight against the Philistines, they brought with them the ark of the covenant
In Psalm 77 we are told that God's way is in the sanctuary and His way is in the sea and His paths are in the great waters
The Bible tells us that God will never forsake us , but in our experience it sometimes seems to us that He does forsake us
He admits that it was his infirmity that he was puzzled and complained to God because God had cast off His people for awhile
When the psalmist could not sleep during the night, he mused upon the great things God had done for His people
The temple had been destroyed, the city had been devastated, and many of the people had been either killed or taken captive
Without paying attention to our spirit and to the church, we cannot know God's way, which is revealed in His sanctuary
In this slogan the word 'spirit' refers to our regenerated human spirit, and the word 'ground' denotes the ground of the church
Many of us can testify that certain secrets in the Bible were unknown to us until we went into this twofold sanctuary
He chose Mount Zion, which He loved, and 'He built His sanctuary like the heights,/Like the earth that He has founded forever'
In both verse 3 and verse 7, he prayed, 'O God, restore us;/And cause Your face to shine, and we will be saved'
In verses 8 through 13 the psalmist speaks regarding God's dealing with Israel as His vine, which He brought out of Egypt and planted
In verses 14 through 19 the psalmist asks God to visit His vine for the sake of Christ as the Man of His right hand
The vine which God had brought out of Egypt and planted in the good land became evil, and God took away its protection
We can have revival among us only if we exalt Christ, letting Him have the preeminence and giving Him the first place in everything
As regenerated people we need to come together in the meetings of the church to exalt Christ by praising, singing, and shouting
God's intention is to get the earth for Christ's inheritance, and Satan's plot is to take God's habitation in possession
The annual feasts, as well as the Sabbatical year and the year of Jubilee, are times of rejoicing, singing, and shouting
Psalm 82:1-7 reveals that God judges in the midst of the judges because of their unjust judgment over the poor and the orphan
In Old Testament times, the judges were the priests, who knew God's law and who represented God to judge God's people
The word in 82:8 applies to Christ, the One appointed to judge the earth and the One worthy to inherit all the nations
Satan's plot is to take God's habitation in possession through the nations who conspire against God's hidden ones
In this message we will consider Psalm 84, which is concerned with the psalmist's love for the house of God with Christ
The main difference is that whereas the psalmists experienced God's dealing and stripping, Job also experienced God's consuming
My soul longs, indeed even faints,/For the courts of Jehovah;/My heart and my flesh cry out/For the living God'
The brass altar, on which all kinds of offerings were offered, was in the outer court before the door of the tabernacle
It was at the cross, therefore, that all our problems were solved, and it was at the cross that we first believed in the Lord Jesus
The golden altar for incense in front of the Holy of Holies is where God's people are accepted by God in peace
Before Christ's death there was a veil separating the Holy of Holies, where the ark was, from the Holy Place, where the golden altar was
The fact that Exodus 40:5 and 6 mention the golden altar together with the brass altar indicates that these two altars are closely related
As a result of our experience at this altar, we are clean and are qualified to enter into the tabernacle to contact God at the incense altar
Like a swallow coming to the nest where she may lay her young, we may come to the cross of Christ as our refuge
It is here, at the cross, that we have our nest, our refuge, and it is here that we 'lay our young,' that is, produce our spiritual children
Before contacting the cross they were sinners, but by contacting the cross they become believers, young children in the Lord
We have pointed out that this psalm on the psalmist's love for the house of God with Christ speaks of God's tabernacles and God's house
When we come to the church, the house of God, we are attracted by the two altars, both of which are very striking
At the brass altar we meet the crucified Christ, but at the golden altar the crucified Christ becomes the ascended Christ
Revelation 8:3 indicates that in order for our prayer to be accepted by God, it must have Christ as the incense added to it
The psalmist speaks of one who stands at the threshold, which is the dividing line between the inside and the outside
If we take the highway to go to God's house, trouble and persecution will come to us, and such things will cause us to weep
Those tears became a spring; the spring became the Spirit as the early rain; and as a result this brother was very living
The tears they shed are their own, but these tears become a spring, which becomes the early rain, the Spirit as the blessing
Those who take the highway to Zion already have strength in God, and now they are strengthened further and thus go from strength to strength
The psalmist prayed concerning David, saying that he was the shield to protect them and that he was God's anointed
In verse 11d 'those who walk uprightly' probably refers, in the complex sentiments of the psalmist, to those who keep the law
In verse 12 the man who trusts in You probably refers also in the complex sentiments of the psalmist to the man who dwells in Gods house
Do you believe that it is because we walk uprightly that we today enjoy Christ as our sun, shield, grace, and glory?
The intrinsic content of Psalm 84 is the secret revelation concerning the enjoyment of the incarnated Triune God
The Old Testament indicates that God is triune , but the God unveiled in the Old Testament is not the incarnated Triune God
As the firstborn Son of God, begotten in resurrection, He has humanity as well as divinity, the human nature as well as the divine nature
Samson is a typical example of one who received the power of God from the Spirit of God but did not have anything related to God's life
When He ascended to the heavens, another altar was established, the golden altar of incense for God to accept what Christ has brought to Him
The fourth aspect consists of the blessings of dwelling in the house of God to enjoy God as the sun, the shield, the grace, and the glory
We have pointed out that in Psalm 84 there is a secret revelation concerning our enjoyment of the incarnated Triune God
Although many Christians talk about and even debate regarding the Trinity, not many enjoy the incarnated Triune God
We need to see that Christ is not only the embodiment of God but also that Christ is the incarnated Triune God
To answer this question we need to see that Gods goal is not to solve our problems Gods goal is to make us the old creation the new creation
Titus 3:5 says that God has saved us 'through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit'
After we have experienced the altar and the laver, we are qualified to enter into the incarnated God, signified by the tabernacle
When we enter into Him, we have the showbread table for the life supply and the lampstand for the light of life
There was a veil separating the incense altar in the Holy Place from the ark of the testimony in the Holy of Holies
The New Testament, from Matthew 1 through Revelation 22, covers the entire span of the incarnation of the Triune God
In the first chapter of the New Testament we have the individual Christ, but in the last chapter we have the corporate Christ
Today we all are 'swallows' who have suffered from storms, wind, rain, snow, and the burning sun and who need a nest, a refuge
Verse 11 speaks of those who walk uprightly, and verse 12 concludes, 'O Jehovah of hosts, blessed is the man/Who trusts in You'
The 'man who trusts in You' refers probably, in the sentiments of the psalmist, to the man who dwells in the house of God
The background in Psalms 85 86 and 88 involves three things the restoration of Gods people personal salvation and release from sufferings
If they do care for God, their concern is related mainly to restoration, personal salvation, and release from sufferings
In verse 4 the psalmist prays, 'Restore us, O God of our salvation,/And cause Your indignation toward us to cease'
Eventually, however, the sons of Korah experienced God's punishment and the desolation and degradation of God's people
David's seeking for his personal salvation was important; however, it was important not for itself but for something else
The fact that the New Jerusalem will have twelve gates indicates that God's holy city will be full of fellowship
Recently, for the sake of fellowship among the churches, the Lord has led us to practice the clustering and the blending
Psalm 87 unveils Christ with all the saints to be God's house for God's city and for God to gain the whole earth
Verses 5 and 6 say, 'Of Zion it will be said,/This one and that one were born in her,/And the Most High Himself will establish her
In addition to those born in Zion, Psalm 87 speaks of people born in five other places: Rahab, Babylon, Philistia, Tyre, and Cush
When there was a famine in Canaan and people were short of food, they went down to Egypt, a land of riches signifying today's world
Today there are many people who are not in the holy things but are very close to these things and have their human way to handle them
According to the Bible and to history, Tyre was a commercial country, a country of merchandise and of high civilization
Moses, Joshua, David, Elijah, Peter, Paul, Luther, Calvin, Wesley, Zinzendorf, Darby, Watchman Nee, and so many others were born in Zion
We today may be the unknown ones, but we can sing and praise the Lord, saying of Zion, the city of God, 'All my springs are in you'
Like Heman, many Christians today are suffering ones, and to them nothing is more important than release from their suffering
Psalm 89, especially verses 3-4, 19-29, and 34-37, unveils the intention of God for Christ, His Anointed, to possess the entire earth
The unique One in God's record in Psalm 87 has become God's anointed One, God's Holy One, God's mighty One, in Psalm 89
All the parts of the earth are signified by their rivers, such as Egypt by the Nile and Babylon by the Euphrates
Psalm 89 is a lengthy psalm revealing that God cares for nothing other than Christ as the unique Possessor of the whole earth
We, however, regard certain spiritual things restoration, personal salvation, release from suffering as very positive
Psalm 84 unveils Christ as the house of God with the two altars for the 'sparrows' and the 'swallows,' that is, for the weak ones
We may be weak 'sparrows' and 'swallows,' but we enjoy the incarnated Triune God with the two altars as His two great consummations
Psalm 89 unveils Christ as God's Anointed to possess the entire earth, with His territory extending from the sea to all the rivers
The processed and consummated Triune God is revealed in the Psalms, and the enjoyment of God's chosen people is also revealed here
The division of the Psalms into these five books is not according to chronological order that is it is not according to the time of writing
Psalms 90 92 are in one category; Psalms 93 101 are in a second category; and Psalms 102 106 are in a third category
It is hard to say how the Psalms were divided into five books, but we can be sure that this arrangement was not made by the human mind
In this message, entitled 'The Saints' Deeper Experience of God in the Identification with Christ,' we will consider Psalms 90 through 92
As we read these psalms, we need to seek what they reveal about the deeper experience of God and about the identification with Christ
Psalm 90 opens with a word concerning God as our dwelling place: 'O Lord, You have been our dwelling place/In all generations'
In Psalm 36 the river of God's pleasures is for our drinking, and the fatness of God's house is for our eating
When we experience the Triune God to the degree that we take Him as our dwelling place, we have the deeper experience of God
As we have indicated, Psalms 90 through 92 are about the saints' deeper experience of God in the identification with Christ
To answer this question we need to read 91:9: 'You have made Jehovah, who is my refuge,/Even the Most High, Your habitation'
Moses, the writer of Psalm 90, took Jehovah as his dwelling place, and the writer of Psalm 91 did the same thing
Moses, the lawgiver, and Christ, the grace-giver, were the same in taking God as their dwelling place, as their habitation
A number of good books have been written on our identification with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension
Austin-Sparks, the identification with Christ in His resurrection; and Brother Nee, the identification with Christ in His ascension
If we drink Christ, eat Christ, and breathe Christ without taking Christ as our habitation, God has no way to recover the earth
As we have pointed out, verses 1 and 2 speak of the saints' taking God from eternity to eternity as their dwelling place
According to the Bible, the person who lived the longest was Methuselah; he lived nine hundred sixty-nine years
In the identification with Christ, we are under the keeping care of the angels, and we tread upon the enemy Satan
Psalm 91:13 says, 'You will tread upon the lion and the cobra;/You will trample the young lion and the serpent'
Christ has been exalted to the highest place in the heavens and He is now seeing Gods salvation in the extension of His days in resurrection
We will be one with Christ in His crucifixion, in His resurrection, in His ascension, and in His taking God as His habitation
If we do not dwell in God, not taking God as our habitation, we may see many things, but these things will be insignificant
In verse 10 the psalmist says, 'You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox;/I am anointed with fresh oil'
Psalm 92:12 through 14 says, 'The righteous man will flourish like the palm tree;/He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon
We need to realize that the Psalms is a book which is very strong concerning the unveiling of Christ in God's economy
The second group, Psalms 93 through 101, shows us that God will recover His full title and right over the earth through the reign of Christ
Christ is with us in the church, but today's world is without Christ, and for this reason the world is evil, dark, and sinful
Let us now consider some matters related to God's possessing the earth through Christ and then look one by one at Psalms 93 through 101
Revelation 1012 shows us that Christ will come to take possession of the earth by putting His right foot on the sea and the left on the land
Christ's placing His feet on the sea and on the land is His treading on them, and to tread on them is to take possession of them
When God recovers His title and right over the earth through the reign of Christ, the earth will no longer be shaken but will be established
Because there is a great deal of injustice on earth today, there is the need for the God of vengeance to shine forth
Apparently this is not happening today, for it may seem that God is not doing anything regarding world affairs
The word 'peoples' in verses 3, 5, 7, 10, and 13 indicates that people of every race and color will be judged by Him
Verses 2 and 3 say, 'Jehovah has made His salvation known;/In the sight of the nations/He has revealed His righteousness
He remembered His lovingkindness and His faithfulnessToward the house of IsraelAll the ends of the earth have seenThe salvation of our God
It seems that this psalm does not belong to this section concerning God's recovery of the earth through Christ's reign
When Christ reigns on earth in the coming age, lovingkindness and justice will be the base of His reign and judgment over the earth
Remember, the 'I' here is the word of David, a type of Christ, indicating that this word is the word of Christ to God
These saints were very close to God, and they had much thought and consideration concerning God and God's interest
These four matters Christ, God's house, God's city, and the coming restoration are the essential elements, the inner essences, of the Bible
The Bible begins with God's existence and then goes on to speak of God's creation, which has certain indications concerning Christ
In this message we come to another group of psalms, consisting of Psalms 102 through 106, which is somewhat hard to understand
The psalmist, a godly one, was suffering because of the destruction and devastation of Zion with the temple and the holy city
The second section of this psalm presents us a picture of the restoration of the destroyed and devastated temple and city of Jerusalem
Christ's suffering consummated in His death, and through His death the church, God's house, came into existence
Israel passed through a time of destruction and devastation, and the people of Israel were captured and carried away to captivity in Babylon
In our study of Psalm 84 we saw that the 'highways to Zion' mentioned in this psalm are the highways of the church life
If we have insight into this psalm, we will see that Christ's suffering and death are not only for redemption but also for restoration
It is in Christs resurrection by Christs resurrection and through Christs resurrection that the church will consummate in the restoration
We need to study these psalms, as well as all the psalms, with much prayer and with much consideration of the Holy Word
Let us now consider Psalm 102 in more detail and then go on to consider the narration of God's history in Psalms 103 through 106
The title of Psalm 102 is 'A Prayer of an afflicted one, when he is fainting and he pours out his complaint before Jehovah'
He went to the housetop where he poured out his complaint to God, asking Him to look upon Zion, the city, and the temple
In the upcoming messages on Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, we will see that these books are a record of the history of God's elect
Even though the record of the history of Israel in Joshua, Judges, and Ruth is disappointing, there was nevertheless a line that was for God
For a while, at the time of the judges, this line consisted of only two persons Boaz, a Jew, and Ruth, a Moabitess
Today in spite of the degradation and devastation of the church God still has a line that is for Christ and for this we should worship Him
Psalm 103 speaks of Gods history in His lovingkindness and compassions in His forgiving of sins healing redeeming and caring of His people
In verse 5 the psalmist continues, 'He satisfies the prime of your life with good,/So that your youth is renewed like the eagle'
To the experienced ones God makes His ways known, and to the younger ones, to the children, He makes His acts known
Verses 12 through 14 declare, 'As far as the east is from the west,/So far has He removed our transgressions from us
In our reading of the Psalms, it is difficult for us to stay away from the godliness and the comfort that we see in this book
If we read the Psalms in the way of seeking godliness and comfort, our reading of this book will not consummate in hallelujahs
There are many verses in the Psalms concerning godliness, and there are many verses through which we may find comfort
If we have Christ, even though we do not think about godliness and comfort, we will enjoy godliness and we will participate in much comfort
The Psalms were composed not only by David but by a number of different writers, including Moses and some of the sons of Korah
As the cornerstone, Christ joins the two walls, one wall being the Jewish believers and the other, the Gentile believers
If we consider Psalms 118 and 119 together, we will see that Christ is both the cornerstone and the testimony of God
As we come to Psalms 107 through 110, we need to realize that the last psalm in this group, Psalm 110, is on Christ in the highest way
In order to have the highest revelation of Christ in Psalm 110, we need the three psalms that come immediately before it
Verses 10 through 16 tell us of God's care and deliverance of the prisoners in darkness and the shadow of death
According to Acts 26:18, the Lord Jesus sent Paul to turn the Gentiles 'from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God'
Verse 17 says, 'Some were fools, because of their way of transgression; /And because of their iniquities, they were afflicted'
We all are seafarers traveling on a human sea that is full of waves and storms, but here also we experience God's care and deliverance
Verses 33 and 34 tell us that God turns rivers into a wilderness, springs of water into thirsty ground, and fruitful land into a salt flat
Today we can enjoy God's care, and we can be delivered by Him from so many things because Christ is sitting there at God's right hand
Because Christ is our High Priest in the heavens praying for us, this care is His care for us and this deliverance is His deliverance of us
Verse 4 unveils God's lovingkindness and truth: 'Your lovingkindness is higher than the heavens,/And Your truth reaches to the sky'
You may offer a child the best seat in a palace, but he will not care to be in that place if his mother is not there
According to Psalm 110:1, Christ is sitting at God's right hand until God makes Christ's enemies His footstool
Hebrews 12:22 says that we have 'come forward to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem'
Do you realize that in the eyes of the Lord our willing consecration, our offering ourselves to Him, is a kind of splendor?
Christ is not only the King with power and authority, as indicated in verse 2; He is also the High Priest, as revealed in verse 4
Today we need Christ not only as our King but also as our Priest to pray for us and to take care of our case before God
He will execute judgment among the nations;/He will fill the place with corpses;/He will shatter the head/Over a great land'
As Christ is taking the lead to fight through to the end, He will need water to drink, and this water will be the overcomers
Psalm 110 is on Christ as the exalted One, as the One who in His ascension has been uplifted to the right hand of God in heaven
In addition to the dew, which is moisture for comforting, Christ needs to drink of the brook flowing by the way
When we come to this psalm, we will consider a number of verses related to Christ as the cornerstone for God's building
In the next message we will see that Psalm 119 is on Christ's being the reality of the law as the testimony and the word of God
The one hundred seventy-six verses of Psalm 119, arranged in twenty-two sections of eight verses each, are on Christ as the law
Toward the beginning of the Psalms, in Psalm 2, the Spirit turns the reader of the Psalms from the law to Christ
The law is a portrait of God, and eventually this portrait is not merely the Ten Commandments but a living person, Christ
After Psalm 119, which closes something and also opens something, there is no further revelation in the Psalms concerning Christ
If you consider all the points regarding Christ in the Psalms, you will see that the Psalms present us a particular picture of Christ
The title of this message on Psalms 111 through 118 is 'The Praise of God's Elect Consummating in the Particular Position of Christ'
These psalms, therefore, are psalms of praises to God, and these praises consummate in a particular position of Christ
As we consider these psalms, we will see that the praises in them are different from the praises in the foregoing psalms
In Psalm 111 we have the praise of God's elect for God's great works according to His covenant which He made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
In verse 5b we are told that He remembers His covenant forever, and in verse 9, that He has commanded His covenant forever
Psalm 112 is the praise of God's elect for God's blessing due to their fear of Him and their virtues thereof, mainly in giving to the poor
Psalm 113 is the praise of God's elect for God's exaltation and humility in taking care of the lowly and needy ones
Who is like Jehovah our God,/Who has set His throne on high,/Who humbles Himself to behold/The heavens and the earth'?
If we compare these verses with Philippians 2:7-11, we will see that Christ humbled Himself and, due to His humility, He was exalted
They have hands, but they do not feel;/They have feet, but they do not walk;/They make no sound in their throat'
They praised and thanked God in the presence of all God's people, in the courts of His house, and in the midst of Jerusalem
They praised and thanked Him for His salvation, deliverance, preservation, bountiful dealing, and abundant benefits
Psalm 117 is the exhortation of God's elect to all the nations to praise Jehovah for His great lovingkindness and everlasting faithfulness
Only God is good, as indicated by the word of the Lord Jesus to the young man in Mark 10, who had addressed Him as 'Good Teacher'
Although Christ was the stone given to them by God, they rejected Him to such an extent that they put Him on the cross
Although Christ was rejected by Israel as the builders of God, in resurrection God made Him the cornerstone for God's building
In Isaiah 28:16 Christ is unveiled as the foundation stone; in Zechariah 4:7, as the topstone; and in Psalm 118:22, as the cornerstone
There is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved'
Without Christ's being the cornerstone, we could not have been made alive with Him and seated with Him in the heavenlies
We still need to see from Psalm 118 that Christ is the stone rejected by the builders but honored by God as the cornerstone
If Christ were not the cornerstone, He could not have died for us and for our sins, and He could not have died with us
Everything He is, everything He has done, and everything He is doing is due to the fact that He is the cornerstone
In Acts 4 we see that as the cornerstone He is the Savior, and in Ephesians 2 we see that as the cornerstone He is the building factor
Often, while the psalmists were expressing their complex sentiments, something suddenly came forth as a revelation concerning Christ
In the meetings, let us exercise our spirit and open our mouth to rejoice in the Lord and to praise Him for His being made the cornerstone
The prosperity mentioned in Psalm 118:25 is not material; rather, it refers to rich blessings that are heavenly, spiritual, and divine
That was the time when Christ was warmly welcomed by the people in Jerusalem who said, 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord'!
After Christ came in the name of Jehovah the first time, He was rejected by the Jews, and today they still will not welcome Him
When He comes back, the Jews will give Him a warm welcome and say, 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord'
In both the Old Testament and the New Testament there is a strong basis for saying that the law in its reality is Christ
The law of God the Ten Commandments with the many statutes, ordinances, and judgments is a portrait of the person of God
These are the commandments about not killing, not committing adultery, not stealing, not lying, and not coveting
We may use five words to summarize these five commandments: murder, adultery, stealing, lying, and covetousness
We have pointed out that the Ten Commandments portray God as the One who is a God of jealousy, love, light, holiness, and righteousness
All these terms from 'law' to 'precepts' consummate in the 'way' or 'ways' , signifying Christ as the way of God to His people
Instead of trembling before the law of letters, you will be happy to be fed with every part of the law as the word, the breath, of God
Every item of the law with its statutes and ordinances exposes our shortcomings, defects, dishonesty, and unfaithfulness
Also, the commandment about keeping the Sabbath may expose our not resting regularly according to God's ordination
The Lord Jesus is the door of the sheepfold , and through Him all those who were in the sheepfold could come out
If this is our attitude toward the Bible today, then whenever we come to the Bible we will have the sense deep within that we are with God
As we read the Bible we will touch God, knowing that He is loving and that it is surely worthwhile for us to love Him and to seek Him
We all should regard the Bible as the living word of God which dispenses God Himself into us as our life and light
If we seek God in this way, we will not regard the law as letters but as a portrait of God which bears His countenance
We see that the psalmist lovingly sought God in an intimate way, even asking Him to cause His face to shine upon him
These verses prove that the psalmist thought of God's law as His living and loving word breathed out of God's mouth
In Psalm 119 many different verbs are used to express the attitude of the God-seekers toward God's law as God's testimony and God's word
To lift up our hand unto the word of God is to indicate that we receive it warmly and gladly and that we say 'amen' to it
To the psalmist the law was not merely a list of commandments; it was also a word full of enjoyment and life supply
In verse 6 the psalmist said that he regarded God's commandments, and in verse 117, that he regarded God's statutes
He treasured it as much as all riches , as great spoil , better than gold and silver , and as a heritage forever
If we treasure up the word in our heart, we will remember it; we will call back, or recall, our enjoyment of it
The psalmist said that he did not forsake God's word, did not swerve from it, did not turn aside from it, and did not go astray from it
These twenty-six items reveal the attitude of the God-seekers toward God's law as God's testimony and as God's word
In this message we will begin to consider a particular group of psalms, Psalms 120 through 134, which are known as the Psalms of Ascents
As the people were suffering in captivity, they forgot many things, but they could not forget Zion and Jerusalem
Because of their experiences, the saints could not forget Zion and Jerusalem, and in their praises they did not neglect them
To answer this question we need to see that when the people of Israel were captured, they were in a downward situation
They had to climb, to ascend, the hill of Zion, and as they were ascending they sang a song of ascents, a song of degrees
As a result of our experiences of the ups and the downs, we will no longer uplift the law, appreciating it in a natural way
Psalm 120 is the praise of a saint in his going up to Zion concerning Jehovah's deliverance of him from his distress
How could a godly Israelite have been in Meshech, a place far to the north, and in Kedar, a place to the south?
The answer must be that the psalmist was among the godly Jews who had been taken into captivity by the Assyrians
Verse 6 may indicate that his captivity was for a long time: 'Long has my soul had its dwelling/With him who hates peace'
Those who hated peace were first the Assyrians and later the Babylonians and the Persians, both of whom invaded Israel
Because these invaders also were liars, the psalmist prayed, 'O Jehovah, deliver my soul from lying lips,/From a tongue of deceit'
Psalm 121 is the praise of the saint in his going up to Zion concerning Jehovah's keeping of him from all evil, disasters
The country was in confusion, and because of the threat of attack by Japanese airplanes, it was a fearful thing to travel by train
Psalm 122 is the praise of the saint in his going up to Zion concerning his love of the house of God in Jerusalem
Verse 7 indicates that the psalmist is concerned not for his own comfort but for the peace and prosperity of Jerusalem
Psalm 123 is the praise of the saint in his going up to Zion concerning God's compassion on the returned captives
While they were undergoing such an experience they could not forget Zion and Jerusalem and when they returned they ascended the hill of Zion
Psalm 124 is the praise of Israel in their going up to Zion concerning Jehovah's help in the invasions of their enemies
The psalmist said that if Jehovah had not been on their side, the proud waters would have passed over their soul
Psalm 125 is the praise of the saints in their going up to Zion concerning Jehovah's surrounding of His people
In verse 1 the psalmist says that those who trust in Jehovah are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but abides forever
Verse 2 tells us that as the mountains surround Jerusalem, so Jehovah surrounds His people from now to eternity
The psalmist continues by saying that Jehovah judges righteously those upright in their hearts and those turning aside to their crooked ways
The expression 'the good' indicates that the psalmist's concept was still according to the principle of good and evil
Psalm 126 is the praise of the returned captives in their going up to Zion concerning the great things which Jehovah had done for them
He who goes forth and weeps, / Bearing seed for scattering, /Will no doubt come in with a ringing shout,/Bearing his sheaves with him'
Psalm 127 is the praise of the saints in their going up to Zion concerning Jehovah's care for and blessing to His people
Unless the Lord keeps the city that is, keeps the church as the kingdom those who guard the church watch in vain
It is vain for you to rise up early,/To lie down late,/To eat the bread of toil;/All the same, He gives to His beloved while they sleep'
Of toiling and striving in ourselves, we need to trust in Him, for He gives to His beloved even while they sleep
In verse 3 the psalmist says that children are the heritage of Jehovah and that the fruit of the womb is a reward
Psalm 128 speaks of Jehovah's blessing to Israel from Zion and the prosperity of Jerusalem in Israel's enjoyment
Zion, the highest peak of that range of mountains, signifies the overcomers in the church, the higher ones among the believers
Israel is God's elect, and God deals with those who persecute His people, but this does not mean that Israel is perfect and sinless
After we are enlightened concerning our real situation, make a thorough confession, and receive God's forgiveness, we become humble
When our heart is humbled and our soul is quiet, we are in a condition that is suitable for God to come in to rest
Only when we are humble, calm, and quiet is the situation right for God to rise up, enter into us, and take us as His resting place
When God has His rest, His dwelling place, in Zion, we can come to Him in Zion and dwell there in unity with the brothers
Finally, in Psalm 134 the children of Israel first charge the priests to praise God in the night, and then they bless the priests
Whereas the priests taught and blessed the children of Israel, here the children of Israel teach and bless the priests
We enjoy God's blessing from Zion and the prosperity of Jerusalem, and then God deals with those who persecute us and hate us
As a result, we become Mount Zion; that is, we become the highest people, those who are even higher than the priests
Psalm 129 is the praise of the saint in his going up to Zion concerning the persecutors of Israel and the haters of Zion
Many times the persecutors have afflicted the believers since the beginning of their Christian life but they have not prevailed against them
Psalm 131 is the praise of the saint in his going up to Zion concerning his humbled heart and quieted soul before Jehovah
The psalmist continues by saying that he has calmed and quieted his soul within him, like a weaned child with its mother
Psalm 132 is the praise of the saint in his going up to Zion concerning Jehovah's habitation and rest in Zion through David His anointed
In verse 1 the psalmist asks Jehovah to remember all of David's afflictions, which typify all the afflictions of Christ
Psalm 133 is the praise of the saint in his going up to Zion concerning Jehovah's commanded blessing for brothers to dwell in unity
It is like the fine oil upon the head/That ran down upon the beard,/Upon Aaron's beard,/That ran down to the hem of his garments'
God always blesses His people from Zion from the highest peak from the ones who have attained to the top to the position of the overcomers
The ark of the testimony was put into the Holy of Holies of the tabernacle, which is called the tabernacle of the testimony
The Bible does not say that the law was put into the ark; rather, the Bible tells us that the testimony was put into the ark
The remaining sixteen psalms may be clustered into three groups Psalms 135 through 139, Psalms 140 through 145, and Psalms 146 through 150
Psalm 135 and Psalms 146 through 150 are 'hallelujah' psalms, for each of these psalms begins and ends with 'Hallelujah'
Psalm 135, a hallelujah psalm, stands alone, whereas Psalms 146 through 150, five other hallelujah psalms, are grouped together
When some hear this, they may wonder about Psalm 137 and ask, 'Are not the remembrance of Zion and the non-forgetting of Zion crucial'?
The title of this message on Psalms 135 through 139 is 'The Expressions of the Saints before Jehovah in Different Directions'
Psalms 135 through 139 were written from different directions to express before God the sentiments of the psalmists
Praise the name of Jehovah;/Praise Him, you servants of Jehovah,/Who stand in the house of Jehovah,/In the courts of the house of our God
Verse 4 says not only that God chose Jacob for Himself but also that He chose Israel for His personal treasure
We have a comparison between our God, who is particular, and the gods, the idols, who cannot speak, see, or hear
He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth;/He makes lightning for the rain;/He brings forth wind from His treasuries'
Jehovah smote the nations and the kings so that He might give their lands as an inheritance to Israel His people
Verses 19 and 20 are the charge to the house of Israel the house of Aaron and the house of Levi all of whom feared Jehovah to bless Jehovah
The subject of Psalm 136 is the charging of the people to give thanks to Jehovah for His everlasting lovingkindness
Verses 2 through 4 are a charge to give thanks to the God of gods and the Lord of lords, to Him who alone does great and wondrous deeds
In order to write such a psalm, the psalmist had to be a person who was very close to God and who cared for God's interests
O daughter of Babylon, who are to be devastated,/Happy will he be who repays you/The recompense of what you have rendered to us
We should not curse them or ask God to punish them, for in the New Testament dispensation we are not permitted to do such things
The psalmist then thanked Jehovah for His lovingkindness and truth in magnifying His word of promise above all in His great glory
He was assured that in the midst of trouble Jehovah would preserve him and that He would save him from his enemies
Seemingly this psalm does not contain anything significant, but it reveals something precious concerning the psalmist's intimacy with God
In order to write this short psalm, the psalmist had to be a person who was soaked with God and who was in the divine presence
Verses 19 through 22 describe the psalmist's hating and loathing the wickedness of the wicked according to the principle of good and evil
Finally, in verses 23 and 24 the psalmist asked God to search him and try him and then to lead him on the eternal way

Although these psalms are common, they nevertheless show us one striking thing that David, the writer, was very close to God
