   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Excuses 5:3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 3 says, "I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The call in verse 2 is beyond many believers' expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They do not realize that there is the aspect of shame to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are not inexperienced as to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They may have had deep experiences of the cross already.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although they have suffered a little for the cross and met some persecution and shame, they have always felt that the cross was their glory, their life, and their power.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It never occurred to them that the cross would become their shame, that they would not only lose worldly fame, but also their spiritual renown, that others would consider that God has rejected them, and that God would put them through trials and strip them of comfort and sympathy from those whom they know, who would think that they were smitten by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They may have suffered shame from the world, but spiritual shame is something new to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of misunderstanding will touch their feeling in a deep way, because it has to do with the relationship between God and them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only then will they know what it means to "fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ" Col 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How unfamiliar is this calling, yet how cruel!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No wonder many shrink back.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The maiden may think that God's glory is more important than everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the past, she may have tried to glorify God's name in her life and work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If God allows her to be misunderstood, stripped of her good name, shamed, and considered by others as being in an argument with God, how can she glorify Him any longer?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps she is not thinking of herself as much as she is thinking of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But she does not realize that her concerns revolve around how she can glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She must be stripped by God to the point that even this good self-intention to glorify God is removed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The cross must work so deeply on her until she is content with the portion that God has allotted for her and until she lets God take care of His own glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With those who have heard such a calling, there may be another problem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They may be concerned about God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through the cross they have experienced, others have been attracted to them to learn of the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The maiden's past experience of the cross made her a channel of life; those who wanted to follow the Lord had to go to her.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if she answers this new call and allows the cross to bring her to the place of shame, will she not lose her position and opportunities in the work?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The past experiences of the cross have attracted others to her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Will not the future experience of the cross turn people away from her?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Will anyone draw near to her again?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Will anyone want to learn the way of the cross from her?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These thoughts may bring hesitation to her footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, she answers, "I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In her outward walk, the cross has put off the old man with its deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Should she rise up to accept the loneliness and shame of the cross and to bear the misunderstanding, like putting on a coat that she has put off?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is it not enough for a person to experience the cross to the extent of being genuinely delivered from the old man?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many believers who have reached this stage do not see that there are two aspects to the cross, the negative aspect and the positive aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The maiden knows resurrection and the cross, but she only knows the negative aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Her attention is on the cross's work in dealing with the old creation; she does not see how the cross also deals with the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She only sees the cross in its work of deliverance; she does not see the cross in its work of initiation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She may misunderstand and think that these works belong to the realm of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, they belong to the realm of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the positive side, the cross brings a stamp of shame, suffering, and misunderstanding to the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus' life is a life in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet do we not see a mark of suffering in Him that comes from the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have taken a bath and are clean before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we walk through the world, we come into contact with the dust and dirt of the world, yet we are cleansed through a continual cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The maiden may think that she needs to preserve her cleanliness, to no longer defile herself, and to not give the appearance that she has stopped progressing but is regressing instead.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All that she sees is the preservation of her own cleanliness; she does not see that the defilement one receives in opening the door to the Lord is not really defilement at all.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>She must put on her coat and be willing to be defiled again before she can open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But this does not imply putting on her old man once more or a defilement by the world once again.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rather, it means a putting on and a defilement by misunderstandings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The refusal here is a refusal of the best thing and a settling for the next best thing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a picture of a person's contentment in his own experience, and a failure to see the importance of experiencing Philippians 3:10 in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Subconsciously, the self has crept in. The maiden sees only herself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It seems that her past experiences in God's work and glory have occupied a place in her already.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Her questions indicate that she does not want to change her present spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But the Lord's calling interrupts our present condition.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All spiritual progress involves a change of our present order.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is where the price lies.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>An attachment to spiritual ease is often the reason behind a rejection of higher callings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we are spiritually at ease and our conscience does not condemn us concerning any error, and when we find ourselves having many spiritual experiences that issue from the Lord's death and resurrection, we are reluctant to pursue after the goal Christ has set for us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We prefer to live in the same way, not spending additional effort to pursue new things and not losing our present peace.</S>
