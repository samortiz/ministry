   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we want to see the way of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. To Realize Our Need of the Life of God</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, we need to realize our need of the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is related to God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's eternal purpose is to have a corporate people that can express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For these people to express God, they surely need the life and the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we only have the human life, we can only express our human being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot express God, the divine being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The particular life that something has issues in an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Dogs express the dog life, and cats express the cat life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>An apple tree cannot express the life and nature of a peach tree, because it does not have the peach life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For us human beings to express God, we need God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Genesis 1 shows us God's purpose for man to express Him, and in Genesis 2 we see the need for man to partake of the tree of life, the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to realize that we need the life of God in order to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A number of Bible teachers say that we need to be regenerated because we are fallen and sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to tell people that even if man had never become fallen, he would still need regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even before man fell, he still needed the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The very man whom God put in front of the tree of life was not fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was pure, he was good, he was perfect, and he was sinless, but he was only human not divine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, Genesis 2 indicates clearly that this sinless man, perfect man, good man, and pure man, still needed the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to be purged from the wrong, traditional concept that regeneration is because of man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to this concept, if man never fell, he would not have the need of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the Bible reveals that regeneration is needed by man even if man never fell.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order for one to be regenerated, he first has to realize his need of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 3:3 the Lord said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In spiritual things to see is to enter into v. 5 . If you have not been born of God, you cannot enter into, or see, anything in the realm of God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you do not have the bird life, you cannot enter into the kingdom of the birds.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you do not have the animal life, you cannot enter into the kingdom of the animals.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to enter into any kind of kingdom, you need that kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you do not have that kind of life, you can never get into that kingdom, that realm, or really understand what is within that realm.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we did not have the human life, we could not be in the human kingdom, the kingdom of man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have been born with the human life into the kingdom of man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today we need to be born with the divine life into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we were only born of man, we could only be in man's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We could never be in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be in the kingdom of God, we need to be born of God, to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John 3:3 shows the need of the life of God.</S>
