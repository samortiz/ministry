   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE VISION OF THE GLORIOUS CHRIST Scripture Reading: Rev 1:9-20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Revelation is on "the revelation of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is clearly seen from the very beginning of the book 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"The revelation of Jesus Christ" means that this revelation is of Jesus Christ, through Jesus Christ, and concerning Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God first gave this revelation to Jesus Christ and then gave this revelation to us through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the revelations in the Bible are focused on Jesus Christ and are for the purpose of revealing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, the book of Revelation not only shows us future events, but who the person of Jesus Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are many prophecies in the Bible, but the central thought of the Bible is not to convey the many prophecies, but to show us who Jesus Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It shows us this One, who was once Jesus of Nazareth in the world and who is now the Christ exalted to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John mentioned future events in Revelation not for the purpose of pointing out the things that are about to come, but to prove how Jesus Christ is reigning on the throne today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jesus Christ is reigning on the throne this is what the book of Revelation emphasizes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We know that Jesus Christ is the Savior, but this is not enough; we must go on to know Him as the King.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should know the Lord's love, but we should also know the majesty of His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The goal of Revelation is that more people would know such a Christ so that they would be watchful until the day when they can see Him face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this message, we will not talk about the Christ who is revealed in the entire book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead, we will concentrate on the first vision that God gave to John, which is the vision of the glorious Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John was known as the disciple who reclined on the Lord's breast John 13:25; 21:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet the King on the throne was unfamiliar to John.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God revealed such a Jesus Christ to John.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This knowledge is fundamental.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once John had this knowledge, the prophecies and the future events were not hard to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Under what conditions did John see this vision?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation 1:9 says, "I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John received his revelation under this circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He did not say that he was a great apostle chosen by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He said, "I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He did not consider himself higher than others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He considered himself as our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How humble and gentle this is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although his body was on the island of Patmos, his spirit was suffering, enduring, and waiting for the coming of the kingdom together with his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He felt this way because he lived in the reality of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He knew that the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance are three inseparable things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before the kingdom comes, there will surely be tribulations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through many tribulations we will enter the kingdom of God Acts 14:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Tribulations paved the way for John to enter the kingdom, and these tribulations worked out for him, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory 2 Cor 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He aspired for the kingdom, and therefore, he did not shrink from the tribulations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The kingdom will come, but it is still not here.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we do not endure, we will slumber, withdraw, or turn to the enticements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John knew this; therefore, he waited patiently.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He believed that his brothers would become fellow partakers in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was not alone in his way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brothers and sisters, are we not John's brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Are we fellow partakers in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brothers and sisters, do we identify ourselves with John's feelings and experience, or are we those who have chosen the broad pathway and who are traveling on our own?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brothers and sisters, we do not enter the kingdom simply by believing that there is a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We cannot enter the kingdom simply by having some knowledge about the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to enter the kingdom, we have to take John's way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Otherwise, our entry into the kingdom will only be a theory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>John was exiled to the island of Patmos because he was faithful to God's word and because he was for the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This island was in the middle of the ocean, with precipitous rocks and barrenness on all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>John was put in an uninhabited spot.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Humanly speaking, this was lonely and pitiful!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, John did not murmur at all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He knew whom he was suffering for.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thank and praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Under such circumstances, the glorious Christ revealed Himself to him and gave him new revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The earth had diminished before John's eyes, but heaven was opened to him!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This brings to mind Joseph who was in prison, Moses who was in the wilderness, David who was in distress, and Paul who was in chains.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They all received fresh revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>John was going down the path they had trodden; he received visions that he had never received before, and he came to know the enthroned Lord whom he had never known before.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Let us consider the vision of the glorious Christ that John saw.</S>
