<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class="title">TWO KINDS OF<br />KNOWLEDGE OF THE LORD&mdash;<br />THAT WHICH IS ACCORDING TO THE FLESH<br />AND THAT WHICH IS ACCORDING<br />TO THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 20:11-18; Luke 24:13-16, 25-32; John 21:1-14</h1><p>From the Lord Jesus' resurrection until now, there are two kinds of knowledge of Him. One kind of knowledge is according to the flesh, and the other kind of knowledge is according to the Spirit. In 2 Corinthians 5:16, Paul said, "So then we, from now on, know no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer." In Galatians 1:15-16, he also said, "It pleased God...to reveal His Son in me." These verses show us the proper means by which we can know the Lord Jesus today. Let us see these two kinds of knowledge of the Lord Jesus by considering a few concrete examples from the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">MARY THE MAGDALENE'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE LORD</h2><p>While Mary the Magdalene was weeping outside the Lord's grave, "two angels in white...said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him. When she said these things, she turned backward and beheld Jesus standing there, yet she did not know that it was Jesus" (John 20:12-14). It is strange that when she turned and saw Jesus, the One whom she had seen and followed for years, she could not recognize Him. The reason that she did not know the Lord at all, even though she knew Him so well before, was because the Son of God who had been in the flesh had been crucified on the cross and resurrected. The body which she desired to see was gone. All those who knew Him according to the flesh did not know Him any longer after His resurrection. He was no longer the Lord Jesus that she knew. He had become the Lord Jesus that she did not know. He was no longer a historical Jesus; He was living in the Spirit. He was no longer the Lord Jesus in the flesh but the Lord Jesus in the Spirit. She could no longer know Him by the same means that she did when she knew Him in the flesh.</p><p>"Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? She, supposing that He was the gardener, said to Him, Sir, if you have carried Him away" (v. 15). Mary's senses were no longer very clear. Formerly, she knew Him by using her ears. Her ears had not changed, but they no longer worked when she tried to identify Him according to her ears. Formerly, her eyes could identify Him. Her eyes had not changed, but they could not identify the Lord Jesus anymore. She had not changed, but Jesus of Nazareth had changed. Mary was still the same Mary, but Jesus of Nazareth had risen from the dead. Her ears, eyes, and understanding had now become useless. According to the old ways it was possible to know the earthly Lord Jesus in the flesh. But it was no longer possible to know the resurrected, spiritual, and heavenly Lord Jesus, who now lived in the Spirit. Mary had not changed. The Lord Jesus had changed. Because the Lord had changed, there had to be a change on Mary's part before she could know the changed Jesus. She had to have a new revelation before she could have a fresh knowledge of the Lord.</p><p>"Jesus said to her, Mary! She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, Rabboni!" (v. 16). It is strange that as soon as the Lord mentioned her name, Mary recognized the Lord. This calling of her name by the Lord is a kind of revelation. What is a revelation? A revelation is not the Lord standing there and saying, "I am Jesus." A revelation is when a person suddenly and inexplicably comes to know the Lord. When the Lord Jesus called, "Mary," she did not come to know that her name was Mary. When the Lord called, "Mary," she realized that this was Rabboni. The Lord did not say anything to her; all He did was call her name, and she became clear within. She received inward knowledge. This is the meaning of a revelation.</p><p>Here we see an important principle. Revelation does not come through the ears, the eyes, or any other power of perception. Revelation is a mysterious thing; it is a knowledge beyond the power of comprehension of the ears and eyes. It is a mysterious kind of knowledge. This is revelation.</p><p>After Mary knew the Lord, she hurried to the disciples to tell them about it. Although the disciples heard it, they were still bewildered.</p>
